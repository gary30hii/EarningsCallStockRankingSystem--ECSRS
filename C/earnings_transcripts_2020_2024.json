Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Lynn, you may begin.\nElizabeth Lynn: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K.  With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Corbat: Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. Given this is my last earnings call with you, we're going to do things a little bit differently today. After I'm done speaking, I'll turn it over to Mark and before we open up to Q&A, Jane will make some comments on the transformation she's been leading and how she sees our strategy evolving. So, with that, let's go ahead and get started.  We had a strong finish to a tumultuous year with net income of $4.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.08 in the fourth quarter. We ended 2020 with over $11 billion in net income despite the doubling of credit reserves as a result of the pandemic and the impact of CECL. Overall, we increased our ACL by $10 billion over the course of the year.  As a sign of the strength and durability of our diversified franchise, our revenues were flat to 2019 despite the massive economic impacts of COVID-19 globally. Our deposits were up nearly 20% as we supported our clients throughout the year, and we see significant franchise value in the growth that we're seeing in the deposit base.  Turning to the fourth quarter, our Institutional Clients Group performed well as they have throughout the year, highlighted by our markets businesses which saw revenues up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Banking saw a 7% revenue decline as Investment Banking activity slowed and low rates continued to impact Treasury and Trade Solutions, although the Private Bank was a standout with a 6% increase. Our Consumer Banking revenues continued to be impacted by the pandemic, although we did see deposit growth in every region.  In the U.S., our retail business did benefit from exceptionally high mortgage refinancing as homeowners saw opportunities in this ultra-low-rate environment. And we saw continued momentum in digital deposits. In Mexico, lower loan volumes pressured our revenues. In Asia, card spending was down again, but we continue to see strong performance in wealth management.  We remain very well capitalized with robust liquidity to serve our clients. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 11.8%, well above our regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $73.83, up 5% from a year ago, and we welcome the Federal Reserve's decision regarding share repurchases as we have excess capital we can return to shareholders, and we plan to resume buybacks during the current quarter.  Given my upcoming retirement from Citi at the end of February, I recently looked through some of the challenges we faced when I became CEO. And while there's always more work to do, I'm very proud of what the firm has accomplished. We're in a fundamentally different place than we were in October 2012.  We've streamlined our consumer business and embraced the shift to digital, so we could serve our clients the way they want to be served. We've reestablished Citi as a go-to bank for our institutional clients throughout our global network. No matter what part of the world you're in, our bankers have a seat at the table during the most significant transactions.  We've optimized our capital base, working through our legacy assets and reducing our DTA by more than half, generating $7 billion of regulatory capital in the process. We dramatically increased the return of our capital to our shareholders. We went from a $0.01 dividend to returning over $85 billion in capital since 2013, and we've reduced our share count by 30%.  Before the pandemic, we had significantly improved the quality and consistency of our earnings, our return on assets, and return on our equity. As a result of the pandemic, while the financial results this year aren't what I would have wanted them to be for my last year as CEO, in many ways, I couldn't be prouder. All the work we did to strengthen our firm helped us get through this extraordinary year, and I'm proud of the fact that we've shown we can go through a crisis and emerge even stronger unlike the events of more than a decade ago.  Just for context, let's compare 2012 to 2020. In 2020, the year of a pandemic, we had nearly $4 billion more in net income, a 12-basis-point higher return on assets and 180 basis points higher return on tangible common equity than we had in 2012. That shows you just how far Citi has come.  And we also showed what our firm is about by serving our customers, our clients, and our communities. We were the first bank to launch an accommodation program for consumers when the pandemic hit. We stood up a small business program for lending in just a matter of weeks. We donated these profits to COVID relief efforts, part of $100 million in such grants we made throughout the year. And in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, we announced $1 billion in strategic actions to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States.  As I said, there's always more to do. But I feel really good about the firm as Jane prepares to take over. She's thrown herself into the transformation we've launched to strengthen our risk and control environment and ensured the firm operates with excellence in every area. I know she'll do everything she can to maximize returns and move Citi forward for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.  With that, Mark is going to go through the presentation.\nMark Mason: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3. Citigroup reported fourth quarter net income of $4.6 billion. Revenues declined 10% from the prior year. While trading remained strong, this was more than offset by the combined impact of lower interest rates and lower levels of consumer activity. Expenses were up 2% year-over-year, reflecting continued investment in our transformation, including infrastructures supporting our risk and control environment, along with higher repositioning costs as we look to adjust capacity in targeted areas.  Credit performance remained strong with credit losses of $1.5 billion, down sequentially as well as year-over-year. And cost of credit was roughly neutral for the quarter as these losses were offset by an ACL release of $1.5 billion, driven primarily by an improvement in our base macro scenario. EPS was $2.08 and ROTCE was 11.4%.  In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer. Deposits grew 19%, reflecting consistent client engagement with corporate clients building liquidity, along with higher savings rates and reduced spending in consumer. Turning to full year results. In 2020, we delivered solid performance despite the pricing with net income of over $11 billion, even as we increased reserves by roughly $10 billion. We ended the year with strong capital and liquidity and grew tangible book value throughout the year.  On the top line, while the pandemic had a significant impact, we held full year revenues flat in 2019, with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher noninterest revenues. Expenses increased 2%, in line with guidance as we invested in our transformation. Results also included COVID-19-related expenses and the civil money penalty in the third quarter offset by lower discretionary spending and continued efficiency savings.  Full year EPS also includes a $0.16 impact related to revising the previously determined accounting for third-party collection fees, reversing the benefit to net income with a corresponding increase to opening retained earnings, capital neutral as of year-end.  On Slide 4, we provide additional detail on reserving actions. As a reminder, these reserves include our estimate of lifetime credit losses tied to a specific base scenario as well as a management adjustment for economic uncertainty, which provides for the possibility for a more adverse outcome. Our reserve release this quarter primarily reflects our improving macroeconomic outlook, although I would note, we did add to our management adjustment for economic uncertainty as the pace and shape of the recovery is still evolved.  Overall, looking at the reserves we hold today, we believe that we are well positioned with nearly $28 billion in reserves, which represents an allowance for credit losses of roughly 4% on funded loan.  Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $4.8 billion, up 30% from last year. Operating margin declined 5% on lower revenues and a 2% increase in expenses, primarily reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls, while credit costs were down considerably given a $1.3 billion ACL release. The release this quarter primarily reflected improvement in the outlook for global GDP as well as fewer downgrades in the portfolio. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.4%, including 4.4% on the noninvestment-grade portion. Total net credit losses were $210 million.  Looking at full year results, the ICG business has performed well this year with 13% revenue growth, positive operating leverage and operating margin growth of 24%. But given the ACL build this year, ICG EBIT declined 6%. And for the full year, ICG delivered a 13.8% return on allocated capital. Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Revenues decreased 1% in the fourth quarter as strong trading performance was offset by lower revenues in TTS, Investment Banking and Corporate Lending.  On the banking side, revenues declined 7%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were down 8% as reported and 6% in constant dollars as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenue. Average deposits were up 22% in constant dollars, and we had solid growth in our underlying drivers despite the significant macro slowdown, with increased digital adoption, cross-border transaction volumes growing over 10% and a record quarter in clearing. Investment Banking revenues were down 5% from last year, as solid growth in equity underwriting was more than offset by lower revenues in M&A and debt underwriting.  Private Bank revenues grew 6%, driven by capital market strength as well as improved managed investment revenues and higher lending. Corporate Lending revenues were down 25%, driven by lower spreads, higher hedging costs and lower average volume. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues increased 13% from last year. Fixed Income revenues grew 7% as higher revenues across spread products and commodities were partially offset by lower revenues in rates and currency, although I would note that we saw solid performance in FX and global rates and good client engagement across the entire business.  Equity revenues were up 57% versus last year, driven by strong performance in cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting higher client volumes and more favorable market conditions. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were unchanged on a reported basis, but up 2% in constant dollars as higher volumes from new and existing clients with broken deposits, settlement volumes and assets under custody were partially offset by lower spreads.  For full year 2020, revenues increased 13% driven by the significant strength in markets this year, along with a solid contribution from Investment Banking and the Private Bank. Throughout the year, we continue to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses as we actively helped our clients navigate through this uncertain environment, given our global platform, our progress in creating new digital solutions and our full-service model, which allows us to capture natural linkages that exist across the franchise.  And given the momentum we've seen this year in key drivers, including digital adoption, deposit growth and client engagement, we're even better positioned to ensure additional share gains in 2021 as these clients more fully recognize the benefits of using Citi as their platform of choice.  Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 7. GCB delivered EBIT of $1.7 billion. Revenues declined 13% as continued strong deposit growth and momentum in Wealth Management were more than offset by lower card volume and lower interest rates across all regions. That said, we did see signs of stabilization sequentially this quarter.  Expenses increased 4% across both North America and international consumers, driven mostly by higher repositioning. Excluding repositioning costs, total GCB expenses were flat as COVID-related costs were largely offset by efficiency savings. Credit cost decreased 45% as lower volumes and improved delinquencies led to lower net credit loss, coupled with an ACL reserve release in all 3 regions.  And looking at full year results, GCB delivered EBIT of $1.1 billion, down significantly from last year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and higher reserve builds under CECL.  Slide 8 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Total fourth quarter revenues were down 11% from last year, but we did see positive momentum in our drivers this quarter. And on a sequential basis, revenues grew 3%. Branded cards revenues were down 13%, reflecting lower purchase sales and lower average loans.  Purchase sales grew 9% sequentially on both seasonal activity as well as the continued recovery in consumer spending but were still down year-over-year. At the same time, we're seeing an increase in payment rates as consumers remain liquid, and we have not yet seen stress in their overall ability to pay. So while purchase activity has improved, our clients are also paying down more quickly, resulting in continued pressure on our loan balance. Retail services revenues were down 16% year-over-year, reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments. Net interest revenues were down 12% as average loans declined by 11% on lower purchase sales activities and higher payment rates. Similar to branded cards, purchase sales grew 18% sequentially but remained down year-over-year. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower losses in 2020 and, therefore, higher income share.  Retail Banking revenues were down 1% year-over-year as strong deposit growth and higher mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spread. Average deposits were up 21%, including 29% growth in checking. We saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales with digital deposits increasing $2 billion quarter-over-quarter. We saw continued underlying growth in our wealth management drivers with 18% year-over-year growth in Citigold client and 11% growth in assets under management.  Overall, we feel good about our client engagement as we exit the year, with spend activity continuing to recover, underlying strength in wealth management drivers and significant deposit growth giving us the opportunity to grow and deepen these relationships going forward as we continue to invest in our products and digital capability.  On Slide 9, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We continue to see good momentum in wealth management as investment revenues grew 16%, with a 7% increase in Citigold client and 13% growth in net new money. And average deposit growth remained strong at 14%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Card revenues remained under pressure year-over-year with purchase sales down 13%, given a continued significant impact on travel in the region. However, we did see sequential improvement in purchase sales this quarter, in line with our expectations.  Turning to Latin America. Total revenues declined 16% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter with average balances up 13% and purchase sales improved sequentially. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continue to decline given the macro environment.  Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. Credit loss rates generally trended downward this quarter, given high levels of liquidity in the U.S., lower spending and the benefits of relief program. However, in Asia, credit loss rates increased, mostly driven by those accounts that exited relief programs in line with our expectations. The year-over-year rise in delinquencies outside the U.S. is concentrated in accounts rolling off relief programs and reflects more modest levels of stimulus in these regions relative to the U.S. Given these trends, we continue to expect peak losses to occur in Asia and Mexico during the first half of 2021 and should begin to recover thereafter.  Meanwhile, in the U.S., while we do expect losses to begin to rise in 2021, given today's delinquency trend and the expected impact of recent stimulus, we now expect peak loss rates to be pushed out to the first half of 2022. Whether continuing to push out these losses is simply a matter of timing or if it will ultimately result in lower aggregate losses remains to be seen, and it's something we are watching closely.  Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues declined significantly from last year, reflecting the impact of lower rates, the wind-down of legacy assets and the absence of episodic gains. Expenses were roughly flat as the wind-down of legacy assets offset investments in infrastructure, risk management and control. And the pretax loss was $690 million this quarter, roughly in line with our prior outlook.  Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trend. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.5 billion in the quarter declined $1.3 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances, partially offset by higher trading-related NIR. Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize and excluding market was roughly flat to the third quarter. And net interest margin declined 3 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenue and balance sheet expansion due to strong deposit growth.  Turning to noninterest revenues in the fourth quarter, non-NIR declined 6% to just over $6 billion, given lower levels of consumer activity year-over-year. Turning to full year results. Revenues were flat with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher noninterest revenue driven by continued strong performance in markets throughout the year as well as strength in investment banking.  On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 11.8% or 180 basis points above our regulatory minimum. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% to $73.83 driven by net income. Before I hand it back to Mike, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. On the top line, we saw an extraordinary year in market performance in 2020 and would expect some degree of normalization this year. And subject to how that plays out, we can see revenues down in the mid to high single-digit range this year, largely driven by market. This outlook assumes industry wallets more similar to 2019 levels. And for net interest revenue specifically, it assumes continued stabilization in the first half of the year with an improvement in the back half to our base case, which assumes loan growth by this point in the recovery.  On a full year basis, the decline in net interest revenues is somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion versus 2020. On the expense side, we expect full year expenses to increase in the range of 2% to 3%, mostly driven by investments related to our transformation. Our cost of credit should be meaningfully lower than 2020. And we expect a tax rate of roughly 21% for the year.  So pulling this together, we expect operating margin pressure this year. But given lower credit costs, we should still see significant improvement in profitability relative to 2020.  And finally, as Mike mentioned earlier, we look forward to repurchasing shares through the balance of 2021, subject to Board approval, starting this quarter.  To wrap up, as I look at how we performed in 2020, we demonstrated the significant earnings power and resilience of the franchise. We sit here today with strong capital and liquidity position. Overall client engagement remains strong. We grew book value every quarter, and we remain focused on supporting colleagues, customers, clients and community, all of which give me a great deal of confidence as we move into 2021.  With that, let me hand it back to Mike.\nMichael Corbat: Thank you, Mark. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jane, so you can hear from her for a few minutes.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I want to thank Mike for his support and for working so closely with me during this transition. It was important to him to ensure Citi has a seamless CEO transition and has obviously been tremendously helpful to me as I prepare to step into the role at the end of February.  I am extremely excited by the opportunities ahead for our firm, and I am equally determined to address the deficiencies in our risk and control environment that have been raised by our regulators. We've embarked on a transformation program that will clearly benefit our clients and investors as well as meeting the regulators' expectations of one of the world's most globally significant financial institutions. And of course, we still have to get through this pandemic. While we hope the end is in sight, this virus has surprised us and taught us the folly of best-laid plans, so we will remain vigilant and adaptable.  My two major priorities as I transition with Mike are our transformation effort and refreshing our strategy so we ultimately achieved 3 things: best position Citi to win, to improve our returns significantly and to address the issues raised by our regulators. While it's early days, our work on these priorities is well underway.  So on the transformation, we're taking the time to step back, to tackle the root cause issues, to define our target end state and develop the detailed plans to get us there. We put in place specific work streams against risk and controls, data and compliance, but we also have work streams on creating a culture of excellence and accountability and on strengthening our critical business processes. Each stream is led by a member of the executive management team. Together, we are accountable for simplifying and modernizing the bank.  In February, we will deliver our gap analysis to the target state; and in May, the detailed implementation plan. This effort will take time and it will require significant investment in technology and talent.  You have my commitment that we will invest your capital wisely, and that you, our clients and our regulators, will all see and benefit from the results. At the end of the day, we want to achieve a state of excellence in our risk and controls, in our operations and in our service to clients. Switching back the strategy. I have the benefit of having worked in a number of businesses and regions in Citi over the last 16 years. Nonetheless, this transition is giving me valuable time to step back and to take a dispassionate look at our strategy and businesses. You wouldn't expect me to come out with specifics at this rather early stage, but I can talk about how we are looking at this.  We have a wonderful franchise, first-class capabilities and a terrific brand name. We are the world's most global bank with a network no one can match. And this means we are uniquely able to help clients grow and succeed globally. Our capital and balance sheet is strong. We have a deep talent bench around the world. So while we have work to do, this is a pretty good hand to play. A few principles will guide how we refresh our strategy. We're taking a clinical look at our strategic positioning, assessing which businesses can attain leading market positions in a much more digitized world. Similarly, I believe in the value of focus and directing our investments and resources to the businesses that will drive stronger growth and improve returns over the long run. I also believe in ensuring the businesses we're in fit well together. So collectively, they are competitively advantaged and generate synergies.  And finally, like any true Scot, I believe there is value to unlock by simplifying the firm. As you know, on Wednesday, we announced that we will integrate Consumer Wealth Management and our Private Bank into one business line. It's a growth opportunity I'm particularly excited about in Asia as well as the U.S. Earlier in the week, we also announced the new head of our TTS franchise and our U.S. consumer leadership. And I look forward to sharing new opportunities and moves with you as we go.  I want to end as I began, by thanking Mike. He has spent his 38-year career at Citi. No one has been more dedicated. He always put Citi first. And he took over at a very difficult time. He had to make tough calls, steering the company through the post-crisis restructuring. He made Citi a simpler, smaller, safer and far stronger institution, returning it to growth, closing the gap with our peers and returning a significant amount of capital to our shareholders just as he promised he would.  His steady leadership this year helped us through this very difficult period for all of us, but this last year showed how the work he led has strengthened our firm as we supported our people, clients and communities through this pandemic. He leaves us with a tremendous foundation, and I am committed to building on his success. We are very grateful to him and proud of him. And all of us at Citi wish him the very best in the next chapter.  Mike, would you like to say something to close?\nMichael Corbat: Thank you, Jane. I appreciate your comments, and I know the firm is going to be in great hands. Jane, Mark and I are now happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Jane, I think it's great that you came on, so I can't resist asking you one. So, I agree with you focusing on strong business, positioning on its own and then making sure businesses fit well together. You came for part of your tenure from the Latin American consumer side and global consumer. I'd love to get your perspective and thoughts on the question that's come up over the years of how much does global consumer \"fit well together.\" Are they individual business on their own? How much can they leverage going forward to be a true global consumer platform?\nJane Fraser: Thanks, Glenn, for your question. So, we are just beginning the work on this strategy. And as I say, we're taking a step back, and Mark and I are working on a dispassionate view of all of the businesses and looking at what are the leading franchises we want to invest behind, what are the others that we want to grow to win. And as we do that work, we will let you know what's the direction we're going to be taking, and as we have done already in the announcements this week on wealth and on the new leadership in TTS.  But I would say, let us do the work and then we'll let you know how everything fitted together. And if there are pieces that end up not being part of the core, we'll let you know, but let us do the work first.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. That's cool. Maybe I'll follow up with a more nitty-gritty one. On the card side, I think part of the plan for the last couple of years has been converting card customers into digital banking clients. I noticed in the appendix that there's been growth in customers, but there hasn't been a tremendous amount of growth lately in active digital and mobile customers, I would say, the last 5 quarters. So, I'm curious if that's -- what you're doing to attack that opportunity and in fact fit into the going-forward plan.\nJane Fraser: Yes. So in terms of the digital customers, it's a different picture in different parts of the world. So, we saw a tremendous growth in Mexico that starts with a much lower digital base. And so with COVID, we saw a pretty rapid acceleration across the industry, and we're a major leader in that. When we look at the States, we already have an extremely active card customer base on the digital front. And so, we weren't expecting to see the same levels of pickup.  I'd say the other piece as well is customer acquisition across the board is lower because of COVID, and you typically do tend to see that the new customers, when they come on board anyone's platform, they tend to have a higher digital adoption rate. So, I think we're pretty optimistic that as and when we see the recovery that we'll also see growth in that digital adoption in the U.S. going forward.\nMark Mason: Jane, the only thing I'd add to that is that we have been seeing greater e-statement penetration -- or e-statement usage, I should say, and e-payment usage. Our e-statements usage and payment usage is up some 15%. And so, as you would imagine through this crisis, people have been actively engaged with our digital capabilities, and that's in part a byproduct of the investments that we've been making in digital technology. And so, we feel good about that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Mark, I was wondering if you could unpack some of the drivers of your 2021 expense outlook between investment spend, maybe the transformation spend and where you're saving money?\nMark Mason: Sure. So look, as I\u2019ve said in the outlook there, we look at -- we see expenses being up about 2% to 3%. Most of that is likely to be driven by the transformation spend as we get our arms around what that cost is going to be. You know already we\u2019ve spent $1 billion this year. That's in our run rate already.  But there is a broader investment strategy that we're working toward, and we're doing that in the context of -- we'll obviously do that in the context of how the strategy Jane spoke to evolves. And so, continued investment in digital capabilities both on the consumer side as you heard me mention, but also on the ICG side, particularly in our TTS platform where we've seen good benefits from the investments already made there. But as you know, that's an area where innovation in technology is what's required to maintain a competitive advantage there.  We just announced the wealth management business, if you will, bringing together wealth from the consumer and in the private bank. And that, I would imagine, will be -- not I would imagine that will be an area of investment for us as we grow fee revenues, as Jane has pointed to, as an important objective of ours. We'll also see growth in advertising and marketing.  So, in that outlook, I talked about net interest revenue stabilizing, but picking up in the back half of the year with growth in loans, and that growth in loans is going to be a byproduct of us starting to put money to work again back in advertising and marketing, which was down materially this year as we managed through this crisis.  So, those are a couple of areas that we would look to invest in, in the context of that 2% to 3%. But again, a lot of it is going to be towards this transformation. And it is an investment, which I continue to remind folks of, and that is to say that we expect to and we'll focus on ensuring that we get a payback on that in the coming years. And so hopefully, that gives you a good sense, John.\nJohn McDonald: No, that's helpful. And just to follow up on the net interest income outlook you mentioned. I think you said it could be down $1 billion to $2 billion on a year-over-year basis. What are the swing factors that would bring you into the low end of that versus the high end of that?\nMark Mason: Yes. So again, the net interest revenue could be down, and that's in part because you got to look at the pace of the recovery that we're forecasting. And so how loan volumes trend will be an important factor there. Obviously, the GDP forecast that we have factors into that. And obviously, the rate curve and how that evolves will be another important factor that comes into play.  That said, I would add that we have seen -- on the card side, you heard me mention this in my prepared remarks. We saw good sequential momentum across purchase sale activity. Some of that's seasonal, but some of that just really good activity with our customers, and we're looking for that to continue. We -- obviously, there's been a stimulus that's been announced already. There are certain talks of significant stimulus or additional stimulus to come. And hopefully, that kind of bridges us to a place where it fuels some of the GDP growth that we're seeing in our forecast.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nErika Najarian: My first question is for Jane. Like Glenn, I can't resist. I think investors are very excited to hear about your strategic plans because the constructive criticism that I get on Citi is that I think that investors are on board with your current plan and remediation and recovery. But I think they continue to wonder whether you have a lot of breadth but not as much depth in terms of market share and businesses.  And that's the long-winded way to ask this question, I'm sorry. Your peers seem to be settling on a mid-teens ROTCE or a little bit higher on a normalized level. And as you think about the wonderful franchise that you already have and the opportunities that you have to improve upon it, do you think that Citi can get to that level eventually whenever that normalized period arrives?\nJane Fraser: Yes, it's a great question. It's one we've been spending a lot of time working on and talking through, as Mark and I look at what is the right configuration of businesses, how do we -- as I said, in the principles we're laying out for how we're looking at the Citi of the future, particularly in a digital environment as the world is changing quite quickly on that front.  So once we finished doing the work, we'll be laying out what are the different metrics and milestones to measure us, both in terms of progress and in terms of the desired outcomes. I've been talking to a number of our key investors, which have been great, very helpful conversations, over the last few weeks and getting input from them around what sorts of outcomes are desirable. And they're very much part of mix as we look at doing this work on the strategy and on the transformation. As Mark said, the two go hand-in-hand going forward. So we look forward to getting back to you with that picture when we're ready. And Mark, I know has been key in all of this. So let me pass the mic to him.\nMark Mason: Yes. Thanks, Jane. Look, in your prepared remarks, you rightfully focused on strategies that are geared towards identifying growth opportunities and improving our returns and narrowing the gap to peers. And I think that type of strategic focus, along with the investments that we've made -- that we're making, both transformation and growth-oriented investments, will certainly put us on that path.  I think the normalization of GDP in the credit environment is going to be helpful as well. And then as many people know, we've got a deferred tax asset and some legacy assets that we'll continue to work down over time. And I think those -- the combination of those things, starting with the strategy and a plan to continue to return capital and return on capital, put us in the right path to getting to those improved levels of returns, not to mention the prospect of increasing rates over time or in the normal part of the cycle.\nErika Najarian: And my follow-up question is for you, Mark. It seems as if the stimulus plan so far and potentially the additional stimulus could build a bridge that's strong enough and long enough to perhaps not delay losses but lower actual cycle losses in card. How should we think about the stimulus related to how that could impact spending and loan volume trends as we trace that back to that NII guide?\nMark Mason: Yes. Look, I mean we -- when we think about our reserve levels and the activity there, we certainly did factor in the impact of stimulus. I think what's important to point to is the stimulus thus far has resulted in high payment rates and a consistent kind of ability to pay for the consumer, and that's been good. And it showed up not only in our payment rates, but it also shows up in the lower level of delinquencies that we've seen and obviously the lower level of losses that we've seen.  There certainly is a need for additional stimulus. And I think the good thing about that is it should continue to support the payment rates that we've seen. And if it is significant enough, can ultimately drive greater consumption and support improved GDP, improved unemployment. Our current forecast, as you heard me mention earlier, assumes that, that loan momentum picks up towards the end of -- or the mid -- I'm sorry, the back half of 2021. If we see that take hold sooner, we could see higher levels of volume in loan growth. And obviously, that would be beneficial to our NIR forecast.  So stimulus is good in that regard. It also will put -- as it takes hold, there'll likely be some early pressure on lending volumes because people tend -- are using it as a liquidity tool and to pay down. But over time, I think it will be beneficial.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Mayo: One simple question and one hard question. Mark, you get the simple one. When can Citigroup start repurchasing shares? And how much do you think you can repurchase in the first quarter? And I don't think you were allowed to purchase yet this quarter, but did you?\nMark Mason: Sure. So as you know, the Fed guidance allowed for us to reinstate buybacks. There was a cap on the first quarter that's based on the trailing 4-quarter average of income for us. That would equate to about $1.8 billion or so in buybacks in the first quarter. And so with -- subject to Board approval, we will approve some level of buybacks in Q1. We have not started those buybacks as of yet.\nMichael Mayo: All right. And then the hard question is for Jane is -- who does Citi want to be in 2030, when we step back 5 or 10 years from now and have a picture of Citi? And the reason I ask that is you mentioned Citi being global. But despite this global status, Citi's fallen short of expectations in each of the past 5 decades. You can go back to Walter Wriston, you can go back to the '80s, you can go back to Sandy Weill and John Reed, the financial supermarket, you can go back to the financial crisis, and even with the retrenching and derisking, and I agree the chance of bankruptcy is far less, the return on capital has fallen short of the cost of capital for the last decade. So you'll be the seventh CEO at Citigroup when you take over. Why will it be different this time? What can you do differently, whether it's business mix or customer mix or geographic mix? Because from my perspective and I -- it's great. You can take a clinical look, a dispassionate look. But I'm extremely passionate about the underperformance of the Citi over almost any time frame over the last 50 years. And so I'm just trying to figure out what you can do given your 16 years at Citi, your experience at McKinsey to actually finally change Citi to generate sustainable returns above the cost of capital. So once again, where -- what's Citi's endgame?\nJane Fraser: Well, thank you, Mike. So I think the end game, and you asked a question in terms of what do we look like in 2030, it's pretty simple really. As you said, we're a global bank. We want to be the leading global bank. We're very well positioned from that from our businesses. That means top-tier franchises in their respective competitive sets with a strategy that has been well understood by the market over that time frame. We want to be best-in-class in serving our clients and our customers, certainly in safety and soundness. And I'd add in, we want to be seen as playing a positive role in society as I think that's a very important part of mix these days. But all of that is with the purpose of generating the desired returns for our investors.  So to be fair, while we have made demonstrable progress over the last 10 years since the crisis, equally know that there is a gap to close with our peers. You can hold me accountable for doing so along with the management team. We're a team on a mission to get this done, and we will get this done.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.\nJim Mitchell: Not to beat a dead horse, maybe just one quick follow-up, if there's any help you can give us. I think one of the biggest concerns on investors is they can't see the path to the kind of peer-level returns. Do you think of it -- as you look at it -- without giving away specifics on strategy and things like that, is it really an efficiency issue? Is it a capital issue because of the DTAs? How do you think about where you are today and what's driving the gap?\nJane Fraser: So these are all the questions that Mark and I are sitting down and looking at our different businesses and saying how do we make sure -- as I said in the opening remarks, we're looking at how do we drive our resource allocation and how do we drive our investments into businesses that will be important growth drivers for the franchise and high-returning areas for the firm going forward. We've come out with one already that we think is an important one on that dimension in wealth, where we've got many different parts of the puzzle that we think will enable us to be highly successful in this domain, bringing the different pieces of the firm together to drive this forward and is clearly going to be one of several areas that we see helping us improve our returns.  And as Mike said, that's not the only piece. There are other elements, as I said, in the different principles. We see value from simplification. And that's in terms of, obviously, the operating efficiencies and the like that we would get from that as well as potentially business mix. And we want to drive the businesses to make sure that they're really fitting well together so that they are achieving the synergies as well as the competitive and collective comparative advantage.  So it's going to be a combination of pieces. But as I say, we're doing this work. We'll let you know as we go of what the decisions we make along the way and look forward to sharing them with you, frankly, with the intent that we have both a leading global firm as well as an organization that's delivering the desired results to our investors. Mark, anything to add, my friend?\nMark Mason: Yes, I think you said it well, but I want to repeat one thing you said, which is that we're going to get this done, right? And it is a combination. We'll continue to refine the strategy here. We've got some very strong businesses with competitive advantages that we want to continue to shore up. We're going to make investments in the franchise because that's what it's going to take in order to continue to drive improved returns.  Yes, there are some drags. I mentioned that earlier. They certainly do weigh on the returns between the DTA and legacy assets. But we also have excess capital as we sit here with the CET1 ratio of an 11.80% versus 11.50% target that we have.  And so we're going to continue to work all of those things in combination. And I believe those are the things -- we believe those are the things that are going to get us back to continued improved levels of returns that we saw coming into this crisis.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. No, fair enough. And maybe just talk -- speaking to one of those businesses where you see growth you've been investing. Can you talk to the underlying -- obviously, with pressure in interest rates, it's hard to see it, the underlying growth in TTS. How do you feel about the businesses? We've seen competition, whether it's in treasury services or payments, wholesale payments, it seems like it's a competitive environment. How do you think about that business and growth from here?\nMark Mason: Yes, sure. I'll take that. So first of all, we feel very good about the TTS business that we have. We think of it as part of our services business inside of the ICG services would include TTS and security services. As you know, we have a very unique position within this part of our franchise. And you're right, the headline numbers are affected by interest rates. But we feel very good about the underlying momentum in the business, and we think that's evidenced by a couple of key drivers.  You're aware we're in 95 countries. That gives our clients the ability to transact in over 140 currencies. And we do that on a global platform. We have 600,000 users on that platform, which is up about 9% from last year. And within that, the mobile users are up about 95%.  We're continuing to grow accounts with our clients. And we now have the ability to open accounts digitally in 50 countries. In 2020, we opened over 14,000 accounts digitally, representing more than a 200% increase. And growing accounts deepens our relationship with clients and allows us to penetrate new activity centers, that allows us to capture more flows across our platform. And ultimately, that delivers more revenue. And so this digital activity drives revenue for us in the future, and it also is more -- in a more efficient way for us to do business with clients.  We're also seeing good transaction volumes across different payment types with these clients. We've had very good clearing performance and cross-border flows through the year. And so those things give us a lot of insight into what the momentum will look like coming out of this crisis. And that's not to mention additional opportunities with new clients. As you know, we've moved our commercial business squarely into the ICG. There's more upside for our TTS platform with a commercial -- with the commercial client base.  And so we feel very good about where we are. We're not taking our position for granted. We're going to continue to invest in this platform, and we're looking forward to capturing the growth and supporting our clients as they come out of this crisis.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew O'Connor: I want to follow up on expenses. So the guidance implies about $44 billion this year, and as you alluded to, a lot of investments in that. As we think out -- it's a little hypothetical because there might be changes to the strategy and simplification that can impact the expense base. But as we think out beyond this year, should we view that as kind of a bloated expense base, that some of these investments are running at higher-than-normal levels and you can bring them down? Or is this more of kind of a normal run rate and then the efficiency will really come from growing revenue?\nMark Mason: Yes. Let me make a couple of quick comments. One, as I mentioned and as you repeated, we will see expense growth here. Jane mentioned we're in the midst of making progress against our transformation. And we'll need to submit a plan in May and get that plan approved and continue to invest to get that executed against. And that will inform the thinking around some of the outer-years. But to answer your question around a bloated expense base, I would say no. It's not a bloated expense base at all. These are investments, as you've heard me mention repeatedly, and they're going to be -- there is going to be a return on the investment. The return will come in both revenue and a more efficient operating platform.  We've got a history now. We've got some credibility now with having demonstrated productivity across our platform, whether that's through automating processes or reducing data centers or low-cost location strategies.  Since our Investor Day, we've continued to improve our productivity. And that's what you should expect. That's what we're expecting of ourselves and we'll deliver on kind of coming out of these investments that we need to make. And so no, not a bloated expense base.  With that said, so put that aside, we are going to continue to invest in the business. And so if there are opportunities that present themselves, either as a byproduct of the strategy, refresh that Jane has mentioned or otherwise, we intend to take advantage of making those investments because that is the only way we get to those improved returns that we're targeting and focused on. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nMatthew O'Connor: That is helpful. And then just separately, as we think about the strategic review, I think there's been some speculation in terms of which businesses, if any, you might exit. And I'm not going to name them, but some of them are pretty high-return businesses, if you just look at them on a stand-alone basis, some aren't. But how do you think conceptually about as you potentially exit or sell a certain business, there might be a gap between you're giving up some earnings before you can deploy them in things like digital and TTS and wealth in terms of the payback, right? Because there could be -- you lose some earnings initially and you might have bloated capital and, again, some of the investments take time to play out. So is that something like you're mindful of or...\nJane Fraser: Yes. What we're looking at the moment is much more around what do we want to be going forward. And where we are in the work is looking at how -- what are the different businesses, how do they best fit together. Digitization is changing quite a few things, as Mark was referring to. It's providing a lot of new opportunities, but also some important investments for growth as well as for returns. And if it ends up that there are businesses as we look at it that we don't think that fit well into the mix, then I think we've got good skills in terms of thinking about how we divest of those in a way that makes sense. But that's honestly not where we are at the moment. We're focused on what we're going to be. So as I say, wait for us to get the work done, and then we can come back to you with the plans of what we're looking at and what that path looks like. I think it's too early to speculate right now.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Two questions. One on the improving profitability that you -- that we've been talking about here. I know we've been talking a lot about it from the expense side and from the revenue growth side, but I'm also wondering about the funding cost side. And given the fact that you have a great brand in the U.S., you have a really good mobile app and we have a relatively low interest rate environment, why not put up a high-cost savings product and reduce your wholesale cost of funds by switching from wholesale to a high-cost savings product, which, at this rate, you can actually -- you should be able to pick up some ROA on that?\nMark Mason: Yes. Look, we have seen very good deposit growth, and some of that is a byproduct of our high-yield savings accounts. But we've also seen strong checking account growth this quarter, and we've seen the growth in our digital deposits as well. And so you're right, there's a funding cost advantage to that. We've seen that play out and the liquidity that's in the market. We intend to continue to grow as it relates to increasing those deposits. And we've been smart about how we've been managing our liquidity, keeping some liquidity, obviously, there for lending needs as they may evolve for our customers and clients but also paying down wholesale debt. We did that through the year and also investing.  We've made some investments through the year. I think we've invested as much as another $78 billion or so, up 21% for the year. And so we've been thoughtfully managing the liquidity that we've seen through the course of this year. We'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to grow deposits on the consumer side because you're right, it is a lower-cost funding alternative. And we'll do that as it -- if it makes a lot of sense.\nBetsy Graseck: The other question for you, Mark, is just on how you're thinking about credit. I know you mentioned that credit costs will be lower in '21 versus '20. I think we can -- we all agree with that. Trying to understand how much flex there is there. Maybe one question there is on the reserve analysis and what kind of level of unemployment you're looking for in your reserving today at year-end '21. And is there some room for that reserve release to be potentially larger as we go through the year?  And then maybe -- I know you talked about how stimulus could help net charge-off peaks. It's hard to give an estimate on that. But maybe give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the trajectory for credit costs year-on-year.\nMark Mason: Sure. So I guess a couple of pieces there. So one, as you know, Betsy, when we model this, we look at kind of the macroeconomic variables that we have at any point in time. And so you look at kind of Page 4, we laid out the variables that we've used this quarter. And you can see that both for U.S. unemployment as well as for U.S. real GDP, we've seen improvement since the third quarter forecast that we ran.  And I'd tell you, even as you look at this, there's been further improvement even off of the fourth quarter '20 forecast that's here. And so those are important factors in the assumptions and what we're able to model in the way of reserve levels. And as we see that improve or improve further, we would expect that, that would be -- that would play out in the way of even lower reserves.  I think the other important factor is the stimulus and how that -- and the additional stimulus that is out there and how that ultimately evolves and what that means and whether that drives consumer consumption and whether that drives even further levels of improved unemployment will be important factors that come into play here.  And then I guess the final piece I'd mention is that we continue to hold management adjustment for economic uncertainty. And as we see these variables continue to improve, that's going to impact how we think about severity and probability associated with that downside scenario. So all of those factors come into play as to how we think about the reserve levels that we carry. While we still feel good about the $28 billion roughly that we have in the way of balances, we feel very good about the direction that these economic variables appear to be moving.  In terms of losses, again, it's been interesting the way this has played out. And so really, what we're all trying to figure out is whether the lower delinquencies and lower level of losses that we've seen thus far is a delay or is it a deflation of losses, right? And that only time will tell as we sit here today. And as you heard me say in my prepared remarks, we think it's a bit of a delay in that we would expect to see losses peak in 2022 now, particularly for U.S. consumer. But again, with another stimulus right around the corner, that, in fact, could be further delayed and ultimately we would hope that it would just go away and be deflated and come down.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKenneth Usdin: A follow-up question, Mark, on the fee side. Understanding that you're -- we'll see this tough comp year-over-year. Just wondering if you can separate when you expect normalization for some of the areas back to19-ish. I know that's a moving target given the environment. But just if you think about separating out Trading and Investment Banking, can you just talk to us through about like the visibility stuff that you see a little bit more easier, how you see that trajecting, notably Investment Banking, TTS, et cetera?\nMark Mason: Yes. So again, we see -- we continue to have good dialogue on the Investment Banking side with our clients. Obviously, we've seen very strong performance as it relates to the SPAC space and equity capital markets, and that will continue to play out just when you think about the nature of those deals. And so that will continue to play out into 2021.  But the dialogue has been very good. And that's both in investment banking, but also just broadly with the corporate clients as corporate clients are trying to figure out what coming out of this crisis means for their own business models and how they think about their digital capabilities and needs and how they think about their supply chains and how that might be shifting. And those types of dialogues they're having both internally but also with us. And so we're part of that conversation. And being part of that creates opportunities on the TTS side, on the Investment Banking side and potentially even as it relates to the corporate lending activity, which we hope to pick up in the back half of the year as well.  And so very, very strong and continued corporate dialogue, and I think that's going to contribute ultimately to driving some of that fee revenue that you mentioned. In terms of the markets piece, we -- again, we've had an extraordinary year. The industry has seen a great deal of wallet growth in markets. And that's got to normalize at some point, obviously, and we are forecasting that it does.  But I'll tell you in the early days of January, we've continued to see robust activity. And it is early days in the quarter. But we have seen that. And so we'll have to see how that plays out over the balance of the quarter and going into the balance of '21.\nKenneth Usdin: Understood. And a follow-up on rates. It's always a little harder to dig out how much rates benefits you guys -- just given the global nature of all the yield curves that you guys face. But is there a way you can help us or just remind us just how sensitive or not to the company is to just -- if the long end were to move here in the U.S. and how much contribution that might be able to add?\nMark Mason: Yes. Look, we tend to be more sensitive to the short end of the curve, but we disclosed some IRE information in our Qs. And in fairness, that's kind of tough to compare relative to peers. So we show what 100 basis point increase would be on the long end. And -- but the reality is that we would see -- with curve steepening, we would see some upside as we would think about investing out on the curve and as it would also impact the pressure we've been seeing from MBS repayments and the like. And so we're more sensitive to the short. But with the steepening, we think we would see some benefit.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.\nChristoph Kotowski: I'm looking at Page 10 of your handout and the global consumer trends. I'm trying to understand that. And I guess, I have 2 questions, one narrow, one broader. And the narrow question is just looking at Latin America, the losses are down and the delinquencies are significantly up. Is that an accounting thing, a forbearance thing? Or is that a real underlying economic thing? And does it have to do with COVID? Or does it have to do with other economic variables?\nMark Mason: Yes. Look, what we're seeing there is as people come off of the relief programs that have been in place, we're seeing delinquencies pick up as was expected. And so that's what's playing out in the increase that we see in the fourth quarter. And ultimately, that will play out in the NCLs. But again, that is along the lines of what we were expecting in Latin America.\nChristoph Kotowski: Okay. And the decline then presumably is the flip side of that, the forbearance?\nMark Mason: That's right. Yes.\nChristoph Kotowski: Right. Okay. And then I guess just looking at the picture more broadly. And I mean I guess if you look at infection rates of COVID, North America is high, Asia is low and Latin America is somewhere in between. Normally, I think all of us like 9 or 10 months ago would have kind of thought that the economic disruption and the loss rates would somehow mirror that. And it doesn't seem to be in any way, shape or form that I can tell. And I'm wondering if you can account for that. And how are we to gauge kind of the disruption that COVID is causing and, I guess, particularly in your kind of global businesses?\nMark Mason: Go ahead. I'm sorry.\nMichael Corbat: No, Mark, I was going to say, Chris, I would say that we've got to look at what I would describe as the unevenness, right? The unevenness, the way that we went into this in terms of timing, in terms of position, in terms of health response, in terms of economic response. You look at the demographics, and clearly, in -- at the different layers or different strata, you see different things. Headlines in the paper this morning, 1 out of every 5 in New York City on rent subsidy are behind in their payments, at least 2 payments. But at the same time, we continue to see paydowns in terms of credit cards. Businesses on different trajectories.  And so again, as I think as we see vaccines roll out on a state-by-state basis, that will cause different outcomes. And then as we see the second round and what President-elect Biden announced last night and ultimately what comes through and how that makes its way into the sector.  So from our perspective, not just in the U.S., but around the globe, we are really taking a very granular approach on a geographic by geographic, client segment by client segment around that and trying to remain very sensitive to each of those. And so I don't think there is a single formula that allows you to look at this and come with the outcome. It's got to be done at a pretty granular level.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.\nCharles Peabody: Yes. I had a follow-up question on the markets commentary or trading businesses. And specifically, I wanted to focus on your FICC trading businesses. Can you give us a little bit more color as it relates to the fourth quarter where the strength in FICC was and where the weakness was in terms of rates, credit, commodities, currencies?  And then as part of that, it's my understanding that you were caught wrong-footed in the rand. And I was wondering -- and I'm assuming that losses there were not material because it's not a deep market. But is there something changing about the environment that's going to make it more difficult in 2021 for positioning or market making or trading? Because you do talk about normalizing. Was there anything in that rand experience that you can extrapolate?\nMark Mason: Sure, this is Mark. Sorry, Mike, go ahead.\nMichael Corbat: First off, Charles, I would say that in the rand piece that, that was more of a research recommendation than an actually a firm positioning play. And so it was our analysts going out with what they believed was a recommendation around that. And so that shouldn't be read as the firm necessarily having that position. Independent research came out with that.  On your second piece, I think as you look at FICC trading, for us, if you look at the fourth quarter and the numbers that we've posted, I think you should look in there, I think relative strength in terms of credit and credit spread products, again, as we measure that against our rates and currencies business, it's not as large. It's still a meaningful business for us but not as large. Some of that other people have spoken to as having outsized, quite significant returns in the leverage lending space. We're not as large in that space.  And I think as we look at our trading revenues, we tend to look at those over not just quarter but longer cycles. And if you look at The Street research today, it's indicating that the trading wallet for 2020 was up somewhere in the neighborhood of mid-20s. As you look at our trading revenues for 2020, we're probably up somewhere in the mid-30s. So again, quarter-to-quarter, less important. But again, for us continuing to take share in there and the underlying mix tends to kind of bounce that around a little bit. But again, I think we feel pretty good about our position and the dialogues where we are.  I think as we think forward, I think it's unlikely to think that we're going to see wallets up to the same degree, certainly in the trading space that we saw this year. We think seasonality will resume. But as Mark said, as we kind of started and it's early in the new year, we have seen activity remain high. And as I think we see more potential stimulus or governmental programs coming out, the Fed and others continuing to take stances on rates and trajectory and where things go, that could keep trading volumes, keep creating volumes relatively high.  So again, we think we're pretty well positioned, and we're in dialogue around those, but we clearly can't escape all of the market dynamics of where the wallets go.\nMark Mason: And Mike, the only thing I'd add is if you look at the numbers, right, FICC is up 34% for the year. Raise in currency is up 32%. Spread products, up 40%. We've had very strong performance this year. It's hard to be upset with those numbers. And so everything you said is exactly right, Mike. And I think the business has been fully engaged with clients, and we're going to continue to do that.\nCharles Peabody: Just as a follow-up, I mean I recognize it was an unusually strong year and particularly in FICC, which was nice to see. But does that make it -- when you look out at 2021, are you looking for FICC to be less robust, and equity sort of offset that? Or is there any mix between FICC and equity in your thought process?\nMark Mason: Look, our equities is up. We're up 25% this year as well, right? So the normal -- and the wallets were up for equities as well. So we'll see a normalization take place across the board next year or at some point?\nMichael Corbat: And I would also say, Charles, we need to look at the new issued calendar. And clearly, the calendar on both the debt and the equity side was strong. We saw the seasonality, and we saw clearly debt issuance slow in the fourth quarter. There are recommendation, and the uptake around our clients was to go ahead and to build lots of liquidity and to shore up the balance sheet. And so probably less debt financing needs in terms of 2021. But at the same time, I've got to say, and I reviewed it last evening, that the equity calendar remains very strong. And again, we'll see what the markets afford, but we've got to be able to have a market that's welcoming to new issues and in particular the SPAC space, which we've excelled and has been strong. And so again, that will also, I think, then dictate some of the secondary activity as we go forward in the year.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Mark, coming back to share repurchases, obviously, there's limitations based on income, and you explained it very clearly, for you and also your peers. If those limitations are lifted possibly after this year's stress test and we go back to the more traditional or the regulations that are in place that went into effect October 1 with the stress capital buffer, where as long as you pass your CET1 requirement, you're free to do whatever you'd like. That as the backdrop, would you guys consider an accelerated share repurchase program if you got the green light rather than doing it every quarter like it was done in the past because that's what the regulations required in the past?\nMark Mason: Yes. We'll need to look at -- first of all, the stress capital buffer, obviously, is an important component to how this all comes together. And coming out of the recent resubmission, you saw the prospective stress capital will have to go up by 10 basis points. They haven't applied that. We're still subject to the 2.5% stress capital buffer, but that will be a factor that we have to consider in the outer-quarters from 2021.  And then post that, there'll be another CCAR submission, and we'll get results that inform the go-forward there. Every quarter, we'll look at what our projected performance would suggest, including that stress capital buffer juxtaposed against our target. And that view will allow for us to take the capital actions that we think are appropriate inside of what those results would suggest.  And so we will take this in quarterly decisions, so to speak, ensuring that our outlook supports the capital action that we want to take. And so that's how we intend to approach it.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And Jane, you pointed out that a lot of work is going to be done about looking at the opportunities to drive growth for Citigroup so that you can narrow the gap between your peers in terms of profitability. And I don't expect you to give us the answers, obviously, on this call. But one of the differences between Citigroup and 2 of its biggest peers that are more profitable is your U.S. consumer banking franchise. And those 2 peers, which announced their numbers today, have ROEs in that business of over 25%, whereas when we look at your global consumer business based on your fourth quarter numbers, the ROE was about 15%. Is there an opportunity for depository acquisitions in the United States? Is there an opportunity to grow the Consumer Banking business in the U.S.?\nJane Fraser: We certainly believe there is a strong opportunity. And the strategy we have as we put all of the U.S. consumer business together over the last year or so has been to make sure that we capitalize on that by building out and deepening our customer relationships in the U.S. And we've had a number of important thrusts digitally and digital acquisition, as Mark referred to. So yes, we do see important growth opportunities, and our home market is an important one for us. The specifics of that, as we said, more to come.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale.\nAndrew Lim: So for the system -- sorry, for the system as a whole, we've seen excess deposits really grew quite a lot at banks. I think one of your competitors has noted how this is putting pressure on certain ratios, one of which would be your supplementary leverage ratio. And I think if you took away the temporary exclusion of cash and treasuries and its nominator of that ratio, then things would look quite tight. I just wanted to see how that pans out for Citi, whether you see that same kind of pressure and how you think about that. And then if I could ask two short technical questions. I didn't quite catch what you said about LatAm NCLs coming down. What was the reason for that? It just strikes me as a bit surprising that, that should be the case.  And then just lastly, on your risk-weighted assets, they climbed quite a bit this quarter. It doesn't seem to be that it could be entirely credit driven. Just if you could give a bit more color on that.\nMark Mason: Sure. Let me start with your first question, which was on, I think, the impact of deposits. And so yes, we have seen a significant increase in deposits. That does impact a number of the important metrics. From an SLR point of view, if not for the relief, which kind of goes away at the end of the first quarter, we'd have a lower SLR by 109 basis points. So the reg relief provided 109 basis points of relief there.  It also has had an impact on -- and by the way, we are managing to that SLR relief going away at the end of the first quarter. So we're aware of that. We're managing accordingly to that.  It's also had an impact on our GCIB score, which is -- has kind of tripped into the next bucket, the 3.5% bucket. And the large percentage of that increase that we've seen in the GCIB score was also driven by deposits. And so we'll have to manage that as well. Obviously, there -- we have a view that some consideration needs to be given to both of these metrics as the Fed has been clear in terms of their view that there's enough capital in the system. And so we're hopeful that as kind of things evolve, that some consideration is given to that. But in the meantime, we're managing the balance sheet and deposits and capital accordingly and with full knowledge of how the relief might evolve in the case of the SLR.  In terms of your question on credit risk in Latin America, the point that I was making here was that because we've had customers that were part of a relief program, that the NCLs that we've seen have been lower than what they would have been if those customers were not running through the relief program. So you see the NCL -- the lower NCL in the quarter, but you also start to see delinquencies pick up. And those delinquencies are picking up as people come out of that relief program and start to -- or stop paying, I should say, and therefore, you see delinquencies take up.  And so shortly, you'll see the NCL start to pick up as people go beyond the 90 days past due delinquent and go into losses. Hopefully, that was clear. The last question you asked was on advanced RWA growth. I mean we did see RWA increase quarter-over-quarter. The drivers there was -- they were a combination of credit risk, market risk and operational risk. And inside of that, we saw FX drive some of that increase as well as derivatives and mostly derivative and FX exposure increases, including CVA. So those are the major drivers of the RWA on an advanced basis tick-up that we saw.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your final question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja: I just have a quick clarification. I know you've been talking about wealth management being a focus. And we see the stats that you give us for Asia, like investment sales up 58% linked quarter. But the fee revenue in Asia consumer is actually down linked quarter by 10%. So is this a really small business in revenue? Since there's no disclosure, it's hard for us to tell. Or what are the other offsets? Because I hear you talk about it as a material part of Asia, but there's no way to put any context around this.\nMark Mason: Yes. And look, we're going to -- we just announced, obviously, the creation of this wealth management business where we'll bring the private bank together with the wealth management business we have globally on consumer. So we'll provide more detailed metrics as it relates to that. But our Asia wealth management is a sizable business, and we are going to continue or expect us to continue to see growth there. And so stay tuned on kind of more disclosure there and more details around the strategy for how we get after that.\nOperator: There are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks?\nElizabeth Lynn: Thank you all for joining us today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us in IR. Thank you again, and have a nice day.\nOperator: This concludes today's earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3. Citigroup reported fourth quarter net income of $4.6 billion. Revenues declined 10% from the prior year. While trading remained strong, this was more than offset by the combined impact of lower interest rates and lower levels of consumer activity. Expenses were up 2% year-over-year, reflecting continued investment in our transformation, including infrastructures supporting our risk and control environment, along with higher repositioning costs as we look to adjust capacity in targeted areas.  Credit performance remained strong with credit losses of $1.5 billion, down sequentially as well as year-over-year. And cost of credit was roughly neutral for the quarter as these losses were offset by an ACL release of $1.5 billion, driven primarily by an improvement in our base macro scenario. EPS was $2.08 and ROTCE was 11.4%.  In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer. Deposits grew 19%, reflecting consistent client engagement with corporate clients building liquidity, along with higher savings rates and reduced spending in consumer. Turning to full year results. In 2020, we delivered solid performance despite the pricing with net income of over $11 billion, even as we increased reserves by roughly $10 billion. We ended the year with strong capital and liquidity and grew tangible book value throughout the year.  On the top line, while the pandemic had a significant impact, we held full year revenues flat in 2019, with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher noninterest revenues. Expenses increased 2%, in line with guidance as we invested in our transformation. Results also included COVID-19-related expenses and the civil money penalty in the third quarter offset by lower discretionary spending and continued efficiency savings.  Full year EPS also includes a $0.16 impact related to revising the previously determined accounting for third-party collection fees, reversing the benefit to net income with a corresponding increase to opening retained earnings, capital neutral as of year-end.  On Slide 4, we provide additional detail on reserving actions. As a reminder, these reserves include our estimate of lifetime credit losses tied to a specific base scenario as well as a management adjustment for economic uncertainty, which provides for the possibility for a more adverse outcome. Our reserve release this quarter primarily reflects our improving macroeconomic outlook, although I would note, we did add to our management adjustment for economic uncertainty as the pace and shape of the recovery is still evolved.  Overall, looking at the reserves we hold today, we believe that we are well positioned with nearly $28 billion in reserves, which represents an allowance for credit losses of roughly 4% on funded loan.  Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $4.8 billion, up 30% from last year. Operating margin declined 5% on lower revenues and a 2% increase in expenses, primarily reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls, while credit costs were down considerably given a $1.3 billion ACL release. The release this quarter primarily reflected improvement in the outlook for global GDP as well as fewer downgrades in the portfolio. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.4%, including 4.4% on the noninvestment-grade portion. Total net credit losses were $210 million.  Looking at full year results, the ICG business has performed well this year with 13% revenue growth, positive operating leverage and operating margin growth of 24%. But given the ACL build this year, ICG EBIT declined 6%. And for the full year, ICG delivered a 13.8% return on allocated capital. Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Revenues decreased 1% in the fourth quarter as strong trading performance was offset by lower revenues in TTS, Investment Banking and Corporate Lending.  On the banking side, revenues declined 7%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were down 8% as reported and 6% in constant dollars as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenue. Average deposits were up 22% in constant dollars, and we had solid growth in our underlying drivers despite the significant macro slowdown, with increased digital adoption, cross-border transaction volumes growing over 10% and a record quarter in clearing. Investment Banking revenues were down 5% from last year, as solid growth in equity underwriting was more than offset by lower revenues in M&A and debt underwriting.  Private Bank revenues grew 6%, driven by capital market strength as well as improved managed investment revenues and higher lending. Corporate Lending revenues were down 25%, driven by lower spreads, higher hedging costs and lower average volume. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues increased 13% from last year. Fixed Income revenues grew 7% as higher revenues across spread products and commodities were partially offset by lower revenues in rates and currency, although I would note that we saw solid performance in FX and global rates and good client engagement across the entire business.  Equity revenues were up 57% versus last year, driven by strong performance in cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting higher client volumes and more favorable market conditions. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were unchanged on a reported basis, but up 2% in constant dollars as higher volumes from new and existing clients with broken deposits, settlement volumes and assets under custody were partially offset by lower spreads.  For full year 2020, revenues increased 13% driven by the significant strength in markets this year, along with a solid contribution from Investment Banking and the Private Bank. Throughout the year, we continue to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses as we actively helped our clients navigate through this uncertain environment, given our global platform, our progress in creating new digital solutions and our full-service model, which allows us to capture natural linkages that exist across the franchise.  And given the momentum we've seen this year in key drivers, including digital adoption, deposit growth and client engagement, we're even better positioned to ensure additional share gains in 2021 as these clients more fully recognize the benefits of using Citi as their platform of choice.  Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 7. GCB delivered EBIT of $1.7 billion. Revenues declined 13% as continued strong deposit growth and momentum in Wealth Management were more than offset by lower card volume and lower interest rates across all regions. That said, we did see signs of stabilization sequentially this quarter.  Expenses increased 4% across both North America and international consumers, driven mostly by higher repositioning. Excluding repositioning costs, total GCB expenses were flat as COVID-related costs were largely offset by efficiency savings. Credit cost decreased 45% as lower volumes and improved delinquencies led to lower net credit loss, coupled with an ACL reserve release in all 3 regions.  And looking at full year results, GCB delivered EBIT of $1.1 billion, down significantly from last year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and higher reserve builds under CECL.  Slide 8 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Total fourth quarter revenues were down 11% from last year, but we did see positive momentum in our drivers this quarter. And on a sequential basis, revenues grew 3%. Branded cards revenues were down 13%, reflecting lower purchase sales and lower average loans.  Purchase sales grew 9% sequentially on both seasonal activity as well as the continued recovery in consumer spending but were still down year-over-year. At the same time, we're seeing an increase in payment rates as consumers remain liquid, and we have not yet seen stress in their overall ability to pay. So while purchase activity has improved, our clients are also paying down more quickly, resulting in continued pressure on our loan balance. Retail services revenues were down 16% year-over-year, reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments. Net interest revenues were down 12% as average loans declined by 11% on lower purchase sales activities and higher payment rates. Similar to branded cards, purchase sales grew 18% sequentially but remained down year-over-year. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower losses in 2020 and, therefore, higher income share.  Retail Banking revenues were down 1% year-over-year as strong deposit growth and higher mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spread. Average deposits were up 21%, including 29% growth in checking. We saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales with digital deposits increasing $2 billion quarter-over-quarter. We saw continued underlying growth in our wealth management drivers with 18% year-over-year growth in Citigold client and 11% growth in assets under management.  Overall, we feel good about our client engagement as we exit the year, with spend activity continuing to recover, underlying strength in wealth management drivers and significant deposit growth giving us the opportunity to grow and deepen these relationships going forward as we continue to invest in our products and digital capability.  On Slide 9, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We continue to see good momentum in wealth management as investment revenues grew 16%, with a 7% increase in Citigold client and 13% growth in net new money. And average deposit growth remained strong at 14%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Card revenues remained under pressure year-over-year with purchase sales down 13%, given a continued significant impact on travel in the region. However, we did see sequential improvement in purchase sales this quarter, in line with our expectations.  Turning to Latin America. Total revenues declined 16% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter with average balances up 13% and purchase sales improved sequentially. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continue to decline given the macro environment.  Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. Credit loss rates generally trended downward this quarter, given high levels of liquidity in the U.S., lower spending and the benefits of relief program. However, in Asia, credit loss rates increased, mostly driven by those accounts that exited relief programs in line with our expectations. The year-over-year rise in delinquencies outside the U.S. is concentrated in accounts rolling off relief programs and reflects more modest levels of stimulus in these regions relative to the U.S. Given these trends, we continue to expect peak losses to occur in Asia and Mexico during the first half of 2021 and should begin to recover thereafter.  Meanwhile, in the U.S., while we do expect losses to begin to rise in 2021, given today's delinquency trend and the expected impact of recent stimulus, we now expect peak loss rates to be pushed out to the first half of 2022. Whether continuing to push out these losses is simply a matter of timing or if it will ultimately result in lower aggregate losses remains to be seen, and it's something we are watching closely.  Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues declined significantly from last year, reflecting the impact of lower rates, the wind-down of legacy assets and the absence of episodic gains. Expenses were roughly flat as the wind-down of legacy assets offset investments in infrastructure, risk management and control. And the pretax loss was $690 million this quarter, roughly in line with our prior outlook.  Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trend. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.5 billion in the quarter declined $1.3 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances, partially offset by higher trading-related NIR. Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize and excluding market was roughly flat to the third quarter. And net interest margin declined 3 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenue and balance sheet expansion due to strong deposit growth.  Turning to noninterest revenues in the fourth quarter, non-NIR declined 6% to just over $6 billion, given lower levels of consumer activity year-over-year. Turning to full year results. Revenues were flat with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher noninterest revenue driven by continued strong performance in markets throughout the year as well as strength in investment banking.  On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 11.8% or 180 basis points above our regulatory minimum. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% to $73.83 driven by net income. Before I hand it back to Mike, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. On the top line, we saw an extraordinary year in market performance in 2020 and would expect some degree of normalization this year. And subject to how that plays out, we can see revenues down in the mid to high single-digit range this year, largely driven by market. This outlook assumes industry wallets more similar to 2019 levels. And for net interest revenue specifically, it assumes continued stabilization in the first half of the year with an improvement in the back half to our base case, which assumes loan growth by this point in the recovery.  On a full year basis, the decline in net interest revenues is somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion versus 2020. On the expense side, we expect full year expenses to increase in the range of 2% to 3%, mostly driven by investments related to our transformation. Our cost of credit should be meaningfully lower than 2020. And we expect a tax rate of roughly 21% for the year.  So pulling this together, we expect operating margin pressure this year. But given lower credit costs, we should still see significant improvement in profitability relative to 2020.  And finally, as Mike mentioned earlier, we look forward to repurchasing shares through the balance of 2021, subject to Board approval, starting this quarter.  To wrap up, as I look at how we performed in 2020, we demonstrated the significant earnings power and resilience of the franchise. We sit here today with strong capital and liquidity position. Overall client engagement remains strong. We grew book value every quarter, and we remain focused on supporting colleagues, customers, clients and community, all of which give me a great deal of confidence as we move into 2021.  With that, let me hand it back to Mike. Jane, the only thing I'd add to that is that we have been seeing greater e-statement penetration -- or e-statement usage, I should say, and e-payment usage. Our e-statements usage and payment usage is up some 15%. And so, as you would imagine through this crisis, people have been actively engaged with our digital capabilities, and that's in part a byproduct of the investments that we've been making in digital technology. And so, we feel good about that. Sure. So look, as I've said in the outlook there, we look at -- we see expenses being up about 2% to 3%. Most of that is likely to be driven by the transformation spend as we get our arms around what that cost is going to be. You know already we've spent $1 billion this year. That's in our run rate already.  But there is a broader investment strategy that we're working toward, and we're doing that in the context of -- we'll obviously do that in the context of how the strategy Jane spoke to evolves. And so, continued investment in digital capabilities both on the consumer side as you heard me mention, but also on the ICG side, particularly in our TTS platform where we've seen good benefits from the investments already made there. But as you know, that's an area where innovation in technology is what's required to maintain a competitive advantage there.  We just announced the wealth management business, if you will, bringing together wealth from the consumer and in the private bank. And that, I would imagine, will be -- not I would imagine that will be an area of investment for us as we grow fee revenues, as Jane has pointed to, as an important objective of ours. We'll also see growth in advertising and marketing.  So, in that outlook, I talked about net interest revenue stabilizing, but picking up in the back half of the year with growth in loans, and that growth in loans is going to be a byproduct of us starting to put money to work again back in advertising and marketing, which was down materially this year as we managed through this crisis.  So, those are a couple of areas that we would look to invest in, in the context of that 2% to 3%. But again, a lot of it is going to be towards this transformation. And it is an investment, which I continue to remind folks of, and that is to say that we expect to and we'll focus on ensuring that we get a payback on that in the coming years. And so hopefully, that gives you a good sense, John. Yes. So again, the net interest revenue could be down, and that's in part because you got to look at the pace of the recovery that we're forecasting. And so how loan volumes trend will be an important factor there. Obviously, the GDP forecast that we have factors into that. And obviously, the rate curve and how that evolves will be another important factor that comes into play.  That said, I would add that we have seen -- on the card side, you heard me mention this in my prepared remarks. We saw good sequential momentum across purchase sale activity. Some of that's seasonal, but some of that just really good activity with our customers, and we're looking for that to continue. We -- obviously, there's been a stimulus that's been announced already. There are certain talks of significant stimulus or additional stimulus to come. And hopefully, that kind of bridges us to a place where it fuels some of the GDP growth that we're seeing in our forecast. Yes. Thanks, Jane. Look, in your prepared remarks, you rightfully focused on strategies that are geared towards identifying growth opportunities and improving our returns and narrowing the gap to peers. And I think that type of strategic focus, along with the investments that we've made -- that we're making, both transformation and growth-oriented investments, will certainly put us on that path.  I think the normalization of GDP in the credit environment is going to be helpful as well. And then as many people know, we've got a deferred tax asset and some legacy assets that we'll continue to work down over time. And I think those -- the combination of those things, starting with the strategy and a plan to continue to return capital and return on capital, put us in the right path to getting to those improved levels of returns, not to mention the prospect of increasing rates over time or in the normal part of the cycle. Yes. Look, I mean we -- when we think about our reserve levels and the activity there, we certainly did factor in the impact of stimulus. I think what's important to point to is the stimulus thus far has resulted in high payment rates and a consistent kind of ability to pay for the consumer, and that's been good. And it showed up not only in our payment rates, but it also shows up in the lower level of delinquencies that we've seen and obviously the lower level of losses that we've seen.  There certainly is a need for additional stimulus. And I think the good thing about that is it should continue to support the payment rates that we've seen. And if it is significant enough, can ultimately drive greater consumption and support improved GDP, improved unemployment. Our current forecast, as you heard me mention earlier, assumes that, that loan momentum picks up towards the end of -- or the mid -- I'm sorry, the back half of 2021. If we see that take hold sooner, we could see higher levels of volume in loan growth. And obviously, that would be beneficial to our NIR forecast.  So stimulus is good in that regard. It also will put -- as it takes hold, there'll likely be some early pressure on lending volumes because people tend -- are using it as a liquidity tool and to pay down. But over time, I think it will be beneficial. Sure. So as you know, the Fed guidance allowed for us to reinstate buybacks. There was a cap on the first quarter that's based on the trailing 4-quarter average of income for us. That would equate to about $1.8 billion or so in buybacks in the first quarter. And so with -- subject to Board approval, we will approve some level of buybacks in Q1. We have not started those buybacks as of yet. Yes, I think you said it well, but I want to repeat one thing you said, which is that we're going to get this done, right? And it is a combination. We'll continue to refine the strategy here. We've got some very strong businesses with competitive advantages that we want to continue to shore up. We're going to make investments in the franchise because that's what it's going to take in order to continue to drive improved returns.  Yes, there are some drags. I mentioned that earlier. They certainly do weigh on the returns between the DTA and legacy assets. But we also have excess capital as we sit here with the CET1 ratio of an 11.80% versus 11.50% target that we have.  And so we're going to continue to work all of those things in combination. And I believe those are the things -- we believe those are the things that are going to get us back to continued improved levels of returns that we saw coming into this crisis. Yes, sure. I'll take that. So first of all, we feel very good about the TTS business that we have. We think of it as part of our services business inside of the ICG services would include TTS and security services. As you know, we have a very unique position within this part of our franchise. And you're right, the headline numbers are affected by interest rates. But we feel very good about the underlying momentum in the business, and we think that's evidenced by a couple of key drivers.  You're aware we're in 95 countries. That gives our clients the ability to transact in over 140 currencies. And we do that on a global platform. We have 600,000 users on that platform, which is up about 9% from last year. And within that, the mobile users are up about 95%.  We're continuing to grow accounts with our clients. And we now have the ability to open accounts digitally in 50 countries. In 2020, we opened over 14,000 accounts digitally, representing more than a 200% increase. And growing accounts deepens our relationship with clients and allows us to penetrate new activity centers, that allows us to capture more flows across our platform. And ultimately, that delivers more revenue. And so this digital activity drives revenue for us in the future, and it also is more -- in a more efficient way for us to do business with clients.  We're also seeing good transaction volumes across different payment types with these clients. We've had very good clearing performance and cross-border flows through the year. And so those things give us a lot of insight into what the momentum will look like coming out of this crisis. And that's not to mention additional opportunities with new clients. As you know, we've moved our commercial business squarely into the ICG. There's more upside for our TTS platform with a commercial -- with the commercial client base.  And so we feel very good about where we are. We're not taking our position for granted. We're going to continue to invest in this platform, and we're looking forward to capturing the growth and supporting our clients as they come out of this crisis. Yes. Let me make a couple of quick comments. One, as I mentioned and as you repeated, we will see expense growth here. Jane mentioned we're in the midst of making progress against our transformation. And we'll need to submit a plan in May and get that plan approved and continue to invest to get that executed against. And that will inform the thinking around some of the outer-years. But to answer your question around a bloated expense base, I would say no. It's not a bloated expense base at all. These are investments, as you've heard me mention repeatedly, and they're going to be -- there is going to be a return on the investment. The return will come in both revenue and a more efficient operating platform.  We've got a history now. We've got some credibility now with having demonstrated productivity across our platform, whether that's through automating processes or reducing data centers or low-cost location strategies.  Since our Investor Day, we've continued to improve our productivity. And that's what you should expect. That's what we're expecting of ourselves and we'll deliver on kind of coming out of these investments that we need to make. And so no, not a bloated expense base.  With that said, so put that aside, we are going to continue to invest in the business. And so if there are opportunities that present themselves, either as a byproduct of the strategy, refresh that Jane has mentioned or otherwise, we intend to take advantage of making those investments because that is the only way we get to those improved returns that we're targeting and focused on. So hopefully, that answers your question. Yes. Look, we have seen very good deposit growth, and some of that is a byproduct of our high-yield savings accounts. But we've also seen strong checking account growth this quarter, and we've seen the growth in our digital deposits as well. And so you're right, there's a funding cost advantage to that. We've seen that play out and the liquidity that's in the market. We intend to continue to grow as it relates to increasing those deposits. And we've been smart about how we've been managing our liquidity, keeping some liquidity, obviously, there for lending needs as they may evolve for our customers and clients but also paying down wholesale debt. We did that through the year and also investing.  We've made some investments through the year. I think we've invested as much as another $78 billion or so, up 21% for the year. And so we've been thoughtfully managing the liquidity that we've seen through the course of this year. We'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to grow deposits on the consumer side because you're right, it is a lower-cost funding alternative. And we'll do that as it -- if it makes a lot of sense. Sure. So I guess a couple of pieces there. So one, as you know, Betsy, when we model this, we look at kind of the macroeconomic variables that we have at any point in time. And so you look at kind of Page 4, we laid out the variables that we've used this quarter. And you can see that both for U.S. unemployment as well as for U.S. real GDP, we've seen improvement since the third quarter forecast that we ran.  And I'd tell you, even as you look at this, there's been further improvement even off of the fourth quarter '20 forecast that's here. And so those are important factors in the assumptions and what we're able to model in the way of reserve levels. And as we see that improve or improve further, we would expect that, that would be -- that would play out in the way of even lower reserves.  I think the other important factor is the stimulus and how that -- and the additional stimulus that is out there and how that ultimately evolves and what that means and whether that drives consumer consumption and whether that drives even further levels of improved unemployment will be important factors that come into play here.  And then I guess the final piece I'd mention is that we continue to hold management adjustment for economic uncertainty. And as we see these variables continue to improve, that's going to impact how we think about severity and probability associated with that downside scenario. So all of those factors come into play as to how we think about the reserve levels that we carry. While we still feel good about the $28 billion roughly that we have in the way of balances, we feel very good about the direction that these economic variables appear to be moving.  In terms of losses, again, it's been interesting the way this has played out. And so really, what we're all trying to figure out is whether the lower delinquencies and lower level of losses that we've seen thus far is a delay or is it a deflation of losses, right? And that only time will tell as we sit here today. And as you heard me say in my prepared remarks, we think it's a bit of a delay in that we would expect to see losses peak in 2022 now, particularly for U.S. consumer. But again, with another stimulus right around the corner, that, in fact, could be further delayed and ultimately we would hope that it would just go away and be deflated and come down. Yes. So again, we see -- we continue to have good dialogue on the Investment Banking side with our clients. Obviously, we've seen very strong performance as it relates to the SPAC space and equity capital markets, and that will continue to play out just when you think about the nature of those deals. And so that will continue to play out into 2021.  But the dialogue has been very good. And that's both in investment banking, but also just broadly with the corporate clients as corporate clients are trying to figure out what coming out of this crisis means for their own business models and how they think about their digital capabilities and needs and how they think about their supply chains and how that might be shifting. And those types of dialogues they're having both internally but also with us. And so we're part of that conversation. And being part of that creates opportunities on the TTS side, on the Investment Banking side and potentially even as it relates to the corporate lending activity, which we hope to pick up in the back half of the year as well.  And so very, very strong and continued corporate dialogue, and I think that's going to contribute ultimately to driving some of that fee revenue that you mentioned. In terms of the markets piece, we -- again, we've had an extraordinary year. The industry has seen a great deal of wallet growth in markets. And that's got to normalize at some point, obviously, and we are forecasting that it does.  But I'll tell you in the early days of January, we've continued to see robust activity. And it is early days in the quarter. But we have seen that. And so we'll have to see how that plays out over the balance of the quarter and going into the balance of '21. Yes. Look, we tend to be more sensitive to the short end of the curve, but we disclosed some IRE information in our Qs. And in fairness, that's kind of tough to compare relative to peers. So we show what 100 basis point increase would be on the long end. And -- but the reality is that we would see -- with curve steepening, we would see some upside as we would think about investing out on the curve and as it would also impact the pressure we've been seeing from MBS repayments and the like. And so we're more sensitive to the short. But with the steepening, we think we would see some benefit. Yes. Look, what we're seeing there is as people come off of the relief programs that have been in place, we're seeing delinquencies pick up as was expected. And so that's what's playing out in the increase that we see in the fourth quarter. And ultimately, that will play out in the NCLs. But again, that is along the lines of what we were expecting in Latin America. That's right. Yes. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Sure, this is Mark. Sorry, Mike, go ahead. And Mike, the only thing I'd add is if you look at the numbers, right, FICC is up 34% for the year. Raise in currency is up 32%. Spread products, up 40%. We've had very strong performance this year. It's hard to be upset with those numbers. And so everything you said is exactly right, Mike. And I think the business has been fully engaged with clients, and we're going to continue to do that. Look, our equities is up. We're up 25% this year as well, right? So the normal -- and the wallets were up for equities as well. So we'll see a normalization take place across the board next year or at some point? Yes. We'll need to look at -- first of all, the stress capital buffer, obviously, is an important component to how this all comes together. And coming out of the recent resubmission, you saw the prospective stress capital will have to go up by 10 basis points. They haven't applied that. We're still subject to the 2.5% stress capital buffer, but that will be a factor that we have to consider in the outer-quarters from 2021.  And then post that, there'll be another CCAR submission, and we'll get results that inform the go-forward there. Every quarter, we'll look at what our projected performance would suggest, including that stress capital buffer juxtaposed against our target. And that view will allow for us to take the capital actions that we think are appropriate inside of what those results would suggest.  And so we will take this in quarterly decisions, so to speak, ensuring that our outlook supports the capital action that we want to take. And so that's how we intend to approach it. Sure. Let me start with your first question, which was on, I think, the impact of deposits. And so yes, we have seen a significant increase in deposits. That does impact a number of the important metrics. From an SLR point of view, if not for the relief, which kind of goes away at the end of the first quarter, we'd have a lower SLR by 109 basis points. So the reg relief provided 109 basis points of relief there.  It also has had an impact on -- and by the way, we are managing to that SLR relief going away at the end of the first quarter. So we're aware of that. We're managing accordingly to that.  It's also had an impact on our GCIB score, which is -- has kind of tripped into the next bucket, the 3.5% bucket. And the large percentage of that increase that we've seen in the GCIB score was also driven by deposits. And so we'll have to manage that as well. Obviously, there -- we have a view that some consideration needs to be given to both of these metrics as the Fed has been clear in terms of their view that there's enough capital in the system. And so we're hopeful that as kind of things evolve, that some consideration is given to that. But in the meantime, we're managing the balance sheet and deposits and capital accordingly and with full knowledge of how the relief might evolve in the case of the SLR.  In terms of your question on credit risk in Latin America, the point that I was making here was that because we've had customers that were part of a relief program, that the NCLs that we've seen have been lower than what they would have been if those customers were not running through the relief program. So you see the NCL -- the lower NCL in the quarter, but you also start to see delinquencies pick up. And those delinquencies are picking up as people come out of that relief program and start to -- or stop paying, I should say, and therefore, you see delinquencies take up.  And so shortly, you'll see the NCL start to pick up as people go beyond the 90 days past due delinquent and go into losses. Hopefully, that was clear. The last question you asked was on advanced RWA growth. I mean we did see RWA increase quarter-over-quarter. The drivers there was -- they were a combination of credit risk, market risk and operational risk. And inside of that, we saw FX drive some of that increase as well as derivatives and mostly derivative and FX exposure increases, including CVA. So those are the major drivers of the RWA on an advanced basis tick-up that we saw. Yes. And look, we're going to -- we just announced, obviously, the creation of this wealth management business where we'll bring the private bank together with the wealth management business we have globally on consumer. So we'll provide more detailed metrics as it relates to that. But our Asia wealth management is a sizable business, and we are going to continue or expect us to continue to see growth there. And so stay tuned on kind of more disclosure there and more details around the strategy for how we get after that."

            "name": "Michael Corbat",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. Given this is my last earnings call with you, we're going to do things a little bit differently today. After I'm done speaking, I'll turn it over to Mark and before we open up to Q&A, Jane will make some comments on the transformation she's been leading and how she sees our strategy evolving. So, with that, let's go ahead and get started.  We had a strong finish to a tumultuous year with net income of $4.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.08 in the fourth quarter. We ended 2020 with over $11 billion in net income despite the doubling of credit reserves as a result of the pandemic and the impact of CECL. Overall, we increased our ACL by $10 billion over the course of the year.  As a sign of the strength and durability of our diversified franchise, our revenues were flat to 2019 despite the massive economic impacts of COVID-19 globally. Our deposits were up nearly 20% as we supported our clients throughout the year, and we see significant franchise value in the growth that we're seeing in the deposit base.  Turning to the fourth quarter, our Institutional Clients Group performed well as they have throughout the year, highlighted by our markets businesses which saw revenues up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Banking saw a 7% revenue decline as Investment Banking activity slowed and low rates continued to impact Treasury and Trade Solutions, although the Private Bank was a standout with a 6% increase. Our Consumer Banking revenues continued to be impacted by the pandemic, although we did see deposit growth in every region.  In the U.S., our retail business did benefit from exceptionally high mortgage refinancing as homeowners saw opportunities in this ultra-low-rate environment. And we saw continued momentum in digital deposits. In Mexico, lower loan volumes pressured our revenues. In Asia, card spending was down again, but we continue to see strong performance in wealth management.  We remain very well capitalized with robust liquidity to serve our clients. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 11.8%, well above our regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $73.83, up 5% from a year ago, and we welcome the Federal Reserve's decision regarding share repurchases as we have excess capital we can return to shareholders, and we plan to resume buybacks during the current quarter.  Given my upcoming retirement from Citi at the end of February, I recently looked through some of the challenges we faced when I became CEO. And while there's always more work to do, I'm very proud of what the firm has accomplished. We're in a fundamentally different place than we were in October 2012.  We've streamlined our consumer business and embraced the shift to digital, so we could serve our clients the way they want to be served. We've reestablished Citi as a go-to bank for our institutional clients throughout our global network. No matter what part of the world you're in, our bankers have a seat at the table during the most significant transactions.  We've optimized our capital base, working through our legacy assets and reducing our DTA by more than half, generating $7 billion of regulatory capital in the process. We dramatically increased the return of our capital to our shareholders. We went from a $0.01 dividend to returning over $85 billion in capital since 2013, and we've reduced our share count by 30%.  Before the pandemic, we had significantly improved the quality and consistency of our earnings, our return on assets, and return on our equity. As a result of the pandemic, while the financial results this year aren't what I would have wanted them to be for my last year as CEO, in many ways, I couldn't be prouder. All the work we did to strengthen our firm helped us get through this extraordinary year, and I'm proud of the fact that we've shown we can go through a crisis and emerge even stronger unlike the events of more than a decade ago.  Just for context, let's compare 2012 to 2020. In 2020, the year of a pandemic, we had nearly $4 billion more in net income, a 12-basis-point higher return on assets and 180 basis points higher return on tangible common equity than we had in 2012. That shows you just how far Citi has come.  And we also showed what our firm is about by serving our customers, our clients, and our communities. We were the first bank to launch an accommodation program for consumers when the pandemic hit. We stood up a small business program for lending in just a matter of weeks. We donated these profits to COVID relief efforts, part of $100 million in such grants we made throughout the year. And in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, we announced $1 billion in strategic actions to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States.  As I said, there's always more to do. But I feel really good about the firm as Jane prepares to take over. She's thrown herself into the transformation we've launched to strengthen our risk and control environment and ensured the firm operates with excellence in every area. I know she'll do everything she can to maximize returns and move Citi forward for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.  With that, Mark is going to go through the presentation. Thank you, Mark. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jane, so you can hear from her for a few minutes. Thank you, Jane. I appreciate your comments, and I know the firm is going to be in great hands. Jane, Mark and I are now happy to take your questions. No, Mark, I was going to say, Chris, I would say that we've got to look at what I would describe as the unevenness, right? The unevenness, the way that we went into this in terms of timing, in terms of position, in terms of health response, in terms of economic response. You look at the demographics, and clearly, in -- at the different layers or different strata, you see different things. Headlines in the paper this morning, 1 out of every 5 in New York City on rent subsidy are behind in their payments, at least 2 payments. But at the same time, we continue to see paydowns in terms of credit cards. Businesses on different trajectories.  And so again, as I think as we see vaccines roll out on a state-by-state basis, that will cause different outcomes. And then as we see the second round and what President-elect Biden announced last night and ultimately what comes through and how that makes its way into the sector.  So from our perspective, not just in the U.S., but around the globe, we are really taking a very granular approach on a geographic by geographic, client segment by client segment around that and trying to remain very sensitive to each of those. And so I don't think there is a single formula that allows you to look at this and come with the outcome. It's got to be done at a pretty granular level. First off, Charles, I would say that in the rand piece that, that was more of a research recommendation than an actually a firm positioning play. And so it was our analysts going out with what they believed was a recommendation around that. And so that shouldn't be read as the firm necessarily having that position. Independent research came out with that.  On your second piece, I think as you look at FICC trading, for us, if you look at the fourth quarter and the numbers that we've posted, I think you should look in there, I think relative strength in terms of credit and credit spread products, again, as we measure that against our rates and currencies business, it's not as large. It's still a meaningful business for us but not as large. Some of that other people have spoken to as having outsized, quite significant returns in the leverage lending space. We're not as large in that space.  And I think as we look at our trading revenues, we tend to look at those over not just quarter but longer cycles. And if you look at The Street research today, it's indicating that the trading wallet for 2020 was up somewhere in the neighborhood of mid-20s. As you look at our trading revenues for 2020, we're probably up somewhere in the mid-30s. So again, quarter-to-quarter, less important. But again, for us continuing to take share in there and the underlying mix tends to kind of bounce that around a little bit. But again, I think we feel pretty good about our position and the dialogues where we are.  I think as we think forward, I think it's unlikely to think that we're going to see wallets up to the same degree, certainly in the trading space that we saw this year. We think seasonality will resume. But as Mark said, as we kind of started and it's early in the new year, we have seen activity remain high. And as I think we see more potential stimulus or governmental programs coming out, the Fed and others continuing to take stances on rates and trajectory and where things go, that could keep trading volumes, keep creating volumes relatively high.  So again, we think we're pretty well positioned, and we're in dialogue around those, but we clearly can't escape all of the market dynamics of where the wallets go. And I would also say, Charles, we need to look at the new issued calendar. And clearly, the calendar on both the debt and the equity side was strong. We saw the seasonality, and we saw clearly debt issuance slow in the fourth quarter. There are recommendation, and the uptake around our clients was to go ahead and to build lots of liquidity and to shore up the balance sheet. And so probably less debt financing needs in terms of 2021. But at the same time, I've got to say, and I reviewed it last evening, that the equity calendar remains very strong. And again, we'll see what the markets afford, but we've got to be able to have a market that's welcoming to new issues and in particular the SPAC space, which we've excelled and has been strong. And so again, that will also, I think, then dictate some of the secondary activity as we go forward in the year."

            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I want to thank Mike for his support and for working so closely with me during this transition. It was important to him to ensure Citi has a seamless CEO transition and has obviously been tremendously helpful to me as I prepare to step into the role at the end of February.  I am extremely excited by the opportunities ahead for our firm, and I am equally determined to address the deficiencies in our risk and control environment that have been raised by our regulators. We've embarked on a transformation program that will clearly benefit our clients and investors as well as meeting the regulators' expectations of one of the world's most globally significant financial institutions. And of course, we still have to get through this pandemic. While we hope the end is in sight, this virus has surprised us and taught us the folly of best-laid plans, so we will remain vigilant and adaptable.  My two major priorities as I transition with Mike are our transformation effort and refreshing our strategy so we ultimately achieved 3 things: best position Citi to win, to improve our returns significantly and to address the issues raised by our regulators. While it's early days, our work on these priorities is well underway.  So on the transformation, we're taking the time to step back, to tackle the root cause issues, to define our target end state and develop the detailed plans to get us there. We put in place specific work streams against risk and controls, data and compliance, but we also have work streams on creating a culture of excellence and accountability and on strengthening our critical business processes. Each stream is led by a member of the executive management team. Together, we are accountable for simplifying and modernizing the bank.  In February, we will deliver our gap analysis to the target state; and in May, the detailed implementation plan. This effort will take time and it will require significant investment in technology and talent.  You have my commitment that we will invest your capital wisely, and that you, our clients and our regulators, will all see and benefit from the results. At the end of the day, we want to achieve a state of excellence in our risk and controls, in our operations and in our service to clients. Switching back the strategy. I have the benefit of having worked in a number of businesses and regions in Citi over the last 16 years. Nonetheless, this transition is giving me valuable time to step back and to take a dispassionate look at our strategy and businesses. You wouldn't expect me to come out with specifics at this rather early stage, but I can talk about how we are looking at this.  We have a wonderful franchise, first-class capabilities and a terrific brand name. We are the world's most global bank with a network no one can match. And this means we are uniquely able to help clients grow and succeed globally. Our capital and balance sheet is strong. We have a deep talent bench around the world. So while we have work to do, this is a pretty good hand to play. A few principles will guide how we refresh our strategy. We're taking a clinical look at our strategic positioning, assessing which businesses can attain leading market positions in a much more digitized world. Similarly, I believe in the value of focus and directing our investments and resources to the businesses that will drive stronger growth and improve returns over the long run. I also believe in ensuring the businesses we're in fit well together. So collectively, they are competitively advantaged and generate synergies.  And finally, like any true Scot, I believe there is value to unlock by simplifying the firm. As you know, on Wednesday, we announced that we will integrate Consumer Wealth Management and our Private Bank into one business line. It's a growth opportunity I'm particularly excited about in Asia as well as the U.S. Earlier in the week, we also announced the new head of our TTS franchise and our U.S. consumer leadership. And I look forward to sharing new opportunities and moves with you as we go.  I want to end as I began, by thanking Mike. He has spent his 38-year career at Citi. No one has been more dedicated. He always put Citi first. And he took over at a very difficult time. He had to make tough calls, steering the company through the post-crisis restructuring. He made Citi a simpler, smaller, safer and far stronger institution, returning it to growth, closing the gap with our peers and returning a significant amount of capital to our shareholders just as he promised he would.  His steady leadership this year helped us through this very difficult period for all of us, but this last year showed how the work he led has strengthened our firm as we supported our people, clients and communities through this pandemic. He leaves us with a tremendous foundation, and I am committed to building on his success. We are very grateful to him and proud of him. And all of us at Citi wish him the very best in the next chapter.  Mike, would you like to say something to close? Thanks, Glenn, for your question. So, we are just beginning the work on this strategy. And as I say, we're taking a step back, and Mark and I are working on a dispassionate view of all of the businesses and looking at what are the leading franchises we want to invest behind, what are the others that we want to grow to win. And as we do that work, we will let you know what's the direction we're going to be taking, and as we have done already in the announcements this week on wealth and on the new leadership in TTS.  But I would say, let us do the work and then we'll let you know how everything fitted together. And if there are pieces that end up not being part of the core, we'll let you know, but let us do the work first. Yes. So in terms of the digital customers, it's a different picture in different parts of the world. So, we saw a tremendous growth in Mexico that starts with a much lower digital base. And so with COVID, we saw a pretty rapid acceleration across the industry, and we're a major leader in that. When we look at the States, we already have an extremely active card customer base on the digital front. And so, we weren't expecting to see the same levels of pickup.  I'd say the other piece as well is customer acquisition across the board is lower because of COVID, and you typically do tend to see that the new customers, when they come on board anyone's platform, they tend to have a higher digital adoption rate. So, I think we're pretty optimistic that as and when we see the recovery that we'll also see growth in that digital adoption in the U.S. going forward. Yes, it's a great question. It's one we've been spending a lot of time working on and talking through, as Mark and I look at what is the right configuration of businesses, how do we -- as I said, in the principles we're laying out for how we're looking at the Citi of the future, particularly in a digital environment as the world is changing quite quickly on that front.  So once we finished doing the work, we'll be laying out what are the different metrics and milestones to measure us, both in terms of progress and in terms of the desired outcomes. I've been talking to a number of our key investors, which have been great, very helpful conversations, over the last few weeks and getting input from them around what sorts of outcomes are desirable. And they're very much part of mix as we look at doing this work on the strategy and on the transformation. As Mark said, the two go hand-in-hand going forward. So we look forward to getting back to you with that picture when we're ready. And Mark, I know has been key in all of this. So let me pass the mic to him. Well, thank you, Mike. So I think the end game, and you asked a question in terms of what do we look like in 2030, it's pretty simple really. As you said, we're a global bank. We want to be the leading global bank. We're very well positioned from that from our businesses. That means top-tier franchises in their respective competitive sets with a strategy that has been well understood by the market over that time frame. We want to be best-in-class in serving our clients and our customers, certainly in safety and soundness. And I'd add in, we want to be seen as playing a positive role in society as I think that's a very important part of mix these days. But all of that is with the purpose of generating the desired returns for our investors.  So to be fair, while we have made demonstrable progress over the last 10 years since the crisis, equally know that there is a gap to close with our peers. You can hold me accountable for doing so along with the management team. We're a team on a mission to get this done, and we will get this done. So these are all the questions that Mark and I are sitting down and looking at our different businesses and saying how do we make sure -- as I said in the opening remarks, we're looking at how do we drive our resource allocation and how do we drive our investments into businesses that will be important growth drivers for the franchise and high-returning areas for the firm going forward. We've come out with one already that we think is an important one on that dimension in wealth, where we've got many different parts of the puzzle that we think will enable us to be highly successful in this domain, bringing the different pieces of the firm together to drive this forward and is clearly going to be one of several areas that we see helping us improve our returns.  And as Mike said, that's not the only piece. There are other elements, as I said, in the different principles. We see value from simplification. And that's in terms of, obviously, the operating efficiencies and the like that we would get from that as well as potentially business mix. And we want to drive the businesses to make sure that they're really fitting well together so that they are achieving the synergies as well as the competitive and collective comparative advantage.  So it's going to be a combination of pieces. But as I say, we're doing this work. We'll let you know as we go of what the decisions we make along the way and look forward to sharing them with you, frankly, with the intent that we have both a leading global firm as well as an organization that's delivering the desired results to our investors. Mark, anything to add, my friend? Yes. What we're looking at the moment is much more around what do we want to be going forward. And where we are in the work is looking at how -- what are the different businesses, how do they best fit together. Digitization is changing quite a few things, as Mark was referring to. It's providing a lot of new opportunities, but also some important investments for growth as well as for returns. And if it ends up that there are businesses as we look at it that we don't think that fit well into the mix, then I think we've got good skills in terms of thinking about how we divest of those in a way that makes sense. But that's honestly not where we are at the moment. We're focused on what we're going to be. So as I say, wait for us to get the work done, and then we can come back to you with the plans of what we're looking at and what that path looks like. I think it's too early to speculate right now. We certainly believe there is a strong opportunity. And the strategy we have as we put all of the U.S. consumer business together over the last year or so has been to make sure that we capitalize on that by building out and deepening our customer relationships in the U.S. And we've had a number of important thrusts digitally and digital acquisition, as Mark referred to. So yes, we do see important growth opportunities, and our home market is an important one for us. The specifics of that, as we said, more to come."

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have objections please disconnect at the time. Miss. Lynn, you may begin.\nElizabeth Lynn: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.\nMike Corbat: Thank you, Liz and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported earnings for the third quarter of 2020. We had net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.40. We continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic extremely well. Credit costs have stabilized, deposits continue to increase and revenues are up 3% year-to-date. As you know last week we entered into consent orders with the Federal Reserve and the OCC and I will discuss how we are approaching those after I go through our business and financial performance. Our institutional clients group continues to perform extremely well. Investment Banking had another strong quarter accessing the capital markets for our clients and private bank revenues are now up 9% year-to-date. Treasury and Trade Solutions, the backbone of our global network is down only 4% for the quarter and 5% for the year in constant dollars, despite significantly lower interest rates. Trading performance were strong as well, with fixed income and equities up 42% and 18% respectively year-to-date. Global consumer banking revenues remained under pressure due to the economic impact of the pandemic, predominantly driven by the decline in credit card spending. At the same time, deposits continued to increase significantly, credit costs decreased and we saw more investment activity from our wealth management clients. On balance, our global consumer banking franchise has shown resilience in light of the challenges we're facing. Our capital position strengthened during the quarter with our common equity tier one ratio increasing to 11.8% well above our regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $71.95 up 4% from a year ago, and we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders over time. Turning to the consent orders, they focus on four areas that impact our risk and control environment; risk management, data governance, controls, and compliance. What ties these areas together is the need to modernize our infrastructure, governance and processes. We've had remediation programs in place, and while we've been making progress in these areas, we're simply not where we need to be. While this is disappointing, we're committed to thoroughly addressing the issues identified in the orders and modernizing our bank. As many of you know, we've been making structural changes and accelerating investments. We've centralized program management and learned from unsparing root cause analysis from outside firms. We're laser focused on reducing manual touch points, automating processes and ensuring accurate data can be accessed quickly when we're producing management and regulatory reports. More importantly, we're making strengthening our risk and control environment and achieving operational excellence, a strategic priority for the firm going forward. This won't be a quick or easy fix, we need to conduct an in-depth gap analysis to ensure our solutions are tailored to the issues we face and get us to the necessary end state. While we can't fully scope out the cost yet, for a multi-year transformation, I can tell you with certainty that we're committing all the necessary resources while continuing to serve our clients. Importantly, we're aligned with our regulators, as far as timelines are concerned, so we\u2019ll not jeopardize the quality or completeness for speed. Collectively, these investments will not only further enhance our safety and soundness, they'll also create a digital infrastructure that will make us more efficient, more competitive, and significantly improve our ability to serve our clients and customers. So these are investments we need to make. In hindsight, we should have done them faster and prevented it from coming to this. But our firm has made tremendous progress in recent years, whether it's de risking our balance sheet are improving our efficiency and business performance, to close the gap and returns with our competitors. Our foundation is sound stable and secure. Our performance during this pandemic shows the progress we've made achieving excellence in our risk and control environment and our operations is necessary for Citi to take the next step forward. Our franchise is made up of committed and capable people who make us proud every day. They've done everything asked of them and I know they'll continue to do so in the times ahead. Ahead of the transition in February, change is driving this transformation and the entire management team is committed to getting Citi to where it needs to be and doing it the right way. With that, Mark, will go through the presentation and then we'd be happy to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on slide three, Citigroup reported third quarter net income of $3.2 billion, which included a modest increase in credit reserves of roughly $300 million this quarter. Reported results also include the $400 million civil money penalty in connection with the consent orders that Mike just mentioned, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.19. For the quarter, revenues of $17.3 billion declined 7% from the prior year. While trading and investment banking remains strong, this is more than offset by the combined impact of lower interest rates and lower levels of activity in consumer. Expenses were up 5% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment. Credit cost of $2.3 billion were meaningfully lower relative to the first half of the year. Our effective tax rate was 20% for the third quarter. Looking at year-to-date results, we delivered net income of over $7 billion, even as we increase credit reserves by roughly $11 billion. We grew revenues by 3% predominantly reflecting continued strength in our markets and investment banking businesses, while expenses increased 1% year-over-year, allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and a 6% increase in operating margin. In constant dollars, end of period loans declined 4% year-over-year to $667 billion, reflecting a higher level of repayments across institutional and consumer, as well as a slowdown in draws in our institutional businesses, and lower spending activity in consumer. Deposits grew 16% with consistent client engagement, reflecting the benefits of our global platform across both the institutional and consumer franchises, which also serve to strengthen our available liquidity. And three quarters of the way through the year, we continue to manage well through this crisis, with significant capital and liquidity, as well as a significant cushion in the form of credit reserves. As of September 30, our CET1 Capital ratio was 11.8% close to 200 basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement. We have over $950 billion in available liquidity. We have more than doubled credit reserves since the end of last year. Today, they stand at nearly $29 billion, and including the modest increase taking this quarter, our reserve ratio was roughly stable at 4% on funded loans. And as we discussed last quarter, we feel good about our ability to continue to support our clients as we all manage through this crisis. On slide four, we provide additional detail on reserving action so far this year. As a reminder, these reserves include our estimate of lifetime credit losses tied to a specific base scenario, as well as a management adjustment for economic uncertainty, which provides some room in the event of a more adverse outcome. In the first quarter, our base scenario reflected a short lived downturn followed by recovery in the back half of 2020 with unemployment falling to 7% by year end, and full year GDP close to prior year levels. By the end of the second quarter our base case assumed a more severe and protracted downturn this year, but with a sharper recovery into next year. And now you can see we are expecting a somewhat more muted and slower recovery in both unemployment and GDP through 2022. I would note, however, that our forward looking view on a rolling 13 quarter basis in unemployment, as an example, is continuing to improve as we move further beyond the peak of the crisis. And outlook for other variables like VIX and oil prices is also important and generally improved this quarter. So on a net basis we did not see a significant impact on reserves from the change in our base macro outlook this quarter. But we did add to our management adjustment for economic uncertainty, which grew from $2.3 billion to $3.1 billion during the quarter, partially offset by lower loan volumes and other small items. Today, we are factoring in a downside scenario that is more adverse relative to our base case. For example, we are incorporating a more significant deterioration in U.S. GDP growth rates, which is now close to 9% lower than our base case in 2021 versus our second quarter outlook that was only 1% lower than the base case. So all else being equal, if the management adjustment had not changed, we would have seen a reserve release of roughly $500 million in the quarter. Looking at the level of reserves we hold today, we believe that we're well prepared for expected credit losses, having reserved for something worse than our base case. And given the lifetime nature of the CECL methodology and the conservative nature of our management adjustment, it is now more likely than not that we'll see reserve releases and our ACL come down in 2021 to offset future losses as we continue to progress through the crisis, assuming our base case holds. Although this may be offset somewhat as we would likely need to build additional reserves to cover future loan growth as the economy recovers and we support our client\u2019s needs. Turning now to each business. Slide five shows the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars. GCB delivered EBIT of $1.4 billion. While revenues remain under pressure, credit costs were down considerably this quarter, reflecting a small ACL release, and lower net credit losses in particular in the U.S., where we're seeing a continued benefit from government stimulus and other relief. Revenues declined 12% as continued strong deposit growth and momentum in Asia, wealth management was more than offset by lower card volumes and lower interest rates across all regions, and expenses decreased 2% as lower volume related expenses, reduction in marketing and other discretionary spending, and efficiency savings were partially offset by increases in COVID-19 related expenses. Slide six shows the results for North American consumer in more detail. Total third quarter revenues of $4.5 billion were down 13% from last year. Branded Cards revenues of $2.1 billion were down 12%, reflecting lower purchase sales and lower average loans. As seen across the industry purchase sales have continued to recover during the third quarter of 16% sequentially, but still down 9% versus last year. At the same time, we're seeing an increase in payment rates as consumers remain liquid and we have not yet seen stress and their overall ability to pay. So while purchase activity has improved, our clients are also paying down more quickly resulting in pressure on our loan balances. This is creating a revenue headwind, but it is also benefiting cost of credit as delinquencies and losses have outperformed our initial expectations for 2020. Retail services revenues of $1.4 billion were down 21% year-over-year, reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments. Net interest revenues were down 16% as average loans declined by 10% on lower purchase sales activity and higher payment rates. Similar to Branded Card, purchase sales recovered sequentially this quarter up 18%, but remained down 8% year-over-year. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower loss expectations in 2020, and therefore higher income sharing. During the quarter, we launched a new digital credit card program with Wayfair. With this partnership, we further diversified our portfolio with a leading e-commerce retailer and now provide half of the top 10 U.S. e-commerce companies in 2020 with consumer credit card programs. Retail banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 2% year-over-year as strong deposit growth and higher mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Average deposits were up 19% including 26% growth and checking. We saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales with more than two thirds coming from customers outside of our branch footprint. And we will continue to look for opportunities to deepen our relationships with these customers, including through our investments in digital wealth capabilities. Total expenses for North American consumer were down 3% year-over-year, as we managed our marketing and other discretionary expenses, while recognizing efficiency savings and lower volume related costs, which more than offset incremental COVID-19 related expenses. Total credit cost of $1.2 billion decreased 23% from last year, reflecting lower net credit losses as well as a modest reserve release. On slide seven, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 13% year-over-year in the third quarter. Cards revenues declined by 23% reflecting lower activity levels with purchase sales down 17% year-over-year. We're continuing to see a disproportionate impact on Asia card revenues from the decline in travel spending, including lower travel related interchange and foreign transaction fees. However, our strength and wealth management continued. We saw record investment revenues this quarter up 16% reflecting continued strong client engagement with 7% growth in Citi gold clients and 13% growth in net new money versus last year. And average deposit growth remains strong at 13% this quarter. Turning to Latin America, total consumer revenues declined 10% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw a good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter, with average balances of 13%. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending revenues were impacted by branch closures and a continued decline in the macro environment. In total, operating expenses for our International consumer business were down 1% in the third quarter, reflecting efficiency, savings and lower volume related expenses. And cost of credit declined to $392 million, with lower net credit losses and a modest reserve released this quarter, reflecting a change in accounting for third party collection fees. Slide eight provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. As I noted earlier, credit trends remain broadly stable to improving this quarter, given high levels of liquidity in the U.S. lower spending and the benefits of relief programs. However, we do expect losses to begin to rise next year and likely peak towards the end of 2021 as government stimulus and other programs roll off, and unemployment remains elevated. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide nine, ICG delivered EBIT of $3.7 billion this quarter and $10.8 billion year-to-date. Revenues of $10.4 billion increased 5% in the third quarter, as strong performance in fixed income and equity markets, investment banking and the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in TTS, corporate lending and security services. In the third quarter, we continue to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses given our highly differentiated global platform, our progress in creating new digital solutions for clients and our full service model which allows us to capture natural linkages that exist across the franchise. Turning now to the results for the businesses, starting with banking. Total banking revenues of $5.3 billion declined 2%. Treasury and trade solution revenues of $2.4 billion were down 6% as reported, and 4% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates, and lower commercial cards revenues. Our average deposits were up 26% in constant dollars, and we had solid growth and underlying drivers despite the significant macro slowdown. One example of the continued client engagement that we have seen is in instant payments, where we are now live in 26 countries and have seen significant client demand for these capabilities. Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were up 13% from last year, reflecting solid growth in capital markets and continued share gains. Capital Markets continue to be extremely strong equity underwriting in particular, which allowed us to continue to support our clients in raising liquidity through IPOs, convertibles and follow on offerings. Private Bank revenues of $938 million grew 8% driven by strong client engagement, particularly in capital markets, as well as improved managed investments, revenues, and higher lending. Corporate lending revenues of $538 million were down 25% as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. And while we continue to provide new loans and facilitate additional draws, we also saw significant repayments as we helped our investment grade client access capital markets, which led to the decline in end of period loans. Total markets and security services revenue of $5.2 billion increased 16% year-over-year. And as we've seen over the prior two quarters, we continue to actively make markets for both our corporate and investor clients as we help them navigate through the continued uncertain environment. Fixed Income revenues of $3.8 billion grew 18% driven by strong performance across spread products and commodities. Equities revenues of $875 million were up 15% versus last year, as solid performance in cash equities and derivatives, reflecting strong client volumes and more favorable market conditions were partially offset by lower revenues in prime finance. And finally, in security services, revenues were down 5% on a reported basis, and 4% in constant dollars, as higher deposit volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. Total operating expenses of $5.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year, reflecting continued investments in infrastructure, risk management and controls as well as higher compensation costs. Total credit costs of $838 million were up meaningfully from last year, although down significantly on a sequential basis. We built $529 million in reserves this quarter. The increase is largely due to continued uncertainty in the economic environment going forward. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.8% including 5.7% on the non-investment grade portion. Total net credit losses were $326 million. Finally, total non-accrual loans declined roughly $400 million sequentially to $3.6 billion, reflecting write-offs and repayments across the portfolio. Slide 10 shows results for Corporate/Other. Revenues declined significantly from last year reflecting the wind down of legacy assets and the impact of lower rates, as well as marks on securities. Expenses were up as the wind down of legacy assets was more than offset by investments in infrastructure, risk management and controls, incremental costs associated with COVID-19 and the $400 million civil money penalty that I mentioned earlier. Excluding the onetime impact of the penalty, the pre-tax loss for corporate/other was $657 million this quarter. And looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect a similar quarterly pre-tax loss. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.5 billion this quarter declined $930 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances partially offset by higher trading related NIR. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $670 million driven by lower loan balances as well as lower trading related NIR and net interest margin declined 14 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenues. Turning to non-interest revenues. In the third quarter, non-NIR declined 2% to $6.8 billion given lower levels of consumer activity, partially offset by strong trading and investment banking revenues year-over-year. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect the continuation of these dynamics with both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues down year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19 as well as the normalization in trading and investment banking activity. On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 Capital ratio improved to 11.8% driven by net income, our supplementary leverage ratio was 6.8%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 4% to $71.95 driven by net income. Before I conclude, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fourth quarter. On the top line, we expect to see continued pressure and consumer reflecting the impact of rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19. And we would also expect the low rate environment to continue to weigh on our cool businesses in ICG. Our markets and investment banking businesses should reflect broader industry trends. In total, we expect this to result in full year revenues that are roughly flat, with the decline in net interest revenues, more or less offset by non-interest revenues on a full year basis consistent with prior guidance. On the expense side, we remain focused on protecting our employees and supporting our customers. We are making targeted investments in the franchise where we see the best opportunities for the future. And we are accelerating investments to achieve excellence in our risk and control environment and enhance our operations for a fully digital world. As a result, we could see expenses that are up a couple percent or so on a full year basis. Turning to credit. As I mentioned already, if our macro outlook holds, we wouldn't expect additional reserve builds. But given the remaining uncertainty, we are also unlikely to see any material releases this quarter. And for the fourth quarter, we would expect a level of losses similar to those seen this quarter. In summary, the environment remains challenging this quarter, but we continue to perform well. Year-to-date, we have demonstrated the significant earnings power of the franchise, we ended the quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position. Overall client engagement remains strong. We grew book value this quarter, and we have remained focused on supporting employees, customers, clients and communities. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: ` Hi, good morning. Mike just wanted to ask your question as in terms of lessons learned on the consent order and the need to invest here. I guess, the question is why weren't these issues addressed earlier? Was, was there a misread of regulatory expectations? Or was management attention and resources just needed elsewhere? And you didn't get to it yet? Can you hear me?\nMark Mason: John, this is Mark, can you hear me?\nJohn McDonald: Yes, sorry. Could [Ph] you hear the question?\nMark Mason: Yes, we did hear the question. I think Mike's mic may be muted -- you muted.\nMike Corbat: Oh, can you hear me?\nMark Mason: Yes, yes, we can hear you now.\nMike Corbat: Like, I'm sorry. Sorry. So I was saying, John, that over the over the past decade or so I think we've done a lot of work in terms of positioning the firm for both a financial and a strategic perspective. And I think we've made a number of investments across areas that we felt were critical. And we're going to continue to make, continue to make targeted investments. At the Barclays Conference, Mark spoke about our next phase of our transformation. And, I think as we think about that, we have always been focused in terms of how we operate. But I would say we haven't gone fast enough, that, we feel that, again, I think if you think you look at COVID and the way we've come through COVID, I feel quite proud about kind of what we've done and what we've been able to do, obviously not over. And we've initiated a number of significant remediation projects along the way to strengthen our controls, our infrastructure and our governments. But that being said, we didn't do it fast enough. And we've got to we've got to move faster. And that's certainly where we're going to be focused. I think in terms of what the expectation should be, in terms of how we're going to approach that I think, really four, four pillars that we're going to be focused on. One is the organizational component. And you've seen this already go with that in terms of the establishment, and hiring of our Chief Administrative Officer, Karen Peetz coming in. And I think creating and putting a framework around the way we'll go with this. I would say the strategic component, which is really agreeing on what the end state vision for our processes, and I think, being critical, and as I said, in my opening, we have brought people in to give us an external assessment of what needs to be done and where we fell short. And I think it's making sure that the work that we do comes together across the institution. So as opposed to simply addressing specific issue, solving holistic problems, I think there's an operational component behind this in terms of making sure that around things like data and technology to make sure that we're driving the proper automation, the elimination of manual touch points and other things that we've spoken about. And I think importantly, the fourth component is the cultural piece, and making sure that all the businesses, all the regions, all the functions understand that it's everyone's responsibility to get this right. So I would say it hasn't John been from lack of effort, and commitment to it, but I would say that we certainly could have ensured to work smarter around getting to the, the endpoint.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, that's helpful. And then a follow up for Mark. Mark obviously, with the consent orders, and the work required additional expense, and investment will be needed in the coming years. Do you still think you can make progress closing the profitability gap to peers? Will that still be a goal? And also, if you can't do significant M&A, or our portfolio acquisitions, are there opportunities potentially to slim down and simplify the company over time that could help profitability? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Thanks, John. So the answer -- the answer is yes. I mean, our intent is over time to continue to narrow the gap to continue to increase profitability, improve returns over time and so that that hasn't changed. With every -- with every crisis, in some ways comes a unique opportunity. And that is a unique opportunity to take a hard look at your business model and you see corporations around the world having to think through that as they manage through this crisis and similarly, we will with the benefit of a new incoming CEO, and as well as managing through this crisis, we'll continue to look at our business model, continue to look at our strategy, and see what makes sense as we come out of this, and how we can best capture opportunities to serve our clients.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Thanks. One quick follow-up. Is it clear to you what will be deemed significant acquisitions or portfolio additions versus ordinary course? Or is that something that's still to be defined?\nMike Corbat: It's still to be defined. But there are some things that obvious in terms of BAU activity, in terms of securitizations, and other types of activities that we do within different parts of the franchise. But we still have to define what significant means and get regulatory agreement on that.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, there. Just maybe a quick follow-up. Good morning. Just a quick follow up on the Consent. Are the expenses going to be inside of Corporate/Other and outside of the businesses? And then, and related to the question is it clear to you that if and when the group comes off capital return suspension that you will be able to act -- as any of the other banks will act on the capital return front?\nMark Mason: Yes, sure. In terms of the first question, as you heard me mentioned before, we're spending more than a $1 billion in terms of incremental spend in 2020. That is split between Corporate as well as some of the other businesses depending on the nature of the spend. I would expect that as we go forward it would be a similar dynamic, again, depending on the nature of the spend would be booked in Corporate/Other or in some of the respective or one of the respective businesses. To give a quick example, in some of the consulting spend that we do, that is meant to help scope out and state vision or a key process, for example, we'd likely book that in Corporate/Other, it would serve to benefit the entire franchise. And so that's just one example. In terms of capital actions, going forward, there's nothing in the Consent Order that prevents us from making capital action decisions, and taking capital action decisions going forward. And so, we would expect that we'd be able to act similarly to our peers as we come out of this crisis.\nGlenn Schorr: Appreciate that. One quick one on cards if I could. You down double digits -- well into double digits in Asia and Mexico, but just overall. I wonder if you could parse out how much you think that the macro environment and some of the obvious that you've already spoken on. Because we're trying to build back to is what takes us to the other side where we have a bottoming out and building of off bottom. And that includes how you're marketing, meaning, our promo and teasers on whole given the macro backdrop and how you're marketing into the banking base? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Yes. So look, there are a couple of different dynamics that I think are important. I think the key one you hit on, which is we're still in the midst of a crisis. And so, we're very much still seeing pressure on purchase sales. It's better than it was in the prior quarters, but there certainly is still pressure there. We're seeing that across the franchise. One of the big drags this quarter you see is retail services. That's in part tied to the partner and revenue sharing that we have with partners where an improved forecast in loss expectations ends up resulting in us sharing more revenues with the partners. But the dynamic that's important to watch as this plays through is how unemployment, how GDP evolves, and what that means in the way of purchase activity starting to pick up. And that's going to be an important factor. We are keeping a close watch on that. We have dialed back advertising, marketing spend about cons et cetera, et cetera, and we want to be thoughtful about when we leg back in as we see signs of things turning. And so, we keep a close watch on that. We don't want to be late to that. And we'll be very proactive at getting after it where it makes sense and testing it where we think we're seeing good signals that warrant us increasing some of that spend to drive some of the future volume activity that we see. But as of right now, we're seeing the pressure on volumes. That's really a direct byproduct of the crisis we're managing through.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks, Mark.\nMark Mason: Yep.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, good morning.\nMike Corbat: Good morning.\nJim Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just a question, a follow-up on expenses. You guys have done a pretty good job over the last few years sort of investing, spending on investment and offsetting with efficiency saves. Obviously, that may not happen perfectly this year, because of the incremental spend. How do we think about that going forward? Is this ramp up start to stabilize next year? And you can kind of get back on that path? Or how do we think about beyond 4Q?\nMark Mason: Yes. So look, I think that -- as I mentioned, we've got an incremental spend of about a $1 billion this year that has gone towards infrastructure, risk and controls. We started that incremental spend path if you will in 2019. So to some extent in our run rate is more spend towards those types of activities. There will be an opportunity to look at that spend, the billion dollars and recalibrate it or point it in a different direction or reprioritize the spend. There's some of it that is a one-year spend that we'll have an opportunity to spend again, so to speak as we get into 2021 and we'll take advantage of that opportunity. The order requires, I think a very important step, which is that we step back and come up with a target and state vision for some of these key processes, and the risk management and controls that incompliance around them. And I highlight that step, because we need to do that in order to appropriately dimension the reprioritization of the spend we already have in our expense space, and what incremental spend is necessary. And so, we'll do that over the time period that's been allotted to us over within the order. It is an investment. And I highlight that, because many of the things that Mike described in terms of automation, in terms of reduced manual touch points, in terms of straight through processing. Many of those things will yield benefits in the way we run our organization, in the way we not only improve our operations, but in the way we're able to go to market and compete and serve our clients. And so, I do expect benefits to accrue from these investments down the line. And we will separate and away from that, because I won't compromise the dollars needed in order to make those improvements in those investments. Separate and away from that, we will continue to be responsible managers of the firm. And that means, ensuring that we look across the franchise and make sure -- and to ensure that we're spending wisely.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just pivoting to just NII. I appreciate the year-over-year guidance. But where and when do you see it kind of stabilizing, given where the rate picture is right now?\nMark Mason: Yes. So look, I mean, there are obviously a lot of factors that played through the quarter and 2020, the combination of not only rates, but the volumes that had played through are all important factors here, let alone the amount of liquidity that's in the market, and the impact that has on the balance sheet. I'd expect for near to stabilize and stay relatively flat as we go into the remainder of the year, assuming current trends kind of play out. We project some near growth on the accrual businesses, as hopefully COVID diminishes a little bit. However, as I've said before, the markets near could be somewhat volatile. So, a little bit hard to predict as you well know. But I'm looking -- we're looking at stabilization as we come through the end of the year here.\nJim Mitchell: Okay. Thank you.\nMark Mason: Yep.\nOperator: Again, please limit your questions to one question and one follow up. Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. My question is for Mike.\nMike Corbat: Good morning.\nMike Mayo: Look, Mike, we've agreed a lot about Citi's improved resiliency. Since you started Citi is simpler, stronger and safer and you look at the CDS spreads. They were four times wider when you came in as CEO and that's progress. But what we've disagreed on is the pace need for more restructuring. And so the question is where is the sense of urgency? Speaking on behalf of investors, people I speak with, there's collective sense of extreme disappointment with technology, the new regulatory order and tech, the route problems were not transparent to investors, but execution, eating go fast enough. And you said this new tech fix will take time on the business mix. Many questions continue on why you have this global consumer footprint, which has terrible efficiency, and returns, worst in class ROTC this quarter 8%. Even if we give you the 12% from last year, that's still below the 19% of JPMorgan this quarter alone. So where is the sense of urgency? So recognizing the improvement that you've had with the balance sheet, but still a long way to go with strategy? Why not step aside now and have the new CEO, Jane Fraser take over as a way to demonstrate the increased sense of urgency. Thank you.\nMike Corbat: Sure. So I would start out, Mike, by saying that I think it is important to the board, it's important to the company that we have a real transition. As you recall, my transition was about five minutes. And as part of this process, I did commit to the board that I'd stay throughout the year and close out the three-year plan, which we announced in 2017. We are starting the transition now. And I think that allows, Jane to be very much involved in terms of our financial plan. And if you recall, when I started, I thought it was important kind of going into the budget and planning process that the CEO own that. I think I was fortunate in terms of my timing of coming in of that being the case. And I think with Jane coming in that will very much be the case. And because she will be accountable for delivering next year and into the future. I think it's also important that Jane has taken on the transformation work and working on the gap analysis and other related things to the Consent Order. As part of that, by the way, Jane continues to have a day job in terms of running consumers. She's also overseeing our return to the office in terms of our North American business. And I think the orderly transition is the right thing to do. I think in terms of the accomplishments, I appreciate what you said in terms of some of the acknowledgement. But again, kind of grounding where we started, net income increased from $7.5 billion to the end of last year north of $19 billion. Our return on assets went from 39 basis points, to right about 100 basis points. So return on tangible common equity, yes, still behind our peers went from 5% to 12%. But went a long way towards closing that gap. We went from returning hardly any capital in 2012 to returning nearly $80 billion over the last six years in returning our share count by about 30%. And so, I don't think you accomplished those things without a sense of commitment and a sense of urgency. And I feel great about the team that's in place and their commitment to that. And so, I think we have made significant progress. And I think Jane's got a foundation to build on from that. And I think she and the team will be kind of focused on those things. And again, I think coming out of COVID, as Mark talked about here or as in when we come out of COVID and the environment, I think there's things that they can take advantage of. And I think they will and I think they'll certainly act with that sense of urgency.\nMike Mayo:\nreins:\nMike Corbat: Well, shareholders absolutely do matter, Mike. And if you've got to look at throughout the firm, whether it's the pay structure, employees and in particular, more highly paid employees getting paid significantly in stock or stock related types of instruments of the different programs and scorecards being very linked to how we perform and the things that hopefully over time drive, share performance. And again, I think there's no one thing in particular. And so I think getting those metrics right is critical, I know the board. I know the compensation committee, all work hard in terms of trying to create that alignment. And again, I think, from a disclosure perspective, we've been kind of very public and transparent in terms of the metrics and the scorecard process that leadership and broader management is held to at the firm.\nMike Mayo: Alright. If I can squeeze in one more just for Mark. I mean, obviously, if disappoint with execution, strategy controls, transparency, but let's just looking forward now with financials. As far as the expenses, Mark, you're already asked about this, you're already spending a billion dollars. You see some of this as a one-year spent. I guess, you have to do a review. So you don't really know the exact spending to fix these problems. But should we think of the billions. We think of $2 billion as a bigger than a breadbox. Again, when we hear it's not a quick fix, and not a easy fix. It's going to take a while. People's imaginations run wild. Is this $10 billion? Is this $5 billion. It's somehow frame this the best that you can. Again, given that you're at the early stages of a more full review?\nMark Mason: Yes. Mike, you know, what I would say is -- look, if you look back, we have been, I think, quite responsible at managing our investments over the past number of years. And what people should expect is that we'll continue to be responsible around that. The second thing I'd say is that these are investments, as I said earlier, I think they are necessary investments to improve the way we operate and our ability to compete. And these are investments that we're going to make, right. It's hard to pinpoint a number as you've said. I would expect, as I mentioned earlier, to an earlier question that we would -- we will continue to increase our profitability. We will continue to improve our returns. But I can't dimension the number for you next year or the year after, except to say, we are still running the firm. We have performed, I think quite well through this crisis. There is still a crisis for us to manage through. And we will continue to do that with a focus on our clients, and responsible management of our overall financials. When we get more clarity on the actual spend, and as we get through the budget that's here, and the response to the order, I'm sure, I'll be able to give you more color on that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. First, thanks for taking my questions. I guess it doesn't sound like, Jane, is on the call, which is fine. It's not surprising. But when should we expect to hear from her in terms of the transition and kind of her thoughts on the regulatory issues and process forward?\nMike Corbat: Yes. I think we should let her kind of get her feet under her and go through some of these processes and get educated and start to form her opinions that I described. And so, we'll probably start to introduce her on the January call in terms of maybe having more view towards a forward look. And then obviously, the quarter after that, she'll have the range.\nMatt O'Connor: That makes sense. And then, understanding that there could be more views in a room, so to speak. But for now, far from addressing the regulatory issues is that a matter of spending money and fixing the processes, did kind of like allude to. There could be some strategic changes. So, is this the business model that you think Citigroup will have going forward? Or more structural changes, potentially coming to address the regulatory issues and better position the company?\nMark Mason: Yes. Let me let me perhaps try and clarify the earlier comments. So to be clear, we have, as Mike described, Consent Order that we need to address. And I think importantly, when you look at that consent order, it is an opportunity for us to take a step back and look at these key processes and the infrastructure controls, compliance activity that support them. So that's kind of one important step that as responsible managers of the franchise we intend to execute against and some of that we've begun already and that was referenced in the consent orders. Separate and away from that what I was alluding to was just simply put the idea that we are in a crisis. And as you go through a crisis, you learn things about your business. And as I mentioned, we talk to clients all the time. They're learning things about their business as they manage through this crisis. We're learning things about and identifying opportunities about our business, for example, the investments that we've made in digital have turned out to be very wise investments as we manage through this crisis. What are the opportunities to accelerate that type of spend as we go forward, given the acceptance of digitization has probably been accelerated by a couple of years now. The importance of revenue mix and growing our fee base revenue or the traction that our wealth management businesses getting in this type of environment, presents opportunities for us to look at how we can expand that aspect of our business and business model. So the crisis will create and has created an opportunity for us to take another look. On top of that, with any new CEO, I think you would expect an opportunity for that person to take a step back and take a look at the business that we have, take a look at the environment that we're playing into, and to make an assessment as to what the right path forward is in light of where we think the growth trajectory is, and where we think the return opportunities are. And so, that is the other leg that would Jane coming in February. I'm sure, she will want to take that opportunity and see what comes of that. So hopefully that clarifies the point.\nMatt O'Connor: Yes. It does. Thanks for the color.\nMark Mason: Yep.\nOperator: Again, ladies and gentlemen, please limit your questions to one question and one follow up. Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: Mark, I apologize. But I'm going to have to re-ask the question that you've been asked many times. And I'm wondering if this could be a successful attempt. But as we think about productivity savings versus investment in risk management for 2021. Is $11.9 billion, or rather $10.9 billion a good starting point in terms of how we should think about quarterly expenses as we think about the next several quarters?\nMark Mason: Well, the expenses that we have in the quarter that you referenced include, obviously a $400 million civil money penalty, that's part of that, that's booked in operating expenses. And in terms of 2021, we're in the midst of constructing our plan right now. And so, hard for me to give you an exact number, or run rate number for you to forecast in 2021. So sorry to disappoint. But I don't have much beyond the way. I've answered that question already.\nErika Najarian: Thanks. And I guess my second question is to Mike. And I think it's always hard to call out competitors by name. But going back to Mike Mayo set of questions, the questions that we as analysts got ever since that journal article came out, is why isn't Citigroup, the new Wells Fargo in terms of regulatory issues. And many investors pointed out that when your consent order came out last week, that the asset cap and business activity limitation for Wells actually came out two years after the consent order. And without listing the things that you've already accomplished, and perhaps just looking forward, how can you reassure your current investors and prospective investors that you're not going down, the same laborious regulatory remediation route as one of your peers, which could clearly be impactful in terms of business activity restrictions?\nMike Corbat: Sure. So I would say, one very important part of that, Erika, is what we spoke about in terms of no widespread customer harm. The company did not profit from the activities. And you can kind of go on with that. I think the second piece is that around customer harm, and around some of those things there were not just Wells Fargo, but there were kind of widespread industry deep dives into sales practices and other pieces in here. I think in this you've seen and we've talked about the four areas of focus. And where we're going to be spending our time. And we've been asked to do the gap analysis. We've obviously been at this for a while, and we will obviously do extensive gap analysis, but I think we've got to get a reasonable idea. And again, we're open to the findings that come from that in terms of the things that need to be done. And I think that, as importantly, in there is kind of the understanding of the process failures that got us here. Again, no fraud, no customer harm, no benefit around that. And if I could just go back and touch on the question that you asked Mark, I think an important way to think about it is historically, you've heard us kind of speak to the way that we've gone at the expense side of things is really working hard to offset the costs that we've been putting out there in terms of some of this transformation work. I think the way you're going to hear us talk about it and the way you should think about is those are separate streams, the remediation work will cost what it will cost. But don't think as a result of that, that there's still not significant work that we recognize, that we can do from a business improvement process. And so, we're not linking the two is those necessarily being offsetting, but we will continue to work on those things to better the efficiencies of the company away from this. I think the second piece is that that while we're not speaking to it, we've referenced it, I think that this work will have, this transformation will have an ROI in terms of what this allows us to do and do differently. We talked about from the client customer perspective, the business process in terms of the way we aggregate data, the way that we kind of move, risk and controls through the firm in a more automated way, we think gives us the ability not just to improve the process, but we do think that over time, we'll have a return in terms of the benefits and costs that are associated with those both directly and indirectly.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolf Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning.\nMike Corbat: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: Well, maybe a question for Mark, pertaining to capital. One of the things that has happened recently is that the advanced CET1 has now become your binding constraint. And one of the key questions that we've been getting and was an expectation that we would see a significant uptick in RWAs relating to operational risks. And it looks like that, generally speaking, there hasn't been much movement in terms of RWA divergence and was hoping you could speak to whether the impact from recent events is fully reflected in that number? Or whether we could see further upward pressure in the fourth quarter?\nMark Mason: Sure, yes, the -- you're speaking to the civil money penalty. The answer is yes. We have reflected our estimates of the impact in the in the RWA for operational risk associated with that. And just given how it falls in terms of the level, the magnitude of the impact relative to other operational risks, there was not a material change in the RWA as a result of it.\nSteven Chubak: Got it. Okay. And then, just one follow up, Mark, related to discussion about profitability targets and the need to -- and the desire to close the gap with peers, and that's still your intent. This year, you plan to do an Investor Day. It was delayed due to COVID, then in the consent order and in a CEO transition. Now is the management team intend to provide refreshed targets in the coming months? And are there any plans to actually hold an Investor Day, so you could provide a more fulsome update? I know, it's challenging to answer without Jane on the call, but we're going to get some perspective as to how we should think about the timing for when we can get at least some updated targets to hold the management team accountable to?\nMark Mason: Yes. Again, that's a -- as you said, that's a tough question to answer. I would like to give obviously, Jane the opportunity to get in the seat and to work through some of the things that Mike has referenced, that I've referenced earlier. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, at least historically in the fourth quarter, we've tried to give you know some context, not only for full year performance, but in terms of what we're seeing in the market going forward. We'll see how this fourth quarter plays out. And then obviously on the fourth quarter earnings call we'll give an updated perspective on what we think performance might look like in 2021 and also the timing for which we can give you a more comprehensive view on how we think about things, how we think about things going forward.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.\nSaul Martinez: Hey guys, good morning.\nMark Mason: Hey, Saul.\nSaul Martinez: I'm sorry, I'm going to beat a dead horse even more here with the consent order and it's a potential applications on cost. But I know, it's hard to know was it the time horizon is around this. And in terms of having more color, and it's clear, you're taking -- you want to take this serious and you're not going to scam. But these processes can be expensive and you have to improve outcomes in the short term, and then as expensive, but build more systematic solutions to the operational risk efficiencies, which require longer term investments and whatnot. So, with all of that, how -- I mean, when do you think you will know what you're up against. And when I say, what you're up against, I mean, meaning, not only the incremental expenses, and I'm not just talking about things -- which is in absolute terms, how much you're going to have to spend to fix these issues and the time horizon to fix these issues? When do you think you'll have better handle on the multitude of different dimensions to this?\nMark Mason: Yes. So let me try and go at this again. So look, we spend, call it $42 billion to $43 billion a year in terms of total expenses. You've heard me reference, about $9 billion of that is associated with technology. And maybe half of whatever is associated with kind of compensation. But I highlight that to say that we obviously have a large expense base, one that we've been managing very, very diligently over the past number of years. And with that expense base, there are a couple of different areas that I think are useful to point out as we think about the incremental need. So one is the billion plus and incremental spend that we've made. And as I mentioned earlier, the opportunity to re-spend those dollars, to reprioritize, those dollars. There's also spend that we make on the current operations and infrastructure, that we make every year. And that too, I think, will give us an opportunity to re-look at that spend, that base, and reprioritize that spent, right? So there are multiple categories where we can re-point if you will to a better approach, if you will of addressing what's been highlighted in the order. And it's not until we kind of work through the incremental that's already in there, the base that rolls off and gives us an opportunity to re-spend that we then are faced with, okay, what more is required around the investment. Now, a couple percentage points of an increase is pretty significant in the way of absolute dollars that can be put to work on these types of initiatives. In terms of the when -- well, let me have one of them. And the second thing I'd highlight is, as Mike pointed out, separate and away from the required spend to address the opportunity or the investment and infrastructure risk and controls, there also remains opportunities for us to look at our data centers for us to look at, where we have -- to ensure the right placement of people around the organization. So our footprint for us to look at some of the roll off from some of the COVID spend that we've had to make this year. So there are other opportunities for us to look at dollars that we have let alone capacity adjustments that may be warranted coming out of this COVID-19. And so my -- what I'm trying to highlight is that there are many puts and takes through the budget process that we're constructing now. And the process that we will use to dimension the spend associated with this order. In terms of timing, the order actually points out that we've got some 120 days or so to identify the gap, a gap between our current state and an end state target. And then some 90 days or so to develop and have a plan approved after which we can move towards executing or continuing to execute against. And so, that gives you some sense for how we're thinking about the timing and the dimensioning of this. But again, I think we've got a track record now as has been pointed out of being very thoughtful and responsible around investment dollars and our total expense base and you and others and shareholders should expect that we will continue to be disciplined and responsible as it relates to that. And again, as I mentioned earlier, we're looking to improve profitability and returns as we do this, right?\nSaul Martinez: Okay. No, that's helpful. And hopefully, they'll be able to succeed on that latter point. Just a quick follow up and a little bit more of a mundane question. I think just more of a correction [ph] or clarification. I think you mentioned, Mark, in the fourth quarter that corporate and other pre tax losses should it be similar to this quarter that I [Indiscernible] with no civil fee in this quarter?\nMark Mason: Sure. So ex the $400 million. So I said roughly the 657 that we see, excluding the $400 million civil money penalty is likely to be the levels that we see in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. Mark, if I could go to a different topic, you mentioned that you don't really expect NCOs to start peeking until the end of next year. So I was just wondering if it's just a time shift difference? And you can just kind of walk us through how you're expecting the loss curve generally to appear over the next year or so? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Yes, sure. So, again, it's -- when you look across the portfolio, we're seeing payment rates coming in higher than we expected. And the consumers are proving to be quite resilient when you think about the stimulus and the forbearance programs that have been in place. And so, as we look at loss curves and delinquency buckets, and what they're suggesting, over the next number of quarters, it looks as though the aggregate level, we're likely to see -- we're likely to see losses towards the fourth quarter or back end of 2021. Obviously, assumptions around GDP, assumptions around unemployment, all of those factors come into play. But that is in fact, what we're seeing. That's going to vary by regions. And so, in Asia. in LatAm, we may see that earlier, but what I was referencing on the back end was kind of when you look at the aggregate portfolio.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Okay. And if I could follow up on a question on just taxes, obviously, when taxes went down, you guys had to write down the DTA. And just in terms of the outlook, at least, from what we know, about a potential rise to 28%, depending on the outcome of the election, and the eventual plans. Any ideas of what type of impact a directional change might have to the others to the positive in terms of either tax rate, and being able to write back up the DTA?\nMark Mason: Sure. So, hard to know exactly what happens, but in the event that we did see, or we do see a tax rate increase to 28% or so, and it went into effect in the latter part of 2021. It would likely result in our DTA increasing by about $4 billion. So, a one time increase in our detail about $4 billion. And obviously would have the impact of our rate being close to that level, our tax rate being close to that level. And as a result of that, less income given the higher tax rate and less income contributing to the CET1 ratio. And then, in terms of the disallowed DTA, with a higher corporate tax rate, we would expect to return to our usage levels of roughly a billion dollars per year. So that gives you a little bit of a sense of a couple of the moving pieces should that happen.\nMike Corbat: And Mark, I think an important nuance there is what comes out between remaining territorial or a reversion to global taxation. I think what people are talking about today is it would likely remain territorial, which, again with a average global tax rate of about 25%, that would certainly benefit us in some of the jurisdictions that we operate in.\nKen Usdin: That's a good point. Yep.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Good. Thanks. One quick question first on the NII. I heard you saying that, its going to be stabilizing after the fourth quarter as you look out to 2021. But you kind of just outlined some of the factors that are leading to that stability? Then what gives you confidence that it's actually stable off that level? Did you think about the potential for stimulus and maybe further consumer deleveraging if we get stimulus in that statement? Thanks.\nMike Corbat: Yes. And so, look, again, that is that is based on kind of current trends that we're seeing in terms of roughly include improving unemployment and improving GDP. Obviously, there is talk of another stimulus in terms of its impact. We've assumed that kind of a bit later in terms of in the first quarter of 2021. It does assume that we continue to see the purchase sales activity improved quarter over quarter. We've seen some of that certainly in Q3. We continue to see that as we look even in the early days of October. And so that playing out would be another important factor. And then obviously, what happens in terms of the overall liquidity that's in the market is a factor that influences mix and the NIM as well.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: So maybe the second question on the NIM. I mean, if you think about the yield on the earning asset side, I mean, are you getting closer to the top yields as you think about the repricing cycle? And where rates are stabilized at a low level? So are you kind of expecting earning asset yields to be closer to the bottom as well? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Yes. So look, in terms of the in terms of the NIM, we've seen some of the -- obviously, the pressure from rates. We've seen the pressure in terms of the market, in terms of the mix of assets that we have, but also pressure in terms of the deposit levels coming in quite high with a, frankly a lack of loan demand to put that to work. And so, subject to how that liquidity that's in the market evolves. And what happens with ultimate asset pricing is going to have an important factor on that. The NIM is really an output of how those near [ph] revenues play out and how the balance sheet evolves. And so, a bit of continued uncertainty a little bit in terms of how some of those market factors play out, but we see that as well stabilizing towards the end of the year.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler.\nJeff Harte: Good afternoon, guys. Unfortunately, I have one more consent order kind of related question. Do you have a feel for regulators views on the adequacy of existing remediation projects that have been underway versus just not having moved fast enough?\nMike Corbat: Sure. So I would say that not have moved fast enough, and not have been holistic enough, Jeff, to use my words. And so again, I think this gap analysis will give us a better sense of that. But again, as I said, we've brought others in to help us look at and think about these things. And so again, we'll see what the final analysis yields. But I think we've got a sense of the right approach and direction.\nJeff Harte: Not necessarily starting over?\nMike Corbat: Broadly defined no. There may be some more refined areas where it may make sense to do that, but not broadly. And again, I think if you look at kind of how -- as an example, we've kind of managed through this crisis, which I think is a good real life live test. Again, I think we've been able to get the data. We've been able to make the right decisions. We've been able to act in a timely manner. But again, I think this pandemic has shown us the accelerated move to digital, and the ability to continue to work remotely or more remotely over time and the ability to make faster and better decisions as critical and in particular, as I think appropriately our regulators continue to raise the bar on the larger institutions, in terms of their expectations.\nJeff Harte: Okay. And just kind of something fundamental. Mexico is a relatively large exposure for Citigroup and the geography upon which the market has some macroeconomic concerns. Can you talk a bit about the credit related trends you're specifically seeing down in the business in Mexico? And currently what your expectations are? How much things like deferrals has helped down there?\nMike Corbat: Yes, sure. So I mean, look, Mexico, similar to other parts of the world also had forbearance, as part of the program although, unlike the U.S. the in Mexico, customers needed to be less than 30 days past due as of the end of February to be eligible. And so what we, what we saw is that, when you look at our loss rates for the quarter, you see a tick up in Latin America largely driven by Mexico and the impact of those customers kind of playing through the delinquency buckets and into losses. That said, Mexico also comes with a, higher NIM in the way of -- in the way of overall performance. And we would expect for losses there to certainly come to a peak of sooner than the end of 2021. In terms of more broadly our exposure, in Mexico is about $57 billion in terms of total country exposure, and that's down a little bit since the second quarter. At the end of the third quarter, about $30 billion of loans between, GCB and ICG. In Mexico, 13 or consumer loans about 16 are corporate loans. And about half of that 13, a little bit more than half is in credit card and in personal loans. And remember, we tend to target a higher quality customer segment than most of our peers there, and we price the risk accordingly. And so, we would expect for that to play out in a relatively favorable way. And then there's another 81% of our payroll loans in the portfolio are concentrated in sectors that have a lower risk of layoffs, like government, employers, and pensioners. And so that too, should be helpful as we think about the quality of our book. And then there's the portion that's in mortgages is it weights towards LTVs of 50%, less than 50%. And so that, too, should speak to the quality of our books. So overall, we feel as though we're appropriately reserved, and are managing reasonable levels of performance there.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.\nCharles Peabody: Yes, I just had some follow up questions on net interest, revenue guidance. You kept using the word stabilization as we entered 2021. So my first question is, does that imply further weakness in the fourth quarter before it stabilizes? And then the related question on page 11, you show the mix of net interest revenue between the core bank and then the markets related? You saw a big drop in the markets related net interest revenue. And I was wondering if you can talk about what drove that in is, which of those pieces to expect to stabilize first?\nMike Corbat: Yes, and so just to be to be clear, the stabilization that I was referring to is kind of as we go into the fourth quarter and so I\u2019d expect net interest revenue to stabilize in the, in the fourth quarter for total Citi. And for many of the factors that I mentioned already. Look, the markets revenue as you've heard me mentioned before, it's really important to look at total revenue. The total revenue there in part because the nature of how transactions are structured with clients impacts, whether that revenues coming in the form of near and non near. And so, I think it's very important to, as I mentioned, look at total revenue there. And our total revenue in the quarter, as you mentioned, as I mentioned earlier, is up in terms of in total markets revenue, in light of the strong, fixed income, and the strong equities performance that we saw there. And so, that that part is lower than the prior quarter as we see some of that normalization in markets take place, but still very strong in light of the environment that we're managing through and candidly, as we go into a fourth quarter with an election and in the case of Europe, Brexit and speculation around the stimulus and uncertainty around vaccines, hard to predict exactly how customers clients decide to reposition their books, as some of those things become clearer. And so total revenue in the way of markets revenue is the way we think about it, and a fourth quarter that I think will show near revenue stabilizing, but keep in mind, markets performance, will have will likely have puts and takes.\nCharles Peabody: And my follow up question, let me just ask that same question about mix between markets related NII and core bank. Would you expect the core bank NII to actually grow in the fourth quarter sequentially?\nMike Corbat: I would expect? Well again, I would expect that our fourth quarter will show net interest revenues and non-net interest revenues kind of down year-over-year. But the aggregate of the two, relatively stable.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja: Thanks for taking my questions.\nMike Corbat: Good morning.\nVivek Juneja: Morning, Mike. On the whole regulatory issue, it\u2019s quite disappointing to read in the consent orders of the incentive comp, did not account for risk management and the comments about the practices that the regulator's made. Given that what changes should we expect, in senior management incentive comp? And, can you talk about why you didn't prioritize risk management, which is such a cornerstone since the last crisis? And what changes should we expect in the board, as well as other senior executives, as a result?\nMike Corbat: So the notion of accountability. And I think what they're speaking to goes more broad than just the executive management team. But obviously, you've got a number of work streams here, you've got a fair number of people involved in those processes. And it's kind of taking it down and kind of making sure that the people who are responsible for each of those processes have the appropriate waiting. And I think the challenge comes that in many of the instances or in many of the work streams, you actually have people that it isn't, it isn't their sole job. They are a practicing expert, or practicing practitioner in terms of the markets business or in consumer or in different functions. And we have seconded [Ph] them as part of their job into doing this regulatory work, because they, they're the expert. They're the area through which a number of these things would flow. And the question is, how do you create the proper balance and proper accountability around that? So I don't look at it and say that it's executives, just the executive team. I think it's striking the right balance. And so as an example, should someone in risk be responsible for delivering on financials of the firm profitability expenses, or are there pieces that are in there? And so I think it's kind of creating the right balance to drive the right behaviors, get the right outcomes and -- in people in both directions properly. So again, I think that it's the way it's written, it's my interpretation is actually broader than the way you've described it.\nVivek Juneja: And so does that mean, you'll be adding more people do you think as a result to be able to hold some people fully responsible for this? So how are you thinking as you look forward?\nMike Corbat: Well, we have in risk and controls we've been, we've added thousands of people since the beginning of the year, and we were adding people last year to these projects. So without a doubt, we've been bringing those resources and getting that expertise in and we've tried to bring in subject matter experts, from other firms from other industries to help us as we think about these things, and I think we've made a number of very key strong external hires. I think we've made some very strong internal moves in terms of people and I think we've also moved strongly in terms of what I would say single adding people i.e. making this remediation, not just their primary, but in many case their sole responsibility in terms of delivering on. So again, yes, we're absolutely committed to having the right resources, the right expertise, the right talent, and then having the right accountability around delivering against this.\nVivek Juneja: And Mike, you may have mentioned, but Karen Peetz obviously we brought in as the CAO, and to help kind of, to help kind of lead in this transformation, across the organization. So as you say, we're bringing in the people that we need and getting after it.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning. Good morning. Yes so, like you just mentioned, Karen was brought in June. And Mike, I know you became CEO of the Citibank USA, like literally back in June timeframe. So I guess I'm kind of looking at all this thinking, you must have expected, you've been working on this for a while, and I was, I was thinking you probably expected some kind of requirement from the regulators, that you were already partially executing on is that fair? Like, is this consent order, might be a surprise to the street, but is it really a surprise to you?\nMike Corbat: Well, around these, around these work streams, as we've acknowledged, we have been working on them for a while. So it's not like, all of a sudden, we woke up one day and said, gee, we're going to, we're going to go at some of these things as de novo or new project. So we've been working on them for a while. And I would say that, again, what we've been focused on is really bringing these projects together. I would say a historic approach that we've taken as we've gone at these, in some ways serially or individually, and I don't think that has yielded the outcomes that either I either Citi or regulators necessarily would want. And so as we went down this path, it became apparent to me and I think the board and others that we needed to really join these processes and create a body to be able to go at it. And I think we're very fortunate to have Karen with us who has been through some of this and have this expertise to be able to, I think bring these work streams together. Because when you think about data as an example, data feeds through risk, data feeds through compliance, data feeds through lots of your controls, and making sure that we're taking a holistic approach to the way that we go at and modernize our data approach is critical. So that we do it once, we do it right, we do it, we do it holistically. And so again, I don't think the word for some of the work streams are new. I think the broader, more encompassing, holistic approach, in some areas is newer.\nMark Mason: And Mike, just to that point in terms of us having started this already, again, the incremental billion we're spending, we're not -- we started spending that at the beginning of the year, right. And we spent incremental dollars in 2019 as well. And by the way, that billion dollars wasn't something that I kept, it was what do we think is required to make as much traction as we can in the year and we're spending that incremental billion dollars and still managing our total expenses responsibly. Alright.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes, it's interesting point, cause, when I look at the stock. I'm looking at a stock that's priced for, effectively a 5% ROE. Okay? And if you say, hey, that is right because the expenses are going to go up that much to drive a 5% ROE. That's like a 5 billion increase in expenses. And Mark to your point earlier, you were mentioning that you're planning on -- are hoping to execute this improving profitability, which is obviously above 5% today. So could you help us understand what kinds of profit improvements you think you can, focus on over the course of the next couple of years? I mean, I'm wondering, what some big threads are? Is it? Is it better deposit, core deposits that can bring down your cost of funds? Is it greater execution with your current customer base? Is it incremental customers, help us understand what you're thinking about there?\nMike Corbat: Yes, look there. There are multiple components to it right there. There are additional linkages that we try to capture across our franchises whether it's doing more with our TTS clients. I mentioned earlier that we are seeing a lot of traction as a relates to instant payment capabilities, whether it's doing more between our capital markets business and in spread products and trade lending that we do with corporate law clients in terms of unique structuring opportunities there. And so, there are linkages opportunities across the franchise that we will continue to capture that I think will help in the way of top line performance. There are opportunities to grow in the wealth management space, more where we\u2019ve seen 16% growth and investments in Asia this quarter, we think there's more, we think there's more upside, we think there's more wealth growth, upside in the U.S. as well. But there are also operational benefits from again, when, when we say manual activity, when you replace manual activity with an improved technology, or an automation or straight through processing, you remove the manual, removing the manual improves the quality of the output in a more timely fashion. But it also over time is less costly when you don't have those manual steps. And so I say improved profitability as we go into 2021 and 2022 and beyond in part in getting both top line, ultimately getting expense benefits from a host of activities, including capacity adjustments that we may decide to take as we come out of this crisis. And then the other, the other items play through as well, including cost of credit, and so on and so forth.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Mike.\nMark Mason: Good Morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Mark, you've given us some good detail on the consumer portfolios. Can you share with us on the commercial side, when you look at your ratings that you give us in terms of investment grade to BB, B, CCC, they really haven't moved very much since the fourth quarter of 2019. So can you share with us what you're seeing in these portfolios, and what are the energy portfolios and the leisure and hospitality travel portfolios, still the ones that give you the most risk course, you see the most risk in terms of credit losses over the next 12 months or so?\nMark Mason: Yes, yes, sure Gerard. Let me let me start by saying, as you know, we have coming out of the last crisis, we have really adjusted our risk framework, our risk appetite, we have rethought our client focus to ensure that we're focused on clients that can take best advantage of the breadth of our offering, but also on the multinational investment grade type clients. And so we have maintained a skew in terms of ratings towards, 80% or so of our portfolio, being in those investment grade names. We've got a long history of, operating in all of these sectors that you that you see on page 23. And we've got, deep experience through cycles, and expertise in each of these industries, and that includes client selection. And in many instances, we are banking many of the leaders in their respective industries. And, it's important to note that because I think that speaks to not only the quality of the name, but what we can expect when you go through downturns, and it speaks to why we're so committed to staying alongside our clients and helping them manage through the uncertainty. When I think about some of the sectors that we point to in this crisis, we've been thoughtful about the way we have dealt with these clients over time. So you look at the aviation space, and our exposures there tend to be secured. They tend to we have extensive experience with structuring to mitigate risk there, whether that's secured or guaranteed by export credit agencies. We've got extensive experience with valuation of collateral there. You look at autos and in many cases; the lending there is in securitization vehicles. So, the risk of bankruptcy is remote and with underlying consume obligors in that case. You look at energy and a lot of that is reserved based lending with borrow -- borrowing basis that go through a periodic redetermination. And that helps in terms of reducing exposure when oil prices fall. And so you look at these you look at our activity with these clients in these sectors, our deep experience, and we think that it positions us as well to manage through this with them. And certainly feel good about the reserves that we have. And we have taken proactive actions. In the pre-crisis we went through exposure reductions, just given where we were in the cycle. And we've aggressively downgraded names that are in impacting sectors early in the crisis and put enhanced monitoring in place. But as I mentioned, we feel we feel good about the portfolio we have, we feel good about the reserves that we have, and we feel good about our ability to manage through this with these clients.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over for any closing remarks.\nElizabeth Lynn: Thank you all for joining today. Please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations if you have any additional questions. Thank you again and have a nice day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may",

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on slide three, Citigroup reported third quarter net income of $3.2 billion, which included a modest increase in credit reserves of roughly $300 million this quarter. Reported results also include the $400 million civil money penalty in connection with the consent orders that Mike just mentioned, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.19. For the quarter, revenues of $17.3 billion declined 7% from the prior year. While trading and investment banking remains strong, this is more than offset by the combined impact of lower interest rates and lower levels of activity in consumer. Expenses were up 5% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment. Credit cost of $2.3 billion were meaningfully lower relative to the first half of the year. Our effective tax rate was 20% for the third quarter. Looking at year-to-date results, we delivered net income of over $7 billion, even as we increase credit reserves by roughly $11 billion. We grew revenues by 3% predominantly reflecting continued strength in our markets and investment banking businesses, while expenses increased 1% year-over-year, allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and a 6% increase in operating margin. In constant dollars, end of period loans declined 4% year-over-year to $667 billion, reflecting a higher level of repayments across institutional and consumer, as well as a slowdown in draws in our institutional businesses, and lower spending activity in consumer. Deposits grew 16% with consistent client engagement, reflecting the benefits of our global platform across both the institutional and consumer franchises, which also serve to strengthen our available liquidity. And three quarters of the way through the year, we continue to manage well through this crisis, with significant capital and liquidity, as well as a significant cushion in the form of credit reserves. As of September 30, our CET1 Capital ratio was 11.8% close to 200 basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement. We have over $950 billion in available liquidity. We have more than doubled credit reserves since the end of last year. Today, they stand at nearly $29 billion, and including the modest increase taking this quarter, our reserve ratio was roughly stable at 4% on funded loans. And as we discussed last quarter, we feel good about our ability to continue to support our clients as we all manage through this crisis. On slide four, we provide additional detail on reserving action so far this year. As a reminder, these reserves include our estimate of lifetime credit losses tied to a specific base scenario, as well as a management adjustment for economic uncertainty, which provides some room in the event of a more adverse outcome. In the first quarter, our base scenario reflected a short lived downturn followed by recovery in the back half of 2020 with unemployment falling to 7% by year end, and full year GDP close to prior year levels. By the end of the second quarter our base case assumed a more severe and protracted downturn this year, but with a sharper recovery into next year. And now you can see we are expecting a somewhat more muted and slower recovery in both unemployment and GDP through 2022. I would note, however, that our forward looking view on a rolling 13 quarter basis in unemployment, as an example, is continuing to improve as we move further beyond the peak of the crisis. And outlook for other variables like VIX and oil prices is also important and generally improved this quarter. So on a net basis we did not see a significant impact on reserves from the change in our base macro outlook this quarter. But we did add to our management adjustment for economic uncertainty, which grew from $2.3 billion to $3.1 billion during the quarter, partially offset by lower loan volumes and other small items. Today, we are factoring in a downside scenario that is more adverse relative to our base case. For example, we are incorporating a more significant deterioration in U.S. GDP growth rates, which is now close to 9% lower than our base case in 2021 versus our second quarter outlook that was only 1% lower than the base case. So all else being equal, if the management adjustment had not changed, we would have seen a reserve release of roughly $500 million in the quarter. Looking at the level of reserves we hold today, we believe that we're well prepared for expected credit losses, having reserved for something worse than our base case. And given the lifetime nature of the CECL methodology and the conservative nature of our management adjustment, it is now more likely than not that we'll see reserve releases and our ACL come down in 2021 to offset future losses as we continue to progress through the crisis, assuming our base case holds. Although this may be offset somewhat as we would likely need to build additional reserves to cover future loan growth as the economy recovers and we support our client's needs. Turning now to each business. Slide five shows the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars. GCB delivered EBIT of $1.4 billion. While revenues remain under pressure, credit costs were down considerably this quarter, reflecting a small ACL release, and lower net credit losses in particular in the U.S., where we're seeing a continued benefit from government stimulus and other relief. Revenues declined 12% as continued strong deposit growth and momentum in Asia, wealth management was more than offset by lower card volumes and lower interest rates across all regions, and expenses decreased 2% as lower volume related expenses, reduction in marketing and other discretionary spending, and efficiency savings were partially offset by increases in COVID-19 related expenses. Slide six shows the results for North American consumer in more detail. Total third quarter revenues of $4.5 billion were down 13% from last year. Branded Cards revenues of $2.1 billion were down 12%, reflecting lower purchase sales and lower average loans. As seen across the industry purchase sales have continued to recover during the third quarter of 16% sequentially, but still down 9% versus last year. At the same time, we're seeing an increase in payment rates as consumers remain liquid and we have not yet seen stress and their overall ability to pay. So while purchase activity has improved, our clients are also paying down more quickly resulting in pressure on our loan balances. This is creating a revenue headwind, but it is also benefiting cost of credit as delinquencies and losses have outperformed our initial expectations for 2020. Retail services revenues of $1.4 billion were down 21% year-over-year, reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments. Net interest revenues were down 16% as average loans declined by 10% on lower purchase sales activity and higher payment rates. Similar to Branded Card, purchase sales recovered sequentially this quarter up 18%, but remained down 8% year-over-year. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower loss expectations in 2020, and therefore higher income sharing. During the quarter, we launched a new digital credit card program with Wayfair. With this partnership, we further diversified our portfolio with a leading e-commerce retailer and now provide half of the top 10 U.S. e-commerce companies in 2020 with consumer credit card programs. Retail banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 2% year-over-year as strong deposit growth and higher mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Average deposits were up 19% including 26% growth and checking. We saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales with more than two thirds coming from customers outside of our branch footprint. And we will continue to look for opportunities to deepen our relationships with these customers, including through our investments in digital wealth capabilities. Total expenses for North American consumer were down 3% year-over-year, as we managed our marketing and other discretionary expenses, while recognizing efficiency savings and lower volume related costs, which more than offset incremental COVID-19 related expenses. Total credit cost of $1.2 billion decreased 23% from last year, reflecting lower net credit losses as well as a modest reserve release. On slide seven, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 13% year-over-year in the third quarter. Cards revenues declined by 23% reflecting lower activity levels with purchase sales down 17% year-over-year. We're continuing to see a disproportionate impact on Asia card revenues from the decline in travel spending, including lower travel related interchange and foreign transaction fees. However, our strength and wealth management continued. We saw record investment revenues this quarter up 16% reflecting continued strong client engagement with 7% growth in Citi gold clients and 13% growth in net new money versus last year. And average deposit growth remains strong at 13% this quarter. Turning to Latin America, total consumer revenues declined 10% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw a good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter, with average balances of 13%. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending revenues were impacted by branch closures and a continued decline in the macro environment. In total, operating expenses for our International consumer business were down 1% in the third quarter, reflecting efficiency, savings and lower volume related expenses. And cost of credit declined to $392 million, with lower net credit losses and a modest reserve released this quarter, reflecting a change in accounting for third party collection fees. Slide eight provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. As I noted earlier, credit trends remain broadly stable to improving this quarter, given high levels of liquidity in the U.S. lower spending and the benefits of relief programs. However, we do expect losses to begin to rise next year and likely peak towards the end of 2021 as government stimulus and other programs roll off, and unemployment remains elevated. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide nine, ICG delivered EBIT of $3.7 billion this quarter and $10.8 billion year-to-date. Revenues of $10.4 billion increased 5% in the third quarter, as strong performance in fixed income and equity markets, investment banking and the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in TTS, corporate lending and security services. In the third quarter, we continue to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses given our highly differentiated global platform, our progress in creating new digital solutions for clients and our full service model which allows us to capture natural linkages that exist across the franchise. Turning now to the results for the businesses, starting with banking. Total banking revenues of $5.3 billion declined 2%. Treasury and trade solution revenues of $2.4 billion were down 6% as reported, and 4% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates, and lower commercial cards revenues. Our average deposits were up 26% in constant dollars, and we had solid growth and underlying drivers despite the significant macro slowdown. One example of the continued client engagement that we have seen is in instant payments, where we are now live in 26 countries and have seen significant client demand for these capabilities. Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were up 13% from last year, reflecting solid growth in capital markets and continued share gains. Capital Markets continue to be extremely strong equity underwriting in particular, which allowed us to continue to support our clients in raising liquidity through IPOs, convertibles and follow on offerings. Private Bank revenues of $938 million grew 8% driven by strong client engagement, particularly in capital markets, as well as improved managed investments, revenues, and higher lending. Corporate lending revenues of $538 million were down 25% as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. And while we continue to provide new loans and facilitate additional draws, we also saw significant repayments as we helped our investment grade client access capital markets, which led to the decline in end of period loans. Total markets and security services revenue of $5.2 billion increased 16% year-over-year. And as we've seen over the prior two quarters, we continue to actively make markets for both our corporate and investor clients as we help them navigate through the continued uncertain environment. Fixed Income revenues of $3.8 billion grew 18% driven by strong performance across spread products and commodities. Equities revenues of $875 million were up 15% versus last year, as solid performance in cash equities and derivatives, reflecting strong client volumes and more favorable market conditions were partially offset by lower revenues in prime finance. And finally, in security services, revenues were down 5% on a reported basis, and 4% in constant dollars, as higher deposit volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. Total operating expenses of $5.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year, reflecting continued investments in infrastructure, risk management and controls as well as higher compensation costs. Total credit costs of $838 million were up meaningfully from last year, although down significantly on a sequential basis. We built $529 million in reserves this quarter. The increase is largely due to continued uncertainty in the economic environment going forward. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.8% including 5.7% on the non-investment grade portion. Total net credit losses were $326 million. Finally, total non-accrual loans declined roughly $400 million sequentially to $3.6 billion, reflecting write-offs and repayments across the portfolio. Slide 10 shows results for Corporate/Other. Revenues declined significantly from last year reflecting the wind down of legacy assets and the impact of lower rates, as well as marks on securities. Expenses were up as the wind down of legacy assets was more than offset by investments in infrastructure, risk management and controls, incremental costs associated with COVID-19 and the $400 million civil money penalty that I mentioned earlier. Excluding the onetime impact of the penalty, the pre-tax loss for corporate/other was $657 million this quarter. And looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect a similar quarterly pre-tax loss. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.5 billion this quarter declined $930 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances partially offset by higher trading related NIR. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $670 million driven by lower loan balances as well as lower trading related NIR and net interest margin declined 14 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenues. Turning to non-interest revenues. In the third quarter, non-NIR declined 2% to $6.8 billion given lower levels of consumer activity, partially offset by strong trading and investment banking revenues year-over-year. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect the continuation of these dynamics with both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues down year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19 as well as the normalization in trading and investment banking activity. On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 Capital ratio improved to 11.8% driven by net income, our supplementary leverage ratio was 6.8%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 4% to $71.95 driven by net income. Before I conclude, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fourth quarter. On the top line, we expect to see continued pressure and consumer reflecting the impact of rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19. And we would also expect the low rate environment to continue to weigh on our cool businesses in ICG. Our markets and investment banking businesses should reflect broader industry trends. In total, we expect this to result in full year revenues that are roughly flat, with the decline in net interest revenues, more or less offset by non-interest revenues on a full year basis consistent with prior guidance. On the expense side, we remain focused on protecting our employees and supporting our customers. We are making targeted investments in the franchise where we see the best opportunities for the future. And we are accelerating investments to achieve excellence in our risk and control environment and enhance our operations for a fully digital world. As a result, we could see expenses that are up a couple percent or so on a full year basis. Turning to credit. As I mentioned already, if our macro outlook holds, we wouldn't expect additional reserve builds. But given the remaining uncertainty, we are also unlikely to see any material releases this quarter. And for the fourth quarter, we would expect a level of losses similar to those seen this quarter. In summary, the environment remains challenging this quarter, but we continue to perform well. Year-to-date, we have demonstrated the significant earnings power of the franchise, we ended the quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position. Overall client engagement remains strong. We grew book value this quarter, and we have remained focused on supporting employees, customers, clients and communities. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. John, this is Mark, can you hear me? Yes, we did hear the question. I think Mike's mic may be muted -- you muted. Yes, yes, we can hear you now. Thanks, John. So the answer -- the answer is yes. I mean, our intent is over time to continue to narrow the gap to continue to increase profitability, improve returns over time and so that that hasn't changed. With every -- with every crisis, in some ways comes a unique opportunity. And that is a unique opportunity to take a hard look at your business model and you see corporations around the world having to think through that as they manage through this crisis and similarly, we will with the benefit of a new incoming CEO, and as well as managing through this crisis, we'll continue to look at our business model, continue to look at our strategy, and see what makes sense as we come out of this, and how we can best capture opportunities to serve our clients. Yes, sure. In terms of the first question, as you heard me mentioned before, we're spending more than a $1 billion in terms of incremental spend in 2020. That is split between Corporate as well as some of the other businesses depending on the nature of the spend. I would expect that as we go forward it would be a similar dynamic, again, depending on the nature of the spend would be booked in Corporate/Other or in some of the respective or one of the respective businesses. To give a quick example, in some of the consulting spend that we do, that is meant to help scope out and state vision or a key process, for example, we'd likely book that in Corporate/Other, it would serve to benefit the entire franchise. And so that's just one example. In terms of capital actions, going forward, there's nothing in the Consent Order that prevents us from making capital action decisions, and taking capital action decisions going forward. And so, we would expect that we'd be able to act similarly to our peers as we come out of this crisis. Yes. So look, there are a couple of different dynamics that I think are important. I think the key one you hit on, which is we're still in the midst of a crisis. And so, we're very much still seeing pressure on purchase sales. It's better than it was in the prior quarters, but there certainly is still pressure there. We're seeing that across the franchise. One of the big drags this quarter you see is retail services. That's in part tied to the partner and revenue sharing that we have with partners where an improved forecast in loss expectations ends up resulting in us sharing more revenues with the partners. But the dynamic that's important to watch as this plays through is how unemployment, how GDP evolves, and what that means in the way of purchase activity starting to pick up. And that's going to be an important factor. We are keeping a close watch on that. We have dialed back advertising, marketing spend about cons et cetera, et cetera, and we want to be thoughtful about when we leg back in as we see signs of things turning. And so, we keep a close watch on that. We don't want to be late to that. And we'll be very proactive at getting after it where it makes sense and testing it where we think we're seeing good signals that warrant us increasing some of that spend to drive some of the future volume activity that we see. But as of right now, we're seeing the pressure on volumes. That's really a direct byproduct of the crisis we're managing through. Yep. Yes. So look, I think that -- as I mentioned, we've got an incremental spend of about a $1 billion this year that has gone towards infrastructure, risk and controls. We started that incremental spend path if you will in 2019. So to some extent in our run rate is more spend towards those types of activities. There will be an opportunity to look at that spend, the billion dollars and recalibrate it or point it in a different direction or reprioritize the spend. There's some of it that is a one-year spend that we'll have an opportunity to spend again, so to speak as we get into 2021 and we'll take advantage of that opportunity. The order requires, I think a very important step, which is that we step back and come up with a target and state vision for some of these key processes, and the risk management and controls that incompliance around them. And I highlight that step, because we need to do that in order to appropriately dimension the reprioritization of the spend we already have in our expense space, and what incremental spend is necessary. And so, we'll do that over the time period that's been allotted to us over within the order. It is an investment. And I highlight that, because many of the things that Mike described in terms of automation, in terms of reduced manual touch points, in terms of straight through processing. Many of those things will yield benefits in the way we run our organization, in the way we not only improve our operations, but in the way we're able to go to market and compete and serve our clients. And so, I do expect benefits to accrue from these investments down the line. And we will separate and away from that, because I won't compromise the dollars needed in order to make those improvements in those investments. Separate and away from that, we will continue to be responsible managers of the firm. And that means, ensuring that we look across the franchise and make sure -- and to ensure that we're spending wisely. Yes. So look, I mean, there are obviously a lot of factors that played through the quarter and 2020, the combination of not only rates, but the volumes that had played through are all important factors here, let alone the amount of liquidity that's in the market, and the impact that has on the balance sheet. I'd expect for near to stabilize and stay relatively flat as we go into the remainder of the year, assuming current trends kind of play out. We project some near growth on the accrual businesses, as hopefully COVID diminishes a little bit. However, as I've said before, the markets near could be somewhat volatile. So, a little bit hard to predict as you well know. But I'm looking -- we're looking at stabilization as we come through the end of the year here. Yep. Yes. Mike, you know, what I would say is -- look, if you look back, we have been, I think, quite responsible at managing our investments over the past number of years. And what people should expect is that we'll continue to be responsible around that. The second thing I'd say is that these are investments, as I said earlier, I think they are necessary investments to improve the way we operate and our ability to compete. And these are investments that we're going to make, right. It's hard to pinpoint a number as you've said. I would expect, as I mentioned earlier, to an earlier question that we would -- we will continue to increase our profitability. We will continue to improve our returns. But I can't dimension the number for you next year or the year after, except to say, we are still running the firm. We have performed, I think quite well through this crisis. There is still a crisis for us to manage through. And we will continue to do that with a focus on our clients, and responsible management of our overall financials. When we get more clarity on the actual spend, and as we get through the budget that's here, and the response to the order, I'm sure, I'll be able to give you more color on that. Yes. Let me let me perhaps try and clarify the earlier comments. So to be clear, we have, as Mike described, Consent Order that we need to address. And I think importantly, when you look at that consent order, it is an opportunity for us to take a step back and look at these key processes and the infrastructure controls, compliance activity that support them. So that's kind of one important step that as responsible managers of the franchise we intend to execute against and some of that we've begun already and that was referenced in the consent orders. Separate and away from that what I was alluding to was just simply put the idea that we are in a crisis. And as you go through a crisis, you learn things about your business. And as I mentioned, we talk to clients all the time. They're learning things about their business as they manage through this crisis. We're learning things about and identifying opportunities about our business, for example, the investments that we've made in digital have turned out to be very wise investments as we manage through this crisis. What are the opportunities to accelerate that type of spend as we go forward, given the acceptance of digitization has probably been accelerated by a couple of years now. The importance of revenue mix and growing our fee base revenue or the traction that our wealth management businesses getting in this type of environment, presents opportunities for us to look at how we can expand that aspect of our business and business model. So the crisis will create and has created an opportunity for us to take another look. On top of that, with any new CEO, I think you would expect an opportunity for that person to take a step back and take a look at the business that we have, take a look at the environment that we're playing into, and to make an assessment as to what the right path forward is in light of where we think the growth trajectory is, and where we think the return opportunities are. And so, that is the other leg that would Jane coming in February. I'm sure, she will want to take that opportunity and see what comes of that. So hopefully that clarifies the point. Yep. Good morning. Well, the expenses that we have in the quarter that you referenced include, obviously a $400 million civil money penalty, that's part of that, that's booked in operating expenses. And in terms of 2021, we're in the midst of constructing our plan right now. And so, hard for me to give you an exact number, or run rate number for you to forecast in 2021. So sorry to disappoint. But I don't have much beyond the way. I've answered that question already. Sure, yes, the -- you're speaking to the civil money penalty. The answer is yes. We have reflected our estimates of the impact in the in the RWA for operational risk associated with that. And just given how it falls in terms of the level, the magnitude of the impact relative to other operational risks, there was not a material change in the RWA as a result of it. Yes. Again, that's a -- as you said, that's a tough question to answer. I would like to give obviously, Jane the opportunity to get in the seat and to work through some of the things that Mike has referenced, that I've referenced earlier. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, at least historically in the fourth quarter, we've tried to give you know some context, not only for full year performance, but in terms of what we're seeing in the market going forward. We'll see how this fourth quarter plays out. And then obviously on the fourth quarter earnings call we'll give an updated perspective on what we think performance might look like in 2021 and also the timing for which we can give you a more comprehensive view on how we think about things, how we think about things going forward. Hey, Saul. Yes. So let me try and go at this again. So look, we spend, call it $42 billion to $43 billion a year in terms of total expenses. You've heard me reference, about $9 billion of that is associated with technology. And maybe half of whatever is associated with kind of compensation. But I highlight that to say that we obviously have a large expense base, one that we've been managing very, very diligently over the past number of years. And with that expense base, there are a couple of different areas that I think are useful to point out as we think about the incremental need. So one is the billion plus and incremental spend that we've made. And as I mentioned earlier, the opportunity to re-spend those dollars, to reprioritize, those dollars. There's also spend that we make on the current operations and infrastructure, that we make every year. And that too, I think, will give us an opportunity to re-look at that spend, that base, and reprioritize that spent, right? So there are multiple categories where we can re-point if you will to a better approach, if you will of addressing what's been highlighted in the order. And it's not until we kind of work through the incremental that's already in there, the base that rolls off and gives us an opportunity to re-spend that we then are faced with, okay, what more is required around the investment. Now, a couple percentage points of an increase is pretty significant in the way of absolute dollars that can be put to work on these types of initiatives. In terms of the when -- well, let me have one of them. And the second thing I'd highlight is, as Mike pointed out, separate and away from the required spend to address the opportunity or the investment and infrastructure risk and controls, there also remains opportunities for us to look at our data centers for us to look at, where we have -- to ensure the right placement of people around the organization. So our footprint for us to look at some of the roll off from some of the COVID spend that we've had to make this year. So there are other opportunities for us to look at dollars that we have let alone capacity adjustments that may be warranted coming out of this COVID-19. And so my -- what I'm trying to highlight is that there are many puts and takes through the budget process that we're constructing now. And the process that we will use to dimension the spend associated with this order. In terms of timing, the order actually points out that we've got some 120 days or so to identify the gap, a gap between our current state and an end state target. And then some 90 days or so to develop and have a plan approved after which we can move towards executing or continuing to execute against. And so, that gives you some sense for how we're thinking about the timing and the dimensioning of this. But again, I think we've got a track record now as has been pointed out of being very thoughtful and responsible around investment dollars and our total expense base and you and others and shareholders should expect that we will continue to be disciplined and responsible as it relates to that. And again, as I mentioned earlier, we're looking to improve profitability and returns as we do this, right? Sure. So ex the $400 million. So I said roughly the 657 that we see, excluding the $400 million civil money penalty is likely to be the levels that we see in the fourth quarter. Yes, sure. So, again, it's -- when you look across the portfolio, we're seeing payment rates coming in higher than we expected. And the consumers are proving to be quite resilient when you think about the stimulus and the forbearance programs that have been in place. And so, as we look at loss curves and delinquency buckets, and what they're suggesting, over the next number of quarters, it looks as though the aggregate level, we're likely to see -- we're likely to see losses towards the fourth quarter or back end of 2021. Obviously, assumptions around GDP, assumptions around unemployment, all of those factors come into play. But that is in fact, what we're seeing. That's going to vary by regions. And so, in Asia. in LatAm, we may see that earlier, but what I was referencing on the back end was kind of when you look at the aggregate portfolio. Sure. So, hard to know exactly what happens, but in the event that we did see, or we do see a tax rate increase to 28% or so, and it went into effect in the latter part of 2021. It would likely result in our DTA increasing by about $4 billion. So, a one time increase in our detail about $4 billion. And obviously would have the impact of our rate being close to that level, our tax rate being close to that level. And as a result of that, less income given the higher tax rate and less income contributing to the CET1 ratio. And then, in terms of the disallowed DTA, with a higher corporate tax rate, we would expect to return to our usage levels of roughly a billion dollars per year. So that gives you a little bit of a sense of a couple of the moving pieces should that happen. Yes. So look, in terms of the in terms of the NIM, we've seen some of the -- obviously, the pressure from rates. We've seen the pressure in terms of the market, in terms of the mix of assets that we have, but also pressure in terms of the deposit levels coming in quite high with a, frankly a lack of loan demand to put that to work. And so, subject to how that liquidity that's in the market evolves. And what happens with ultimate asset pricing is going to have an important factor on that. The NIM is really an output of how those near [ph] revenues play out and how the balance sheet evolves. And so, a bit of continued uncertainty a little bit in terms of how some of those market factors play out, but we see that as well stabilizing towards the end of the year. And Mike, just to that point in terms of us having started this already, again, the incremental billion we're spending, we're not -- we started spending that at the beginning of the year, right. And we spent incremental dollars in 2019 as well. And by the way, that billion dollars wasn't something that I kept, it was what do we think is required to make as much traction as we can in the year and we're spending that incremental billion dollars and still managing our total expenses responsibly. Alright. Good Morning. Yes, yes, sure Gerard. Let me let me start by saying, as you know, we have coming out of the last crisis, we have really adjusted our risk framework, our risk appetite, we have rethought our client focus to ensure that we're focused on clients that can take best advantage of the breadth of our offering, but also on the multinational investment grade type clients. And so we have maintained a skew in terms of ratings towards, 80% or so of our portfolio, being in those investment grade names. We've got a long history of, operating in all of these sectors that you that you see on page 23. And we've got, deep experience through cycles, and expertise in each of these industries, and that includes client selection. And in many instances, we are banking many of the leaders in their respective industries. And, it's important to note that because I think that speaks to not only the quality of the name, but what we can expect when you go through downturns, and it speaks to why we're so committed to staying alongside our clients and helping them manage through the uncertainty. When I think about some of the sectors that we point to in this crisis, we've been thoughtful about the way we have dealt with these clients over time. So you look at the aviation space, and our exposures there tend to be secured. They tend to we have extensive experience with structuring to mitigate risk there, whether that's secured or guaranteed by export credit agencies. We've got extensive experience with valuation of collateral there. You look at autos and in many cases; the lending there is in securitization vehicles. So, the risk of bankruptcy is remote and with underlying consume obligors in that case. You look at energy and a lot of that is reserved based lending with borrow -- borrowing basis that go through a periodic redetermination. And that helps in terms of reducing exposure when oil prices fall. And so you look at these you look at our activity with these clients in these sectors, our deep experience, and we think that it positions us as well to manage through this with them. And certainly feel good about the reserves that we have. And we have taken proactive actions. In the pre-crisis we went through exposure reductions, just given where we were in the cycle. And we've aggressively downgraded names that are in impacting sectors early in the crisis and put enhanced monitoring in place. But as I mentioned, we feel we feel good about the portfolio we have, we feel good about the reserves that we have, and we feel good about our ability to manage through this with these clients."

            "name": "Mike Corbat",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported earnings for the third quarter of 2020. We had net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.40. We continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic extremely well. Credit costs have stabilized, deposits continue to increase and revenues are up 3% year-to-date. As you know last week we entered into consent orders with the Federal Reserve and the OCC and I will discuss how we are approaching those after I go through our business and financial performance. Our institutional clients group continues to perform extremely well. Investment Banking had another strong quarter accessing the capital markets for our clients and private bank revenues are now up 9% year-to-date. Treasury and Trade Solutions, the backbone of our global network is down only 4% for the quarter and 5% for the year in constant dollars, despite significantly lower interest rates. Trading performance were strong as well, with fixed income and equities up 42% and 18% respectively year-to-date. Global consumer banking revenues remained under pressure due to the economic impact of the pandemic, predominantly driven by the decline in credit card spending. At the same time, deposits continued to increase significantly, credit costs decreased and we saw more investment activity from our wealth management clients. On balance, our global consumer banking franchise has shown resilience in light of the challenges we're facing. Our capital position strengthened during the quarter with our common equity tier one ratio increasing to 11.8% well above our regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $71.95 up 4% from a year ago, and we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders over time. Turning to the consent orders, they focus on four areas that impact our risk and control environment; risk management, data governance, controls, and compliance. What ties these areas together is the need to modernize our infrastructure, governance and processes. We've had remediation programs in place, and while we've been making progress in these areas, we're simply not where we need to be. While this is disappointing, we're committed to thoroughly addressing the issues identified in the orders and modernizing our bank. As many of you know, we've been making structural changes and accelerating investments. We've centralized program management and learned from unsparing root cause analysis from outside firms. We're laser focused on reducing manual touch points, automating processes and ensuring accurate data can be accessed quickly when we're producing management and regulatory reports. More importantly, we're making strengthening our risk and control environment and achieving operational excellence, a strategic priority for the firm going forward. This won't be a quick or easy fix, we need to conduct an in-depth gap analysis to ensure our solutions are tailored to the issues we face and get us to the necessary end state. While we can't fully scope out the cost yet, for a multi-year transformation, I can tell you with certainty that we're committing all the necessary resources while continuing to serve our clients. Importantly, we're aligned with our regulators, as far as timelines are concerned, so we'll not jeopardize the quality or completeness for speed. Collectively, these investments will not only further enhance our safety and soundness, they'll also create a digital infrastructure that will make us more efficient, more competitive, and significantly improve our ability to serve our clients and customers. So these are investments we need to make. In hindsight, we should have done them faster and prevented it from coming to this. But our firm has made tremendous progress in recent years, whether it's de risking our balance sheet are improving our efficiency and business performance, to close the gap and returns with our competitors. Our foundation is sound stable and secure. Our performance during this pandemic shows the progress we've made achieving excellence in our risk and control environment and our operations is necessary for Citi to take the next step forward. Our franchise is made up of committed and capable people who make us proud every day. They've done everything asked of them and I know they'll continue to do so in the times ahead. Ahead of the transition in February, change is driving this transformation and the entire management team is committed to getting Citi to where it needs to be and doing it the right way. With that, Mark, will go through the presentation and then we'd be happy to take your questions. Oh, can you hear me? Like, I'm sorry. Sorry. So I was saying, John, that over the over the past decade or so I think we've done a lot of work in terms of positioning the firm for both a financial and a strategic perspective. And I think we've made a number of investments across areas that we felt were critical. And we're going to continue to make, continue to make targeted investments. At the Barclays Conference, Mark spoke about our next phase of our transformation. And, I think as we think about that, we have always been focused in terms of how we operate. But I would say we haven't gone fast enough, that, we feel that, again, I think if you think you look at COVID and the way we've come through COVID, I feel quite proud about kind of what we've done and what we've been able to do, obviously not over. And we've initiated a number of significant remediation projects along the way to strengthen our controls, our infrastructure and our governments. But that being said, we didn't do it fast enough. And we've got to we've got to move faster. And that's certainly where we're going to be focused. I think in terms of what the expectation should be, in terms of how we're going to approach that I think, really four, four pillars that we're going to be focused on. One is the organizational component. And you've seen this already go with that in terms of the establishment, and hiring of our Chief Administrative Officer, Karen Peetz coming in. And I think creating and putting a framework around the way we'll go with this. I would say the strategic component, which is really agreeing on what the end state vision for our processes, and I think, being critical, and as I said, in my opening, we have brought people in to give us an external assessment of what needs to be done and where we fell short. And I think it's making sure that the work that we do comes together across the institution. So as opposed to simply addressing specific issue, solving holistic problems, I think there's an operational component behind this in terms of making sure that around things like data and technology to make sure that we're driving the proper automation, the elimination of manual touch points and other things that we've spoken about. And I think importantly, the fourth component is the cultural piece, and making sure that all the businesses, all the regions, all the functions understand that it's everyone's responsibility to get this right. So I would say it hasn't John been from lack of effort, and commitment to it, but I would say that we certainly could have ensured to work smarter around getting to the, the endpoint. It's still to be defined. But there are some things that obvious in terms of BAU activity, in terms of securitizations, and other types of activities that we do within different parts of the franchise. But we still have to define what significant means and get regulatory agreement on that. Good morning. Good morning. Sure. So I would start out, Mike, by saying that I think it is important to the board, it's important to the company that we have a real transition. As you recall, my transition was about five minutes. And as part of this process, I did commit to the board that I'd stay throughout the year and close out the three-year plan, which we announced in 2017. We are starting the transition now. And I think that allows, Jane to be very much involved in terms of our financial plan. And if you recall, when I started, I thought it was important kind of going into the budget and planning process that the CEO own that. I think I was fortunate in terms of my timing of coming in of that being the case. And I think with Jane coming in that will very much be the case. And because she will be accountable for delivering next year and into the future. I think it's also important that Jane has taken on the transformation work and working on the gap analysis and other related things to the Consent Order. As part of that, by the way, Jane continues to have a day job in terms of running consumers. She's also overseeing our return to the office in terms of our North American business. And I think the orderly transition is the right thing to do. I think in terms of the accomplishments, I appreciate what you said in terms of some of the acknowledgement. But again, kind of grounding where we started, net income increased from $7.5 billion to the end of last year north of $19 billion. Our return on assets went from 39 basis points, to right about 100 basis points. So return on tangible common equity, yes, still behind our peers went from 5% to 12%. But went a long way towards closing that gap. We went from returning hardly any capital in 2012 to returning nearly $80 billion over the last six years in returning our share count by about 30%. And so, I don't think you accomplished those things without a sense of commitment and a sense of urgency. And I feel great about the team that's in place and their commitment to that. And so, I think we have made significant progress. And I think Jane's got a foundation to build on from that. And I think she and the team will be kind of focused on those things. And again, I think coming out of COVID, as Mark talked about here or as in when we come out of COVID and the environment, I think there's things that they can take advantage of. And I think they will and I think they'll certainly act with that sense of urgency. Well, shareholders absolutely do matter, Mike. And if you've got to look at throughout the firm, whether it's the pay structure, employees and in particular, more highly paid employees getting paid significantly in stock or stock related types of instruments of the different programs and scorecards being very linked to how we perform and the things that hopefully over time drive, share performance. And again, I think there's no one thing in particular. And so I think getting those metrics right is critical, I know the board. I know the compensation committee, all work hard in terms of trying to create that alignment. And again, I think, from a disclosure perspective, we've been kind of very public and transparent in terms of the metrics and the scorecard process that leadership and broader management is held to at the firm. Yes. I think we should let her kind of get her feet under her and go through some of these processes and get educated and start to form her opinions that I described. And so, we'll probably start to introduce her on the January call in terms of maybe having more view towards a forward look. And then obviously, the quarter after that, she'll have the range. Sure. So I would say, one very important part of that, Erika, is what we spoke about in terms of no widespread customer harm. The company did not profit from the activities. And you can kind of go on with that. I think the second piece is that around customer harm, and around some of those things there were not just Wells Fargo, but there were kind of widespread industry deep dives into sales practices and other pieces in here. I think in this you've seen and we've talked about the four areas of focus. And where we're going to be spending our time. And we've been asked to do the gap analysis. We've obviously been at this for a while, and we will obviously do extensive gap analysis, but I think we've got to get a reasonable idea. And again, we're open to the findings that come from that in terms of the things that need to be done. And I think that, as importantly, in there is kind of the understanding of the process failures that got us here. Again, no fraud, no customer harm, no benefit around that. And if I could just go back and touch on the question that you asked Mark, I think an important way to think about it is historically, you've heard us kind of speak to the way that we've gone at the expense side of things is really working hard to offset the costs that we've been putting out there in terms of some of this transformation work. I think the way you're going to hear us talk about it and the way you should think about is those are separate streams, the remediation work will cost what it will cost. But don't think as a result of that, that there's still not significant work that we recognize, that we can do from a business improvement process. And so, we're not linking the two is those necessarily being offsetting, but we will continue to work on those things to better the efficiencies of the company away from this. I think the second piece is that that while we're not speaking to it, we've referenced it, I think that this work will have, this transformation will have an ROI in terms of what this allows us to do and do differently. We talked about from the client customer perspective, the business process in terms of the way we aggregate data, the way that we kind of move, risk and controls through the firm in a more automated way, we think gives us the ability not just to improve the process, but we do think that over time, we'll have a return in terms of the benefits and costs that are associated with those both directly and indirectly. Good morning. And Mark, I think an important nuance there is what comes out between remaining territorial or a reversion to global taxation. I think what people are talking about today is it would likely remain territorial, which, again with a average global tax rate of about 25%, that would certainly benefit us in some of the jurisdictions that we operate in. Yes. And so, look, again, that is that is based on kind of current trends that we're seeing in terms of roughly include improving unemployment and improving GDP. Obviously, there is talk of another stimulus in terms of its impact. We've assumed that kind of a bit later in terms of in the first quarter of 2021. It does assume that we continue to see the purchase sales activity improved quarter over quarter. We've seen some of that certainly in Q3. We continue to see that as we look even in the early days of October. And so that playing out would be another important factor. And then obviously, what happens in terms of the overall liquidity that's in the market is a factor that influences mix and the NIM as well. Sure. So I would say that not have moved fast enough, and not have been holistic enough, Jeff, to use my words. And so again, I think this gap analysis will give us a better sense of that. But again, as I said, we've brought others in to help us look at and think about these things. And so again, we'll see what the final analysis yields. But I think we've got a sense of the right approach and direction. Broadly defined no. There may be some more refined areas where it may make sense to do that, but not broadly. And again, I think if you look at kind of how -- as an example, we've kind of managed through this crisis, which I think is a good real life live test. Again, I think we've been able to get the data. We've been able to make the right decisions. We've been able to act in a timely manner. But again, I think this pandemic has shown us the accelerated move to digital, and the ability to continue to work remotely or more remotely over time and the ability to make faster and better decisions as critical and in particular, as I think appropriately our regulators continue to raise the bar on the larger institutions, in terms of their expectations. Yes, sure. So I mean, look, Mexico, similar to other parts of the world also had forbearance, as part of the program although, unlike the U.S. the in Mexico, customers needed to be less than 30 days past due as of the end of February to be eligible. And so what we, what we saw is that, when you look at our loss rates for the quarter, you see a tick up in Latin America largely driven by Mexico and the impact of those customers kind of playing through the delinquency buckets and into losses. That said, Mexico also comes with a, higher NIM in the way of -- in the way of overall performance. And we would expect for losses there to certainly come to a peak of sooner than the end of 2021. In terms of more broadly our exposure, in Mexico is about $57 billion in terms of total country exposure, and that's down a little bit since the second quarter. At the end of the third quarter, about $30 billion of loans between, GCB and ICG. In Mexico, 13 or consumer loans about 16 are corporate loans. And about half of that 13, a little bit more than half is in credit card and in personal loans. And remember, we tend to target a higher quality customer segment than most of our peers there, and we price the risk accordingly. And so, we would expect for that to play out in a relatively favorable way. And then there's another 81% of our payroll loans in the portfolio are concentrated in sectors that have a lower risk of layoffs, like government, employers, and pensioners. And so that too, should be helpful as we think about the quality of our book. And then there's the portion that's in mortgages is it weights towards LTVs of 50%, less than 50%. And so that, too, should speak to the quality of our books. So overall, we feel as though we're appropriately reserved, and are managing reasonable levels of performance there. Yes, and so just to be to be clear, the stabilization that I was referring to is kind of as we go into the fourth quarter and so I'd expect net interest revenue to stabilize in the, in the fourth quarter for total Citi. And for many of the factors that I mentioned already. Look, the markets revenue as you've heard me mentioned before, it's really important to look at total revenue. The total revenue there in part because the nature of how transactions are structured with clients impacts, whether that revenues coming in the form of near and non near. And so, I think it's very important to, as I mentioned, look at total revenue there. And our total revenue in the quarter, as you mentioned, as I mentioned earlier, is up in terms of in total markets revenue, in light of the strong, fixed income, and the strong equities performance that we saw there. And so, that that part is lower than the prior quarter as we see some of that normalization in markets take place, but still very strong in light of the environment that we're managing through and candidly, as we go into a fourth quarter with an election and in the case of Europe, Brexit and speculation around the stimulus and uncertainty around vaccines, hard to predict exactly how customers clients decide to reposition their books, as some of those things become clearer. And so total revenue in the way of markets revenue is the way we think about it, and a fourth quarter that I think will show near revenue stabilizing, but keep in mind, markets performance, will have will likely have puts and takes. I would expect? Well again, I would expect that our fourth quarter will show net interest revenues and non-net interest revenues kind of down year-over-year. But the aggregate of the two, relatively stable. Good morning. So the notion of accountability. And I think what they're speaking to goes more broad than just the executive management team. But obviously, you've got a number of work streams here, you've got a fair number of people involved in those processes. And it's kind of taking it down and kind of making sure that the people who are responsible for each of those processes have the appropriate waiting. And I think the challenge comes that in many of the instances or in many of the work streams, you actually have people that it isn't, it isn't their sole job. They are a practicing expert, or practicing practitioner in terms of the markets business or in consumer or in different functions. And we have seconded [Ph] them as part of their job into doing this regulatory work, because they, they're the expert. They're the area through which a number of these things would flow. And the question is, how do you create the proper balance and proper accountability around that? So I don't look at it and say that it's executives, just the executive team. I think it's striking the right balance. And so as an example, should someone in risk be responsible for delivering on financials of the firm profitability expenses, or are there pieces that are in there? And so I think it's kind of creating the right balance to drive the right behaviors, get the right outcomes and -- in people in both directions properly. So again, I think that it's the way it's written, it's my interpretation is actually broader than the way you've described it. Well, we have in risk and controls we've been, we've added thousands of people since the beginning of the year, and we were adding people last year to these projects. So without a doubt, we've been bringing those resources and getting that expertise in and we've tried to bring in subject matter experts, from other firms from other industries to help us as we think about these things, and I think we've made a number of very key strong external hires. I think we've made some very strong internal moves in terms of people and I think we've also moved strongly in terms of what I would say single adding people i.e. making this remediation, not just their primary, but in many case their sole responsibility in terms of delivering on. So again, yes, we're absolutely committed to having the right resources, the right expertise, the right talent, and then having the right accountability around delivering against this. Well, around these, around these work streams, as we've acknowledged, we have been working on them for a while. So it's not like, all of a sudden, we woke up one day and said, gee, we're going to, we're going to go at some of these things as de novo or new project. So we've been working on them for a while. And I would say that, again, what we've been focused on is really bringing these projects together. I would say a historic approach that we've taken as we've gone at these, in some ways serially or individually, and I don't think that has yielded the outcomes that either I either Citi or regulators necessarily would want. And so as we went down this path, it became apparent to me and I think the board and others that we needed to really join these processes and create a body to be able to go at it. And I think we're very fortunate to have Karen with us who has been through some of this and have this expertise to be able to, I think bring these work streams together. Because when you think about data as an example, data feeds through risk, data feeds through compliance, data feeds through lots of your controls, and making sure that we're taking a holistic approach to the way that we go at and modernize our data approach is critical. So that we do it once, we do it right, we do it, we do it holistically. And so again, I don't think the word for some of the work streams are new. I think the broader, more encompassing, holistic approach, in some areas is newer. Yes, look there. There are multiple components to it right there. There are additional linkages that we try to capture across our franchises whether it's doing more with our TTS clients. I mentioned earlier that we are seeing a lot of traction as a relates to instant payment capabilities, whether it's doing more between our capital markets business and in spread products and trade lending that we do with corporate law clients in terms of unique structuring opportunities there. And so, there are linkages opportunities across the franchise that we will continue to capture that I think will help in the way of top line performance. There are opportunities to grow in the wealth management space, more where we've seen 16% growth and investments in Asia this quarter, we think there's more, we think there's more upside, we think there's more wealth growth, upside in the U.S. as well. But there are also operational benefits from again, when, when we say manual activity, when you replace manual activity with an improved technology, or an automation or straight through processing, you remove the manual, removing the manual improves the quality of the output in a more timely fashion. But it also over time is less costly when you don't have those manual steps. And so I say improved profitability as we go into 2021 and 2022 and beyond in part in getting both top line, ultimately getting expense benefits from a host of activities, including capacity adjustments that we may decide to take as we come out of this crisis. And then the other, the other items play through as well, including cost of credit, and so on and so forth."

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have objections please disconnect at the time. Ms. Lynn, you may begin.\nElizabeth Lynn: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.\nMike Corbat: Thank you, Liz and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported earnings for the second quarter of 2020, with net income of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $0.50. As in the first quarter, credit cost weighed down our net income. However, the overall business performance was strong which shows that we've been able to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic reasonably well so far. The solid revenue growth at 5% and strong expense management down 1% both on the year-on-year basis, our margin was up 13%. We grew loans and our deposits were up significantly. Our regulatory capital increased and we continue to add to our substantial liquidity and our balance sheet has more than ample capacity to continue to serve our clients. The Institutional Clients Group had an exceptional quarter. Fixed income was at 68%. We had our best investment banking quarter in recent history and private bank revenues approached $1 billion. And while Treasury and Trade Solutions continued to be impacted by the lower rate environment, we did see good client engagement and strong deposit growth in that business. Global Consumer Banking revenues were down and spending slowed significantly due to the pandemic. In North America, despite the decline in purchase sale activity, Branded Cards revenues were up slightly due to a mix shift towards earnings balances. At the same time, Retail Services saw a significant decline in consumer spending with our partners.  Retail Banking saw higher mortgage revenue from refinancing activity due to the low rate environment. In Asia, the slowdown in travel and consumer activity again reduced revenues. And in Mexico, revenues declined as the country is struggling from the effects of the health pandemic. Our capital position strengthened during the quarter with our common equity Tier 1 ratio increasing to 11.5% on an advanced basis. I was pleased with our results from the Federal Reserve's related stress test placing our stress capital buffer at 2.5%. This leads us comfortably about our new regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book value per share of $71.15 was down only slightly from the first quarter, but still up 5% from a year ago. We plan to keep paying our quarterly dividend as long as macroeconomic and financial conditions permit. During the quarter, we continue to support our clients, colleagues and communities through this pandemic. While I'd like to see more of our people back in the office, we've been clear that we won't do anything to jeopardize their health and safety. Most recently, we pause plans to invite a limited number of colleagues back to sites located in areas where the health data was going in the wrong direction. We've also remained committed to supporting communities through a variety of initiatives. These now total over a $100 million in contributions from our company and its foundation. But what I'm most proud of is the $2 million which my colleagues donated out of their own pockets to organization providing COVID relief as part of our matching program. And we recently made our first distribution to the Citi Foundation representing $25 million in net profits from the Payroll Protection Program to support Community Development, Financial Institutions. We're also partnering with minority-owned depository institutions to help them extend credit to businesses through PPP by purchasing their loans through a $50 million facility. This effort is even more important as we look at the economic disparities drawn along racial lines in our society. And, of course, we continue to serve our clients whether it's providing consumer relief or helping companies access the capital markets to strengthen their balance sheets. We enter the second half in a strong position to handle what comes our way. We are in a completely unpredictable environment for which no models, no cycles to point to. The pandemic has a grip on the economy and it doesn't seem likely to loosen until vaccines are widely available. We'll keep managing through this with a sharp emphasis on our risk management and continue to make investments in our infrastructure to enhance our safety, soundness and controls to ensure that we have an industry with strong and stable institution. With that Mark will go through our presentation. And then we will be happy to answer your questions.\nMark Mason: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 4. Citigroup reported second quarter net income of $1.3 billion which included a $5.6 billion increase in credit reserve this quarter, primarily reflecting the deterioration in the economic outlook since the end of the first quarter under CECL and downgrades in the corporate loan portfolio. The reserve bill also includes an additional qualitative management adjustment to reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and/or a somewhat slower recovery. Revenues of $19.8 billion grew by 5% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher fixed income and investment banking records. Expenses were down slightly year-over-year resulting in positive operating leverage and a 13% improvement in operating margin. Credit costs were $7.9 billion this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 9% for the second quarter reflecting a higher relative impact from tax advantage investments and other tax benefit items given the lower level of EBIT. Looking at results for the first half of 2020, we delivered net eight number $3.8 billion even as we increase credit reserves by $10.5 billion under the CECL framework given the current environment. We grew revenues by 8% predominantly reflecting continued strength in our markets and investment banking businesses, while we held expenses flat year-over-year allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and a 20% increase in operating margin. In constant dollars end-of-period loans were 1% year-over-year to $685 billion reflecting growth in our institutional businesses mostly offset by the impact of lower spending activity in our consumer business. Deposits grew 20% reflecting engagement with clients and flight to quality so to speak across both the institutional and consumer franchises, which serve to strengthen our available liquidity. We maintain a strong capital and liquidity position which has been critical to our ability to support our clients as they manage through this crisis. As of June 30th, our CET1 capital ratio was 11.5%, 150 basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement. We had close to $900 billion in available liquidity and including the additional reserves taking this quarter, credit reserves stand at roughly $28 billion with the reserve ratio of 3.89% of funded loans. With the level of capital, liquidity and the reserve we hold today plus significant pre provision earnings power seen through the first half of the year, we continue to operate from a position of strength. And as we discussed last quarter, we're combining this financial strength with operational resiliency which allows us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis. Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 7% as strong deposit growth was more than offset by lower loan volumes and lower interest rates across all regions. And expenses decreased 8% as lower volume related expenses reduction in marketing and other discretionary spending and efficiency savings were partially offset by increases in COVID-19 related expenses. Total credit cost of $3.9 billion were up significantly from last year, including a reserve build of proximately $2 billion driven by the deterioration in the economic outlook. Slide 6 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Second quarter revenues of $4.7 billion were down 5% from last year. During the quarter we continued to focus on providing assistance to help customers impacted by COVID-19. Since the crisis began, we have provided relief to more than 2 million accounts representing roughly 6% of our aggregate balances across cards and mortgages. In a hopeful sign, many of those same customers have continue to make their regular payments during the second quarter although we realized it -- and to date over half of our current enrollees have rolled off the program with more than 80% of these customers remaining current. While reenrollment rates remain below expectations and about the mid-teens. Turning now to the businesses starting with cards. Branded Cards revenues of $2.2 billion were up 1% year-over-year as lower purchase sales and lower average loans were offset by a favorable mix shift towards interest earning balances which supported net increase revenues. As seen across the industry purchase sales declined significantly down 21% in the second quarter. However, in recent weeks we have seen signs of improvement with purchase sale down to the low double digits year-over-year in June compared to a 30% decline in April. Average loans declined 7% reflecting lower sales activity. We also took credit actions during the quarter including a pause in proactive marketing and a reduction in credit line increases and BAL con activity as examples. We believe these risk actions are proven given the current environment but they are likely to result in more pressure on interest earnings balances in the second half of the year. Retail Services revenues of $1.4 billion were down 13% year-over-year reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments. Net interest revenues were down 7% as average loans declined by 6% on lower purchase sale activity. Purchase sales were down 25% year-over-year in the second quarter but similar to Branded Cards we saw improvement in the month of June with the pace of sales declines flowing to the mid-teens. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year. As we have discussed in the past, Retail Services revenues are shown net up payments related to income sharing arrangements with our retail partners, which can vary quarter-to-quarter based on the overall mix and profit outlook for our portfolios. Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 3% year-over-year as the benefit of stronger deposit volume and an improvement in mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Our deposit momentum continues to improve with average deposits of 14% driven by a combination of environmental factors including the delay of tax payments, stimulus payments and a reduction in overall spending, as well as our continued strategic efforts to drive organic growth. Digital deposit sales accelerated even as we continue to adjust pricing given the current rate environment with digital deposits growing by $3 billion this quarter to a total of nearly $12 billion. We also saw strong engagement with existing clients driving balanced growth across deposit products including checking which grew 13% year-over-year. Total expenses for North America consumer were down 10% year-over-year as reductions in marketing and other discretionary expenses along with efficiency saving and lower volume related costs more than offset incremental COVID-19 related expenses. Turning to Credit. Total Credit cost of $3 billion increased significantly from last year as we built roughly $1.5 billion in reserves this quarter reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook, partially offset by the impact of a change in accounting for third-party collection fees. On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollar. In Asia, revenues declined 15% year-over-year in the second quarter. Cards revenues declined by 22% reflecting lower activity levels with purchase sales down 29% year-over-year. We're seeing a disproportionate impact on Asia card revenues from lower travel spend in the region given our affluent client base and a greater proportion of fee revenues coming from travel related interchange and foreign transaction fees. We also saw an impact on customer acquisition in products like insurance which rely more heavily on face-to-face engagement. However, average deposit will remains strong at 10% this quarter albeit at lower deposit spreads, reflecting a flight to quality as well as continued client engagement across the franchise. While investment revenues were down this quarter, we saw continued underlying growth in our wealth management drivers with 6% growth in Citigold clients and 10% growth in net new money versus last year. Today, we are seeing some early signs that were pick up an activity with purchase sales declined moderating and net new money and investment sales show a material improvement in June versus prior month. But the shape to recovery remains fluid. Turning to Latin America. Total consumer revenues declined 7% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter with average balances of 9%. However, revenues were impacted by lower purchase sales and loan volume as well as lower deposit spreads in the current environment. In total, operating expenses for international business were down 4% in the second quarter, reflecting efficiency savings and lower volume related expenses and cost of credit increased to $883 million. Slide 8 provides additional detail on Global Consumer credit trend. Credit loss rates generally trended upwards this quarter as a result of the macroeconomic slowdown. Although this was much more a function of the lower loan balances as it is still too early to see a pronounced impact from COVID-19 on our net credit losses. 90 plus day delinquency rates improved in the US despite the lower balances has reduced spending combined with the benefit of significant government stimulus and our own customer relief efforts has generated liquidity which has been used to pay down debt even in the later delinquency buckets. Earlier stage delinquencies are also improved given the additional liquidity and the impact of relief efforts although it is still early and there is still significant uncertainty around the timing of the economic recovery and how customers will perform once these relief and stimulus programs start to roll off. Delinquency rates were up slightly in Asia, although still at modest and absolute levels. And in Mexico, we saw a more significant impact as COVID-19 is still peaking in that market and customers are not benefiting from the same level of government stimulus. Turning now to Institutional Clients Group on Slide 9. Revenues of $12.1 billion increased 21% in second quarter and were up 25% excluding a roughly $350 million pretax gain on our investment in trade wealth in the prior year as strong performance in fixed income, investment banking and the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in GTS, corporate lending and security services. The quarter was also impacted by $431 million of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads tightened during the quarter. During the quarter, we continue to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses. And we've been actively helping our clients navigate through this uncertain environment. In TTS, we continue to work with our clients to sustain their operations, manage their supply chain and optimize their working capital and liquidity. We will continue to see momentum in our digital efforts as evidenced by strong growth in Citi direct users and digital account opening, which further deepen our relationship with our clients. In markets, we saw record volumes as we supported our clients, leveraging our Citi velocity platform and electronic execution capability. And similar to the first quarter, we actively made markets to both our corporate and investor clients as we help them navigate through volatile macroeconomic conditions.  In Investment Banking, clients remained focus on both sources and usage of short-term and long-term liquidity. We continue to provide new loans and facilitate additional draws for clients looking to bolster liquidity. However, we also saw significant repayments which led to the sequential decline in end-of-period loan and corporate lending. And we continue to hope our clients access capital markets which drove further share gain. I'd note that investment grade debt underwriting is up 131% year-over-year as we continue to help our clients' source liquidity in this evolving environment.  Turning now to the results for the businesses starting with Banking. Total Banking revenues of $5.7 billion increased 4%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were down 11% as reported and 7% in constant dollars as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rate and lower commercial cards revenues. Our average deposits were 30% in constant dollars. We had strong growth in our instant payment and API volume and our cross-border flow were resilient despite the significant macro slowdown. All of which give us confidence in the underlying health of the franchise. Investment Banking revenues of $1.8 billion were up 37% from last year outperforming the market wallet and delivering the highest revenue quarter since the financial crisis. Results reflected strong growth in both debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by M&A.  Private Bank revenues of $956 million grew 10% driven by increased capital market activity as well as higher lending and deposit volume, partially offset by lower deposits spreads. Corporate Lending revenues of $646 million were down 11% as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spread. Total Market and Securities Services of $6.9 billion increased 48% year-over-year. Fixed Income revenues of $5.6 billion grew 68% reflecting strong performance across rates and currencies, spread products and commodity. Equities revenues of $770 million were down 40% versus last year as solid performance in cash equities was more than offset by lower revenues and derivatives and Prime Finance reflecting a more challenging environment. And finally, in Security Services, revenues were down 9% on reported basis and 5% in constant dollars as higher deposit volume were more than offset by lower spread. Total operating expenses of $5.9 billion increased 7% year-over-year as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher compensation cost, continued investment and volume driven growth.  Total credit cost of $3.9 billion was up significantly from last year. We built roughly $3.5 billion in reserves this quarter. The increase in reserves reflected the impact of changes in the economic outlook, as well as downgrades in the corporate loan portfolio during the quarter. As of quarter end, our overall funding reserve ratio was 1.71% including 4.9% on the non-investment grade. We provide more detail on the corporate portfolio in the appendix of our earnings presentation. Total non accrual loans increased $1.5 billion sequentially this quarter reflecting the current environment with roughly half of the increase coming from smaller size exposure. Overall, we remained vigilant and managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we saw out there today.  Slide 10 shows the results of the Corporate/Others. Revenues of $290 million declined significantly from last year reflecting the wind down of legacy assets and the impact of lower rates partially offset by AFS gains gain as well as positive marks on legacy security, as spreads tightened during the quarter. Expenses were down slightly as the wind down of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs as well as incremental cost associated with COVID-19. And the pretax loss of $343 million this quarter reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, as well as lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trend. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.1 billion this quarter declined $580 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances, partially offset by higher trading-related NIR and the improved mix in branded cards that I mentioned earlier. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $250 million, mainly reflecting the lower rate environment, partially offset by higher trading related NIR and the absence of an episodic one-time item. The net interest margin declined 31 basis points sequentially with lower net interest revenues, driving roughly one-third of the decline and the remainder representing balance sheet growth, reflecting an increase in liquid assets, driven by higher deposits as we accommodated the needs of our clients while also strengthening our own liquidity in the current environment. Turning to non-interest revenue. In the second quarter, a strong performance in trading and investment banking drove a significant increase year-over-year. As we look to the third quarter, we expect both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues to decline year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19 as well as normalization in investment banking activities. On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio improved to 11.5%, primarily reflecting the decline in risk-weighted assets. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.7% primarily reflecting the benefit of the temporary relief granted by the FRB. And our tangible book value per share declined slightly to $71.15 reflecting the debt-valuation adjustment DVA impact to OCI, as Citi\u2019s credit spreads tightened during the quarter. During the quarter, we also received our stress test results including our preliminary stress capital buffer, SCB, requirement of 2.5%. Incorporating this SCB and a GSIB surcharge of 3% results in a minimum regulatory requirement of 10%. In summary, the environment remains challenging this quarter, but we continue to perform well. We ended the period with a strong capital and liquidity position. The underlying business performance this quarter remained solid, and we were able to absorb the significant reserve build with strong results in our markets and investment banking businesses. Overall client engagement remains strong, bolstered by increased digital acquisition and engagement. And while our consumer business has been impacted by COVID-19 related lower levels of activity, we have seen a pick up through the quarter. That said, we did see a significant headwind from the full quarter impact of the lower rate environment. Looking to the third quarter and the rest of 2020, we expect the environment to continue to remain challenging and uncertain. On the top line, we expect to see continued pressure in consumer, reflecting the impact of rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19. And we would also expect the low rate environment to continue to weigh on our core businesses in ICG. Our markets and investment banking businesses should reflect broader industry trends. That said, we would expect normalization relative to the first half. Based on our best estimate, we would expect these headwinds in the back half of the year to result in full year revenues that are flat to down slightly, with the decline in net interest revenues more or less offset by non-interest revenues on a full year basis. On the expense side, we remain focused on protecting our employees and supporting our customers. And we continue to feel good about the investments we are making, particularly in our digital capabilities and infrastructure and control. That said we continue to explore all opportunities to operate more efficiently to fund these investments and offset headwinds created by COVID-19. And overall, we still expect expenses to be flattish to down slightly for the full year. Turning to credit. We do expect a higher level of losses going forward, given our current outlook. However, this should be offset by the release of existing reserves. Of course, the overall level of reserve in the back half of the year remains dependent on the environment relative to our current outlook. So to wrap up, we are preparing for range of outcomes and remain confident in our ability to maintain our overall strength and stability, as well as continue to support our customers.  With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.\nGlennSchorr: Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Sorry about that. My apologies. Quick question on cards in your comments you mentioned doing less balance transfer and tighter credit box impacting revenues. Could you dimensionalize maybe what portion of the book or remind us what portion of the book is promotional? Where this might take it to and how much pressure we're talking about on the card side? Appreciate it.\nMarkMason: Yes. This is Mark. Good morning, Glenn. Look, I'd say a couple of things we're seeing take place. We're obviously managing through a crisis here and what we've seen is we've seen less purchase sale activity, less loan volume take place and frankly less new card acquisitions both on the branded side as well as the retail side. And in light of that, in light of the environment that we're in we've dialed back the marketing spend. we've dialed back bal con and the like and what happens as you know is that as you dial back that level of spending you in the future you don't get the increase in average interest earning balances, loan balances that ultimately drive forward-looking revenues. And so the comment there is simply meant to suggest as we prudently manage through this crisis. We've needed to dial back. We've decided to dial back that's been and I think what's critically important is that we turn that back on as this crisis turns around and that's the way we're kind of planning so that we start to get those promotional balances peaking back up as the economy turns as GDP turns as unemployment falls. And we can start growing those balances again. So that mix as you know is very important. It'll be pressured as we manage through this, but then we want to be very responsive to the economy as it changes which is slightly different from the way it was handled in the past.\nGlennSchorr: That's fair. All prudent, I get it and apologies if I miss it in the prepared remarks. Related to the reserve build I get that there's multiple scenario, a lot of variables but can you talk about where we were at the end of the first quarter versus where at the end of the second quarter in the economic backdrop that you wrote reserves to just so we can do the compare and contrast. Thanks.\nMarkMason: Yes. Let me try and dimension that a little bit because I think it's important first to kind of understand how we approach the CECL modeling. And then I'll share with you the variables, the key variables that we used in the in the second quarter here specifically. So remember as we approach CECL we've got to take a view on the forward look of the economic environment. And the way we've approached that is we've established models to in order to forecast those reserve levels. And we use one scenario for that we use a base scenario for the modeling of that. In addition to that base scenario, which drives the quantitative output in the way of the level of reserves, we have a quantitative approach that drives a management adjustment and that management adjustment is designed to account for the economic uncertainty and the prospect of a more severe stress or a slower recovery. And so those two components become important to how we've established the reserve both in the first quarter and in the second quarter. In the first quarter -- sorry the second quarter to more specifically to your question, the basic economic forecast called for U.S unemployment peaking at roughly 15% or so in the second quarter and GDP falling 35% plus quarter-over-quarter. Now what's important is the shape and the pace of the recovery including whether we see a significant second wave of the virus or what impact the crisis has on broader employment et cetera and our base scenario as GDP recovering sequentially in the third quarter and beyond and bring, call it, under 10% by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 and then trending down from that through the fourth quarter of 2021. And these assumptions kind of assume a potential second wave but one that is controlled, it assumes appropriate fiscal response if needed to maintain that pace of recovery but there's a lot of uncertainty there. And that that kind of drives the quantitative approach and then we consider the probability of an alternative downside scenario. And we build additional reserves as appropriate to that and so if you think about our total reserves, which show up on page 20 I think which stand at about $28.5 billion in terms of the ACL reserves that includes roughly a $2.2 billion or so $2.3 billion or so additional management adjustment to account for the possibility of a more adverse outcome. And so that -- so hopefully that helps. We've got a very specific base scenario then we look at a more stressed scenario, severely more stressed scenario and we put a probability to that in order to establish what our management adjustment should be. And that's what's in the $28.5 billion that's it's today.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMattO\u2019Connor: Good morning. Could you talk a bit about the timing of when you think the charge offs will actually start to go up? And obviously you've alluded to the large reserves and that may or may not hit earnings entirely, but just as we think about the loss recognition, maybe if you can speak to when you think we might start seeing that and what peak levels and when and obviously it might vary by region. So any thoughts on those topics would be helpful. Thank you.\nMarkMason: Sure. We are -- if you kind of look at the information that we reported. We aren't yet seeing significant NCLs as of yet. We aren't yet seeing. There are some increases but we aren't yet seeing significant NCLs. We aren't yet seeing meaningful or increases in even the 30 to 89 buckets, in fact, they're declining so if you look at kind of North America the 30 to 89 delinquencies declined sequentially in branded cards, in retail services. They were relatively stable. In Asia, in Mexico they declined as well. All in our supplement and part of that is because as you know there are government payroll protection programs. There are stimulus checks. There are unemployment benefits. They're all of these things that are in place in many ways to kind of prop up the economy and so we aren't yet seeing the stress, if you will kind of play through those early buckets. What I would say is that as we get to through the back half of the year and towards the back after the year we're likely to see NCL start to pick up. And we're likely to see some of that at least on the consumer side start to peak towards the middle of next year. But I think what you've got to keep in mind is that we're building reserves now around lifetime expected losses and so to the extent that the forecast plays out as the scenario would suggest, you'll see those losses pick up and all things being equal as it relates to balances, you'll also see the reserves used to cover those -- to cover those losses.\nMattO\u2019Connor: And then just on a follow-up I mean this is the first cycle that we've all been through with CECL and I always think about there's all these reserves being built that you're supposed to use as charge-offs hit. But that kind of assumes that charge offs aren't going to go up kind of beyond the level of reserves, right? So like if charge off are going up but the macro environment continues to get worse, you don't really know if you should be using reserves or not. So I guess I'm just wondering like it should be a little bit more coincident in terms of using reserves as charge offs go up than maybe before CECL, but I would assume like the backup this year for example when charge-offs go up like you're not going to be using reserves yet until you're confident that the macro is not going to be worse than you preserved for, right?\nMarkMason: Again, I think in every quarter we're going to be taking a view on the forward economic outlook and so a little bit to your point if we get into the third quarter and we're seeing that our outlook is consistent with what it was at the end of the second quarter then we're going to take a view as it balances all, balances in terms of loans all things been equal related to balances. We're going to take a view as to whether we think that economic environment is going to be as we've scenario it out, get better or worse and act with the reserves accordingly. I think the other thing that I point out to your question is that remember when I described how we established the reserves, we've also built this management adjustment, this qualitative approach which is meant to account for some of that uncertainty and the prospect for a yet worse scenario.\nOperator: Your next question from the line is of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nErikaNajarian: Hi. Good morning. I hate to ask yet another question on the reserve, but just wanted to make sure we got the right takeaways from everything that you just said, Mark. As we think about your current outlook for the economy are you done with significant reserve building? And in that case in terms of what you're alluding to should we assume that once the charge off actually starts to manifest that are drawn against your reserves and you have a longer, reasonable and supportable period versus peers. And I'm wondering as investors start evaluating banks on normalized earnings how we should think about the end state reserve to loan ratio relative to that longer RNS period?\nMarkMason: Yes. I guess here's the way I think about it which is we obviously, you've heard us say in terms of the uncertainty unprecedented crisis. We've taken a view on our forward look of the economy and how it plays out. And that is in fact the view that drives what we've established in the way of reserves. Now we're sitting at reserve levels of $28.5 billion, 3.9% or so of funded, 7% against the global consumer bank in terms of against balances the ICG at 1.7 even within the ICG non-investment grade is nearly 5%, 4.9% in terms of the reserves against the loan balances. We're sitting with reserves that we feel the level we feel comfortable about the level of reserves that we have, but that is for all the reasons that I described tied to the scenario that I've described for you. A scenario where we see the meaningful drop in GDP this quarter but we also see a recovery sequentially in the third quarter and unemployment start to start to fall by the fourth quarter and so to the extent that those things -- a little bit of room there I would say because I do have a management adjustment then I would expect that the first half would reflect by and large the majority of the reserves that we would need to take. And so -- and losses started to play out that we'd be utilizing that reserves in order to cover them. So hopefully that that helps.\nErikaNajarian: Yes. That helps and I'll follow up offline on normalized reserves. But I wanted to get the second question and your peer earlier today noted that we should essentially cut trading revenues in half for the second half of the year in terms of normalization and should we be doing the same for Citi for the second half of the year. And I suspect probably more applicable to the fixed side than the equity side.\nMarkMason: Yes. Look, we have seen very strong performance in our markets business and in -- FICC particular, was up 68% and we adjust for the gain that we had last year is up as much as close to a 90% little bit under 90%. So very strong performance there. We have -- I did mention in my prepared remarks that we would expect to see our markets revenue, our investment banking revenue normalized in the back half of the year and I think that certainly holds in terms of what we're expecting. And I also gave a little bit of guidance in terms of how to think about full year performance and that should hopefully inform how to kind of model our performance. And I talked about total revenues or full year revenues that are flat to down slightly with a decline in net interest revenue that's more or less offset by non-interest revenues on a full year basis. And I think if you can kind of model that out and it will, I think, reflect that normalization that I'm speaking to with regard to markets which will show up in both but you'll see a good part of the normalization in the non year.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. \nMikeMayo: Hi. I have a few questions, so I'll ask a couple then I'll re-queue at the back end, if that's okay. But Mike the one line that got me was that we will be struggling until we get a vaccine, which might be correct. Nobody really knows how this is going to play out but that's a little bit more pessimistic than some of the guidance given by others and certainly the timeframe for a vaccine is uncertain too. So I'm just trying to reconcile the comment that in the reserves are fine. It sounds like the second quarter reserve a build is a high water mark, so that's reflecting everything. On the other hand, if we have to wait until we get a vaccine and also you did mention Mexico not having the stimulus and we have had some data since the end of the quarter that looks a little bit worse. So I guess my question is, Mike, how confident are you that you've built enough reserves as of the second quarter in light of what you said about Mexico, the vaccine and what's taking place since quarter end.\nMikeCorbat: Sure. Thank you, Mike. So let me just kind of touch on the comment in terms of the vaccine. As we think of as I think of these health pandemic and not necessarily specific dates, but a broad-based timeline effectively I think of this going through four stages, containment, stabilization, normalization and ultimately a return to growth. I would describe that today the economy as we've seen the global economy, the global health pandemic is not all in the same place. We didn't enter it at the same time. We didn't have the same response either from a health or from a fiscal or monetary perspective and therefore we're going to see exit and exit rates different and we're going to actually see the numbers in terms of resurgence of COVID in some areas in different ways. I would describe right now that broadly in the world we are somewhere between containment and stabilization, right. Containment is that we can bend the curve in terms of the transmission of cases. Stabilization is that as we remove or start to take down some of the barriers or actions that were put in place. Working remotely, social distancing kind of all of those things that have been put there and as that start to get lifted that you actually don't see cases come back. And when you get to the third phase around normalization and simply put normalization to me is am I willing to get on the airliner? Am I willing to get in a subway? Am I willing to go into a crowded venue to watch a sporting event or a concert or what it may be. And I think realistically when we get to that third bucket, I just don't see that coming and I would say many don't see that coming until we feel like there's a an anti-virus vaccine that's available for the mass population around that. And so I think one of the things that people struggle with today is the disconnect in some ways between where the market is in some ways and actually where we are in terms of this health pandemic. And the number of questions that are out there. So I don't want to be pessimistic in there. I want to be a realist and I just think that in order to truly normalize that's what's necessary to do that. To the second part of your question, we've seen different responses in different ways. We've seen different health responses. We have seen different economic responses and I think the approach specific to your question in terms of Mexico is that in both cases those responses have been pretty straightforward, right. We really haven't seen the extraordinary actions that we've seen from the US or UK or some of the governments around the world. It's been much more of a BAU response and I think as part of that we're seeing that economy being hit fairly hard and it's still relatively speaking in the earlier stages and by the way that's not just Mexico, more of Latin America and other parts of the world. And I think as we forecast growth rates going forward I think our forecast right now is for a contraction of about 8% in Mexico in terms of GDP as we look forward. So the economy has been hit, will continue to be hit. That being said I think the actions that we've taken in terms of the risk approach, we've taken in terms of the ways that we have looked at and been mindful in terms of risk going into this. I think should serve us well but again I think the effects of this are likely to be felt longer in Mexico.\nMikeMayo: And the last part of my question was since quarter end you see the COVID cases increase in Florida and Texas and see what's happening in California. Any change in assumptions in the last couple weeks?\nMikeCorbat: When you say functions, Mike, what do you -- \nMikeMayo: And your assumption sorry.\nMikeCorbat: Oh assumption, I'm sorry. Sure, yes, well to me right if we want characterize what's happening in this in some cases as resurgence or the second round of this. One is I would say that we've seen both societal and behaviors changing right that I think what we've seen in these states where we've seen resurgences is in some ways a dichotomy of the population I think those that have reverted back to original protocols from the early stages of COVID and what needs to be done. And I think those that are, I think being much more for lack of better term free spirited or kind of moving forward with their lives. And I think you can see that in the spend rates that while these cases have had a resurgence, we've seen spend come back off in some of those places, but we haven't seen it necessarily go back to the lower levels of the darkest days of early COVID. I think the second thing in there and it's in all of the national health reports are that the demographics have changed. We were actually seeing and part of it can be attributed maybe to testing or more mass testing but we're actually seeing the average age of the infected population coming down round one it was in the 50 to 50year plus range on average and the last numbers I saw coming out had the most recent cases in these states actually in the mid-30s as an average. And so we're actually seeing a different demographic in there and again I think that has some impact in terms of the way people respond and what spend and what other things are. And to Mark's earlier point Mike just finishing on this, I think that what we're seeing is that the extraordinary actions of the Fed and the Treasury leave not just ours but industry models kind of wanting for more insight. But we've never seen this type of action whether it's the checks people receive, whether it's payroll protection 500 plus billion, whether it's the holiday in terms of income tax payments, but we're actually seeing a consumer in the US that actually kind of goes into this and it's not all even but in pretty good shape. Savings rates are up, obviously spending levels are down. Mark talked about some of the delinquencies and some of the positive things that we're seeing there in terms of the buckets and the roll rates. It's early but again I think as we look at a potential spike back up in some areas obviously over the weekend stimulus round two came on the table. It seems to be bipartisan and so it's likely we're going to get more from that and so again I think those things give us, I won't say comfort but give us I think a good a view based on what we've been through in terms of the consumer in particular to be able to withstand some of these variations and contagion rates as we go forward.\nMikeMayo: Sorry so a 10 second summary, your $28.5 billion reserves as we stand here at July 14 reflect all that 8% contraction in Mexico, some spending come off; some spike in cases and everything else that's out there now. It's not like the first quarter we had all this new information. The $28.5 billion is your best estimate now for your future losses under CECL.\nMikeCorbat: Yes and the one correction. The one correction I would make to that Mike is it's not -- again, we close and our view is as of the quarter end is as of June 30th but again the models are very sensitive to unemployment. They're insensitive to GDP and as we went through last quarter, as we were doing different flashes those numbers moved around. So again the models are sensitive to those inputs and my guess is as those inputs continue to change, there'll be variation but absolutely as of quarter end we are comfortable with where we set those and the reserving around that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerardCassidy: Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Mike. Mark, you gave us good detail in the slides as you pointed out on the commercial portfolio, the wholesale portfolio and you showed us some of the migration trends from AAA to BBB et cetera. Can you share with us what percentage of the corporate portfolio was reviewed and was downgraded? And second and how often do you now need to review the portfolio for potential future either upgrades or downgrades in that portfolio?\nMarkMason: Yes. So, look, we are constantly reviewing the portfolio and we ramp that up that timing up significantly as we've managed through this crisis. They're obviously, I start by saying kind of all companies all sectors have been impacted by this obviously there's some more significantly impacted than others. When I think about sectors that that drove a good portion of the reserve build that we've seen is, I think, about aviation I think about energy; I think about autos, commercial real estate to some extent and retails and retailing and that combination probably drove a third of the build that we saw. We did see significant downgrades through the quarter and you heard me reference the non-investment grade reserves sitting at 4.9% of the loan balances and so we are actively reviewing the portfolio as you would imagine. We're looking at both the 80% investment grade, the 20% non-investment grade of our balances and we're adjusting that accordingly, and we'll continue to do that through the quarter and continue to work through the entire book there, just to put it in perspective there were probably a couple thousand names that were involved in the driving of the downgrades. And so they're meaningful names and meaningful review and assessment that we go through in the quarter.\nGerardCassidy: Very good. Thank you and then as a follow-up shifting over to the consumer side, in the slides once again you gave us the relief efforts that you're making with some of your customers or forbearance. I guess you could call it in credit cards mortgage et cetera. It's a two-part question. Is there any way of you, Citigroup finding out what percentage of those customers are unemployed, but receiving enhanced unemployment benefits so that the delinquencies across in your portfolios, as well as your peers are quite low. And part of the reason possibly is due to the unemployment benefits being so beneficial to the people that are unemployed. Is there any way of carving out the higher risk components of these forbearance areas where they could end up turning into charge-offs later in the year or next year?\nMarkMason: Yes. Look, we're constantly again reviewing the portfolio but in terms of specific unemployment information that's something that we have available to us as we work with our customers and review their specific credit statistics. So we don't have that. We do have as you know the early signs of both customers who took advantage of the forbearance globally and them still paying. So we've got if you think about it globally we have 40% to 60% of the customers that were -- that are enrolled in the consumer relief programs continue to make payments and they aren't contractually obligated to do. So almost 50% in branded cards and 40% in retail and again high numbers around the globe. So that is a good sign that people are benefiting from the program and taking those benefits and applying them to their exposures and the other important stat that I think is a good indicator and probably gets a little bit closer to what you're trying to get a sense for is that the first time enrollment volumes have come down significantly, while we're offering reenrollment, the rates are running below expectation. They are kind of in the mid-teens so to speak or but around there and more than half of the total enrollments that it rolled off to date and over 80% of those remain current. And so we're seeing good signs of those rolling off enrollment continuing to remain current, which we think is a positive indicator. That said we've said it a couple of times on the call now there's still some uncertainty, fair amount of uncertainty out there in terms of how this thing continues to evolve. But the good leading indicators between purchase sales, between re-enrollment levels, between continued payment both on and off the programs.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. \nJohnMcDonald: Thank you. Mark, I was hoping you could drill down a little bit on the outlook for consumer revenues. You mentioned the outlook for continued pressure on the top-line there. Just wondering it sound like maybe you're seeing some improvement in Asia, you're down 15% revenues in the quarter but sound like maybe a little bit improvement there. Latin America wasn't sure so maybe just a little bit of dimensioning what you see in the outlook for consumer revenues international and domestic.\nMarkMason: Yes. Sure. So, look, I mean I think that we're going to continue to see pressure on the consumer revenue line. And I think that as you know if you think, if we could be just kind of taken in pieces very quickly in the US, our branded cards, our retail services, the unemployment stats are very important indicators for those businesses what those stats are. We've seen -- while we've seen improvement in purchase sales, they're still down in the 20s year-over-year and so we do expect that we will see continued pressure on the loan activity there and so and as a result continued top-line pressure on the consumer business domestically. Similarly when I look at Asia for example, there we have a large card business. We're focused on the wealth segment there again purchase sales are still under pressure there. The nature of that activity and card skews towards travel and I commented on the prospect of travel recovering and what that looks like in the future and so we'd expect to see continued pressure in Asia. Similarly, there's pressure in the insurance business that's there in light of the face-to-face interaction that's involved. And in Mexico as well just given the GDP deceleration. So I think consumer will continue to have some top-line pressure. I think the underlying indicators there are still strong for us in terms of the deposit growth; in terms of the engagement; in terms of the digital access in use of our offering. And so we've got good indicators including investment AUMs in Asia that show positive signs as we come out of this. But as we're managing through it we're going to have top-line pressure there.\nJohnMcDonald: In Latin America just to finish it up?\nMarkMason: Yes. So in Latin America and in Mexico specifically as Mike suggested we're seeing a continued pressure from a GDP point of view. They are later in the cycle in terms of addressing or managing through this COVID-19 situation. There's likely to be some continued pressure on employment there. And so I think there's going to be top-line pressure in Latin America consumer, Mexico in particular as we go through this as well. That said I feel good about where we're positioned. We kind of started to dial back lending activity a little bit in some of the prior quarters. I think we're well positioned from a reserve point of view and I think we're positioned for when Mexico recovers from this to continue to kind of gain ground there given some of the investments we've made in the prior years.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.\nBrianKleinhanzl: Great. Thanks. Maybe just a quick question for Mike. I know there's been a lot changes in Hong Kong so a big piece of your portfolio and what are the operations over there? Is there any change and how you're thinking about the business there? And how you think about that in a go forward basis to start?\nMikeCorbat: Yes. Brian, I would say one is that I think as we look at the region you can't just look at Hong Kong. I think you've got to take a bit of a broader view and the word I would use is that it's complex right. We've got the combination of a sideline trade deal with China; you've got the interaction between China and Hong Kong. You've got the recent announcement or creation of this new national security law which is I think fairly specific in terms of calling out financial support in terms of China against its sovereignty with significant penalties around that. And so I think we've got to be mindful of all those. From our perspective, we've been in Hong Kong a long time. It's an important place. It's our Asian hub as we operate in a number of countries there. And I would say a couple important things as to that. One is we do obeyed local laws; second is that our goal really is to be there to support our clients. And that we're fairly used to operating in charged or complex environments and as part of that I think we have found both the Hong Kong government and the HKMA and others very supportive of our business and our approach. And at the same time we have I think received the same support from China and haven't in any way kind of received restrictions or other things from them. So obviously it's something we pay close attention to. It's important to us but obviously we're committed to being there and obviously are monitoring things closely.\nBrianKleinhanzl: In a separate question. And Mark mentioned that in the retail services that there was some pressure from partner payments. So are those higher partner payments fully in the run rate now or should we expect those to kind of increase on a go-forward basis and what were those exactly? Thanks.\nMarkMason: Sure. So as you know, we've got a number of partners that make up our retail services partner business and many of these arrangements call for the sharing of profitability. So contractual profitability of sharing between us and the partners and we will determine that based on our outlook in any given quarter for the balance of the year. And so we make an estimate for what we think profitability will look like and then we obviously account for the share that goes to the partner in the revenue line. That profitability estimate excludes ACLs so the reserves that we've been building. It does include any NCLs that we realize and so important to note that again when we're calculating that the lifetime reserves that we're building despite the fact that we'll share them when they become losses that's excluded from the profitability estimate. And so essentially what's happened and what's caused part of the drag on retail services is that we've seen the losses that we expect from retail services push out beyond kind of 2020. As I mentioned earlier, we see good signs in some of the early buckets and as such our view as to when those losses will actually come through as NCLs has been pushed out into 2021. As a result, the 2021 view on profitability for some of these partners is going up and therefore the amount of sharing has increased thus putting pressure on the top line. To answer the other part of the question, so we believe at this stage based on our view for the balance of the year that we've accounted for the level of profit sharing that we would expect, but as things evolve we would need to adjust accordingly.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.\nSaulMartinez: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So, Mark, I want to go back to CECL and get your perspective on the stickiness of CECL reserves as its charge off start to happen. And I guess the willingness to release reserves that I think we've all been focused on reserve builds, when we see the peak in reserves and less focus on what happens in the cadence and pace of releasing reserves and declines in reserves as the actual loss start to occur. And I mean as you know CECL kind of works backwards every given quarter you need to -- you estimate when you built your lifetime losses are in portfolio, your charge-offs and kind of back into a plug with loan loss provisions. So I'm curious given all the uncertainty that we are -- we still have and will likely continue to see whether as you start to see charge-off start to materialize and whatever the fourth quarter or the beginning part of next year in the more material way whether there's sort of a bias to maybe maintain reserve levels at fairly high levels and not necessarily release reserves because even if we're not -- even if reserve releases are happening or we're not building reserves as charge-offs happen that could imply that provision credit costs remain pretty high for a while. So I'm curious whether you think there will be sort of hesitancy or a natural inclination to kind of wait it out and have a little bit more stickiness in the reserve levels and until we get more clarity and all of the things going on in the world.\nMarkMason: I think it largely depends on our outlook at that point in time in that given quarter. I mean it's just know -- there's no other way for me to kind of explain it when we get into the -- like we're in the third quarter now as we go through the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we will have a view a forward-looking view and if that forward-looking view is still meaningfully uncertain to worse than it was in the second quarter then we will likely continue to have to adjust reserves accordingly. If that forward looking view is better, we can -- or the same for that matter, it will support the release activity that you're alluding to. And that's the way I think about it. I think that's how it's probably going to work.\nSaulMartinez: Okay. Got it. I guess maybe just getting more granular even that I guess if there's -- if your baseline economic you -- I know you only use one scenario your baseline has a change or even not maybe getting a little bit better but you still have a high degree of uncertainty in potential in the range of outcomes. Some of which were far worse. I would assume that your qualitative adjustments will factor that in some way shape or form is that and that's reflected?\nMarkMason: That's right. So I mean it the way we think about the qualitative piece now as you know we cover kind of a 15% probability that the recovery is worse or slower right. And that has an impact or an implied higher unemployment et cetera. And so if we view things as getting better we would toggle that probability so to speak to adjust the way we think about the management adjustment that should be there.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKenUsdin: Thanks. Good morning. First question just on expenses, Mark, you've done a very nice job this year keeping the level flat and that $10.4 billion, $10.5 billion zone through the first half you've got $3billion more revenue and flat expenses and I heard you point earlier that you expected to keep it flattish from here given that we'll see a likely decline in second half revenues from here though can you talk about just what optionality you do have to adjust the cost base lower given your point about supporting employees, investing in technology and then the pushes and pulls of compensation and staff levels et cetera. Thanks.\nMarkMason: Sure. Thank you. So I guess a couple things. One is as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that I do expect that we will maintain our full year expenses roughly flattish. And that's what we're kind of managing to and part of that against revenues that are flat to slightly down and if you think about what we're managing through in the midst of this crisis, we've got a lot of puts and takes. So we've got some headwinds that kind of fall into a bunch of different categories including the things we do to support our employees including building out our collection capabilities, including enhancing our fraud detection capabilities all of which I think are important to ensuring that we're managing through this crisis in a thoughtful and responsible way. Sanitization of buildings, ensuring that people have remote access and the equipment to support that all of those things come with cost. Cost that we were not planning for in the year. There are obviously some tailwind. So we've got marketing expenses that you heard me mentioned we've dialed back. We've got T&E expenses because people are doing more Zoom than they are traveling to meet with clients. And so you've got some tailwind there that offset that but net-net when you think about those expenses they are headwinds for us. We also have investments that we will continue to make. Investments in technology, investments in enhancing our digital capabilities which have proven to be quite valuable as we've managed through this crisis. Investment in infrastructure and controls that ensure that we not only protect the franchise but we're improving our efficiency in operations and improving the quality of our data et cetera, et cetera and then we've got productivity initiatives and the other levers that pull or that we do pull quite naturally with revenues. And so the compensation expenses obviously will adjust accordingly. The transaction expenses will adjust with how we see volumes move and we'll continue to deliver on our productivity savings in the way of right placement and reducing our number of centers and the like and so, yes, they're levers but they're also meaningful headwinds and that's kind of how I get to that outlook of roughly flattish as we manage through this particular year.\nKenUsdin: Got it. Thank you. My second question just on capital. This year you've been bound a little bit more on CET1 by the advanced approaches with advanced RWAs a little bit higher than standardized. It's only about 20 basis points but as we get into the SCB construct can you do anything to optimize the advanced RWAs vis-\u00e0-vis the standardized approach and how much of a focus will that be?\nMarkMason: Yes. Look, I mean we're part of a big part of kind of what's driving the advanced -- the down grades that are associated with the prices that we're managing through. And so that is a factor that's likely to persist for a while and we're actively managing and optimizing the balance sheet to identify ways to impact or reduce that persuaded assets and aid in the calculation here of the CET1 and but that is the headwind that we've got to manage. Now what I point out is that the regulatory minimum for CET1 in both on standardized and advances are running at about 10%. And so we sit on an advanced basis at a ratio as Mike and I've said at 11.5%. So we're still 150 basis points above that regulatory minimum, which we think gives us room to manage through this period of uncertainty and a range of different outcomes. It also gives us room if you think about some of the additional stress analysis that's in front of us in the industry. So, yes, advance; yes a byproduct of the prices were in, yes we're constantly looking to manage it effectively where that makes sense and where we can continue to serve our clients in a way that is great for the franchise.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJimMitchell: Good morning. Mark, maybe just can you help us unpack a little bit the -- how we think about the trajectory of NII? What would -- how do you deposit, flight to safety deposits have been stickier than I would have thought still seeing growth in deposits. What are your assumptions I guess around balance sheet growth and NIM? Where do you see kind of NIM bottoming out? Those kind of things would be I think helpful and just understanding your assumptions and versus ours.\nMarkMason: Yes. So, look, we kind of mentioned in my opening remarks that we obviously saw NIM decline some 31 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And that's a combination again of lower rates, loan mix shift that we've seen so lower NIM cards in higher ICG in terms of that mix and the balance sheet expansion which is really a reflection of the strong growth in deposits in the solid liquidity position that we have. And so when I think about that dynamic we are likely to continue to see as I mentioned pressure on our cards lending activity around the globe. We're likely to kind of continue to see rates kind of impact some of our banking businesses, businesses like TTS and the like. And as a result, I think that we'll continue to see some pressure on the NIM line in the outer quarters but again I'd point you back to the total revenue forecast that I've given because obviously there are other components here. And that is getting back to flattish to slightly down.\nJimMitchell: I mean that's all fair. I just was curious if you're assuming a flattish balance sheet or further growth. Obviously, I've heard your comments on some of the pressures just try to figure out what your base case assumption is for the balance sheet.\nMarkMason: Yes and then the balance sheet will see, they'll likely be some growth in the balance sheet but that will be driven by the client demand that we see out there and our ability to meet that. But we will likely see some continued growth in the balance sheet from a GAAP asset point of view.\nJimMitchell: Okay. Just as a follow up on capital. I mean what is your, Mike, do you think you need to see getting back to your earlier comments need to see a vaccine before banks can sort of confidently return to buybacks or do you think it just -- you just need to have a little more macros, stable macro data. How do you think about returning to buybacks given your capital position? Obviously you can't do it in the third quarter but beyond that.\nMikeCorbat: Yes. I think it's based on as we look and project forward what we see from an economic perspective and obviously what's going on in the economy both consumer and institutional. And how we're projecting loss and loss rates that going forward and do we feel comfortable about the trajectory of the pandemic and using my timeline do we feel like we're somewhere in that stabilization moving to normalization, right. So I think in here there's the fear that as we get into colder weather maybe that's now been debunked with Florida and Texas and others. But in the fall maybe we start to see resurgence and some of these things spike up. I think we'd like to see this roll over and hence have some comfort that we've got the ability to keep it down. And that again we see a better sense. I'm not sure what the new normal is but we see a better sense of normalcy whatever that is returning to the global economy.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.\nCharlesPeabody: Good morning. A couple of questions regarding your capital, your tax position and how it affects your capital. First in the stress test, I believe the CARES ACT provided some capital relief around your tax position. I was wondering if that was true. And if you could size that and secondly going forward if tax rates are raised as Biden suggests, how much would that enhance your CET1 ratio? And then finally, I think Jamie Dimon this morning implied that he would love to restart buyback sometime in the fourth quarter after the election. I was curious if you saw buybacks as a regulatory issue or a political issue. Thank you.\nMikeCorbat: Okay. In terms of the CARES ACT, there is a benefit associated with that. I don't think that it is significant in our case to the CET1 ratio. But I don't have that specific number in front of me. In terms of the tax rate and the prospect of the rollback of taxes that will come with many puts and takes including the impact to the DTA and other things that we have across the firm. And so I apologize I don't have the exact math on that but we can n certainly kind of been beneficial. \nCharlesPeabody: But you would have to write up your NOL by billions of dollars, is that correct? I would add by --\nMikeCorbat: We would have to make a number of adjustments such as that would add to capital. \nCharlesPeabody: Go ahead.\nMikeCorbat: I was going to say, Charles, the other piece that you've seen in our tax rate is given the breadth of our business we haven't necessarily enjoyed the benefit that the more you fully US-centric institutions have had. And so again ours would be the blend of the US versus international and in that tax rate going up again I don't think we would go back to a global taxation system. We would say a territorial system which again vis-\u00e0-vis some US counterparties could on a relative basis would probably be to our benefit. And I think to your final point, I view when the US industry made the decision to go ahead and to stop buybacks, it was not political; it was done, we thought from a prudence perspective of the right thing not knowing what to expect going into this. I don't view this today as being political. I view it as and as the Fed has said it will ultimately be our choice to come back into reinstate buybacks at the right time. And again as we said in the previous questions, we'll be monitoring that and when the time is right we'll be back in there filing to re-begin or to begin the buybacks.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. \nBetsyGraseck: Hi. Good morning. Two quick questions. One on Mexico, I know, a couple years back you invested something around $1 billion in the infrastructure there and I'm wondering is that investment finished, completed and is it now in the run rate or does that represent a level of funding that could then come out and pay for other things as an efficiency opportunity is basically the question.\nMarkMason: So, yes, we did announce an investment a number of years ago. We are largely through that if we got this somewhere probably 80% or somewhere on through having deployed that investment. What is left it does serve as a lever for us that we reconsider as we take on these decisions. And just keep in mind those investments were made in building out enhancing our technology and branches and digital capabilities and the like and so I think they have certainly been beneficial. But we are largely through that and what's left is available to us to the toggle as we need to do.\nBetsyGraseck: Okay and then as I flip to the US could you give us an update on where you are with the efforts to drive deposit growth in the US? I mean I obviously see that deposit growth was up not only in the US but in International in the quarter. But I'm really kind of honing in here on the consumer side and you had had the announcement around some partnerships with American Airlines and with Google and so I just like to understand where you are in that strategy and do you think that there's anything that you can do to drive up the consumer deposit growth in the back half of this year and into next?\nMarkMason: Yes. So we've had very good consumer deposit growth, excuse me, through the quarter. I think that we benefited from the investments that we've made in our digital capabilities, as you've seen the digital deposit sales grow meaningfully as high as $12 billion as we ended the quarter. And we continue to see those benefits play out both in our market and outside of our markets, which, as you know, has been part of our strategy to ensure that we are leveraging the breadth of our customer base in cards that has a broader presence in the U.S. than we do in terms of the Retail Banking footprint. And so, we continue to see those benefits of the strategy play out. Some of that is fueled by some of the things that I've mentioned earlier in terms of the stimulus that's out there and the delay in terms of tax payments, but nonetheless we've been able to capture upside from both new and existing clients, and we expect to continue to do that through the balance of the year. I'd also highlight -- I know your question was around consumer, specifically, but I would also highlight that we're also seeing very good continued traction on the institutional side in our TTS franchise. And that growth in many ways is, as we've seen and worked very closely with our corporate clients to shore up their liquidity positions, whether it was early on where they were drawing all in lines or in the quarter where we partnered with those same clients to access the capital markets, we've been kind of that partner of choice, that flight to quality on both the consumer side in the U.S. and internationally as well as the institutional side.\nBetsyGraseck: Yes. I know I figured that institution was extremely strong. I'm just wondering out of that -- it does -- is there more room for the consumer to accelerate and kind of move it forward from here?\nMarkMason: And on the consumer, you've seen it in both the U.S., you've seen it in Mexico, you've seen it in Asia. We've had strong consumer growth across all of the regions. But we are pleased with the growth that we're seeing here. Mike, do you want to add something?\nMikeCorbat: Yes. Sure. The other piece Betsy is that, I think very consistent with what we've spoken about in the past of that $12 billion that Mark mentioned, two-thirds, which again is a pretty stable number for us, is coming from outside our branch footprint, which we obviously play -- we pay close attention to, given our branch model.\nBetsyGraseck: Two-thirds of the growth in consumer is coming from outside of the branch footprint.\nMikeCorbat: Two-thirds of the digital growth is coming from outside the branch footprint.\nOperator: Your final question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMikeMayo: Hi. Thanks for letting me have my follow-up questions. I just say -- so just to be clear, so you are not guiding for positive operating leverage this year, Mark, because earlier you said expenses flat to down, and then you said flat. And it sounds like your guess, and I know there are a lot of COVID costs that make this a difficult year, but -- so no positive operating leverage this year?\nMarkMason: Yes. I'd repeat what I said earlier which revenues are kind of slightly down and expenses flattish, right.\nMikeMayo: Okay. I guess -- and as far as the equities business you guys didn't participate as much as others. And help me with this logic. I mean you had the corporate draw-downs in March that was replaced with the fixed income markets. And now, maybe we have a reequification with more equity activities, and then one of your competitors showed a lot of pickup in equities. You talked about normalization in capital markets. Do you expect equities to improve? You recognized under performance is a timing thing. How do you think about that?\nMarkMason: So I would say, one is, let's kind of break the business into a few different buckets. So one, I would say that our cash trading performance was good. It was strong. And I would say that, again, it's early to see, but we did not do as well in either of Prime or Delta One -- Prime Finance, Delta One derivatives. From equification perspective, if you actually look into our capital markets numbers, you see a very strong number in ECM that our ECM business was up 56% on a year-over-year basis. So in terms of the capital raising aspects of it, we were quite active in most of the headline deals that were done. And so again, cash trading okay. We'll see where things come out, but not as good performance in derivatives, Delta One, Prime Finance and a strong performance in terms of ECM.\nMikeMayo: And then just a summary question. Through the course of this call, your stock price went down. You're underperforming the BKX. It's just one day. I know stocks move. Don't read too much into that. But there is, I think a feeling that I'm getting that either your -- being more maybe realistic pragmatic about the realities of the world out there, and that goes back to -- you mentioned about the vaccine. You're seeing something specific to your franchise that gives you more caution or maybe, me and others are just interpreting your comments too negatively. I just say that because when you talk about the revenues, the NIM was down 31 basis points. It still goes lower. You talked about the consumer being under pressure, less partner payments, Retail Services, ICG normalizes ahead, TTS gets hurt by lower rates, you won't have positive operating leverage and expenses, the loan losses, you have Mexico with COVID, and we are only somewhere between containment and stabilization and no buybacks for some time to come. So those are all -- that's a summary of some of the negatives that you had from this call. So maybe that was unintentional or maybe that was intentional. So this is kind of a last chance to either put some positives on the other side, like with digital banking or deposit growth or things like that or to say you know what, I'm actually in the camp where this is going to be a long road and maybe you differ from the rest of the world.\nMarkMason: Well, I would start off Mike and say that it is not our intention to be negative. I think we're all in this together and I would certainly say that the unknowns outweigh the knowns. And if somebody has the crystal ball, I would love to see it. But I think what we are seeing and what we've described coming through four very challenging months, is the first half of 2020 with revenues up 8%, expenses flat, our ability to absorb significant reserve builds under the new format of CECL, broad scale or wide-ranging engagement from our clients. I think you will continue to see in the numbers as they settle that we continue to take market share, we've continued to build capital, we've continued to build liquidity and feel very good about where we are and how we're going into the second half of the year. The unknowns are the unknowns. We don't know. And that in there, we're seeing resurgences in places where cases had been down, and they've come back up. And the U.S. is uneven in the approaches and the rest of the world has been uneven. And so again, I would say we go in feeling very well positioned against this. But we don't want people leaving the call simply thinking that the world is a great place and it is a V-shape recovery. It's our view that we will see V, we will see U, we will see W. And as an institution, we need to be prepared to deal with all of it. And I think you've seen across our businesses while in certain areas, revenues have been under pressure that we've managed through this very well so far. And I'm really proud of the team in terms of what they've done. But again, I don't think anybody should leave any bank earnings call this quarter simply feeling like the worst is absolutely behind us and it's a rosy path ahead. So, feel good about where we are. The environments are unknown. I think the actions we've taken so far have been spot on. And I think we're well positioned for what the future brings.\nOperator: This concludes today's second quarter 2020 earnings review. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 4. Citigroup reported second quarter net income of $1.3 billion which included a $5.6 billion increase in credit reserve this quarter, primarily reflecting the deterioration in the economic outlook since the end of the first quarter under CECL and downgrades in the corporate loan portfolio. The reserve bill also includes an additional qualitative management adjustment to reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and/or a somewhat slower recovery. Revenues of $19.8 billion grew by 5% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher fixed income and investment banking records. Expenses were down slightly year-over-year resulting in positive operating leverage and a 13% improvement in operating margin. Credit costs were $7.9 billion this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 9% for the second quarter reflecting a higher relative impact from tax advantage investments and other tax benefit items given the lower level of EBIT. Looking at results for the first half of 2020, we delivered net eight number $3.8 billion even as we increase credit reserves by $10.5 billion under the CECL framework given the current environment. We grew revenues by 8% predominantly reflecting continued strength in our markets and investment banking businesses, while we held expenses flat year-over-year allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and a 20% increase in operating margin. In constant dollars end-of-period loans were 1% year-over-year to $685 billion reflecting growth in our institutional businesses mostly offset by the impact of lower spending activity in our consumer business. Deposits grew 20% reflecting engagement with clients and flight to quality so to speak across both the institutional and consumer franchises, which serve to strengthen our available liquidity. We maintain a strong capital and liquidity position which has been critical to our ability to support our clients as they manage through this crisis. As of June 30th, our CET1 capital ratio was 11.5%, 150 basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement. We had close to $900 billion in available liquidity and including the additional reserves taking this quarter, credit reserves stand at roughly $28 billion with the reserve ratio of 3.89% of funded loans. With the level of capital, liquidity and the reserve we hold today plus significant pre provision earnings power seen through the first half of the year, we continue to operate from a position of strength. And as we discussed last quarter, we're combining this financial strength with operational resiliency which allows us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis. Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 7% as strong deposit growth was more than offset by lower loan volumes and lower interest rates across all regions. And expenses decreased 8% as lower volume related expenses reduction in marketing and other discretionary spending and efficiency savings were partially offset by increases in COVID-19 related expenses. Total credit cost of $3.9 billion were up significantly from last year, including a reserve build of proximately $2 billion driven by the deterioration in the economic outlook. Slide 6 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Second quarter revenues of $4.7 billion were down 5% from last year. During the quarter we continued to focus on providing assistance to help customers impacted by COVID-19. Since the crisis began, we have provided relief to more than 2 million accounts representing roughly 6% of our aggregate balances across cards and mortgages. In a hopeful sign, many of those same customers have continue to make their regular payments during the second quarter although we realized it -- and to date over half of our current enrollees have rolled off the program with more than 80% of these customers remaining current. While reenrollment rates remain below expectations and about the mid-teens. Turning now to the businesses starting with cards. Branded Cards revenues of $2.2 billion were up 1% year-over-year as lower purchase sales and lower average loans were offset by a favorable mix shift towards interest earning balances which supported net increase revenues. As seen across the industry purchase sales declined significantly down 21% in the second quarter. However, in recent weeks we have seen signs of improvement with purchase sale down to the low double digits year-over-year in June compared to a 30% decline in April. Average loans declined 7% reflecting lower sales activity. We also took credit actions during the quarter including a pause in proactive marketing and a reduction in credit line increases and BAL con activity as examples. We believe these risk actions are proven given the current environment but they are likely to result in more pressure on interest earnings balances in the second half of the year. Retail Services revenues of $1.4 billion were down 13% year-over-year reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments. Net interest revenues were down 7% as average loans declined by 6% on lower purchase sale activity. Purchase sales were down 25% year-over-year in the second quarter but similar to Branded Cards we saw improvement in the month of June with the pace of sales declines flowing to the mid-teens. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year. As we have discussed in the past, Retail Services revenues are shown net up payments related to income sharing arrangements with our retail partners, which can vary quarter-to-quarter based on the overall mix and profit outlook for our portfolios. Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 3% year-over-year as the benefit of stronger deposit volume and an improvement in mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Our deposit momentum continues to improve with average deposits of 14% driven by a combination of environmental factors including the delay of tax payments, stimulus payments and a reduction in overall spending, as well as our continued strategic efforts to drive organic growth. Digital deposit sales accelerated even as we continue to adjust pricing given the current rate environment with digital deposits growing by $3 billion this quarter to a total of nearly $12 billion. We also saw strong engagement with existing clients driving balanced growth across deposit products including checking which grew 13% year-over-year. Total expenses for North America consumer were down 10% year-over-year as reductions in marketing and other discretionary expenses along with efficiency saving and lower volume related costs more than offset incremental COVID-19 related expenses. Turning to Credit. Total Credit cost of $3 billion increased significantly from last year as we built roughly $1.5 billion in reserves this quarter reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook, partially offset by the impact of a change in accounting for third-party collection fees. On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollar. In Asia, revenues declined 15% year-over-year in the second quarter. Cards revenues declined by 22% reflecting lower activity levels with purchase sales down 29% year-over-year. We're seeing a disproportionate impact on Asia card revenues from lower travel spend in the region given our affluent client base and a greater proportion of fee revenues coming from travel related interchange and foreign transaction fees. We also saw an impact on customer acquisition in products like insurance which rely more heavily on face-to-face engagement. However, average deposit will remains strong at 10% this quarter albeit at lower deposit spreads, reflecting a flight to quality as well as continued client engagement across the franchise. While investment revenues were down this quarter, we saw continued underlying growth in our wealth management drivers with 6% growth in Citigold clients and 10% growth in net new money versus last year. Today, we are seeing some early signs that were pick up an activity with purchase sales declined moderating and net new money and investment sales show a material improvement in June versus prior month. But the shape to recovery remains fluid. Turning to Latin America. Total consumer revenues declined 7% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter with average balances of 9%. However, revenues were impacted by lower purchase sales and loan volume as well as lower deposit spreads in the current environment. In total, operating expenses for international business were down 4% in the second quarter, reflecting efficiency savings and lower volume related expenses and cost of credit increased to $883 million. Slide 8 provides additional detail on Global Consumer credit trend. Credit loss rates generally trended upwards this quarter as a result of the macroeconomic slowdown. Although this was much more a function of the lower loan balances as it is still too early to see a pronounced impact from COVID-19 on our net credit losses. 90 plus day delinquency rates improved in the US despite the lower balances has reduced spending combined with the benefit of significant government stimulus and our own customer relief efforts has generated liquidity which has been used to pay down debt even in the later delinquency buckets. Earlier stage delinquencies are also improved given the additional liquidity and the impact of relief efforts although it is still early and there is still significant uncertainty around the timing of the economic recovery and how customers will perform once these relief and stimulus programs start to roll off. Delinquency rates were up slightly in Asia, although still at modest and absolute levels. And in Mexico, we saw a more significant impact as COVID-19 is still peaking in that market and customers are not benefiting from the same level of government stimulus. Turning now to Institutional Clients Group on Slide 9. Revenues of $12.1 billion increased 21% in second quarter and were up 25% excluding a roughly $350 million pretax gain on our investment in trade wealth in the prior year as strong performance in fixed income, investment banking and the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in GTS, corporate lending and security services. The quarter was also impacted by $431 million of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads tightened during the quarter. During the quarter, we continue to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses. And we've been actively helping our clients navigate through this uncertain environment. In TTS, we continue to work with our clients to sustain their operations, manage their supply chain and optimize their working capital and liquidity. We will continue to see momentum in our digital efforts as evidenced by strong growth in Citi direct users and digital account opening, which further deepen our relationship with our clients. In markets, we saw record volumes as we supported our clients, leveraging our Citi velocity platform and electronic execution capability. And similar to the first quarter, we actively made markets to both our corporate and investor clients as we help them navigate through volatile macroeconomic conditions.  In Investment Banking, clients remained focus on both sources and usage of short-term and long-term liquidity. We continue to provide new loans and facilitate additional draws for clients looking to bolster liquidity. However, we also saw significant repayments which led to the sequential decline in end-of-period loan and corporate lending. And we continue to hope our clients access capital markets which drove further share gain. I'd note that investment grade debt underwriting is up 131% year-over-year as we continue to help our clients' source liquidity in this evolving environment.  Turning now to the results for the businesses starting with Banking. Total Banking revenues of $5.7 billion increased 4%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were down 11% as reported and 7% in constant dollars as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rate and lower commercial cards revenues. Our average deposits were 30% in constant dollars. We had strong growth in our instant payment and API volume and our cross-border flow were resilient despite the significant macro slowdown. All of which give us confidence in the underlying health of the franchise. Investment Banking revenues of $1.8 billion were up 37% from last year outperforming the market wallet and delivering the highest revenue quarter since the financial crisis. Results reflected strong growth in both debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by M&A.  Private Bank revenues of $956 million grew 10% driven by increased capital market activity as well as higher lending and deposit volume, partially offset by lower deposits spreads. Corporate Lending revenues of $646 million were down 11% as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spread. Total Market and Securities Services of $6.9 billion increased 48% year-over-year. Fixed Income revenues of $5.6 billion grew 68% reflecting strong performance across rates and currencies, spread products and commodity. Equities revenues of $770 million were down 40% versus last year as solid performance in cash equities was more than offset by lower revenues and derivatives and Prime Finance reflecting a more challenging environment. And finally, in Security Services, revenues were down 9% on reported basis and 5% in constant dollars as higher deposit volume were more than offset by lower spread. Total operating expenses of $5.9 billion increased 7% year-over-year as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher compensation cost, continued investment and volume driven growth.  Total credit cost of $3.9 billion was up significantly from last year. We built roughly $3.5 billion in reserves this quarter. The increase in reserves reflected the impact of changes in the economic outlook, as well as downgrades in the corporate loan portfolio during the quarter. As of quarter end, our overall funding reserve ratio was 1.71% including 4.9% on the non-investment grade. We provide more detail on the corporate portfolio in the appendix of our earnings presentation. Total non accrual loans increased $1.5 billion sequentially this quarter reflecting the current environment with roughly half of the increase coming from smaller size exposure. Overall, we remained vigilant and managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we saw out there today.  Slide 10 shows the results of the Corporate/Others. Revenues of $290 million declined significantly from last year reflecting the wind down of legacy assets and the impact of lower rates partially offset by AFS gains gain as well as positive marks on legacy security, as spreads tightened during the quarter. Expenses were down slightly as the wind down of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs as well as incremental cost associated with COVID-19. And the pretax loss of $343 million this quarter reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, as well as lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trend. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.1 billion this quarter declined $580 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances, partially offset by higher trading-related NIR and the improved mix in branded cards that I mentioned earlier. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $250 million, mainly reflecting the lower rate environment, partially offset by higher trading related NIR and the absence of an episodic one-time item. The net interest margin declined 31 basis points sequentially with lower net interest revenues, driving roughly one-third of the decline and the remainder representing balance sheet growth, reflecting an increase in liquid assets, driven by higher deposits as we accommodated the needs of our clients while also strengthening our own liquidity in the current environment. Turning to non-interest revenue. In the second quarter, a strong performance in trading and investment banking drove a significant increase year-over-year. As we look to the third quarter, we expect both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues to decline year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19 as well as normalization in investment banking activities. On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio improved to 11.5%, primarily reflecting the decline in risk-weighted assets. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.7% primarily reflecting the benefit of the temporary relief granted by the FRB. And our tangible book value per share declined slightly to $71.15 reflecting the debt-valuation adjustment DVA impact to OCI, as Citi's credit spreads tightened during the quarter. During the quarter, we also received our stress test results including our preliminary stress capital buffer, SCB, requirement of 2.5%. Incorporating this SCB and a GSIB surcharge of 3% results in a minimum regulatory requirement of 10%. In summary, the environment remains challenging this quarter, but we continue to perform well. We ended the period with a strong capital and liquidity position. The underlying business performance this quarter remained solid, and we were able to absorb the significant reserve build with strong results in our markets and investment banking businesses. Overall client engagement remains strong, bolstered by increased digital acquisition and engagement. And while our consumer business has been impacted by COVID-19 related lower levels of activity, we have seen a pick up through the quarter. That said, we did see a significant headwind from the full quarter impact of the lower rate environment. Looking to the third quarter and the rest of 2020, we expect the environment to continue to remain challenging and uncertain. On the top line, we expect to see continued pressure in consumer, reflecting the impact of rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19. And we would also expect the low rate environment to continue to weigh on our core businesses in ICG. Our markets and investment banking businesses should reflect broader industry trends. That said, we would expect normalization relative to the first half. Based on our best estimate, we would expect these headwinds in the back half of the year to result in full year revenues that are flat to down slightly, with the decline in net interest revenues more or less offset by non-interest revenues on a full year basis. On the expense side, we remain focused on protecting our employees and supporting our customers. And we continue to feel good about the investments we are making, particularly in our digital capabilities and infrastructure and control. That said we continue to explore all opportunities to operate more efficiently to fund these investments and offset headwinds created by COVID-19. And overall, we still expect expenses to be flattish to down slightly for the full year. Turning to credit. We do expect a higher level of losses going forward, given our current outlook. However, this should be offset by the release of existing reserves. Of course, the overall level of reserve in the back half of the year remains dependent on the environment relative to our current outlook. So to wrap up, we are preparing for range of outcomes and remain confident in our ability to maintain our overall strength and stability, as well as continue to support our customers.  With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Yes. This is Mark. Good morning, Glenn. Look, I'd say a couple of things we're seeing take place. We're obviously managing through a crisis here and what we've seen is we've seen less purchase sale activity, less loan volume take place and frankly less new card acquisitions both on the branded side as well as the retail side. And in light of that, in light of the environment that we're in we've dialed back the marketing spend. we've dialed back bal con and the like and what happens as you know is that as you dial back that level of spending you in the future you don't get the increase in average interest earning balances, loan balances that ultimately drive forward-looking revenues. And so the comment there is simply meant to suggest as we prudently manage through this crisis. We've needed to dial back. We've decided to dial back that's been and I think what's critically important is that we turn that back on as this crisis turns around and that's the way we're kind of planning so that we start to get those promotional balances peaking back up as the economy turns as GDP turns as unemployment falls. And we can start growing those balances again. So that mix as you know is very important. It'll be pressured as we manage through this, but then we want to be very responsive to the economy as it changes which is slightly different from the way it was handled in the past. Yes. Let me try and dimension that a little bit because I think it's important first to kind of understand how we approach the CECL modeling. And then I'll share with you the variables, the key variables that we used in the in the second quarter here specifically. So remember as we approach CECL we've got to take a view on the forward look of the economic environment. And the way we've approached that is we've established models to in order to forecast those reserve levels. And we use one scenario for that we use a base scenario for the modeling of that. In addition to that base scenario, which drives the quantitative output in the way of the level of reserves, we have a quantitative approach that drives a management adjustment and that management adjustment is designed to account for the economic uncertainty and the prospect of a more severe stress or a slower recovery. And so those two components become important to how we've established the reserve both in the first quarter and in the second quarter. In the first quarter -- sorry the second quarter to more specifically to your question, the basic economic forecast called for U.S unemployment peaking at roughly 15% or so in the second quarter and GDP falling 35% plus quarter-over-quarter. Now what's important is the shape and the pace of the recovery including whether we see a significant second wave of the virus or what impact the crisis has on broader employment et cetera and our base scenario as GDP recovering sequentially in the third quarter and beyond and bring, call it, under 10% by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 and then trending down from that through the fourth quarter of 2021. And these assumptions kind of assume a potential second wave but one that is controlled, it assumes appropriate fiscal response if needed to maintain that pace of recovery but there's a lot of uncertainty there. And that that kind of drives the quantitative approach and then we consider the probability of an alternative downside scenario. And we build additional reserves as appropriate to that and so if you think about our total reserves, which show up on page 20 I think which stand at about $28.5 billion in terms of the ACL reserves that includes roughly a $2.2 billion or so $2.3 billion or so additional management adjustment to account for the possibility of a more adverse outcome. And so that -- so hopefully that helps. We've got a very specific base scenario then we look at a more stressed scenario, severely more stressed scenario and we put a probability to that in order to establish what our management adjustment should be. And that's what's in the $28.5 billion that's it's today. Sure. We are -- if you kind of look at the information that we reported. We aren't yet seeing significant NCLs as of yet. We aren't yet seeing. There are some increases but we aren't yet seeing significant NCLs. We aren't yet seeing meaningful or increases in even the 30 to 89 buckets, in fact, they're declining so if you look at kind of North America the 30 to 89 delinquencies declined sequentially in branded cards, in retail services. They were relatively stable. In Asia, in Mexico they declined as well. All in our supplement and part of that is because as you know there are government payroll protection programs. There are stimulus checks. There are unemployment benefits. They're all of these things that are in place in many ways to kind of prop up the economy and so we aren't yet seeing the stress, if you will kind of play through those early buckets. What I would say is that as we get to through the back half of the year and towards the back after the year we're likely to see NCL start to pick up. And we're likely to see some of that at least on the consumer side start to peak towards the middle of next year. But I think what you've got to keep in mind is that we're building reserves now around lifetime expected losses and so to the extent that the forecast plays out as the scenario would suggest, you'll see those losses pick up and all things being equal as it relates to balances, you'll also see the reserves used to cover those -- to cover those losses. Again, I think in every quarter we're going to be taking a view on the forward economic outlook and so a little bit to your point if we get into the third quarter and we're seeing that our outlook is consistent with what it was at the end of the second quarter then we're going to take a view as it balances all, balances in terms of loans all things been equal related to balances. We're going to take a view as to whether we think that economic environment is going to be as we've scenario it out, get better or worse and act with the reserves accordingly. I think the other thing that I point out to your question is that remember when I described how we established the reserves, we've also built this management adjustment, this qualitative approach which is meant to account for some of that uncertainty and the prospect for a yet worse scenario. Yes. I guess here's the way I think about it which is we obviously, you've heard us say in terms of the uncertainty unprecedented crisis. We've taken a view on our forward look of the economy and how it plays out. And that is in fact the view that drives what we've established in the way of reserves. Now we're sitting at reserve levels of $28.5 billion, 3.9% or so of funded, 7% against the global consumer bank in terms of against balances the ICG at 1.7 even within the ICG non-investment grade is nearly 5%, 4.9% in terms of the reserves against the loan balances. We're sitting with reserves that we feel the level we feel comfortable about the level of reserves that we have, but that is for all the reasons that I described tied to the scenario that I've described for you. A scenario where we see the meaningful drop in GDP this quarter but we also see a recovery sequentially in the third quarter and unemployment start to start to fall by the fourth quarter and so to the extent that those things -- a little bit of room there I would say because I do have a management adjustment then I would expect that the first half would reflect by and large the majority of the reserves that we would need to take. And so -- and losses started to play out that we'd be utilizing that reserves in order to cover them. So hopefully that that helps. Yes. Look, we have seen very strong performance in our markets business and in -- FICC particular, was up 68% and we adjust for the gain that we had last year is up as much as close to a 90% little bit under 90%. So very strong performance there. We have -- I did mention in my prepared remarks that we would expect to see our markets revenue, our investment banking revenue normalized in the back half of the year and I think that certainly holds in terms of what we're expecting. And I also gave a little bit of guidance in terms of how to think about full year performance and that should hopefully inform how to kind of model our performance. And I talked about total revenues or full year revenues that are flat to down slightly with a decline in net interest revenue that's more or less offset by non-interest revenues on a full year basis. And I think if you can kind of model that out and it will, I think, reflect that normalization that I'm speaking to with regard to markets which will show up in both but you'll see a good part of the normalization in the non year. Yes. So, look, we are constantly reviewing the portfolio and we ramp that up that timing up significantly as we've managed through this crisis. They're obviously, I start by saying kind of all companies all sectors have been impacted by this obviously there's some more significantly impacted than others. When I think about sectors that that drove a good portion of the reserve build that we've seen is, I think, about aviation I think about energy; I think about autos, commercial real estate to some extent and retails and retailing and that combination probably drove a third of the build that we saw. We did see significant downgrades through the quarter and you heard me reference the non-investment grade reserves sitting at 4.9% of the loan balances and so we are actively reviewing the portfolio as you would imagine. We're looking at both the 80% investment grade, the 20% non-investment grade of our balances and we're adjusting that accordingly, and we'll continue to do that through the quarter and continue to work through the entire book there, just to put it in perspective there were probably a couple thousand names that were involved in the driving of the downgrades. And so they're meaningful names and meaningful review and assessment that we go through in the quarter. Yes. Look, we're constantly again reviewing the portfolio but in terms of specific unemployment information that's something that we have available to us as we work with our customers and review their specific credit statistics. So we don't have that. We do have as you know the early signs of both customers who took advantage of the forbearance globally and them still paying. So we've got if you think about it globally we have 40% to 60% of the customers that were -- that are enrolled in the consumer relief programs continue to make payments and they aren't contractually obligated to do. So almost 50% in branded cards and 40% in retail and again high numbers around the globe. So that is a good sign that people are benefiting from the program and taking those benefits and applying them to their exposures and the other important stat that I think is a good indicator and probably gets a little bit closer to what you're trying to get a sense for is that the first time enrollment volumes have come down significantly, while we're offering reenrollment, the rates are running below expectation. They are kind of in the mid-teens so to speak or but around there and more than half of the total enrollments that it rolled off to date and over 80% of those remain current. And so we're seeing good signs of those rolling off enrollment continuing to remain current, which we think is a positive indicator. That said we've said it a couple of times on the call now there's still some uncertainty, fair amount of uncertainty out there in terms of how this thing continues to evolve. But the good leading indicators between purchase sales, between re-enrollment levels, between continued payment both on and off the programs. Yes. Sure. So, look, I mean I think that we're going to continue to see pressure on the consumer revenue line. And I think that as you know if you think, if we could be just kind of taken in pieces very quickly in the US, our branded cards, our retail services, the unemployment stats are very important indicators for those businesses what those stats are. We've seen -- while we've seen improvement in purchase sales, they're still down in the 20s year-over-year and so we do expect that we will see continued pressure on the loan activity there and so and as a result continued top-line pressure on the consumer business domestically. Similarly when I look at Asia for example, there we have a large card business. We're focused on the wealth segment there again purchase sales are still under pressure there. The nature of that activity and card skews towards travel and I commented on the prospect of travel recovering and what that looks like in the future and so we'd expect to see continued pressure in Asia. Similarly, there's pressure in the insurance business that's there in light of the face-to-face interaction that's involved. And in Mexico as well just given the GDP deceleration. So I think consumer will continue to have some top-line pressure. I think the underlying indicators there are still strong for us in terms of the deposit growth; in terms of the engagement; in terms of the digital access in use of our offering. And so we've got good indicators including investment AUMs in Asia that show positive signs as we come out of this. But as we're managing through it we're going to have top-line pressure there. Yes. So in Latin America and in Mexico specifically as Mike suggested we're seeing a continued pressure from a GDP point of view. They are later in the cycle in terms of addressing or managing through this COVID-19 situation. There's likely to be some continued pressure on employment there. And so I think there's going to be top-line pressure in Latin America consumer, Mexico in particular as we go through this as well. That said I feel good about where we're positioned. We kind of started to dial back lending activity a little bit in some of the prior quarters. I think we're well positioned from a reserve point of view and I think we're positioned for when Mexico recovers from this to continue to kind of gain ground there given some of the investments we've made in the prior years. Sure. So as you know, we've got a number of partners that make up our retail services partner business and many of these arrangements call for the sharing of profitability. So contractual profitability of sharing between us and the partners and we will determine that based on our outlook in any given quarter for the balance of the year. And so we make an estimate for what we think profitability will look like and then we obviously account for the share that goes to the partner in the revenue line. That profitability estimate excludes ACLs so the reserves that we've been building. It does include any NCLs that we realize and so important to note that again when we're calculating that the lifetime reserves that we're building despite the fact that we'll share them when they become losses that's excluded from the profitability estimate. And so essentially what's happened and what's caused part of the drag on retail services is that we've seen the losses that we expect from retail services push out beyond kind of 2020. As I mentioned earlier, we see good signs in some of the early buckets and as such our view as to when those losses will actually come through as NCLs has been pushed out into 2021. As a result, the 2021 view on profitability for some of these partners is going up and therefore the amount of sharing has increased thus putting pressure on the top line. To answer the other part of the question, so we believe at this stage based on our view for the balance of the year that we've accounted for the level of profit sharing that we would expect, but as things evolve we would need to adjust accordingly. I think it largely depends on our outlook at that point in time in that given quarter. I mean it's just know -- there's no other way for me to kind of explain it when we get into the -- like we're in the third quarter now as we go through the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we will have a view a forward-looking view and if that forward-looking view is still meaningfully uncertain to worse than it was in the second quarter then we will likely continue to have to adjust reserves accordingly. If that forward looking view is better, we can -- or the same for that matter, it will support the release activity that you're alluding to. And that's the way I think about it. I think that's how it's probably going to work. That's right. So I mean it the way we think about the qualitative piece now as you know we cover kind of a 15% probability that the recovery is worse or slower right. And that has an impact or an implied higher unemployment et cetera. And so if we view things as getting better we would toggle that probability so to speak to adjust the way we think about the management adjustment that should be there. Sure. Thank you. So I guess a couple things. One is as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that I do expect that we will maintain our full year expenses roughly flattish. And that's what we're kind of managing to and part of that against revenues that are flat to slightly down and if you think about what we're managing through in the midst of this crisis, we've got a lot of puts and takes. So we've got some headwinds that kind of fall into a bunch of different categories including the things we do to support our employees including building out our collection capabilities, including enhancing our fraud detection capabilities all of which I think are important to ensuring that we're managing through this crisis in a thoughtful and responsible way. Sanitization of buildings, ensuring that people have remote access and the equipment to support that all of those things come with cost. Cost that we were not planning for in the year. There are obviously some tailwind. So we've got marketing expenses that you heard me mentioned we've dialed back. We've got T&E expenses because people are doing more Zoom than they are traveling to meet with clients. And so you've got some tailwind there that offset that but net-net when you think about those expenses they are headwinds for us. We also have investments that we will continue to make. Investments in technology, investments in enhancing our digital capabilities which have proven to be quite valuable as we've managed through this crisis. Investment in infrastructure and controls that ensure that we not only protect the franchise but we're improving our efficiency in operations and improving the quality of our data et cetera, et cetera and then we've got productivity initiatives and the other levers that pull or that we do pull quite naturally with revenues. And so the compensation expenses obviously will adjust accordingly. The transaction expenses will adjust with how we see volumes move and we'll continue to deliver on our productivity savings in the way of right placement and reducing our number of centers and the like and so, yes, they're levers but they're also meaningful headwinds and that's kind of how I get to that outlook of roughly flattish as we manage through this particular year. Yes. Look, I mean we're part of a big part of kind of what's driving the advanced -- the down grades that are associated with the prices that we're managing through. And so that is a factor that's likely to persist for a while and we're actively managing and optimizing the balance sheet to identify ways to impact or reduce that persuaded assets and aid in the calculation here of the CET1 and but that is the headwind that we've got to manage. Now what I point out is that the regulatory minimum for CET1 in both on standardized and advances are running at about 10%. And so we sit on an advanced basis at a ratio as Mike and I've said at 11.5%. So we're still 150 basis points above that regulatory minimum, which we think gives us room to manage through this period of uncertainty and a range of different outcomes. It also gives us room if you think about some of the additional stress analysis that's in front of us in the industry. So, yes, advance; yes a byproduct of the prices were in, yes we're constantly looking to manage it effectively where that makes sense and where we can continue to serve our clients in a way that is great for the franchise. Yes. So, look, we kind of mentioned in my opening remarks that we obviously saw NIM decline some 31 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And that's a combination again of lower rates, loan mix shift that we've seen so lower NIM cards in higher ICG in terms of that mix and the balance sheet expansion which is really a reflection of the strong growth in deposits in the solid liquidity position that we have. And so when I think about that dynamic we are likely to continue to see as I mentioned pressure on our cards lending activity around the globe. We're likely to kind of continue to see rates kind of impact some of our banking businesses, businesses like TTS and the like. And as a result, I think that we'll continue to see some pressure on the NIM line in the outer quarters but again I'd point you back to the total revenue forecast that I've given because obviously there are other components here. And that is getting back to flattish to slightly down. Yes and then the balance sheet will see, they'll likely be some growth in the balance sheet but that will be driven by the client demand that we see out there and our ability to meet that. But we will likely see some continued growth in the balance sheet from a GAAP asset point of view. So, yes, we did announce an investment a number of years ago. We are largely through that if we got this somewhere probably 80% or somewhere on through having deployed that investment. What is left it does serve as a lever for us that we reconsider as we take on these decisions. And just keep in mind those investments were made in building out enhancing our technology and branches and digital capabilities and the like and so I think they have certainly been beneficial. But we are largely through that and what's left is available to us to the toggle as we need to do. Yes. So we've had very good consumer deposit growth, excuse me, through the quarter. I think that we benefited from the investments that we've made in our digital capabilities, as you've seen the digital deposit sales grow meaningfully as high as $12 billion as we ended the quarter. And we continue to see those benefits play out both in our market and outside of our markets, which, as you know, has been part of our strategy to ensure that we are leveraging the breadth of our customer base in cards that has a broader presence in the U.S. than we do in terms of the Retail Banking footprint. And so, we continue to see those benefits of the strategy play out. Some of that is fueled by some of the things that I've mentioned earlier in terms of the stimulus that's out there and the delay in terms of tax payments, but nonetheless we've been able to capture upside from both new and existing clients, and we expect to continue to do that through the balance of the year. I'd also highlight -- I know your question was around consumer, specifically, but I would also highlight that we're also seeing very good continued traction on the institutional side in our TTS franchise. And that growth in many ways is, as we've seen and worked very closely with our corporate clients to shore up their liquidity positions, whether it was early on where they were drawing all in lines or in the quarter where we partnered with those same clients to access the capital markets, we've been kind of that partner of choice, that flight to quality on both the consumer side in the U.S. and internationally as well as the institutional side. And on the consumer, you've seen it in both the U.S., you've seen it in Mexico, you've seen it in Asia. We've had strong consumer growth across all of the regions. But we are pleased with the growth that we're seeing here. Mike, do you want to add something? Yes. I'd repeat what I said earlier which revenues are kind of slightly down and expenses flattish, right. So I would say, one is, let's kind of break the business into a few different buckets. So one, I would say that our cash trading performance was good. It was strong. And I would say that, again, it's early to see, but we did not do as well in either of Prime or Delta One -- Prime Finance, Delta One derivatives. From equification perspective, if you actually look into our capital markets numbers, you see a very strong number in ECM that our ECM business was up 56% on a year-over-year basis. So in terms of the capital raising aspects of it, we were quite active in most of the headline deals that were done. And so again, cash trading okay. We'll see where things come out, but not as good performance in derivatives, Delta One, Prime Finance and a strong performance in terms of ECM. Well, I would start off Mike and say that it is not our intention to be negative. I think we're all in this together and I would certainly say that the unknowns outweigh the knowns. And if somebody has the crystal ball, I would love to see it. But I think what we are seeing and what we've described coming through four very challenging months, is the first half of 2020 with revenues up 8%, expenses flat, our ability to absorb significant reserve builds under the new format of CECL, broad scale or wide-ranging engagement from our clients. I think you will continue to see in the numbers as they settle that we continue to take market share, we've continued to build capital, we've continued to build liquidity and feel very good about where we are and how we're going into the second half of the year. The unknowns are the unknowns. We don't know. And that in there, we're seeing resurgences in places where cases had been down, and they've come back up. And the U.S. is uneven in the approaches and the rest of the world has been uneven. And so again, I would say we go in feeling very well positioned against this. But we don't want people leaving the call simply thinking that the world is a great place and it is a V-shape recovery. It's our view that we will see V, we will see U, we will see W. And as an institution, we need to be prepared to deal with all of it. And I think you've seen across our businesses while in certain areas, revenues have been under pressure that we've managed through this very well so far. And I'm really proud of the team in terms of what they've done. But again, I don't think anybody should leave any bank earnings call this quarter simply feeling like the worst is absolutely behind us and it's a rosy path ahead. So, feel good about where we are. The environments are unknown. I think the actions we've taken so far have been spot on. And I think we're well positioned for what the future brings."

            "name": "Mike Corbat",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported earnings for the second quarter of 2020, with net income of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $0.50. As in the first quarter, credit cost weighed down our net income. However, the overall business performance was strong which shows that we've been able to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic reasonably well so far. The solid revenue growth at 5% and strong expense management down 1% both on the year-on-year basis, our margin was up 13%. We grew loans and our deposits were up significantly. Our regulatory capital increased and we continue to add to our substantial liquidity and our balance sheet has more than ample capacity to continue to serve our clients. The Institutional Clients Group had an exceptional quarter. Fixed income was at 68%. We had our best investment banking quarter in recent history and private bank revenues approached $1 billion. And while Treasury and Trade Solutions continued to be impacted by the lower rate environment, we did see good client engagement and strong deposit growth in that business. Global Consumer Banking revenues were down and spending slowed significantly due to the pandemic. In North America, despite the decline in purchase sale activity, Branded Cards revenues were up slightly due to a mix shift towards earnings balances. At the same time, Retail Services saw a significant decline in consumer spending with our partners.  Retail Banking saw higher mortgage revenue from refinancing activity due to the low rate environment. In Asia, the slowdown in travel and consumer activity again reduced revenues. And in Mexico, revenues declined as the country is struggling from the effects of the health pandemic. Our capital position strengthened during the quarter with our common equity Tier 1 ratio increasing to 11.5% on an advanced basis. I was pleased with our results from the Federal Reserve's related stress test placing our stress capital buffer at 2.5%. This leads us comfortably about our new regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book value per share of $71.15 was down only slightly from the first quarter, but still up 5% from a year ago. We plan to keep paying our quarterly dividend as long as macroeconomic and financial conditions permit. During the quarter, we continue to support our clients, colleagues and communities through this pandemic. While I'd like to see more of our people back in the office, we've been clear that we won't do anything to jeopardize their health and safety. Most recently, we pause plans to invite a limited number of colleagues back to sites located in areas where the health data was going in the wrong direction. We've also remained committed to supporting communities through a variety of initiatives. These now total over a $100 million in contributions from our company and its foundation. But what I'm most proud of is the $2 million which my colleagues donated out of their own pockets to organization providing COVID relief as part of our matching program. And we recently made our first distribution to the Citi Foundation representing $25 million in net profits from the Payroll Protection Program to support Community Development, Financial Institutions. We're also partnering with minority-owned depository institutions to help them extend credit to businesses through PPP by purchasing their loans through a $50 million facility. This effort is even more important as we look at the economic disparities drawn along racial lines in our society. And, of course, we continue to serve our clients whether it's providing consumer relief or helping companies access the capital markets to strengthen their balance sheets. We enter the second half in a strong position to handle what comes our way. We are in a completely unpredictable environment for which no models, no cycles to point to. The pandemic has a grip on the economy and it doesn't seem likely to loosen until vaccines are widely available. We'll keep managing through this with a sharp emphasis on our risk management and continue to make investments in our infrastructure to enhance our safety, soundness and controls to ensure that we have an industry with strong and stable institution. With that Mark will go through our presentation. And then we will be happy to answer your questions. Sure. Thank you, Mike. So let me just kind of touch on the comment in terms of the vaccine. As we think of as I think of these health pandemic and not necessarily specific dates, but a broad-based timeline effectively I think of this going through four stages, containment, stabilization, normalization and ultimately a return to growth. I would describe that today the economy as we've seen the global economy, the global health pandemic is not all in the same place. We didn't enter it at the same time. We didn't have the same response either from a health or from a fiscal or monetary perspective and therefore we're going to see exit and exit rates different and we're going to actually see the numbers in terms of resurgence of COVID in some areas in different ways. I would describe right now that broadly in the world we are somewhere between containment and stabilization, right. Containment is that we can bend the curve in terms of the transmission of cases. Stabilization is that as we remove or start to take down some of the barriers or actions that were put in place. Working remotely, social distancing kind of all of those things that have been put there and as that start to get lifted that you actually don't see cases come back. And when you get to the third phase around normalization and simply put normalization to me is am I willing to get on the airliner? Am I willing to get in a subway? Am I willing to go into a crowded venue to watch a sporting event or a concert or what it may be. And I think realistically when we get to that third bucket, I just don't see that coming and I would say many don't see that coming until we feel like there's a an anti-virus vaccine that's available for the mass population around that. And so I think one of the things that people struggle with today is the disconnect in some ways between where the market is in some ways and actually where we are in terms of this health pandemic. And the number of questions that are out there. So I don't want to be pessimistic in there. I want to be a realist and I just think that in order to truly normalize that's what's necessary to do that. To the second part of your question, we've seen different responses in different ways. We've seen different health responses. We have seen different economic responses and I think the approach specific to your question in terms of Mexico is that in both cases those responses have been pretty straightforward, right. We really haven't seen the extraordinary actions that we've seen from the US or UK or some of the governments around the world. It's been much more of a BAU response and I think as part of that we're seeing that economy being hit fairly hard and it's still relatively speaking in the earlier stages and by the way that's not just Mexico, more of Latin America and other parts of the world. And I think as we forecast growth rates going forward I think our forecast right now is for a contraction of about 8% in Mexico in terms of GDP as we look forward. So the economy has been hit, will continue to be hit. That being said I think the actions that we've taken in terms of the risk approach, we've taken in terms of the ways that we have looked at and been mindful in terms of risk going into this. I think should serve us well but again I think the effects of this are likely to be felt longer in Mexico. When you say functions, Mike, what do you -- Oh assumption, I'm sorry. Sure, yes, well to me right if we want characterize what's happening in this in some cases as resurgence or the second round of this. One is I would say that we've seen both societal and behaviors changing right that I think what we've seen in these states where we've seen resurgences is in some ways a dichotomy of the population I think those that have reverted back to original protocols from the early stages of COVID and what needs to be done. And I think those that are, I think being much more for lack of better term free spirited or kind of moving forward with their lives. And I think you can see that in the spend rates that while these cases have had a resurgence, we've seen spend come back off in some of those places, but we haven't seen it necessarily go back to the lower levels of the darkest days of early COVID. I think the second thing in there and it's in all of the national health reports are that the demographics have changed. We were actually seeing and part of it can be attributed maybe to testing or more mass testing but we're actually seeing the average age of the infected population coming down round one it was in the 50 to 50year plus range on average and the last numbers I saw coming out had the most recent cases in these states actually in the mid-30s as an average. And so we're actually seeing a different demographic in there and again I think that has some impact in terms of the way people respond and what spend and what other things are. And to Mark's earlier point Mike just finishing on this, I think that what we're seeing is that the extraordinary actions of the Fed and the Treasury leave not just ours but industry models kind of wanting for more insight. But we've never seen this type of action whether it's the checks people receive, whether it's payroll protection 500 plus billion, whether it's the holiday in terms of income tax payments, but we're actually seeing a consumer in the US that actually kind of goes into this and it's not all even but in pretty good shape. Savings rates are up, obviously spending levels are down. Mark talked about some of the delinquencies and some of the positive things that we're seeing there in terms of the buckets and the roll rates. It's early but again I think as we look at a potential spike back up in some areas obviously over the weekend stimulus round two came on the table. It seems to be bipartisan and so it's likely we're going to get more from that and so again I think those things give us, I won't say comfort but give us I think a good a view based on what we've been through in terms of the consumer in particular to be able to withstand some of these variations and contagion rates as we go forward. Yes and the one correction. The one correction I would make to that Mike is it's not -- again, we close and our view is as of the quarter end is as of June 30th but again the models are very sensitive to unemployment. They're insensitive to GDP and as we went through last quarter, as we were doing different flashes those numbers moved around. So again the models are sensitive to those inputs and my guess is as those inputs continue to change, there'll be variation but absolutely as of quarter end we are comfortable with where we set those and the reserving around that. Yes. Brian, I would say one is that I think as we look at the region you can't just look at Hong Kong. I think you've got to take a bit of a broader view and the word I would use is that it's complex right. We've got the combination of a sideline trade deal with China; you've got the interaction between China and Hong Kong. You've got the recent announcement or creation of this new national security law which is I think fairly specific in terms of calling out financial support in terms of China against its sovereignty with significant penalties around that. And so I think we've got to be mindful of all those. From our perspective, we've been in Hong Kong a long time. It's an important place. It's our Asian hub as we operate in a number of countries there. And I would say a couple important things as to that. One is we do obeyed local laws; second is that our goal really is to be there to support our clients. And that we're fairly used to operating in charged or complex environments and as part of that I think we have found both the Hong Kong government and the HKMA and others very supportive of our business and our approach. And at the same time we have I think received the same support from China and haven't in any way kind of received restrictions or other things from them. So obviously it's something we pay close attention to. It's important to us but obviously we're committed to being there and obviously are monitoring things closely. Yes. I think it's based on as we look and project forward what we see from an economic perspective and obviously what's going on in the economy both consumer and institutional. And how we're projecting loss and loss rates that going forward and do we feel comfortable about the trajectory of the pandemic and using my timeline do we feel like we're somewhere in that stabilization moving to normalization, right. So I think in here there's the fear that as we get into colder weather maybe that's now been debunked with Florida and Texas and others. But in the fall maybe we start to see resurgence and some of these things spike up. I think we'd like to see this roll over and hence have some comfort that we've got the ability to keep it down. And that again we see a better sense. I'm not sure what the new normal is but we see a better sense of normalcy whatever that is returning to the global economy. Okay. In terms of the CARES ACT, there is a benefit associated with that. I don't think that it is significant in our case to the CET1 ratio. But I don't have that specific number in front of me. In terms of the tax rate and the prospect of the rollback of taxes that will come with many puts and takes including the impact to the DTA and other things that we have across the firm. And so I apologize I don't have the exact math on that but we can n certainly kind of been beneficial. We would have to make a number of adjustments such as that would add to capital. I was going to say, Charles, the other piece that you've seen in our tax rate is given the breadth of our business we haven't necessarily enjoyed the benefit that the more you fully US-centric institutions have had. And so again ours would be the blend of the US versus international and in that tax rate going up again I don't think we would go back to a global taxation system. We would say a territorial system which again vis-a\u0300-vis some US counterparties could on a relative basis would probably be to our benefit. And I think to your final point, I view when the US industry made the decision to go ahead and to stop buybacks, it was not political; it was done, we thought from a prudence perspective of the right thing not knowing what to expect going into this. I don't view this today as being political. I view it as and as the Fed has said it will ultimately be our choice to come back into reinstate buybacks at the right time. And again as we said in the previous questions, we'll be monitoring that and when the time is right we'll be back in there filing to re-begin or to begin the buybacks. Yes. Sure. The other piece Betsy is that, I think very consistent with what we've spoken about in the past of that $12 billion that Mark mentioned, two-thirds, which again is a pretty stable number for us, is coming from outside our branch footprint, which we obviously play -- we pay close attention to, given our branch model. Two-thirds of the digital growth is coming from outside the branch footprint."

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have objections please disconnect at the time. Ms. Lynn, you may begin.\nElizabeth Lynn: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today as well as those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.\nMike Corbat: Thank you, Liz and good morning everyone. Today, we\u2019ve reported earnings for the first quarter of 2020, with net income of $2.5 billion, we had earnings per share of $1.05. Our earnings were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we had strong revenue performance as the economic shocks caused by the pandemic weren\u2019t felt until late in the quarter and we continue to show expense discipline. However, as you would expect, credit costs reduced our net income. The significant loan loss reserves we took also reflected the Day-2 impact of the new CECL accounting standard. In our Institutional Clients Group, we had strong performance in our markets business as we help clients navigate severe volatility that led to trading revenues that were higher than last year and what is typically a strong quarter for that business as it is. Treasury and trade solutions was impacted by the cuts to interest rates, but client engagement stayed very strong throughout the quarter. Investment Banking matched last year\u2019s solid performance as we continue to gain share among our target clients. Global Consumer Banking also fared well from a revenue perspective, considering the environment. In the US, and its strong revenue growth in cards with branded in retail services of 7% and 4%, respectively. We grew average deposits 8% with another solid portion acquired digitally. In Asia, we saw a slight revenue decline as the economic impacts of COVID-19 first materialized in that region. In Mexico, revenues rose modestly, excluding a one-time gain from 2019 as the virus had limited impact on that country\u2019s economy during the quarter. Our tangible book value per share increased to $71.52 at the end of the quarter, up 9% from a year ago. We ended the quarter with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 11.2% as our risk weighted assets increased significantly due to increased client demand. As I\u2019ve said, this isn\u2019t a financial crisis, it\u2019s a public health crisis with severe economic ramifications. Although we did have good revenue performance this quarter, we exited the quarter in a dramatically different environment. While we\u2019ve built significant loan loss reserves, no one knows what the severity or longevity of the virus\u2019s impact on the global economy will be. That said, we entered this crisis in a very strong position from a capital, liquidity and balance sheet perspective. We have the resources we need to serve our clients without jeopardizing our safety and soundness. Now, I\u2019d like to take a moment to highlight some of the things that we\u2019re doing to help our people, clients and communities which you can see on Slide 3. I have to say I\u2019m very proud of how our people have responded to this fast-moving situation. We\u2019ve been very aggressive, shifting to remote working to reduce our people\u2019s chances of becoming infected, where the spread of the virus dictates it, we only have people going to our sites if there\u2019s no possible way, they can perform their roles remotely. For example, last week in North America Markets and Securities Services 98% of our people worked remotely and globally, our people adapted well to this new way of working with over 80% of our colleagues working remotely. Investments we\u2019ve made in our technology have allowed us to operate very smoothly in a set of circumstances that would have been hard to imagine with such a large share of our workforce working remotely at the same time. These investments are also helping us to serve our clients through digital and mobile channels whether it\u2019s a consumer depositing a check or a corporate treasurer managing liquidity. Our investments in risk management and controls will never complete are also serving us well in the face of the severe economic downturn and large swings across markets, whether in equities, fixed income or commodities. We\u2019ve tried to help keep our people financially healthy as well and reduce the stress they\u2019re facing. We decided last month to make a one-time payment of $1,000 to employees who make $60,000 or less per year in the US that are making equivalent payments in our international markets. And we\u2019ve halted new reductions in our workforce for the time being. From a consumer and institutional perspective, we\u2019re well positioned to serve the clients and the customer segments we\u2019ve been focusing on. We know many consumers are facing real struggles, and we\u2019re doing our best to support them. We were quick to implement the ways to reduce the burden on our consumer appliance and announced additional accommodations last week in the US. While we haven\u2019t been a large player in small business lending, we\u2019re ramping up our efforts so we can support clients who participate in the Payroll Protection Plan, and we have additional consumer relief programs in place in our international consumer franchise. We\u2019re working hard to support our corporate clients, many of whom are facing financial pressure. We\u2019ve been able to support them, while keeping within our risk and liquidity limits. We\u2019ve also been helping the communities we served during this extraordinarily difficult time, partnering with groups like the World Health Organizations, Citi\u2019s foundations have already committed $30 million today to support those impacted and we\u2019ll make additional announcements in coming days. We\u2019ve donated personal protective equipment, the hospital workers and last week we started using our cafeteria in our headquarters to make meals for food banks. Our people keep coming up with new ways to help and I couldn\u2019t be prouder. And as a Bank, we\u2019ll do everything we can to support the broader economy. We serve as the transmission mechanism for policymakers for both fiscal and monetary, which they can use as a bridge to the real economy. Looking forward, there are too many unknowns to count. The path that virus will chart, whether there will be successful interventions, the action government leaders will take either reopen the economy or put in place measures that will further restrict it. We also have to bear in mind, COVID-19 is a new disease and the medical guidance continues to evolve, as you would expect. But we feel confident in our ability to manage through whatever scenario comes to pass and with that, Mark will go through our presentations and then we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions.\nMark Mason: Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 4, Citigroup reported first quarter net income of $2.5 billion. Results included a $4.9 billion increase in credit reserves this quarter. This reserve increased reflects the impact of changes in our economic outlook due to COVID-19. These builds are larger, given a significant impact this change in our economic outlook has on our estimated lifetime losses under the new CECL standard. Revenues of $20.7 billion grew 12% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher markets revenues and the benefit of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio. Expenses were roughly flat year-over-year, and we were able to deliver positive operating leverage and a 27% improvement in operating margin. Credit costs were $7 billion this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 19% for the first quarter, below our full year outlook, reflecting a small benefit associated with stock-based incentive compensation. The ultimate economic impact of this health crisis and our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters. The impact that we are already seeing varies across our franchise. We saw the earliest impact on consumer behavior in Asia as spending slowed in response to restrictions on travel and other commercial activity. We\u2019re seeing the same pattern today here in the US and now beginning in Mexico, which is likely to put pressure on loan balances. However, deposit growth remains strong across regions and we\u2019re leveraging digital channels to engage with our client. The rate environment has changed significantly. Our accrual businesses reflect the impact of the three US rate cuts seen last year, as well as some impact from additional cuts seen this quarter in response to the crisis, with an expectation for a more pronounced impact going forward. Although I would know that this has been partially offset in areas like TTS, where clients are moving volumes towards us as a stable partner of choice. A similar dynamic is playing out in markets, where we are also seen as a counterparty of choice. Additionally, we are seeing higher corporate loan volumes reflecting drawdowns and new facilities given our clients response to the crisis. And finally, our performance in investment banking reflects the market volatility we\u2019ve seen, as well as the uncertainty that remains on the corporate side. From the onset, we\u2019ve been focused on our employees and our clients and ensuring we maintain balance sheet strength to serve them through this uncertainty. As of March 31st, our CET 1 capital ratio was 11.2%, below our stated target of 11.5% even our efforts to support our clients through this period. Additionally, we had over $800 billion in available liquidity to help support our clients, and including the $4.1 billion transition impact as we adopted CECL at the beginning of the year, as well as the additional reserves taken this quarter, credit reserves stand at roughly $23 billion with a reserve ratio of 2.9% on funded loans.  With the level of capital, liquidity and the reserves we hold today, plus significant pre-provision earnings power, we are operating from a position of strength. We\u2019re combining this financial strength with operational resiliency, given investments in our people, operations and technology along with digital capabilities which allow us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis. Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 2% as growth in North America was partially offset by lower revenues in Asia, reflecting the initial impact of COVID-19 on customer behavior. Expenses were roughly flat, allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and 5% improvement in operating margin. Total credit costs of $4.8 billion were up significantly from last year, including a reserve build of approximately $2.8 billion, primarily related to the impact of changes in our economic outlook. Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 4% from last year. Although the impact of COVID-19 has only been felt in North America in recent weeks, we have leveraged our experience in Asia to inform our response strategy. We\u2019re one of the first banks in the US to provide assistance to help impacted customers starting in early March. We\u2019ve since expanded that support and continue to evaluate whether additional support is needed. In addition, the enhancements we have made to our digital capabilities have prepared us to better respond and continue serving our customers as they manage through this pricing. Digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter at $1.6 billion. We continue to drive mobile adoption of 13% year-over-year. We made change to allow our customers to use self service channels for more transactions, including increased limits for ATM withdrawals, mobile check deposits and Zelle transaction. And we\u2019ve continued to launch new digitally led value proposition such as Citi Wealth Builder, a new digital investment platform for clients in the emerging affluent segments. These capabilities are allowing us to remain engaged with our clients, even as roughly 40% of our branches in the US are now temporarily closed, driven by lower customer traffic, particularly in urban areas. Turning now to the businesses. Branded cards revenue of $2.3 billion grew 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% loan growth and continued spread expansion with net interest revenue as a percentage of loans improving to 933 basis points this quarter. Client engagement remained strong through February with purchase sales growth of roughly 10% for the first two months of the quarter. However, as seen across the industry, purchase sales declined significantly in late March with the implementation of more extensive lockdowns in many states. Categories like travel and entertainment have seen the biggest impact, while there has been some offset from higher spending on essentials as well as higher online sales. So in total, we grew a purchase sale of 3% in branded cards in the first quarter, but the trend line over the past month would indicate a significant decline in purchase activity in the second quarter, which is expected to impact loan growth. Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were largely unchanged year-over-year, as a benefit of stronger deposit volumes and an improvement in mortgage revenues were offset by lower deposit spreads. Our deposit momentum continued to improve with average deposits of 8%. As I noted earlier, digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter even as we continue to adjust pricing, given the current rate environment. We also saw a strong engagement with existing clients, driving balanced growth across deposit [technical difficulty], including checking. While AUMs declined by 6% due to market movements, we drove continued growth in Citigold households and investment fees during the quarter and mortgage revenues grew as a result of increased refinancing activity. Finally, retail services revenues of $1.7 billion were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower partner payments and higher average loan. Purchase sales were down 3% year-over-year in the first quarter, again, including significant pressure in late March, driven by reduced client activity and store closures at some of our partners. This is expected to have an impact on new account acquisitions and loan balances as we move through the year. Total expenses for North America Consumer were down 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume related costs. Turning to credit, total credit costs of $3.9 billion increased significantly from last year. We built roughly $2.4 billion in reserves this quarter, reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook. And net credit losses grew by 8% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolio. Our NCL rates in US branded cars and retail services were 346 and 553 basis points, respectively. Consistent with the uptake we\u2019ve typically seen in the first quarter. Historically, we\u2019ve seen higher NCL rates in the first half versus the second half of the year. However, given the rapidly changing economic environment due to COVID-19, we are likely to see increased pressure on NCL rates in the back half of 2020, consistent with the reserve actions we took this quarter. On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 1% year-over-year in the first quarter. Despite the early emergence of COVID-19 in the region, we saw strong investment in FX revenues through most of the quarter. This was offset by lower purchase sales activity and loan balances in our card business, driven by restrictions on movement and changes in customer behavior. We also saw an impact on customer acquisitions in products like insurance, which rely more heavily on face-to-face engagement. However, average deposit growth remained strong at 8% this quarter, and we continue to drive digital engagement across the franchise. Today, we are seeing some early signs that we\u2019ll pick up in activity in China as movement restrictions have eased over the past week or so. But that is a small consumer business for us and of course, many other markets are still in an earlier stage of managing through the crisis. Turning to Latin America, total consumer revenues were largely unchanged year-over-year and grew 3% excluding a residual gain last year on the sale of our asset management business. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter, with average balances up 4%. And we\u2019re also benefitting from improved spreads in card. However, we continue to see pressure on overall loan growth. And while we haven\u2019t yet seen the full impact from COVID-19 in Mexico, we did see a slowdown in purchase sales in March, which is expected to continue as customer behavior will likely follow the pattern we\u2019ve seen in other regions. In total, operating expenses for our international business were up 3% in the first quarter, driven by Mexico, reflecting investments as well as episodic items partially offset by efficiency savings and cost of credit increased to $939 million, primarily driven by the impact of changes in our economic outlook. Slide 8 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends, which shows the seasonality we typically see in the first quarter. Overall, we have not seen a pronounced impact from COVID-19 on our credit statistics, but it is still early. We do anticipate rising unemployment and therefore higher loss rates than originally expected for this year. However, it is unclear what benefit the historic $2 trillion relief package as well as our own customer relief efforts will have in helping to mitigate some of the potential stress on consumers. I would also note that we are taking appropriate actions to manage new and existing credit exposures, including investments in our operation. And importantly, as I\u2019ve noted on prior calls, we feel good about the quality of our consumer credit portfolios, both relative to the industry as well as Citi\u2019s historical risk exposure. If you look at our US card portfolios as an example, the FICO distributions of our outstanding loans and open to buy exposures due much more towards the higher end than before the 2008 crisis. And as a result, when we stress today\u2019s card portfolios to the same level as 2008, our pro forma loss rates are 25% to 30% lower than experienced in the last crisis. In Asia as you can see from our credit metrics, we maintain a very low risk portfolio targeted at high quality consumers in both our unsecured and mortgage portfolio, where our average LTV is less than 50%. In Mexico, we clearly serve a wider range of clients compared to our other region, given our national footprint. However, we generally target a higher quality segment than our local peers. The credit profile of our clients has improved over time, as we have remained disciplined and tightened down lending criteria since the crisis, which is reflected in our more stable NCL rates over the past few years. We generate strong margins in Mexico as well, with a net credit margin of cards for example, of roughly 20%. That said, clearly the impact of COVID-19 is not fully known at this point and we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 9. Revenues of $12.5 billion increased 25% in the first quarter, as strong performance in fixed income and equity markets as well as the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in TTS and corporate lending. The quarter also benefited from the impact of $816 million of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges, as credit spreads widen during the quarter. Total banking revenues of $5.2 billion decreased 6%. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues of $2.4 billion were down 5% as reported and 2% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Our global footprint enables us to have a unique relationship with our clients. Even the breadth of that relationship, we\u2019re playing a pivotal role in helping our clients navigate through these unprecedented times. We continue to see robust underlying business drivers in TTS, including 24% growth in end-of-period deposits in constant dollars, as well as 6% growth in cross-border flows. And we continue to see that benefit of our investment in technology, given the accelerated adoption of digital tools. In March, while we, as well as most of our clients were working remotely, we opened close to 1,000 accounts digitally, three times the number we opened digitally in March of last year. We\u2019ve also seen a rapid growth in CitiDirect users, up 25% year-over-year in the quarter to over 580,000 users. And within that, active mobile users increased tenfold this year. But as we exited the quarter, we did see the full pressure of the lower rate environment begins to take hold, with revenues down 9% year-over-year in the month of March on a reported basis. Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were largely unchanged from last year, outperforming the market wallet as growth in M&A and equity underwriting were offset by decline in debt underwriting. However, I would note that investment grade debt underwriting was up double-digits year-over-year, as we helped our clients source liquidity in this evolving environment. Private bank revenues of $949 million grew 8%, driven by increased capital markets activity as we supported our clients through turbulent market conditions. In higher lending and deposit volumes, partially offset in lower deposit spreads, reflecting the impact of lower interest rate. Corporate lending revenues of $448 million were down 40%, primarily reflecting an adjustment to the residual value of the lease financing, as well as other marks on the portfolio. And while average loans were roughly flat, we did see a meaningful increase in end-of-period loans this quarter, reflecting the drawdowns and new facilities that I mentioned earlier, as we continue to support our clients. Total markets and Security Services revenues of $6.5 billion increased 37% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $4.8 billion to 39% year-over-year, with growth across rates and currencies and commodities. As volatility, volumes and spreads reached record levels, we actively made markets during this turbulent period for both corporate and investor clients. Equities revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% versus last year, reflecting a strong performance in derivatives, including an increase in client activity due to higher volatility. And finally in security services, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars, driven by higher client activity and deposit volume partially offset by lower spread. Total operating expenses of $5.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher compensation costs, continued investments and volume-driven growth. Total credit costs of $2 billion were up significantly from last year, we built roughly $1.9 billion in reserves this quarter. The increase in reserves primarily reflected the impact of changes in the economic outlook, as well as some downgrades along with volume growth in the portfolio. As of quarter end, our funded reserve ratio was 81 basis points, including a funded reserve ratio of roughly 2% on the non-investment grade portion. We provide more details on the corporate portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. Total non-accrual loans increased sequentially this quarter, but the ratio of non-accrual to total corporate loans remained low at 57 basis points. Overall, we feel good about our corporate credit quality and like consumer, we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we see out there today. Slide 10 shows the results for corporate/other. Revenues of $73 million declined significantly from last year, reflecting the wind down of legacy asset, the impact of lower rates, as well as marks on legacy securities as spreads widened during the quarter. Expenses were down 24% as the wind down of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs, as well as incremental costs associated with COVID-19, including a special compensation award granted to roughly 75,000 employees who are being most directly impacted by COVID-19. And the pretax loss was $535 million this quarter, higher than our previous outlook, reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, locks on security, the impact of lower rates as well as the special compensation award. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.5 billion this quarter declined slightly year-over-year as the impact of lower rates was mostly offset by loan growth and an extra day, along with higher trading related NIR. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $330 million, reflecting the lower rate environment, one fewer day in the quarter and the adjustment in corporate lending that I mentioned earlier. And net interest margin declined 15 basis points sequentially, with lower net interest revenues driving roughly half of the decline and the remainder reflecting growth in the balance sheet. Turning to non-interest revenue, in the first quarter, healthy business performance for most of the quarter as well as a strong pickup in trading activity in March drove a significant increase in non-interest revenue. As we look to the second quarter, we expect both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues to decline, reflecting the full quarter impact of lower rates, as well as a much more pronounced impact from COVID-19. On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio declined to 11.2% driven mostly by the increase in risk weighted assets. The increase in RWA reflected our support to our customers as well as increased market volatility and widening credit spreads. Our supplementary in leverage ratio was 6%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% to $71.52 driven by net income and the reduced share count. In summary, the environment changed dramatically this quarter, but we continue to operate well in a challenging environment. We ended the period with a strong capital liquidity position. We certainly saw the impact of slower global growth and macro uncertainty on our top line results as we exited the quarter. But we feel good about our ability to manage risk through the cycle. We remain disciplined in our target client strategy and feel strongly that our focus on these higher quality, more resilient segments is the right strategy in any economic environment. Looking to the second quarter and the rest of 2020, let me remind you that we are all operating with a great deal of uncertainty today. And our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters. With that said, given the adverse impact of COVID-19, we no longer expect to deliver a RoTCE of 12% to 13% for the full year. Based on what we\u2019re seeing today, on the top line, we expect the revenue trend in the latter part of March and the beginning of April characterized by COVID related lower level of activity, particularly in banking, and our consumer franchise, will continue through much of the second quarter. And in our markets business, revenue should reflect the broader industry. The first quarter is typically the strongest quarter, and clearly this year was particularly strong, so we would expect some normalization in activity levels here. And finally, we will see the more pronounced impact of the lower rate environment on the top line. On the expense side, there are couple things that are important to consider as we think about running the franchise and managing our expenses, including the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, how do we continue to protect our employees who are on the front line and how do we ensure that we are able to help our customers manage through this. And from this standpoint, we\u2019re being thoughtful about where we need to deploy resources to ensure we can deliver for our customers, in a period where roughly 80% of our workforce is working remotely. Here we feel good about the investments we\u2019ve made over the last few years in technology. These investments are allowing us to manage through this period, and support our customers and clients through digital mean. However, I would also note that during these unprecedented times, we are also exploring all opportunities to operate as efficiently as possible and potentially repay certain investments we would have otherwise made, in order to offset some of the headwinds created by COVID-19. We would also expect to see a natural reduction and some volume related expenses, including T&E, meetings and event calls. So again, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty today, but we will have more to say on both the top line impact as well as these efficiency efforts in the coming month as the impact of COVID-19 is better understood. But that should hopefully give you a sense of how we\u2019re thinking about the environment and our pre-provision earnings power. Turning to credit. Looking ahead to the second quarter and the remainder of 2020, we do expect a higher level of losses given our current outlook. And as our outlook continues to evolve, it is also reasonable to expect additional increases in credit reserves if our outlook deteriorates further. However, given the credit quality of our portfolio, we remain confident in our ability to maintain our overall strength and stability, as well as continue to support our customers and win new business. Undoubtedly, every company around the world will feel an economic impact from this unprecedented situation. But we are confident that Citi will emerge in a position of strength, having demonstrated that we lived up to our stated objective to be an indisputably strong and stay institution and having shown that we stood by our clients and supported our customers and employees during this very difficult time. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019d give us a little bit more of the assumptions behind the reserve build and \u2013 because card is \u2013 is a little bigger for you guys. I\u2019m curious if you could talk about the reserve and how you think about it from a branded versus retail services partner card perspectives? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Sure. Good morning, Glenn. So you know, you can turn to page 20, we\u2019ve broken out some additional you know, details here and you can see you know, we started or ended the year, I should say with about $14 billion in reserves, you\u2019re right the lion\u2019s share that is in cards in split between branded you know, and retail and you know our focus obviously is tends to be on the higher \u2013 the higher FICO scored you know, clients and that skews certainly the case in cards and tends to be higher on retail services, but not quite as high as on the cards\u2019 side. And so that\u2019s going to you know, impact a little bit the split between the two. You can see in terms of the day one impact that was about $4.1 billion. We talked about that on the last call, and we built another $4.9 billion, so that gets us to a total reserve balance of almost $23 billion. What it point out is you know, the cards piece obviously is at roughly $9.5 billion, but again \u2013 I mean 9.5%, excuse me of LLR to loans. But again you know, we tend to you know, to think of this as a higher quality book. In terms of the factors that become important you know, there are a host of variables that we run through our model, as well as combined with severity of a recession, probability of a recession, I would say that the two most critical as it relates to cards and again, they\u2019re all important in understanding how they work together becomes important. But two very important ones become obviously GDP and unemployment, and how that affects the underlying behavior of the consumer in each of those instances. Obviously, the retail services there, our partners that we have that are you know, more directly impacted by the COVID-19 situation, but we also have the $2 trillion relief stimulus that\u2019s been introduced and a little bit unclear as to how that ultimately plays out and impacts the behavior. So lots of puts and takes going you know, through the model, the \u2013 those economic assumptions change kind of straight through the end of the quarter, but the short of it is that you know, based on our outlook as have been you know, this additional build of $2.4 billion per cards you know was the appropriate amount for us to take.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay, that\u2019s a very helpful side. Thank you. Maybe just one follow-up on, I\u2019m curious your view, because you\u2019re in the midst of all of it of how much has the financial plumbing been improved by some of the government actions, and then where you, most importantly, where you see that we need the most improvement less to come on the plumbing things like, money markets, CP, I\u2019m talking about reserve banks?\nMike Corbat: Yeah, Glenn, I would say that the actions that we\u2019ve seen out of the combination of the Fed and the Treasury are truly extraordinary, not just in terms of the volume of dollars and programs, but I think the breath that\u2019s there and the speed at which they\u2019ve implemented them I mean, whether it\u2019s it's been the CP facility, the money market liquidity facility, the repo facilities, the broader corporate pieces, the SBA loans and now not something that\u2019s being talked about that much, but this main street program that\u2019s there. And I think from a plumbing perspective, your question\u2019s a good one, because obviously the real economy doesn\u2019t have direct access to the Fed or to the Treasury. And I think if the banks and in particular, the big banks role, one of many roles that we played to be that transmission mechanism between fiscal monetary and the real economy. And I think you can just see in terms of in the early days, how the markets were trading, a lot of the fears and concerns that were there and whether it was the early fears of draws, whether it was the early fears of money funds that being able to get liquidity across the board, and I think the programs have gone a long way. I think that there still a few things out there that probably need some work. And certainly, as an institution, as an industry, we\u2019re in constant dialogue with the Fed and the Treasury on those. And again, as I suspect as those things create challenges, it\u2019s likely that we will see a reaction come out of those bodies to be able to address it. So I think the plumbing is actually working pretty well that in spite of working remotely and the numbers that Mark and I spoke to, and we had in late March record volumes of trading in terms of settlement, clearing, margin \u2013 margining in the system. And again, most of that done remotely and you know, we all would have said to each other 6, 9, 12 months ago you know, we\u2019re going to model for this type of stress, we probably all would have been skeptical in terms of how the system performs. So I\u2019m proud of how we\u2019ve performed and I\u2019m quite pleased so far, how the system has performed.\nGlenn Schorr: Excellent. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning.\nMark Mason: Hi, Erika. Good morning.\nErika Najarian: I just wanted to \u2013\nMike Corbat: Good morning, Erika.\nErika Najarian: Thank you, Mark. Hi, I wanted to clarify your statement on card losses. So just want to make sure I was interpreting it correctly. You said that the losses today, the cumulative losses today could be 20% lower than the global financial crisis experienced. And when I look back at the regulatory data, \u201909 and 2010 would add up to a 20% loss rate. So wanted just to make sure I \u2013 we were interpreting that correctly that you know, you could see losses of 15% to 16% in card in a cumulative loss scenario, which is about in line with both the company run DFAST and the Fed stress test?\nMark Mason: Yeah, sure I mean, what I said was that you know, if you take the cards portfolio we have today which is of a better quality, then it was back in \u201808, and you were to stress it for the \u201808 financial crisis that yes, our pro forma loss rates would be 25% to 30% lower than what we experienced in the last crisis. That is \u2013 that\u2019s what I see.\nMike Corbat: And I think to be clear, Erika not \u2013 that\u2019s not a prediction, it\u2019s just a level setting based on historic data.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And one of your peers noted in a call yesterday, that they were comfortable going below their regulatory minimum of 10.5% to serve its clients. And I\u2019m wondering what Citi\u2019s stance is ongoing below that 10% bright line, especially since that\u2019s where the automatic distributions on dividend and other payouts kick in?\nMark Mason: Yeah, why don\u2019t I start, Mike or?\nMike Corbat: Sure, go ahead.\nMark Mason: You know look, I think our view is, we are clearly living in an uncertain period of time. The crisis we\u2019re facing is unprecedented. And you know, if I think about our objectives, you know, primary objective ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees, second to that or an addition to that ensuring that we are positioned to serve our clients, our customers and to play an important role in stabilizing the economy. And so when I think about the combination of those things, we want to be there for our clients. And I think we\u2019re expected to be there for our clients in a period like this. And you\u2019ve seen our CET1 ratio dropped to 11.2% this quarter and as the needs of our clients evolve, we\u2019re going to be there for them and that means that our ratio takes more pressure than we\u2019ll manage through that. If we were to drop you know, below the 10% that you referenced, there\u2019s still plenty of room between that and the use of the buffer that the - you know, that the regulators have authorized. And so we\u2019re managing it thoughtfully, diligently but in the context of those priorities that I mentioned.\nErika Najarian: Thank you.\nMark Mason: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning. How are you?\nMark Mason: Good morning, Betsy.\nMike Corbat: Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Question on \u2013 as it relates to the use of that capital part of it is coming from the drawdowns and I wanted to understand how you think your clients are going to be using those drawdowns. Do you expect them to persist for you know, many quarters, many years or do you think that you know, we will, over the next 12 months see some pay down of that through terming out in the capital markets and maybe also give us a sense as to the associated deposits, how much of the drawdowns came back into you know, your liquidity via the deposits and persistency there as well would be helpful? Thanks.\nMike Corbat: Yeah, so Betsy I would say kind of looking at the numbers, we had roughly right around about $30 billion, $32 billion worth of draws in the first quarter, so somewhere 10% or 11%, 12% of our outstanding, but unfunded. So I wouldn\u2019t call that an overly meaningful number. And I think going back to my earlier comment to Glenn, I think that the extraordinary actions taken in the CP facilities in terms of some of the corporate facilities, some of the SBA or probably more likely the main street lending facilities alleviates a lot of that pressure. I think we saw two things there, there were clearly those industries that were under stress and those were pretty easily identifiable along the list that Mark had described. And then I think there were those that just believed that it was a good time to bring in liquidity. And I think as the Fed programs and the Treasury programs came into place, the bond markets reopened, you saw record issuance of debt in the late first quarter. And again, when you look at our portfolio, it\u2019s predominantly an investment grade portfolio and that investment grade portfolio in times with those programs in place has access to the capital markets. And so we saw people shift there. Obviously something we were paying attention to. We\u2019re in constant dialogue with our clients. But again, I think you know, certainly coming into the second quarter, we\u2019ve actually seen really de minimis draws on the facilities and I think in our dialogues, we don\u2019t see or feel that pressure right now.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. And then on the deposit side, can you give us a sense as to, you know, the percentage of the draws that went into deposits and how you think about the persistency of those deposits as well?\nMark Mason: Yeah let me comment a little bit more broadly on the deposits. So you know, the ICG deposits that we saw come in the month of March, we\u2019re about $92 billion our deposits grew pretty significantly just in the month of March. And if I break that down about a third of that were from corporate clients that built liquidity through draws or issuance. And it\u2019s not you know, necessarily just liquidity you know, just draws from us, but about a third of it, we would attribute as being tied towards that increase in liquidity draws or issuances that they\u2019ve done. About a third were from brokered dealers and clearing houses and financial institutions as they bolstered kind of their liquidity buffers. And then a third were from investor clients derisking and moving to cash. And so that gives you a little bit of a sense for a mix. We obviously look at the persistency of the deposits and you know, some of those are certainly operating deposits. And I think part of what will inform the view to some extent is, as Mike described you know, the additional you know, channels that are now available for clients to access additional liquidity as needed. But also how long this persist and there\u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty as you\u2019ve heard us reference as to how long you know, this crisis we\u2019re managing through persists. So hopefully it gives you a sense.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. And you know, the fact that the drawdowns have slowed dramatically you know, de minimis in your words, Mike, the pressure, I would expect going forward on CET1 is going to you know, pull back as well. So maybe you could give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about that? And then you know, in the context of that how you\u2019re thinking about the dividend? Thanks.\nMike Corbat: Sure. So you know, I think as Mark described, the way you know, we thought about, you saw us kind of put a balance sheet to use and you saw the CET1 move from the 11.8% to the 11.2%, clearly leaving us lots of room, lots of buffer. And again, we\u2019re early in this, you know, we don\u2019t know and where this will go, but our gut or how we\u2019re thinking about this is \u2013 this recovery is going to be uneven. I would say that as a team, we\u2019ve pretty well discounted, a uniform V-shaped recovery. The question, is it U-shaped? Is it W-shaped or parts of it L-shaped? And I think we want to retain a lot of flexibility and capacity to be able to step into the situations that count. And again I think as we said that, if there\u2019s two roles, one is, how do we use our own balance sheet? And then how do we actually use and bring to life a lot of these programs and continue programs that have been put out there by the Fed and the Treasury. So in the right situations, we\u2019re prepared to let that ratio go down. We\u2019re in conversations with our board. We are in conversations with our regulator and I think Mark said you know, we feel that we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity in terms of capital and things that we can do before we get near triggering any conversations around dividend, but again, we\u2019re going to treat that as a time when it comes. But you know, to be clear, in our capacity here and the way we\u2019re looking at things you know, we remained committed to paying our dividend.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of more questions on the card business if you don\u2019t mind. So if you kind of separate the branded cards from the retail services and just can you help us talk about just what you\u2019re seeing \u2013 you know, relatively speaking in terms of we can see it in the rate of change that happened in the first quarter, but would you expect divergence in either spending trends, volume balances and credit as this evolves or any color you can help us with there? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Sure, I don\u2019t \u2013 why don\u2019t I start just in terms of the spend. And so you know in the quarter if I think about kind of the last week of March, the card spend activity you know, just broadly for us was down about 30% US spend, you know, by category down total of 30%. The big you know, categories, if you will, impact it are not going to be of any surprise to you travel down 75%, dining and entertainment down some 60% you know, discretionary retail which would include you know, apparel, the department stores, et cetera, down 50% you know, essentials were up 10%. And so, as you would \u2013 as I think you would expect and again, that got us to a total of down about 30% in just the last week. We all have seen what has continued to happen over the past couple of weeks. And so, I would expect, we would expect there to be continued pressure on purchase sale volumes through most of the second quarter, in light of the way this is persisting, and that you know, should play out as well on ultimately loan volumes in which we expect to see some top line pressure there. You know, similarly as you referenced that we have a large retail services business and we have partner clients who we advise in that regard and we\u2019ve been working with them to help drive sales digitally. But obviously the shutdown in most of the economy and the stay at home orders as well as the temporary store closures across most of the country will certainly impact our partners and our results, including a slowdown in new customer acquisitions as well as again, a lower purchase sales volumes \u2013 volume through you know, through that part of our business. You know, that said you know, we\u2019ve got a number of partners who do operate or a large partner I should say who do operate you know as essential resources to you know, to the economy and while they\u2019ll have lower store traffic, they will be able to continue to kind of serve. And ultimately you know, as I said, we would expect the second quarter to have some of that top line pressure play through and over the course of the year to see a pickup in NCLs subject to, of course, how things like the $2 trillion relief package and some of the other customer relief offerings that we put out take hold.\nKen Usdin: Yeah, and thank you and just a follow-up and you know, should and if you know balances come down, just given that card is such a bigger part of your balance sheet. This \u2013 is there a positive offset that comes through with regards to the reserving needs. Just wondering how cards specifically for you guys in that in and out with regards to you know, spend and outstandings informs how the ins and outs of card reserve builds? If that\u2019s a fair question.\nMike Corbat: Yeah. So I mean, if you think about CECL and how it works in the idea of building expected lifetime losses in any given quarter, there are number of factors that come into play, you know, so your probability of recession, your severity of recession, our view on the important economic variables and how they\u2019re going to play out as well as balances. And so, as the balances you know, shift and the mix and makeup of those balances shift, that\u2019s going to have an impact on what we would expect in the way of those lifetime losses and therefore, what we would expect in a way of how that reserve balance would move.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Okay, thanks a lot.\nMike Corbat: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. So in the US there\u2019s obviously a lot of efforts underway that kind of soften the blow to the consumer as we think about credit losses, there\u2019s the fiscal health, there\u2019s payment deferrals. Maybe you could just talk about kind of what\u2019s going on in Mexico and Asia and some of your bigger markets there in terms of you know things that might soften the blow for the consumer. And you know is that as meaningful as kind of what we\u2019re seeing here? Or how do you factor that into your thought process on potential losses?\nMike Corbat: Yeah, Matt, I think that\u2019s a great question. And I think as you think about it as, we think about all the places we come to work, I think we\u2019ve got to use a series of lenses to really look at where these countries and these economies are, I would say, one is that you\u2019ve got to look first at the health crisis response. Have the government\u2019s taking it seriously? Have they put measures? Have they put social distancing? Have they put stay in place types of things and what\u2019s the trajectory of that look like? I think the second piece is around what you see in terms of both monetary and fiscal response. And not just what\u2019s been to-date, but what\u2019s been the capacity of those economies to be able to implement those and more things, potentially into the future. And I think the third important piece that we look at is the underlying demographics of the economy as an example, do they have big exposures or are they dependent on oil exports or other commodities or other types of things where there\u2019s concentrations around that. And so I would say that that it\u2019s not by region, it is really and we are taking really a country-by-country approach to what that is. And I think you\u2019ve seen it all over the map in terms of very strong responses out of the US, out of Japan. You\u2019ve seen some responses out of Europe and I think you\u2019ve seen some of those that are slower. In particular, to your question on Mexico is, we know the President has labeled himself a fiscal hawk and I think he has been reluctant to use any type of outsized spending to go at this crisis to-date. And obviously we\u2019re watching that carefully. We\u2019ve tried to be pretty prudent in terms of our credit standards there and the things that we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re obviously watching it closely.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just want to follow-up on that. I mean remind us, I think your targeted customer base in Mexico you know, is much higher than I would say, the broad-based customers. So maybe just remind us about some of the credit metrics in the card portfolio in Mexico specifically? Thank you.\nMark Mason: I \u2013\nMike Corbat: Mark, do you want to \u2013\nMark Mason: I don\u2019t have the credit metrics available. What I would say is that, you know, while we do appeal to the broader population there, we do tend to focus on the higher and certainly relative to our peer players in that Mexico market. And so, we do skew to the higher end in terms of the credit profile. They have a different system and the FICO system per se. And we actually have been you know, very closely monitoring as you\u2019ve seen over the past number of quarters our loan volumes have, in fact, trended lower than that of the broader industry as we\u2019ve you know, been and quite vigilant about focus and staying inside of our risk parameters, which again, do skew higher than most of the peers in that country.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Yeah. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Security.\nMike Mayo: Sorry if I missed part of this. In terms of additional reserve builds ahead, another $5 billion in the second or third quarter. Yes, no, maybe.\nMark Mason: Hi, Mike. Let me make a couple of comments to that. One, you know, again, a lot of uncertainty here dealing with a significant crisis as you well know. Even as we have closed out this quarter, the variables you know, that we look at continue to shift you know, meaningfully. I would expect that you know, with that as a backdrop, and again, subject to a lot of things including how customers respond to the relief programs that are out there, so on and so forth that we would see additional builds in the second quarter. And that\u2019s kind of where we are. I mean I \u2013 I\u2019m not going to you know, we\u2019ve got the rest of the quarter to play out. We\u2019ve got you know, analysis and models that we have to do. We have you know, consumers that have to respond to much of the stimulus that\u2019s out there. We\u2019ve got to understand how it continues to impact the different businesses that we\u2019re in. it\u2019s way too early to give you any sense for what that number is.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And what lessons have you learned from Asia? I mean, the virus was there first. You should have a little more of a head start than other banks that don\u2019t have that experience and what are you seeing in terms of you know, volumes and credit losses and your ability to work with the clients?\nMark Mason: Yeah.\nMike Corbat: Yeah, so I think that \u2013\nMark Mason: Go ahead, Mike sorry.\nMike Corbat: I would say that you know, in some ways, Mike, we you know, if you want to call it that have been fortunate to have lived that. And I think you know, we took a lot of lessons and I think you saw in our actions in terms of the moves we took in terms of getting people \u2013 remotely getting people home of the types of client engagement. And I would say, less than one that we\u2019re watching very closely is the resurgence of cases as people start to come back in. And so I think we\u2019ve got to be very mindful about how and when or when and how we, in fact, do that. You saw us in very early March go, I think is the first US bank to go out and engage around in particular, our consumer customers in terms of opening up channels and talking about some forbearances and some forgiveness on fees and other things to get them engaged. And I think to Mark\u2019s point and you can see it in the credit numbers that so far relatively benign and we\u2019ve been putting programs in place in most, if not all of our Asian countries in terms of similar types of forbearance programs and really trying to engage around that. So it\u2019s early, but again you could \u2013 you can see the numbers that would probably 60 days in or so that we probably had a reasonably full February and March in terms of COVID in terms of Asia, but you know, again we\u2019re watching the numbers closely, but it\u2019s around the engagement and the programs and you know, some of it was dusting off the playbooks from \u201808 and in some of the things in between.\nMike Mayo: And if I can just follow-up. You talked about the resurgence of cases and people come back in, in Asia. I mean are your employees coming back yet? Are you seeing this or is this just third-party you know, medical advice that you\u2019re receiving? Are you seeing this firsthand? And when do you plan to open Asia back up? You know, in Citi Asia? I mean, how many people are working remote? How many people are in the office?\nMike Corbat: Yeah, you may have missed it. But we talked a little bit earlier, Mike in terms of the unevenness of this, that when you think of this virus that you know, it\u2019s not only uneven in terms of pacing in terms of where we are in the world, we\u2019ve got at least a two to three span just in the United States in terms of where the virus is. And you know, within Asia you know, we\u2019ve seen probably the most concerted efforts to get people back in in terms of China and I would say, we are largely back there. I think the last numbers I looked at as of yesterday, we were about two-thirds back in terms of Hong Kong and I would say, most of the rest of the region at lower levels than that. And so we\u2019re taking a very specific or very site-by-site view in terms of how we bring people back. So, you know, first criteria is where is the virus in its trajectory? Second criteria is, what are the things that happen at a site that are very difficult to replicate in a remote environment? And then in terms of addressing that, what\u2019s the safest way we can begin to bring people back? So that I think that \u2013\nMike Mayo: But that\u2019s pretty remarkable two-thirds back in Hong Kong. So that\u2019s you know, cautiously optimistic for what\u2019s ahead here or don\u2019t read too much?\nMike Corbat: Again, I think it\u2019s place-by-place so I think we\u2019ve you know, we\u2019re taking a kind of a site-by-site and \u2013 but at the same time you know, understanding again, you probably missed this part of it, you know, we\u2019re absolutely open for business. We\u2019re just working differently, right. If you look at the things that we\u2019ve accomplished just in the month of March, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re not at work. You know, as an example, yesterday you know, we had over 180,000 people accessing our systems remotely at one time our peak search was 132,000 of those people on simultaneously. You think about the things that have accomplished Mark and his finance team, you know, closed the quarter on a $2 trillion balance sheet. You look at this submission of CCAR, you look at all the things that remediation efforts, the small business programs, all being applied remotely. So again, it\u2019s going to be bespoke in terms of how we do it, as Mark said, with an eye towards making sure we keep our people safe. And at the same time doing everything we can do to service our customers and clients through this extraordinary time. And it\u2019s going to be case-by-case.\nMike Mayo: All right, thank you.\nMike Corbat: Thank you.\nMark Mason: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.\nSaul Martinez: Hi. Hey, good morning guys.\nMark Mason: Hey, Saul. Good morning.\nSaul Martinez: A couple of CECL questions, so please bear with me. But you know, first I want to get your perspective on the DFAST stress losses and whether you think it\u2019s a good reference point to judge reserve adequacy under CECL, because we do get a lot of questions asking why allowance level are so much below, what the nine quarter stress losses are in the severely adverse scenario in the adversary. And I think that\u2019s true for you guys. And you know, my personal view is that, DFAST is a useful data point, but that there are fundamental differences you know, obviously beyond the differences in the economic scenarios used. The point of DFAST is to estimate loss absorbing capacity in a severe downturn. And maybe estimates are going to be on the conservative end of losses where as under CECL, like these are point in time estimates that you\u2019re \u2013 are your best guesses of what your losses will be over the life of the loans under an economic scenario. So, let alone the lot of methodological differences in terms of how you calculate those things in terms of things like you know, weighted average remaining life or whatever it is. But I\u2019m curious if you have a perspective and whether you think you know, there \u2013 the stress losses should be sort of a reference point or you know, or how useful they are to measure whether you know, a given bank or your bank has adequate reserves?\nMark Mason: Look, I think you said a lot there. I think that it is a reference point, I think you\u2019ve highlighted you know, some meaningful differences in the approaches and perspectives everything from you know, the modeling, the assumptions like et cetera, et cetera. And so I think it does serve as a reference point. But I think what we\u2019re experiencing now and even as we submitted a plan from a CCAR point of view, is that you know, that\u2019s a scenario. It certainly is a stress scenario, but we\u2019re now living through a real life stress situation. And I think you know, that scenario is meant to \u2013 those scenarios are meant to inform you know, a firm\u2019s ability to withstand stress, but we\u2019ve got a real test here that has put us and I think the industry in a position where we are constantly you know, modeling and demonstrating our ability to withstand real-time pressures and the prospect of real life losses. Now with that said, you know, CECL, you know, a new approach I think that the timing is interesting in that we get to see a \u2013 we see a meaningful shift between transition and day one, which I would think in a normal environment, you wouldn\u2019t see that type of dramatic shift. But again you know, that\u2019s informed by you know, a view \u2013 a forward looking view of what is now a crisis in a stressed environment. And so that magnitude of the change that we see in the day two is a direct byproduct of that. And I think what we\u2019ll see is, that continues to you know, that what we do in the way of forward reserves will continue to be informed by that. And what we ultimately experienced in losses, however, will be informed by how much of the uncertainty that I talked to plays out. So again, no stress scenario that\u2019s been created you know, thus far you know, would have contemplated the amount of fiscal response and monetary response that we\u2019ve seen in short order. You know and so that\u2019s not modeled and how customers or consumers react to that is not part of any CCAR DFAST model that we would have run. How that offsets the impact of you know, unemployment or ultimately losses is completely unclear. And so, there\u2019s a fair amount, you know, yes, it\u2019s a data point you know, but there\u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty and now differences I would expect in light of now managing through a real life scenario.\nSaul Martinez: That\u2019s helpful. If I can follow-up, you guys use one scenario, most large banks use these multiple scenarios in calculating their reserves. But \u2013 sorry if I missed this, but can you just outline you know that the sort of big picture, some of the big picture assumptions you\u2019re using whether it\u2019s you know, global growth or US growth or unemployment that underlie that scenario. And I guess it\u2019s sort of an adjunct to that. Does using one scenario create more volatility, because if you\u2019re using the scenario analysis you know, you can kind of calibrate between different outcomes, whereas it\u2019s more of a a big change if you change your outlook, it\u2019s just one scenario to another in your case as opposed to maybe a grade of different outcomes if you were to use sort of a weighted average scenario analysis that most banks use. So does it \u2013 do you think it creates more volatility and more jumps and releases than you otherwise would have?\nMark Mason: Yeah, so we do use a model approach, where we use a scenario, but what I would say is that, that scenario was informed by kind of a further management adjustment and the factors that are considered are not only thousands of variables like GDP and unemployment and many, many, many other stats given the nature of the business that we do, but also the probability of recession and the severity of the recession and we can toggle in our management adjustment degrees of severity that we would expect in a recession, whether that\u2019s 25%, 50%, 75% and a 100% in terms of the severity relative to an \u201808 recession or whatever the case might be. So, while we do use a model and one scenario, there is flex there, if you will, in terms of ensuring that we capture what we think best reflects the forward view of the economic outlook in our analysis. And in terms of as we \u2013 as I may have mentioned \u2013 I think I mentioned earlier at some point you\u2019ve got to put a stake in the ground at the end of the quarter and look at the assumptions that we have to work with in terms of those thousands of variables and certainly the key ones that I mentioned. And this quarter in particular, we\u2019ve seen things continue to move and so even the view that we would have taken at the end of the quarter around many of those metrics \u2013 the outlook on them have been \u2013 has continued to shift. And so we find ourselves running various scenarios to understand the impact on our ratios and on our estimated losses, including ranges of unemployment from 10% to 15% and GDP declines from 20% to 40% we\u2019re constantly kind of running those scenarios to understand the implications on our CET1 ratio and other important metrics that are required to properly run and manage and plan at the firm.\nSaul Martinez: Got it. Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nMark Mason: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Great, thanks. Mark, just quick question first on the ICG and the reserve coverage there. I hear that you said that you\u2019re comfortable with it. When you kind of look at the reserve that you have against the total exposures. It\u2019s about an 80 basis points against all the exposures, but yeah, you\u2019re looking at non-investment grade being 21% of the portfolio. So what kind of metrics are you keying on to get comfort there? It doesn\u2019t seem like it takes a large amount of delinquencies also and have a large increase in losses?\nMark Mason: You know, look we\u2019ve got, there are series of metrics that we use in the case of the ICG, GDP is an important metric, obviously a view on downgrades is an important metric, a view on energy prices, oil prices is an important metric and as you \u2013 we don\u2019t have the entire portfolio parsed here. But that 81 basis points is going to be a mix of where we feel as though we need to have more \u2013more reserves and so one example is that when we built additional reserves and you can look at kind of our reserve ratio for the energy sector for example and that\u2019s closer to 2%, 2.1% in terms of the funded reserve ratio. And so, I highlight that as just a simple example of obviously there going to be some higher, some lower and in terms of the broader non-investment grade similar to that example, I just gave you, the broader non-investment grade bucket is closer to 2% in terms of the reserve ratio. So, again, I can understand the question given the 81 basis points, but we are \u2013 obviously are using good judgment as we look through the different risk profile of the portfolio.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: And then with regards to the guidance that you\u2019re giving about how March and April could trend out to the rest of the quarter, I mean, is there any given update on kind of \u2013 I\u2019m sorry if you gave it already, but how purchase sales were trending in April and how the revenues in TTS were trending in April. I mean, you said March they were down 9% in TTS, is that gotten worse in April? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Sure. I don\u2019t have the spend activity at hand. If I look here for April. I\u2019m not sure if you call it, I said earlier, but the card spend activity towards the end of March, the last week in March has been around 30%, down 30% with a mix across the difference across the differences in the different categories. In terms of TTS, again, I don\u2019t have the April stats, we did see kind of pressure in the month of March and what I was referencing there was the rate pressure playing through in terms of commercial card activity just as another proxy for spend similar to the retail card or consumer card spend levels that was down pretty meaningfully, which says a lot about our corporate client base in terms of T&E, commercial card spend was down almost 60% and kind of B2B, business-to-business, commercial card activity was down some 19% in the month of March. And so, but likely those trends continue. However, I would kind of just note that we continue to see very good engagement with our TTS client base and we see that in the higher volumes that we saw in Q1, we expect as that will continue, we see that in the new accounts that we\u2019re opening with them, we would expect that to continue, including utilizing many of our digital capabilities there. And frankly, as this continues to evolve with all of the uncertainty that it comes with, we would expect that we\u2019re going to be a critical partner to these large multinational clients as they think about what the new norm looks like. And so the metrics will move, the top line will move in light of the rate environment, but I think those underlying drivers, if you will, say a lot about what the future prospects are for the firm here. Mike, you want to comment on \u2013\nMike Corbat: If I can just quickly, Mark before we close out here. I just want to go back to Mike\u2019s question and apologize for having flipped my numbers. We\u2019ve got globally over 80% of our staff working remotely and the number in Hong Kong is that we\u2019ve got about a third back and two-thirds still working remotely. So Mike, I apologize for getting that one inverted. Operator with that, I think that concludes the call.\nOperator: Thanks for today \u2013\nElizabeth Lynn: Thank you all for joining us today. Please feel free to reach out to us in Investor Relations if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you and have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your calling. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 4, Citigroup reported first quarter net income of $2.5 billion. Results included a $4.9 billion increase in credit reserves this quarter. This reserve increased reflects the impact of changes in our economic outlook due to COVID-19. These builds are larger, given a significant impact this change in our economic outlook has on our estimated lifetime losses under the new CECL standard. Revenues of $20.7 billion grew 12% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher markets revenues and the benefit of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio. Expenses were roughly flat year-over-year, and we were able to deliver positive operating leverage and a 27% improvement in operating margin. Credit costs were $7 billion this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 19% for the first quarter, below our full year outlook, reflecting a small benefit associated with stock-based incentive compensation. The ultimate economic impact of this health crisis and our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters. The impact that we are already seeing varies across our franchise. We saw the earliest impact on consumer behavior in Asia as spending slowed in response to restrictions on travel and other commercial activity. We're seeing the same pattern today here in the US and now beginning in Mexico, which is likely to put pressure on loan balances. However, deposit growth remains strong across regions and we're leveraging digital channels to engage with our client. The rate environment has changed significantly. Our accrual businesses reflect the impact of the three US rate cuts seen last year, as well as some impact from additional cuts seen this quarter in response to the crisis, with an expectation for a more pronounced impact going forward. Although I would know that this has been partially offset in areas like TTS, where clients are moving volumes towards us as a stable partner of choice. A similar dynamic is playing out in markets, where we are also seen as a counterparty of choice. Additionally, we are seeing higher corporate loan volumes reflecting drawdowns and new facilities given our clients response to the crisis. And finally, our performance in investment banking reflects the market volatility we've seen, as well as the uncertainty that remains on the corporate side. From the onset, we've been focused on our employees and our clients and ensuring we maintain balance sheet strength to serve them through this uncertainty. As of March 31st, our CET 1 capital ratio was 11.2%, below our stated target of 11.5% even our efforts to support our clients through this period. Additionally, we had over $800 billion in available liquidity to help support our clients, and including the $4.1 billion transition impact as we adopted CECL at the beginning of the year, as well as the additional reserves taken this quarter, credit reserves stand at roughly $23 billion with a reserve ratio of 2.9% on funded loans.  With the level of capital, liquidity and the reserves we hold today, plus significant pre-provision earnings power, we are operating from a position of strength. We're combining this financial strength with operational resiliency, given investments in our people, operations and technology along with digital capabilities which allow us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis. Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 2% as growth in North America was partially offset by lower revenues in Asia, reflecting the initial impact of COVID-19 on customer behavior. Expenses were roughly flat, allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and 5% improvement in operating margin. Total credit costs of $4.8 billion were up significantly from last year, including a reserve build of approximately $2.8 billion, primarily related to the impact of changes in our economic outlook. Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 4% from last year. Although the impact of COVID-19 has only been felt in North America in recent weeks, we have leveraged our experience in Asia to inform our response strategy. We're one of the first banks in the US to provide assistance to help impacted customers starting in early March. We've since expanded that support and continue to evaluate whether additional support is needed. In addition, the enhancements we have made to our digital capabilities have prepared us to better respond and continue serving our customers as they manage through this pricing. Digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter at $1.6 billion. We continue to drive mobile adoption of 13% year-over-year. We made change to allow our customers to use self service channels for more transactions, including increased limits for ATM withdrawals, mobile check deposits and Zelle transaction. And we've continued to launch new digitally led value proposition such as Citi Wealth Builder, a new digital investment platform for clients in the emerging affluent segments. These capabilities are allowing us to remain engaged with our clients, even as roughly 40% of our branches in the US are now temporarily closed, driven by lower customer traffic, particularly in urban areas. Turning now to the businesses. Branded cards revenue of $2.3 billion grew 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% loan growth and continued spread expansion with net interest revenue as a percentage of loans improving to 933 basis points this quarter. Client engagement remained strong through February with purchase sales growth of roughly 10% for the first two months of the quarter. However, as seen across the industry, purchase sales declined significantly in late March with the implementation of more extensive lockdowns in many states. Categories like travel and entertainment have seen the biggest impact, while there has been some offset from higher spending on essentials as well as higher online sales. So in total, we grew a purchase sale of 3% in branded cards in the first quarter, but the trend line over the past month would indicate a significant decline in purchase activity in the second quarter, which is expected to impact loan growth. Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were largely unchanged year-over-year, as a benefit of stronger deposit volumes and an improvement in mortgage revenues were offset by lower deposit spreads. Our deposit momentum continued to improve with average deposits of 8%. As I noted earlier, digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter even as we continue to adjust pricing, given the current rate environment. We also saw a strong engagement with existing clients, driving balanced growth across deposit [technical difficulty], including checking. While AUMs declined by 6% due to market movements, we drove continued growth in Citigold households and investment fees during the quarter and mortgage revenues grew as a result of increased refinancing activity. Finally, retail services revenues of $1.7 billion were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower partner payments and higher average loan. Purchase sales were down 3% year-over-year in the first quarter, again, including significant pressure in late March, driven by reduced client activity and store closures at some of our partners. This is expected to have an impact on new account acquisitions and loan balances as we move through the year. Total expenses for North America Consumer were down 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume related costs. Turning to credit, total credit costs of $3.9 billion increased significantly from last year. We built roughly $2.4 billion in reserves this quarter, reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook. And net credit losses grew by 8% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolio. Our NCL rates in US branded cars and retail services were 346 and 553 basis points, respectively. Consistent with the uptake we've typically seen in the first quarter. Historically, we've seen higher NCL rates in the first half versus the second half of the year. However, given the rapidly changing economic environment due to COVID-19, we are likely to see increased pressure on NCL rates in the back half of 2020, consistent with the reserve actions we took this quarter. On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 1% year-over-year in the first quarter. Despite the early emergence of COVID-19 in the region, we saw strong investment in FX revenues through most of the quarter. This was offset by lower purchase sales activity and loan balances in our card business, driven by restrictions on movement and changes in customer behavior. We also saw an impact on customer acquisitions in products like insurance, which rely more heavily on face-to-face engagement. However, average deposit growth remained strong at 8% this quarter, and we continue to drive digital engagement across the franchise. Today, we are seeing some early signs that we'll pick up in activity in China as movement restrictions have eased over the past week or so. But that is a small consumer business for us and of course, many other markets are still in an earlier stage of managing through the crisis. Turning to Latin America, total consumer revenues were largely unchanged year-over-year and grew 3% excluding a residual gain last year on the sale of our asset management business. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter, with average balances up 4%. And we're also benefitting from improved spreads in card. However, we continue to see pressure on overall loan growth. And while we haven't yet seen the full impact from COVID-19 in Mexico, we did see a slowdown in purchase sales in March, which is expected to continue as customer behavior will likely follow the pattern we've seen in other regions. In total, operating expenses for our international business were up 3% in the first quarter, driven by Mexico, reflecting investments as well as episodic items partially offset by efficiency savings and cost of credit increased to $939 million, primarily driven by the impact of changes in our economic outlook. Slide 8 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends, which shows the seasonality we typically see in the first quarter. Overall, we have not seen a pronounced impact from COVID-19 on our credit statistics, but it is still early. We do anticipate rising unemployment and therefore higher loss rates than originally expected for this year. However, it is unclear what benefit the historic $2 trillion relief package as well as our own customer relief efforts will have in helping to mitigate some of the potential stress on consumers. I would also note that we are taking appropriate actions to manage new and existing credit exposures, including investments in our operation. And importantly, as I've noted on prior calls, we feel good about the quality of our consumer credit portfolios, both relative to the industry as well as Citi's historical risk exposure. If you look at our US card portfolios as an example, the FICO distributions of our outstanding loans and open to buy exposures due much more towards the higher end than before the 2008 crisis. And as a result, when we stress today's card portfolios to the same level as 2008, our pro forma loss rates are 25% to 30% lower than experienced in the last crisis. In Asia as you can see from our credit metrics, we maintain a very low risk portfolio targeted at high quality consumers in both our unsecured and mortgage portfolio, where our average LTV is less than 50%. In Mexico, we clearly serve a wider range of clients compared to our other region, given our national footprint. However, we generally target a higher quality segment than our local peers. The credit profile of our clients has improved over time, as we have remained disciplined and tightened down lending criteria since the crisis, which is reflected in our more stable NCL rates over the past few years. We generate strong margins in Mexico as well, with a net credit margin of cards for example, of roughly 20%. That said, clearly the impact of COVID-19 is not fully known at this point and we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 9. Revenues of $12.5 billion increased 25% in the first quarter, as strong performance in fixed income and equity markets as well as the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in TTS and corporate lending. The quarter also benefited from the impact of $816 million of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges, as credit spreads widen during the quarter. Total banking revenues of $5.2 billion decreased 6%. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues of $2.4 billion were down 5% as reported and 2% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Our global footprint enables us to have a unique relationship with our clients. Even the breadth of that relationship, we're playing a pivotal role in helping our clients navigate through these unprecedented times. We continue to see robust underlying business drivers in TTS, including 24% growth in end-of-period deposits in constant dollars, as well as 6% growth in cross-border flows. And we continue to see that benefit of our investment in technology, given the accelerated adoption of digital tools. In March, while we, as well as most of our clients were working remotely, we opened close to 1,000 accounts digitally, three times the number we opened digitally in March of last year. We've also seen a rapid growth in CitiDirect users, up 25% year-over-year in the quarter to over 580,000 users. And within that, active mobile users increased tenfold this year. But as we exited the quarter, we did see the full pressure of the lower rate environment begins to take hold, with revenues down 9% year-over-year in the month of March on a reported basis. Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were largely unchanged from last year, outperforming the market wallet as growth in M&A and equity underwriting were offset by decline in debt underwriting. However, I would note that investment grade debt underwriting was up double-digits year-over-year, as we helped our clients source liquidity in this evolving environment. Private bank revenues of $949 million grew 8%, driven by increased capital markets activity as we supported our clients through turbulent market conditions. In higher lending and deposit volumes, partially offset in lower deposit spreads, reflecting the impact of lower interest rate. Corporate lending revenues of $448 million were down 40%, primarily reflecting an adjustment to the residual value of the lease financing, as well as other marks on the portfolio. And while average loans were roughly flat, we did see a meaningful increase in end-of-period loans this quarter, reflecting the drawdowns and new facilities that I mentioned earlier, as we continue to support our clients. Total markets and Security Services revenues of $6.5 billion increased 37% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $4.8 billion to 39% year-over-year, with growth across rates and currencies and commodities. As volatility, volumes and spreads reached record levels, we actively made markets during this turbulent period for both corporate and investor clients. Equities revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% versus last year, reflecting a strong performance in derivatives, including an increase in client activity due to higher volatility. And finally in security services, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars, driven by higher client activity and deposit volume partially offset by lower spread. Total operating expenses of $5.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher compensation costs, continued investments and volume-driven growth. Total credit costs of $2 billion were up significantly from last year, we built roughly $1.9 billion in reserves this quarter. The increase in reserves primarily reflected the impact of changes in the economic outlook, as well as some downgrades along with volume growth in the portfolio. As of quarter end, our funded reserve ratio was 81 basis points, including a funded reserve ratio of roughly 2% on the non-investment grade portion. We provide more details on the corporate portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. Total non-accrual loans increased sequentially this quarter, but the ratio of non-accrual to total corporate loans remained low at 57 basis points. Overall, we feel good about our corporate credit quality and like consumer, we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we see out there today. Slide 10 shows the results for corporate/other. Revenues of $73 million declined significantly from last year, reflecting the wind down of legacy asset, the impact of lower rates, as well as marks on legacy securities as spreads widened during the quarter. Expenses were down 24% as the wind down of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs, as well as incremental costs associated with COVID-19, including a special compensation award granted to roughly 75,000 employees who are being most directly impacted by COVID-19. And the pretax loss was $535 million this quarter, higher than our previous outlook, reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, locks on security, the impact of lower rates as well as the special compensation award. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.5 billion this quarter declined slightly year-over-year as the impact of lower rates was mostly offset by loan growth and an extra day, along with higher trading related NIR. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $330 million, reflecting the lower rate environment, one fewer day in the quarter and the adjustment in corporate lending that I mentioned earlier. And net interest margin declined 15 basis points sequentially, with lower net interest revenues driving roughly half of the decline and the remainder reflecting growth in the balance sheet. Turning to non-interest revenue, in the first quarter, healthy business performance for most of the quarter as well as a strong pickup in trading activity in March drove a significant increase in non-interest revenue. As we look to the second quarter, we expect both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues to decline, reflecting the full quarter impact of lower rates, as well as a much more pronounced impact from COVID-19. On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio declined to 11.2% driven mostly by the increase in risk weighted assets. The increase in RWA reflected our support to our customers as well as increased market volatility and widening credit spreads. Our supplementary in leverage ratio was 6%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% to $71.52 driven by net income and the reduced share count. In summary, the environment changed dramatically this quarter, but we continue to operate well in a challenging environment. We ended the period with a strong capital liquidity position. We certainly saw the impact of slower global growth and macro uncertainty on our top line results as we exited the quarter. But we feel good about our ability to manage risk through the cycle. We remain disciplined in our target client strategy and feel strongly that our focus on these higher quality, more resilient segments is the right strategy in any economic environment. Looking to the second quarter and the rest of 2020, let me remind you that we are all operating with a great deal of uncertainty today. And our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters. With that said, given the adverse impact of COVID-19, we no longer expect to deliver a RoTCE of 12% to 13% for the full year. Based on what we're seeing today, on the top line, we expect the revenue trend in the latter part of March and the beginning of April characterized by COVID related lower level of activity, particularly in banking, and our consumer franchise, will continue through much of the second quarter. And in our markets business, revenue should reflect the broader industry. The first quarter is typically the strongest quarter, and clearly this year was particularly strong, so we would expect some normalization in activity levels here. And finally, we will see the more pronounced impact of the lower rate environment on the top line. On the expense side, there are couple things that are important to consider as we think about running the franchise and managing our expenses, including the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, how do we continue to protect our employees who are on the front line and how do we ensure that we are able to help our customers manage through this. And from this standpoint, we're being thoughtful about where we need to deploy resources to ensure we can deliver for our customers, in a period where roughly 80% of our workforce is working remotely. Here we feel good about the investments we've made over the last few years in technology. These investments are allowing us to manage through this period, and support our customers and clients through digital mean. However, I would also note that during these unprecedented times, we are also exploring all opportunities to operate as efficiently as possible and potentially repay certain investments we would have otherwise made, in order to offset some of the headwinds created by COVID-19. We would also expect to see a natural reduction and some volume related expenses, including T&E, meetings and event calls. So again, there's a lot of uncertainty today, but we will have more to say on both the top line impact as well as these efficiency efforts in the coming month as the impact of COVID-19 is better understood. But that should hopefully give you a sense of how we're thinking about the environment and our pre-provision earnings power. Turning to credit. Looking ahead to the second quarter and the remainder of 2020, we do expect a higher level of losses given our current outlook. And as our outlook continues to evolve, it is also reasonable to expect additional increases in credit reserves if our outlook deteriorates further. However, given the credit quality of our portfolio, we remain confident in our ability to maintain our overall strength and stability, as well as continue to support our customers and win new business. Undoubtedly, every company around the world will feel an economic impact from this unprecedented situation. But we are confident that Citi will emerge in a position of strength, having demonstrated that we lived up to our stated objective to be an indisputably strong and stay institution and having shown that we stood by our clients and supported our customers and employees during this very difficult time. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Sure. Good morning, Glenn. So you know, you can turn to page 20, we've broken out some additional you know, details here and you can see you know, we started or ended the year, I should say with about $14 billion in reserves, you're right the lion's share that is in cards in split between branded you know, and retail and you know our focus obviously is tends to be on the higher \u2013 the higher FICO scored you know, clients and that skews certainly the case in cards and tends to be higher on retail services, but not quite as high as on the cards' side. And so that's going to you know, impact a little bit the split between the two. You can see in terms of the day one impact that was about $4.1 billion. We talked about that on the last call, and we built another $4.9 billion, so that gets us to a total reserve balance of almost $23 billion. What it point out is you know, the cards piece obviously is at roughly $9.5 billion, but again \u2013 I mean 9.5%, excuse me of LLR to loans. But again you know, we tend to you know, to think of this as a higher quality book. In terms of the factors that become important you know, there are a host of variables that we run through our model, as well as combined with severity of a recession, probability of a recession, I would say that the two most critical as it relates to cards and again, they're all important in understanding how they work together becomes important. But two very important ones become obviously GDP and unemployment, and how that affects the underlying behavior of the consumer in each of those instances. Obviously, the retail services there, our partners that we have that are you know, more directly impacted by the COVID-19 situation, but we also have the $2 trillion relief stimulus that's been introduced and a little bit unclear as to how that ultimately plays out and impacts the behavior. So lots of puts and takes going you know, through the model, the \u2013 those economic assumptions change kind of straight through the end of the quarter, but the short of it is that you know, based on our outlook as have been you know, this additional build of $2.4 billion per cards you know was the appropriate amount for us to take. Hi, Erika. Good morning. Yeah, sure I mean, what I said was that you know, if you take the cards portfolio we have today which is of a better quality, then it was back in \u201808, and you were to stress it for the \u201808 financial crisis that yes, our pro forma loss rates would be 25% to 30% lower than what we experienced in the last crisis. That is \u2013 that's what I see. Yeah, why don't I start, Mike or? You know look, I think our view is, we are clearly living in an uncertain period of time. The crisis we're facing is unprecedented. And you know, if I think about our objectives, you know, primary objective ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees, second to that or an addition to that ensuring that we are positioned to serve our clients, our customers and to play an important role in stabilizing the economy. And so when I think about the combination of those things, we want to be there for our clients. And I think we're expected to be there for our clients in a period like this. And you've seen our CET1 ratio dropped to 11.2% this quarter and as the needs of our clients evolve, we're going to be there for them and that means that our ratio takes more pressure than we'll manage through that. If we were to drop you know, below the 10% that you referenced, there's still plenty of room between that and the use of the buffer that the - you know, that the regulators have authorized. And so we're managing it thoughtfully, diligently but in the context of those priorities that I mentioned. Yeah. Good morning, Betsy. Yeah let me comment a little bit more broadly on the deposits. So you know, the ICG deposits that we saw come in the month of March, we're about $92 billion our deposits grew pretty significantly just in the month of March. And if I break that down about a third of that were from corporate clients that built liquidity through draws or issuance. And it's not you know, necessarily just liquidity you know, just draws from us, but about a third of it, we would attribute as being tied towards that increase in liquidity draws or issuances that they've done. About a third were from brokered dealers and clearing houses and financial institutions as they bolstered kind of their liquidity buffers. And then a third were from investor clients derisking and moving to cash. And so that gives you a little bit of a sense for a mix. We obviously look at the persistency of the deposits and you know, some of those are certainly operating deposits. And I think part of what will inform the view to some extent is, as Mike described you know, the additional you know, channels that are now available for clients to access additional liquidity as needed. But also how long this persist and there's a fair amount of uncertainty as you've heard us reference as to how long you know, this crisis we're managing through persists. So hopefully it gives you a sense. Sure, I don't \u2013 why don't I start just in terms of the spend. And so you know in the quarter if I think about kind of the last week of March, the card spend activity you know, just broadly for us was down about 30% US spend, you know, by category down total of 30%. The big you know, categories, if you will, impact it are not going to be of any surprise to you travel down 75%, dining and entertainment down some 60% you know, discretionary retail which would include you know, apparel, the department stores, et cetera, down 50% you know, essentials were up 10%. And so, as you would \u2013 as I think you would expect and again, that got us to a total of down about 30% in just the last week. We all have seen what has continued to happen over the past couple of weeks. And so, I would expect, we would expect there to be continued pressure on purchase sale volumes through most of the second quarter, in light of the way this is persisting, and that you know, should play out as well on ultimately loan volumes in which we expect to see some top line pressure there. You know, similarly as you referenced that we have a large retail services business and we have partner clients who we advise in that regard and we've been working with them to help drive sales digitally. But obviously the shutdown in most of the economy and the stay at home orders as well as the temporary store closures across most of the country will certainly impact our partners and our results, including a slowdown in new customer acquisitions as well as again, a lower purchase sales volumes \u2013 volume through you know, through that part of our business. You know, that said you know, we've got a number of partners who do operate or a large partner I should say who do operate you know as essential resources to you know, to the economy and while they'll have lower store traffic, they will be able to continue to kind of serve. And ultimately you know, as I said, we would expect the second quarter to have some of that top line pressure play through and over the course of the year to see a pickup in NCLs subject to, of course, how things like the $2 trillion relief package and some of the other customer relief offerings that we put out take hold. I \u2013 I don't have the credit metrics available. What I would say is that, you know, while we do appeal to the broader population there, we do tend to focus on the higher and certainly relative to our peer players in that Mexico market. And so, we do skew to the higher end in terms of the credit profile. They have a different system and the FICO system per se. And we actually have been you know, very closely monitoring as you've seen over the past number of quarters our loan volumes have, in fact, trended lower than that of the broader industry as we've you know, been and quite vigilant about focus and staying inside of our risk parameters, which again, do skew higher than most of the peers in that country. Hi, Mike. Let me make a couple of comments to that. One, you know, again, a lot of uncertainty here dealing with a significant crisis as you well know. Even as we have closed out this quarter, the variables you know, that we look at continue to shift you know, meaningfully. I would expect that you know, with that as a backdrop, and again, subject to a lot of things including how customers respond to the relief programs that are out there, so on and so forth that we would see additional builds in the second quarter. And that's kind of where we are. I mean I \u2013 I'm not going to you know, we've got the rest of the quarter to play out. We've got you know, analysis and models that we have to do. We have you know, consumers that have to respond to much of the stimulus that's out there. We've got to understand how it continues to impact the different businesses that we're in. it's way too early to give you any sense for what that number is. Yeah. Go ahead, Mike sorry. Thanks. Hey, Saul. Good morning. Look, I think you said a lot there. I think that it is a reference point, I think you've highlighted you know, some meaningful differences in the approaches and perspectives everything from you know, the modeling, the assumptions like et cetera, et cetera. And so I think it does serve as a reference point. But I think what we're experiencing now and even as we submitted a plan from a CCAR point of view, is that you know, that's a scenario. It certainly is a stress scenario, but we're now living through a real life stress situation. And I think you know, that scenario is meant to \u2013 those scenarios are meant to inform you know, a firm's ability to withstand stress, but we've got a real test here that has put us and I think the industry in a position where we are constantly you know, modeling and demonstrating our ability to withstand real-time pressures and the prospect of real life losses. Now with that said, you know, CECL, you know, a new approach I think that the timing is interesting in that we get to see a \u2013 we see a meaningful shift between transition and day one, which I would think in a normal environment, you wouldn't see that type of dramatic shift. But again you know, that's informed by you know, a view \u2013 a forward looking view of what is now a crisis in a stressed environment. And so that magnitude of the change that we see in the day two is a direct byproduct of that. And I think what we'll see is, that continues to you know, that what we do in the way of forward reserves will continue to be informed by that. And what we ultimately experienced in losses, however, will be informed by how much of the uncertainty that I talked to plays out. So again, no stress scenario that's been created you know, thus far you know, would have contemplated the amount of fiscal response and monetary response that we've seen in short order. You know and so that's not modeled and how customers or consumers react to that is not part of any CCAR DFAST model that we would have run. How that offsets the impact of you know, unemployment or ultimately losses is completely unclear. And so, there's a fair amount, you know, yes, it's a data point you know, but there's a fair amount of uncertainty and now differences I would expect in light of now managing through a real life scenario. Yeah, so we do use a model approach, where we use a scenario, but what I would say is that, that scenario was informed by kind of a further management adjustment and the factors that are considered are not only thousands of variables like GDP and unemployment and many, many, many other stats given the nature of the business that we do, but also the probability of recession and the severity of the recession and we can toggle in our management adjustment degrees of severity that we would expect in a recession, whether that's 25%, 50%, 75% and a 100% in terms of the severity relative to an \u201808 recession or whatever the case might be. So, while we do use a model and one scenario, there is flex there, if you will, in terms of ensuring that we capture what we think best reflects the forward view of the economic outlook in our analysis. And in terms of as we \u2013 as I may have mentioned \u2013 I think I mentioned earlier at some point you've got to put a stake in the ground at the end of the quarter and look at the assumptions that we have to work with in terms of those thousands of variables and certainly the key ones that I mentioned. And this quarter in particular, we've seen things continue to move and so even the view that we would have taken at the end of the quarter around many of those metrics \u2013 the outlook on them have been \u2013 has continued to shift. And so we find ourselves running various scenarios to understand the impact on our ratios and on our estimated losses, including ranges of unemployment from 10% to 15% and GDP declines from 20% to 40% we're constantly kind of running those scenarios to understand the implications on our CET1 ratio and other important metrics that are required to properly run and manage and plan at the firm. Okay. You know, look we've got, there are series of metrics that we use in the case of the ICG, GDP is an important metric, obviously a view on downgrades is an important metric, a view on energy prices, oil prices is an important metric and as you \u2013 we don't have the entire portfolio parsed here. But that 81 basis points is going to be a mix of where we feel as though we need to have more \u2013more reserves and so one example is that when we built additional reserves and you can look at kind of our reserve ratio for the energy sector for example and that's closer to 2%, 2.1% in terms of the funded reserve ratio. And so, I highlight that as just a simple example of obviously there going to be some higher, some lower and in terms of the broader non-investment grade similar to that example, I just gave you, the broader non-investment grade bucket is closer to 2% in terms of the reserve ratio. So, again, I can understand the question given the 81 basis points, but we are \u2013 obviously are using good judgment as we look through the different risk profile of the portfolio. Sure. I don't have the spend activity at hand. If I look here for April. I'm not sure if you call it, I said earlier, but the card spend activity towards the end of March, the last week in March has been around 30%, down 30% with a mix across the difference across the differences in the different categories. In terms of TTS, again, I don't have the April stats, we did see kind of pressure in the month of March and what I was referencing there was the rate pressure playing through in terms of commercial card activity just as another proxy for spend similar to the retail card or consumer card spend levels that was down pretty meaningfully, which says a lot about our corporate client base in terms of T&E, commercial card spend was down almost 60% and kind of B2B, business-to-business, commercial card activity was down some 19% in the month of March. And so, but likely those trends continue. However, I would kind of just note that we continue to see very good engagement with our TTS client base and we see that in the higher volumes that we saw in Q1, we expect as that will continue, we see that in the new accounts that we're opening with them, we would expect that to continue, including utilizing many of our digital capabilities there. And frankly, as this continues to evolve with all of the uncertainty that it comes with, we would expect that we're going to be a critical partner to these large multinational clients as they think about what the new norm looks like. And so the metrics will move, the top line will move in light of the rate environment, but I think those underlying drivers, if you will, say a lot about what the future prospects are for the firm here. Mike, you want to comment on \u2013"

            "name": "Mike Corbat",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz and good morning everyone. Today, we've reported earnings for the first quarter of 2020, with net income of $2.5 billion, we had earnings per share of $1.05. Our earnings were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we had strong revenue performance as the economic shocks caused by the pandemic weren't felt until late in the quarter and we continue to show expense discipline. However, as you would expect, credit costs reduced our net income. The significant loan loss reserves we took also reflected the Day-2 impact of the new CECL accounting standard. In our Institutional Clients Group, we had strong performance in our markets business as we help clients navigate severe volatility that led to trading revenues that were higher than last year and what is typically a strong quarter for that business as it is. Treasury and trade solutions was impacted by the cuts to interest rates, but client engagement stayed very strong throughout the quarter. Investment Banking matched last year's solid performance as we continue to gain share among our target clients. Global Consumer Banking also fared well from a revenue perspective, considering the environment. In the US, and its strong revenue growth in cards with branded in retail services of 7% and 4%, respectively. We grew average deposits 8% with another solid portion acquired digitally. In Asia, we saw a slight revenue decline as the economic impacts of COVID-19 first materialized in that region. In Mexico, revenues rose modestly, excluding a one-time gain from 2019 as the virus had limited impact on that country's economy during the quarter. Our tangible book value per share increased to $71.52 at the end of the quarter, up 9% from a year ago. We ended the quarter with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 11.2% as our risk weighted assets increased significantly due to increased client demand. As I've said, this isn't a financial crisis, it's a public health crisis with severe economic ramifications. Although we did have good revenue performance this quarter, we exited the quarter in a dramatically different environment. While we've built significant loan loss reserves, no one knows what the severity or longevity of the virus's impact on the global economy will be. That said, we entered this crisis in a very strong position from a capital, liquidity and balance sheet perspective. We have the resources we need to serve our clients without jeopardizing our safety and soundness. Now, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some of the things that we're doing to help our people, clients and communities which you can see on Slide 3. I have to say I'm very proud of how our people have responded to this fast-moving situation. We've been very aggressive, shifting to remote working to reduce our people's chances of becoming infected, where the spread of the virus dictates it, we only have people going to our sites if there's no possible way, they can perform their roles remotely. For example, last week in North America Markets and Securities Services 98% of our people worked remotely and globally, our people adapted well to this new way of working with over 80% of our colleagues working remotely. Investments we've made in our technology have allowed us to operate very smoothly in a set of circumstances that would have been hard to imagine with such a large share of our workforce working remotely at the same time. These investments are also helping us to serve our clients through digital and mobile channels whether it's a consumer depositing a check or a corporate treasurer managing liquidity. Our investments in risk management and controls will never complete are also serving us well in the face of the severe economic downturn and large swings across markets, whether in equities, fixed income or commodities. We've tried to help keep our people financially healthy as well and reduce the stress they're facing. We decided last month to make a one-time payment of $1,000 to employees who make $60,000 or less per year in the US that are making equivalent payments in our international markets. And we've halted new reductions in our workforce for the time being. From a consumer and institutional perspective, we're well positioned to serve the clients and the customer segments we've been focusing on. We know many consumers are facing real struggles, and we're doing our best to support them. We were quick to implement the ways to reduce the burden on our consumer appliance and announced additional accommodations last week in the US. While we haven't been a large player in small business lending, we're ramping up our efforts so we can support clients who participate in the Payroll Protection Plan, and we have additional consumer relief programs in place in our international consumer franchise. We're working hard to support our corporate clients, many of whom are facing financial pressure. We've been able to support them, while keeping within our risk and liquidity limits. We've also been helping the communities we served during this extraordinarily difficult time, partnering with groups like the World Health Organizations, Citi's foundations have already committed $30 million today to support those impacted and we'll make additional announcements in coming days. We've donated personal protective equipment, the hospital workers and last week we started using our cafeteria in our headquarters to make meals for food banks. Our people keep coming up with new ways to help and I couldn't be prouder. And as a Bank, we'll do everything we can to support the broader economy. We serve as the transmission mechanism for policymakers for both fiscal and monetary, which they can use as a bridge to the real economy. Looking forward, there are too many unknowns to count. The path that virus will chart, whether there will be successful interventions, the action government leaders will take either reopen the economy or put in place measures that will further restrict it. We also have to bear in mind, COVID-19 is a new disease and the medical guidance continues to evolve, as you would expect. But we feel confident in our ability to manage through whatever scenario comes to pass and with that, Mark will go through our presentations and then we'd be happy to answer your questions. Yeah, Glenn, I would say that the actions that we've seen out of the combination of the Fed and the Treasury are truly extraordinary, not just in terms of the volume of dollars and programs, but I think the breath that's there and the speed at which they've implemented them I mean, whether it's it's been the CP facility, the money market liquidity facility, the repo facilities, the broader corporate pieces, the SBA loans and now not something that's being talked about that much, but this main street program that's there. And I think from a plumbing perspective, your question's a good one, because obviously the real economy doesn't have direct access to the Fed or to the Treasury. And I think if the banks and in particular, the big banks role, one of many roles that we played to be that transmission mechanism between fiscal monetary and the real economy. And I think you can just see in terms of in the early days, how the markets were trading, a lot of the fears and concerns that were there and whether it was the early fears of draws, whether it was the early fears of money funds that being able to get liquidity across the board, and I think the programs have gone a long way. I think that there still a few things out there that probably need some work. And certainly, as an institution, as an industry, we're in constant dialogue with the Fed and the Treasury on those. And again, as I suspect as those things create challenges, it's likely that we will see a reaction come out of those bodies to be able to address it. So I think the plumbing is actually working pretty well that in spite of working remotely and the numbers that Mark and I spoke to, and we had in late March record volumes of trading in terms of settlement, clearing, margin \u2013 margining in the system. And again, most of that done remotely and you know, we all would have said to each other 6, 9, 12 months ago you know, we're going to model for this type of stress, we probably all would have been skeptical in terms of how the system performs. So I'm proud of how we've performed and I'm quite pleased so far, how the system has performed. Good morning, Erika. And I think to be clear, Erika not \u2013 that's not a prediction, it's just a level setting based on historic data. Sure, go ahead. Betsy. Yeah, so Betsy I would say kind of looking at the numbers, we had roughly right around about $30 billion, $32 billion worth of draws in the first quarter, so somewhere 10% or 11%, 12% of our outstanding, but unfunded. So I wouldn't call that an overly meaningful number. And I think going back to my earlier comment to Glenn, I think that the extraordinary actions taken in the CP facilities in terms of some of the corporate facilities, some of the SBA or probably more likely the main street lending facilities alleviates a lot of that pressure. I think we saw two things there, there were clearly those industries that were under stress and those were pretty easily identifiable along the list that Mark had described. And then I think there were those that just believed that it was a good time to bring in liquidity. And I think as the Fed programs and the Treasury programs came into place, the bond markets reopened, you saw record issuance of debt in the late first quarter. And again, when you look at our portfolio, it's predominantly an investment grade portfolio and that investment grade portfolio in times with those programs in place has access to the capital markets. And so we saw people shift there. Obviously something we were paying attention to. We're in constant dialogue with our clients. But again, I think you know, certainly coming into the second quarter, we've actually seen really de minimis draws on the facilities and I think in our dialogues, we don't see or feel that pressure right now. Sure. So you know, I think as Mark described, the way you know, we thought about, you saw us kind of put a balance sheet to use and you saw the CET1 move from the 11.8% to the 11.2%, clearly leaving us lots of room, lots of buffer. And again, we're early in this, you know, we don't know and where this will go, but our gut or how we're thinking about this is \u2013 this recovery is going to be uneven. I would say that as a team, we've pretty well discounted, a uniform V-shaped recovery. The question, is it U-shaped? Is it W-shaped or parts of it L-shaped? And I think we want to retain a lot of flexibility and capacity to be able to step into the situations that count. And again I think as we said that, if there's two roles, one is, how do we use our own balance sheet? And then how do we actually use and bring to life a lot of these programs and continue programs that have been put out there by the Fed and the Treasury. So in the right situations, we're prepared to let that ratio go down. We're in conversations with our board. We are in conversations with our regulator and I think Mark said you know, we feel that we've got a lot of capacity in terms of capital and things that we can do before we get near triggering any conversations around dividend, but again, we're going to treat that as a time when it comes. But you know, to be clear, in our capacity here and the way we're looking at things you know, we remained committed to paying our dividend. Yeah. So I mean, if you think about CECL and how it works in the idea of building expected lifetime losses in any given quarter, there are number of factors that come into play, you know, so your probability of recession, your severity of recession, our view on the important economic variables and how they're going to play out as well as balances. And so, as the balances you know, shift and the mix and makeup of those balances shift, that's going to have an impact on what we would expect in the way of those lifetime losses and therefore, what we would expect in a way of how that reserve balance would move. Thank you. Yeah, Matt, I think that's a great question. And I think as you think about it as, we think about all the places we come to work, I think we've got to use a series of lenses to really look at where these countries and these economies are, I would say, one is that you've got to look first at the health crisis response. Have the government's taking it seriously? Have they put measures? Have they put social distancing? Have they put stay in place types of things and what's the trajectory of that look like? I think the second piece is around what you see in terms of both monetary and fiscal response. And not just what's been to-date, but what's been the capacity of those economies to be able to implement those and more things, potentially into the future. And I think the third important piece that we look at is the underlying demographics of the economy as an example, do they have big exposures or are they dependent on oil exports or other commodities or other types of things where there's concentrations around that. And so I would say that that it's not by region, it is really and we are taking really a country-by-country approach to what that is. And I think you've seen it all over the map in terms of very strong responses out of the US, out of Japan. You've seen some responses out of Europe and I think you've seen some of those that are slower. In particular, to your question on Mexico is, we know the President has labeled himself a fiscal hawk and I think he has been reluctant to use any type of outsized spending to go at this crisis to-date. And obviously we're watching that carefully. We've tried to be pretty prudent in terms of our credit standards there and the things that we're doing and we're obviously watching it closely. Mark, do you want to \u2013 Yeah, so I think that \u2013 I would say that you know, in some ways, Mike, we you know, if you want to call it that have been fortunate to have lived that. And I think you know, we took a lot of lessons and I think you saw in our actions in terms of the moves we took in terms of getting people \u2013 remotely getting people home of the types of client engagement. And I would say, less than one that we're watching very closely is the resurgence of cases as people start to come back in. And so I think we've got to be very mindful about how and when or when and how we, in fact, do that. You saw us in very early March go, I think is the first US bank to go out and engage around in particular, our consumer customers in terms of opening up channels and talking about some forbearances and some forgiveness on fees and other things to get them engaged. And I think to Mark's point and you can see it in the credit numbers that so far relatively benign and we've been putting programs in place in most, if not all of our Asian countries in terms of similar types of forbearance programs and really trying to engage around that. So it's early, but again you could \u2013 you can see the numbers that would probably 60 days in or so that we probably had a reasonably full February and March in terms of COVID in terms of Asia, but you know, again we're watching the numbers closely, but it's around the engagement and the programs and you know, some of it was dusting off the playbooks from \u201808 and in some of the things in between. Yeah, you may have missed it. But we talked a little bit earlier, Mike in terms of the unevenness of this, that when you think of this virus that you know, it's not only uneven in terms of pacing in terms of where we are in the world, we've got at least a two to three span just in the United States in terms of where the virus is. And you know, within Asia you know, we've seen probably the most concerted efforts to get people back in in terms of China and I would say, we are largely back there. I think the last numbers I looked at as of yesterday, we were about two-thirds back in terms of Hong Kong and I would say, most of the rest of the region at lower levels than that. And so we're taking a very specific or very site-by-site view in terms of how we bring people back. So, you know, first criteria is where is the virus in its trajectory? Second criteria is, what are the things that happen at a site that are very difficult to replicate in a remote environment? And then in terms of addressing that, what's the safest way we can begin to bring people back? So that I think that \u2013 Again, I think it's place-by-place so I think we've you know, we're taking a kind of a site-by-site and \u2013 but at the same time you know, understanding again, you probably missed this part of it, you know, we're absolutely open for business. We're just working differently, right. If you look at the things that we've accomplished just in the month of March, it's not that we're not at work. You know, as an example, yesterday you know, we had over 180,000 people accessing our systems remotely at one time our peak search was 132,000 of those people on simultaneously. You think about the things that have accomplished Mark and his finance team, you know, closed the quarter on a $2 trillion balance sheet. You look at this submission of CCAR, you look at all the things that remediation efforts, the small business programs, all being applied remotely. So again, it's going to be bespoke in terms of how we do it, as Mark said, with an eye towards making sure we keep our people safe. And at the same time doing everything we can do to service our customers and clients through this extraordinary time. And it's going to be case-by-case. Thank you. If I can just quickly, Mark before we close out here. I just want to go back to Mike's question and apologize for having flipped my numbers. We've got globally over 80% of our staff working remotely and the number in Hong Kong is that we've got about a third back and two-thirds still working remotely. So Mike, I apologize for getting that one inverted. Operator with that, I think that concludes the call."

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions]  Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJen Landis: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thanks, Jen, and happy New Year, everyone. I am delighted to join you again today. Well, we've been busy, and we have a lot to talk about today. I'm going to start with an update on our strategy refresh. Then I'll share my thoughts on our fourth quarter and end on all the progress that we've made against our major priorities. As you saw earlier this week, we announced that we intend to focus our franchise in Mexico solely on our institutional and wealth management businesses, and therefore, to exit the consumer small business and middle-market banking operations there. This was not a decision we took lightly. We took a clinical look at our franchise in Mexico, and we drew the hard conclusion that the noninstitutional businesses do not fit our new strategic direction. Now to be clear, these are terrific, they're scaled, high returning franchises. But our strategic goal is to invest in businesses that are fully aligned with our core strengths and to simplify our firm. As we did the work, it was also clear that there continues to be a tremendous opportunity for our Institutional Clients Group in Mexico. Citi is Mexico's leading institutional bank. We've served corporate clients and investors there for almost a century, and that isn't going to change. Mexico has a bright future, and we are committed to playing an important role in building it. We expect Mexico will be a major recipient of global investment and trade flows in the years ahead. Therefore, we plan to maintain a significant, locally licensed bank there and invest to capture growth in a core and high-returning hub of our institutional network. This won't be a simple transaction. We have spent the last several months working through how to get the best results for our shareholders and be true to our local stakeholders. We will begin the separation process immediately and expect to begin the sales process in the spring. And of course, there will be an opportunity to return excess capital from the transaction to our shareholders. This is our final decision in terms of market exits as we conclude our strategy refresh and approach Investor Day. I'm really looking forward to talking to you about the future Citi on March 2. Today, we are going to talk you through the changes we're making to align our organization and financial reporting with our refreshed strategy. Now these changes will also allow us to reduce structural complexity and its associated costs. Amongst other things, this is going to help make Citi easier for our investors to understand. You'll be able to see and assess more simply the core businesses that make up Citi going forward. First, we're creating a new personal banking and wealth management segment, which will be run by Anand Selva. This will consist of two distinct reporting units: Our U.S. personal banking businesses; and our global wealth management business, which is going to include the private bank. Second, on the institutional side of the house, which will continue to be run by Paco Ybarra, we will begin reporting under three units: services, banking and markets. Services will include Treasury and Trade Solutions and security services, and this reflects just how important we believe these businesses are to Citi's future. Finally, we will create a new segment, legacy franchises, which will house all the businesses we intend to exit. We're going to begin reporting our financials along these segments and reporting units no later than the second quarter, to ensure you have the information you need to measure our progress and hold us accountable, and we really look forward to sharing our strategy and plans for how these businesses will work together and deliver for our shareholders on Investor Day in March. Now turning to earnings. We had a decent end to 2021. As you can see on Slide 2, we closed out the quarter with net income of $3.2 billion and EPS of $1.46. That includes a $1.2 billion hit to EBIT, primarily related to the wind down of our Korean consumer business. Excluding those impacts, our net income would be $4.2 billion, with an EPS of $1.99. Our net income for the full year of $22 billion reflects an improved credit environment and we had a resulting RoTCE of 13.4%. In ICG, we had another strong quarter in investment banking and gained share for the year in M&A. And we continue to make significant investments in talent, and we see a very solid pipeline of transactions ahead of us. Now while we could have had a better balanced performance in fixed income in the quarter, equities finished 2021 up 25% for the year. The rebound TTS is seeing in trade flows and cash volumes was not quite enough to offset the current rate environment, but it bodes well for 2022. Indeed, we think the cycle has turned for this business and it is poised to benefit as monetary policy changes and growth accelerates. You've heard Mark and I talk about improving the revenue mix of our institutional businesses as a priority, and it's yielding results with another quarter of strong momentum in fee growth across products. Parts of our consumer businesses are still weathering COVID's disruptive impact on customer behavior. In the U.S., strong purchase sales continued to be offset by elevated payment rates, but we did see loans increase in branded cards this quarter. Deposits and AUM continued to grow, with digital deposits up nearly 20% for the full year. For the year, we returned nearly $12 billion in capital to our shareholders and we grew our tangible book value per share by 7% to $79.16. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 12.2% on a standardized basis as we built the capital needed to resolve the impact of [stack up]. Now keep in mind, that regulatory change didn't take effect until January 1. While this caused us to temporarily pause our stock buyback, we will resume buybacks this quarter now that, that impact has been addressed. Finally, as Slide 3 shows, we are executing and delivering against our priorities: The strategy refresh, the transformation and our culture, and we are doing so with a real sense of urgency. First, on the strategy. We are laser focused on swiftly and successfully implementing the strategic decisions we made over the past year to improve returns to our investors.  We have signed deals in 6 of the Asia consumer markets including the agreement to sell 4 markets that we announced yesterday. This means that within 8 months of making the decision to exit these 13 businesses, we have a clear path in a majority of them, and we are well into the process in the remaining markets. In Korea, we were decisive in determining the best path for our shareholders was to wind down our consumer operation, and we're able to get most of that charge behind us this quarter. Another area where we haven't wasted any time is wealth management, where we grew our ranks by a net 800 advisers relationship managers and others over the course of the year. They helped us add about 750 private bank clients and 45,000 Citi gold clients in 2021.  In what we know as U.S. Personal Banking, we've seen good uptake of new products such as the custom cash card, and we've been building out digital platforms to capture opportunities in installment lending. And in addition to the progress we're seeing in TTS, we've also been building out our security services platform. We couldn't be more pleased to deepen our relationship with BlackRock by becoming the largest custodian for their iShares ETFs. Second priority, we continue to execute on our transformation agenda in order to demonstrably strengthen our risk and controls as well as modernize our bank for a digital world. This work, it's foundational for everything we want to achieve. We are enhancing our operating model to improve long-term efficiency and our service to clients. As it relates to the consent orders, we are deep into execution mode. We continue to be in constructive dialogue with our regulators as we get their feedback and incorporate it into our ongoing execution and project plans. Third, and relatedly, we are building a culture that expects excellence and demands accountability. We're driving this effort in a variety of ways, including a more robust performance management process at this past year-end, shifting the mix of compensation to better align with shareholders' interest and various culture-changing initiatives.  A culture of excellence also means creating a record of achievement that our people can be proud of. One area that our people take particular pride in is our ESG efforts. Later this month, we will share with you our plan to reach net zero by 2050, a commitment I made on my first day as CEO 10 months ago. And of course, we are going to do all this with a singular focus on our clients as we help them navigate COVID. We certainly hope Omicron is the final disruptive phase of this pandemic, but there are also quite a few other issues to navigate, whether macroeconomic, such as inflation, or geopolitical such as tensions with Russia. We have seen the resilience and the importance of Citi as we supported our clients through unchartered waters, and we will be with them in the next chapter as well. So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we would be delighted to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start by walking you through the financial reporting changes we plan on making in more detail. Then I'm going to walk you through the 2021 financial impact from the 13 Asia market exits as well as Mexico, and changes we are making to our financial disclosure. And then finally, the quarterly results. As part of our strategy refresh, we've started to make changes to better align with our vision and strategy. We refreshed our earnings presentation and included additional metrics and key drivers for the ICG businesses. Our goal is to simplify our financial reporting to make it much easier for our investors to understand our performance and our key assets. Turning to Slide 4, we lay out the details of the changes in the financial reporting that Jane mentioned. First, we intend to move the consumer, small business and middle market banking operations of Citi Banamex, and the 13 Asia consumer exits under a new segment called Legacy Franchises. This will allow you to better understand the financials of the remaining company that will exist post these exits. We've experienced managing businesses being divested and are putting a dedicated team in place to manage the new segment. This will free up the management teams of the go-forward businesses to fully focus on executing on the firm's strategy. Second, we are reorganizing our reporting units to help you better understand the financials of our businesses and the value they bring to Citi. Starting with ICG, we will move TTS and security services to a reporting unit called Services. These businesses are foundational for us as they have a unique position given their global footprint and full suite product offering. Markets will, therefore, no longer include security services and instead will only include equity and fixed income markets. And lastly on ICG, banking will only include advisory, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and corporate lending. The Global Consumer Bank, GCB, will be renamed Personal Banking and Wealth Management, PBWM. The Private Bank will move from ICG to PBWM.  As a reminder, we announced in January of last year that we created a single wealth management organization under Citi Global Wealth, now called Global Wealth Management, which is a distinct reporting unit. The creation of this unit unifies the wealth management teams creating a single, integrated platform serving clients across the wealth continuum from the affluent segment to the ultra-high net worth clients. North America Consumer will be renamed to U.S. Personal Banking and will remain a reporting unit under PBWM. This unit will continue to include branded cards, retail services and retail banking. We plan on providing the financials for the new reporting units on this page under the ICG and PBWM segments, starting no later than the second quarter earnings. And our Investor Day will be a natural opportunity to bring together all the work over the past year and lay out our medium-term vision and strategy for the firm. Slide 5 shows the contribution of the Citi Banamex businesses that we plan to exit as well as the contribution from the 13 Asia markets. Hopefully, this gives you a better sense of the financial results for the combined exits. And in the appendix on Page 18, we have more detail on the 13 Asia exit markets and the deals that we've announced to date. Turning to Mexico. As Jane mentioned, we remain committed to Mexico and will continue to serve our institutional and private bank clients there. That said, upon very careful consideration and analysis, we decided that we are no longer the optimal owner for the businesses that we're exiting. Mexico consumer and small business banking operations included in the intended exit represents the entirety of the Latin America Global Consumer Banking unit and the Mexico middle market banking business that is currently included in Citi's Institutional Clients Group segment. On the left side of the page, we show key figures for 2020 and 2021 for the businesses we intend to exit in Mexico. In 2021, the businesses contributed $4.7 billion of revenue and $1.1 billion of net income. The businesses in total had $20 billion of loans, $31 billion of deposits and approximately $4 billion of allocated TCE. Again, we do not yet have a transaction and are pursuing multiple divestiture path, so the ultimate financial impact of a transaction is not yet known. We will keep you updated on our progress as we run a thoughtful process that takes into consideration what is in the best interest of our shareholders as well as our clients and employees in Mexico. In addition to the opportunity to return additional capital to shareholders, these divestitures will also allow us to simplify the management and organizational structure across the firm. Now turning to Slide 6. As we've gone through our strategy refresh and simplification, we've been reviewing our disclosure in terminology and have decided that now is the right time to more closely align with our peers. First, revenue that we previously referred to as net interest revenue will now be called net interest income, and revenue that we previously referred to as non-NIR will now be called noninterest revenue. Second, as you can see on the page, we've revised how we account for insurance paid on our deposits, including FDIC and foreign deposit insurance. We have previously accounted for the deposit insurance as a control revenue and net interest income. However, beginning this quarter, we will report it as an expense and remove it from net interest income. And as a reminder, this change is earnings neutral. We've made this change to make it easier for you to compare us to our peers, and we have revised prior years to reflect the same reporting treatment to assist with comparability for 2019 to 2021, and the rest of the presentation will also reflect these 2 changes. On Slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $3.2 billion and an EPS of $1.46, an RoTCE of 7.4% on $17 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are costs of approximately $1.2 billion primarily related to the voluntary retirement program we offered in conjunction with the wind down of our Korea consumer business, as well as some additional Asia exit impacts which I will collectively refer to as the Asia divestiture impacts going forward. Excluding these impacts, EPS would have been $1.99, with an RoTCE of approximately 10%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 1% from last year as strength in noninterest revenue driven by ICG, specifically TTS, Security Services and Investment Banking, was mostly offset by lower net interest income across GCB and ICG. Our results include expenses of $13.5 billion, an increase of 18% versus the prior year. Excluding the Asia divestiture cost, expenses would have increased by 8%.  Increased expenses were largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a net benefit in the quarter, primarily driven by an ACL release of approximately $1.4 billion related to the improved macro backdrop and continued improvement in portfolio quality. Now turning to the full year. Our revenues were down 5%, driven by the normalization in markets as well as elevated payment rates in consumer, somewhat offset by strong noninterest revenue growth across ICG and in particular, in investment banking, TTS and security services. Our full year expenses were up 9%, but excluding Asia divestiture costs, our expenses were up 6%. Also for the full year, we generated RoTCE of 13% and 14% excluding Asia-related divestiture impacts. As a reminder, we had a benefit of close to $9 billion in ACL releases for the full year. On Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2021, excluding Asia divestiture impacts, expenses were up 6%, in line with previous guidance. Looking forward, we recognize that we have a lot more work to do. The divestitures provide an opportunity to simplify our management and organizational structure. We're also taking a hard look at our structural expenses, with an eye towards operating as efficiently and soundly as possible and self-funding investments. We have a lot more to say about this at our Investor Day. On Slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $130 million on a sequential basis, driven by North America Consumer. Sequentially, net interest margin remained relatively stable. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was flat. Also on a year-over-year basis, average deposits grew in the quarter as we continue to deepen relationships with our institutional clients as well as our consumer clients, particularly in North America. Average loans were roughly flat year-over-year as growth in the ICG was offset by a decline in GCB. As the probability of higher rates has increased over the last few quarters, let me make a few comments regarding the potential impact from higher rates. In our 10-Q, we disclosed interest rate sensitivity assuming a parallel shift and a runoff balance sheet. This is different from our peers' methodology, which tends to assume a static balance sheet. Assuming a static balance sheet and a 100 basis point parallel shift, we would expect Citi's total net interest income across all currencies to increase by over 3x more than what was disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q, or roughly $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net interest income. On Slide 10, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.3 trillion balance sheet, about 25% or $530 billion consists of HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. And we continue to optimize our balance sheet, deploying excess liquidity into securities as we took advantage of opportunities in the market, as well as reducing our short-term and long-term debt sequentially and year-over-year. On the loan side, corporate loans represent approximately 60% of total loans with loans to corporates outside of the U.S., representing approximately 30% of total loans. And as we've mentioned in the past, about 80% of our total corporate loans are investment grade. From a capital perspective, we ended the year with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 12.2%, as we prepared to adopt SACR on January 1. Having adopted SACR and maintained our capital ratio target, we are resuming buybacks this quarter to similar levels to what you saw in the second and third quarter of 2021. As we look into the remainder of the year, there are a number of variables with respect to capital. These include regulatory headwinds that are impacting us, along with the rest of the industry, such as elevated GSIB surcharges, as well as the timing and impact from the divestitures of the 13 Asia exits and Mexico. In light of this, you should expect us to manage to a CET1 ratio closer to 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GSIB surcharge increase at the beginning of 2023. That said, we remain focused on all aspects of capital with the goal of maintaining a CET1 ratio of 11.5%. And as you know, under the SCB framework, we can assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks, and we will continue to do so throughout the year with the goal of returning excess capital to shareholders. On Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year, driven by investment banking, private bank and security services fees, partially offset by a decline in markets. Expenses increased 10% year-over-year, driven by transformation, business-led investments and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.  Cost of credit was a net benefit of approximately $300 million as net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL release. And we continue to see strong credit performance, with net credit losses declining on a year-over-year basis and nonaccrual loans down sequentially and year-over-year. This resulted in net income of $2.5 billion, down approximately 22% from the prior year, largely driven by the higher expenses and a smaller ACL release versus the prior year. And ICG delivered a 10.8% RoTCE for the quarter. We also saw a 5% growth in both loans and deposits on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. As for the full year, ICG delivered approximately $16 billion of net income on $44 billion of revenue with an RoTCE of roughly 17%. On Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and key drivers for our ICG business for the fourth quarter. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were slightly down versus the prior year, driven by continued headwinds from rates offset by 18% growth in fees, in fact our highest fee quarter ever. And revenue did increase sequentially, driven by both net interest income and strong fee growth. We continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS on a year-over-year basis that indicate continued strong client activity. Since this is the first time we are showing key metrics that demonstrate this momentum, I want to briefly walk you through each one and what it represents. U.S. dollar clearing transactions are up 4%, which reflect the clearing and settlement activity of commercial and treasury flows for financial institutions. Cross-border flows were up 15%. These flows represent our global payment flows, where we provide cross-border solutions for our clients that are fully integrated across our TTS and Markets business and over 145 currencies. And importantly, this client activity drives recurring fee revenues and generate significant operating deposits. Commercial card volumes, which reflect travel, purchase and virtual card activity across all clients are up 48%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and, on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Investment banking revenues were up 43% year-over-year, driven by growth across products, including record advisory performance, the best advisory quarter we've had in over a decade. Private Bank revenues were up 6% year-over-year as we continue to see strong momentum in new client acquisitions. Overall markets revenues were down 17% versus last year. And while there were different dynamics that played through fixed income and equity markets performance, the performance is against a very strong quarter last year. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 20% year-over-year. While we had solid growth in FX and commodities, this was more than offset by a decline in rates and spread products. Equity Markets revenues were down 3% year-over-year as continued growth in prime finance balances and structured activities was offset by a decline in cash. Security Services revenues grew 5% year-over-year as fees grew 11%, driven by higher settlement volumes and higher assets under custody, partially offset by interest rate headwinds. Now turning to Slide 13. Here we show the results for our Global Consumer Banking business for the fourth quarter in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year-over-year, driven by lower revenues across regions. Expenses were up 34% year-over-year, driven by the Asia divestiture costs. Excluding these costs, expenses were up 9%, driven by transformation and business-led investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $105 million benefit this quarter as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. The NCL rate for the quarter was 1.2%, a decline of 61 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. We released over $900 million of ACL this quarter related to continued improvement in our economic outlook and portfolio quality, partially offset by volume growth.  This resulted in a net income decline of 42% and an RoTCE of 8%. Excluding the Asia divestitures impacts, Net income would have grown 44% and resulted in an RoTCE of 20%. As for the full year, GCB delivered $6 billion of net income on $27 billion of revenues, with an RoTCE of 17% and 22% excluding Asia divestiture impacts. On Slide 14, we show GCB revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics for the fourth quarter. Branded cards revenues declined 3% year-over-year on higher payment rates and portfolio mix. We're seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 43%, card sales volumes up 24% and average loans up 3%. In fact, the fourth quarter acquisitions exceeded the same quarter in 2019 by 2%, the first quarter to do so since the onset of the pandemic. Retail Services revenues declined 10% year-over-year, driven by a 2% decline in net interest income due to elevated payment rates as well as by higher partner payments driven by improved credit performance. But despite this, we are seeing positive underlying drivers with account acquisitions up 6% and spend up 16% on a year-over-year basis. While we're encouraged by these underlying drivers in both cards businesses, payment rates do remain stubbornly high, impacting our loan growth and revenue growth in both cards businesses. Retail banking revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower deposit spreads as well as lower mortgage revenue. However, underlying drivers remained strong, with deposits up 13%, Citigold households up 9% and assets under management up 8% year-over-year as we continue to execute on our North America retail strategy with a focus on our global wealth unit. Asia revenues declined 7% year-over-year largely driven by rate headwinds and higher payment rates. Performance in the wealth hubs exceeded that of the overall region with deposit growth of 12%, AUM growth of 13% and 16% growth in Citigold and CPC clients. Latin America revenues declined 3% year-over-year, mainly due to lower loan volumes in both retail and cards. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased year-over-year, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down year-over-year, largely due to the wind down of legacy assets. Cost of credit was benign. At this point, we typically give a full year outlook. However, since we have our Investor Day coming up on March 2, we plan on bringing everything together at that point to talk about 2022 in the full context of our strategy and medium-term performance expectations. As part of our strategy refresh, our goal is to be as simple and transparent as possible. And I hope you like the new earnings presentation, and we will continue to evolve it going forward. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohnMcDonald: Good morning. Mark, thanks for the - all the detail there, and Jane, for the strategic update. Mark, I wanted to ask if you could just go over the restatement of the net interest income sensitivity. Just want to make sure we caught that. What's the difference that's driving the new presentation there? And just what are the key drivers for your net interest income outlook this year? You might not have to give a number, but kind of when you think about trading and then core NII card growth, maybe some of the thoughts there. Thanks.\nMarkMason: Sure. Thank you, and good morning, John. So on Slide 9 is where I kind of covered that. You will recall, John, that historically, we have looked in our disclosure at a run-off balance sheet. And that obviously has deposits running off as they term out, that has loans running off as they mature. Others take an approach where they look at a static balance sheet, right? And so we've run the analysis around assuming a static balance sheet and assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in a rising rate environment, obviously, across all currencies. We obviously have a mix of U.S. dollar and foreign currencies as well. And when we run that analysis, now assuming that the balance sheet is static, that is the deposit levels, loan levels, et cetera, that delivers 3x more than what we disclosed in the Q -- in the third quarter. So that's the $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net interest income. So obviously, retaining -- or assuming that the deposit levels stay the same, allow us to generate more net interest income and that's a major driver in the number range or the range that I provided. In terms of\u2026\nJohnMcDonald: Got it.\nMarkMason: Sorry?\nJohnMcDonald: Yes. That\u2019s helpful.\nMarkMason: Great. In terms of the forward look, I'm not going to give you guidance, as you mentioned. But I think there are a couple of things that are important to keep in mind that we're looking at for 2022. One is the drivers that we mentioned earlier. So a lot of the underlying drivers in our franchise look very strong and are driving healthy fee revenue growth. And I would expect with an outlook for positive GDP that, that's going to continue to play to our advantage in 2022. The second thing I'd point out is the assumptions around interest rate hikes in 2022. I have many as three or four depending on the economists' view that you listen to. And that obviously is going to play to our favor as well when you think about the number of accrual businesses that we have, whether it's our TTS franchise, or our private bank, et cetera, et cetera. So those are important factors that impact the top line, and that we expect to help contribute to some growth coming out of 2022. I mentioned the loan growth on the branded cards portfolio. For cards, it's really going to be about payment rates. I mean, how they taper off \u2013 hopefully, taper off. They've been stubbornly high through all of 2021. So hopefully, we start to see some of that taper off and we get a little bit of growth in average interest-earning balances in the back half of the year, but those are important factors that need to play through into 2022.\nJohnMcDonald: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, as you're managing capital, you mentioned you'll return to some level of buybacks this quarter, and you've got a lot of capital that you expect to free up in transactions that haven't happened yet. So I guess, how are you kind of thinking about that, that future capital is something that you'll deploy as you get it? It's part of your long-term thinking, but you're not planning on using that throughout this year, I assume?\nMarkMason: Yes. So obviously, we look at capital planning with a -- in the context of our strategy and our ability to actually deploy that capital, but to return as much excess capital as we can to our shareholders. And so as we think about the divestitures, which are underway as that capital frees up, we're going to factor that into the capital plan for the year and the quarter. And where we can, we're going to return that to shareholders. So a number of deals are scheduled to close in 2022. That will be part of our plan, and we'll be looking forward to taking those actions in the outer part of the year.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMikeMayo: Hi. For you, Jane, and I'm going to re-queue after my two questions, I got so many. But thank you for the new presentation. But the biggest question that I and, I think, many investors have, is when all is said and done, who is Citigroup? What's the most simple statement you can give on who and what Citigroup represents?\nJaneFraser: All right. I love that question. So I would say that our vision for Citi is to be the preeminent bank for institutions with cross-border needs. We'll be a leader in -- global leader in wealth, a major player in consumer payments and lending in the home market. And that is future Citi and our vision for it. It's simplified, more focused. It's much better connected. It's certainly simpler to operate, characterized by culture of excellence and accountability. And I think as I hope we've shown today, one that should be easier for everybody to understand and fully aligned with our shareholders' interest.\nMikeMayo: And along those lines, are you freeing up what, about $11 billion of capital now? And intentions -- Mark, I always hear you say you're going to invest in the business, you're going to do supply for growth and then you're going to buy back stock. But in terms of a stock price that's this low, I mean, the stock price relative to the financial index is one of the all-time lows. Wouldn't you move buybacks up in the priority order? Or what else can you do or say to show that shareholders matter? Jane, I mean, you've done so much on the E side. You certainly have done a lot on the S side. But the G in ESG, when it relates to shareholders, shareholders have been left back for so long. Just seeing what else you might be able to do or say as it relates to recognizing shareholders and their desire to have a stock price that does better?\nJaneFraser: Our shareholders are an enormous priority for us. And Mike, I know we need to make the bank more shareholder-aligned and friendly, and we are doing so. So let me give you four examples. Our strategy will generate and we will return excess capital to shareholders. And as you say, given where the stock is trading, it makes buybacks highly attractive. Second, we're taking the structure and strategic decisions to put the bank in the best position to drive shareholder value. And you can see we're executing and we are delivering with urgency, and we're very driven to get the valuation in a far higher place than it is today. Third, we're changing many elements of the financial reporting that's easier for our shareholders to understand the bank, and we're going to be as transparent as possible, so you can measure our progress and results. And I think the structure that Mark laid out and I gave a high level on, it will make that job much easier.  And then finally, and a topic I know you've been quite vocal around, we are also making changes to compensation. So more of our senior business leaders will be on the PSUs for this coming year. We've moved to 100% deferred stock versus a mix of stock and cash in the geographies that we're permitted to do so. And we're increasing the importance of returns in determining performance evaluations. There is a myriad and rounds of different actions that we're taking because our shareholders matter to us. And we want to get our valuation up to one that we think has -- realizes its full potential\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlennSchorr: I'm going to turn on just for the sake of your answer. I personally love the management teams are buried in the stock that they asked investors to invest in. To be a leader in all those areas that you want to be in [indiscernible] question, you spend a lot to keep up. And so my question is, how do you balance doing all that and both in profitability gap with spending enough and feeding your franchises to the leaders and yet to be extensive front, it seems like so hard of just what the [indiscernible] you thought.\nMarkMason: I have to apologize. You broke up through much of that question. Would you mind just repeating the tail end of it. There's a lot of static on the line here. Say a little bit more. We're getting a lot of static, should we come back?\nGlennSchorr: Sure thing.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsyGraseck: So a couple of questions. One, just thinking through the walk from where you are today in CET1 until end of the year when you mentioned you'd be ending the year at 12%. You have some businesses that are exiting, which should reduce RWAs, I would think. But then you've got the buybacks as well coming through. And at the same time, I would expect that you'd probably want to grow your RWAs? I know your RWAs were down 5% Q2 and maybe that was part of the reason why [SACR] was a little light. So could you help me understand just how we should think about that trajectory and the drivers of that CET1 change, because it will have some impact on how we're thinking about the rev growth in the markets business.\nMarkMason: Yes. Good question. So we are looking at, obviously, how we continue to invest in the franchise, particularly where there are areas of growth. At the same time, ensure that we're delivering buybacks or share -- return to shareholders. As I look at the CET1 ratio, we're ending the year at about 12.2%. As you know, SACR kicks in -- or has kicked in on January 1. We're ending therefore, on January 1 at roughly around where our target is. And over the course of the year, we'll be able to absorb growth in the businesses where there is a need to do that while continuing to identify offsets to both SACR but also low-returning assets that we may have and ridding ourselves of those and generating income as well as the capital from the divestitures that we will be able to close throughout the course of the year. And so as we look at that plan, the start of the year, which is close to our target, towards the end of 2022 we will have to build that back up to about 12% in order to absorb the GCIB headwind, assuming there's no relief provided to that, which then kicks in at the beginning of 2023. And so through the course of the year, we'll utilize through RWA, we'll free up capital and return capital to shareholders. We'll generate more earnings. But at the end of the year, we'll need to kind of end on the higher end or towards that 12%.\nBetsyGraseck: Do you have a sense as to how much the benefit to like GCIB or SCB should be from all the divestitures you're doing? I was actually thinking when I saw the Mexico news this week that maybe that was one of the reasons why you decided to put -- to exit the Mexico consumer business is potentially the pickup that you get since you mentioned it makes you a simpler company and that should feed into CB, I would think. .\nMarkMason: It's not a major driver as to the decision, as Jane has kind of framed out. But it is -- but it does factor into the points that you've raised. So from a GCIB point of view, there's, I don't know, $31 billion or so of deposits that are tied to our Mexico consumer business. That would drive about 10 basis points or so, or 10 points I should say, on the GCIB score. The total for the divestitures that were -- that we've earmarked, it's about $85 billion in deposits. And so you can do the math that we'd get some benefit from that. You're right, and I don't have numbers that I would share at this point, but -- and in part because the Fed has to run their analysis. But you're right, from a CCAR point of view, when you think about the stress capital buffer, there's an impact to PPNR, but more importantly, to stress losses that will play through as well. As you know, that impact as well as the deposit impact won't really come into play until we've closed on these transactions. But it certainly is a factor to how we think about the longer-term capital planning. And it certainly is something that I'm going to talk more about at Investor Day on March 2.\nBetsyGraseck: Okay. And the low-returning assets that you were talking about exiting, is that like that's basically something like rates and the fixed income business? And should we expect some impact there? Or again, I'm just trying to tie together the 5% decline in RWAs in the comment that fixed income business was a little light this quarter. .\nMarkMason: Yes. Yes. There's -- I'm not looking to be specific on where the low-returning assets we're getting out, but we're certainly looking at our markets franchise to see where those low-returning assets exist, as well as to see where their client relationships that are single product and don't necessarily link across the franchise. And so this is something that Jane and I, along with Paco are keenly focused on. We realized that while we've seen growth in markets and in FIC, it has come with growth in the balance sheet, and we want to make sure that we're optimizing the use of the capital.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErikaNajarian: My first question is for Mark, please. And by the way, thank you so much for this new way of disclosing financials, I think this will be very helpful, and the NII sensitivity as well. I know we're going to get a lot more detail in March. But as we think about the expense base that would be remaining post the exits you've identified, could you help us get a sense of how much more growth would there be left in the remediation-related expenses, how aggressive do you plan to be in terms of investment spend in 2022? And do you think you've identified enough inefficient expenses within the franchise to help fund some of those -- both initiatives?\nMarkMason: Yes, great question. I'm not going to give guidance on 2022, but let me try and frame out how we're thinking about it because I think it is important. Both Jane and I recognize that we've got -- a lot of static we're getting, excuse me. So in terms of the expenses, we obviously have a large expense base. We've seen growth play out this year. But I think there's some real opportunities over time to attack the expense base, and that's exactly what we intend to do. So if you think about the divestitures, I'll stop here for a second. There's some $6.8 billion of expenses tied to divestitures. As those divestitures get closed out, some of that will naturally go away. The balance of that, which tends to be referred to as stranded cost, we are already putting in place a team to focus on attacking and driving out that stranded cost. The second point that I'll bring up around this is the transformation. The transformation has driven 3 percentage points of growth this year. I do expect that there's more growth associated with that, particularly since we're still doing more hiring. There's more tech spend that will be required. But the transformation over time will deliver efficiencies, will reduce the manual touch points, will drive straight-through processing and therefore, will allow for us to bring our expenses down. And the final piece that I'll mention is the strategy. And so Jane mentioned in our strategy, a focus on core businesses. And that's going to allow for us to look at the organizational structure and identify more simplification opportunities in the way we manage and run the firm.  We do about $300 million to $400 million of productivity savings a quarter. That's not enough. We think there's more opportunity for efficiencies than that. And it's those opportunities that we're going to chase down in order to fund some of this investment spend that we expect in the next couple of years. More on that at Investor Day.\nErikaNajarian: Thank you for framing that. Jane, this next question is for you. When you responded to Mike's question about your vision of Citi, you led with your vision of Citi as the world's corporate bank, if I could rephrase. How has your vision of Citi -- what does it include in terms of your funding base? There's a lot of conversation, particularly in the beginning of a rising rate environment about the natural gap that you have to your largest U.S. peers with regard to your naturally higher rate deposits, right? And so how do you envision your funding base evolving over time? And do you have any interest in significantly building out your U.S. retail deposit franchise?\nJaneFraser: So Erika, we've got a pretty diverse funding base. When we look at it from the institutional side, we've got the #1 TTS franchise globally. And that has material funding from our -- for our -- from our cash management and dominant position in cash management there. Our wealth franchise, both from the ultra high net worth down to the affluent clients is also a source of material and very attractive deposits and funding for us. Obviously, we are making the exits on the international consumer banking front. And we've been focused in the retail bank in the U.S. in driving digital deposit growth and continuing to make sure that, that business generates a stable, low-cost funding for the firm here in the U.S. And we'll expect to continue growing that going forward.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMikeMayo: It was sooner than I expected. Just a follow-up on the compensation changes. Yes, that's good news that people are paying in stock instead of just cash and stock. But you had the new bonus arrangement. I did not think that was finalized. But as part of the new bonus arrangement based on the next 3-year financial targets, is that still all cash? Or is that cash and stock? Or is that stock?\nJaneFraser: I assume you're referring to the transformation award. Is that correct, Mike?\nMikeMayo: Yes.\nJaneFraser: Yes. So that one, it's -- while it's paid in cash for the first 2 pieces, the last 50% is pegged to our 3-year stock performance. And we felt that, that was the appropriate balance here. As we said, transformation is our highest priority. We need to successfully address the concerns raised, and that's 100% in our shareholders' interest. One of the pieces that's important in that is that we need to have collective accountability to succeed in addressing these concerns. The shift in our culture -- and this award is one that is therefore dependent upon shared success versus individual incentives here. So it's an important part of delivering. And of course, if we fail to deliver, the outcomes of the transformation and they're not successful in the execution, there will be no award.\nMikeMayo: And when will we -- I guess we'll find out about those targets at Investor Day, so answering that question. As it relates to PSUs, how much was given in stock cash before? And how many people will this apply to versus where it was before?\nJaneFraser: The PSUs are given to the executive management team, and now we're extending that to the broader operating team, which includes the leaders of our major businesses. And you'll see that information delivered in the proxy when we issue that in March. So you'll get all of that information at roughly at the same time.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKenUsdin: Mark, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the card business in aggregate, definitely starting to see a little bit of that balance. But I wonder if you could touch on, number one, like just how you're expecting that balance trajectory to go; number two, spend versus lend and how much you're seeing in that? And then three, just the losses are obviously just amazingly low, and how you would anticipate card normalization?\nMarkMason: Yes, sure. So -- as I've mentioned before, I mean when you look at what's going on with cards across the board, we are seeing increases in spend volume. So branded card spend volume is up 24%. Retail services spend volume is up 16%. So very healthy spend volume. People are using our cards, which is a good thing. In terms of the liquidity that's still out there in the market, even though savings rates have started to normalize, there's still a significant amount of liquidity that's out there in the market. And that's showing up in payment rates in both branded cards and retail services and, frankly, in some of the international card businesses as well. And that has not subsided. And so we did start to see growth in branded cards loans. Average loans are up 3%, branded cards. The end-of-period loans were up 5%. What matters a lot when you come out of a crisis like this is how you reinvest. And so we've spent a lot of time focused on targeting new customers and driving new account acquisitions. Our new account acquisitions are up 43% in branded cards. And we've been also driving that just generally across the board in retail services as well. So getting a good -- a very good response in terms of new accounts coming on board. We've also been focused on how we drive installment lending activity, just kind of to broaden the lending that we're doing with this customer base, and we've seen significant growth in our Flex Loan and Flex Pay products as we've targeted customers who have historically been transactors to really move them onto that product. So very good growth there. In fact, in 2021, we've not only gotten the growth just in aggregate. But if I look at kind of installment lending, we've got 90% of the total installment sales are in digital sales, which is another kind of low-cost acquisition approach that we've taken. So good underlying indicators there. But again, it's not until payment rates start to subside we would expect, hope that, that would start to show up towards the back half of 2022. In terms of the losses, which was the other part of your question, very low loss levels. You heard me mention the delinquency rates earlier. When I look at -- well, the loss rates earlier, when I look at delinquency trends, there's really nothing to focus on there. They remain quite low. And we don't see any signs or any areas of concern, I would say. But I would imagine those 2 would start to normalize as payment rates start to come down.\nKenUsdin: Great, Mark. And then just a follow-up. You mentioned the record -- or the strongest quarter in advisory in a while. I was just wondering if you could just comment broadly on investment banking pipelines across the product groups.\nMarkMason: Yes. The investment banking pipeline looks very strong. We ended the year with significant growth in advisory, up 146% year-over-year, well above the wallet. We've grown share there. ECM was up about 16%, again above the wallet. And really that, reflecting some of the fees coming from SPAC activity. So very good growth. EMEA and North America are both up year-over-year due to continued momentum in M&A. So we feel very good about it. We think the pipeline still looks very strong. We think the investments that we've made and bringing on bankers in some of the sectors we needed to beef up, sectors such as health care, technology, sponsors group, those investments are certainly starting to pay off. So we feel good about it.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlennSchorr: So I think we have a good long-term process in motion and measured in more than 1 year. But what do you think of the sort of -- it feels like returns have to go down before they go up. I know you have the overall goal to close the gap to peers. But between the capital that gets freed up, the GCIB buffer and the denominator, the capital markets partially normalizing some stranded expenses on sole franchises and then continuing to execute on these transformations, is it okay and is it normal? I think it's partially in our models that we go down first and then rise up?\nMarkMason: Yes. So thank you, Glenn. So look, if you look at 2021 with a 13.4% RoTCE and reserve releases that get close to $9 billion, I'd have to say yes, right? Because those reserve releases drive a considerable amount of that. Now it's important to compare that to 2020, where we had the opposite effect because we were building meaningful reserves. But as I -- as we look at the forward look, which we'll take you through in more detail, as Jane mentioned we're focused on core parts of the franchise that show the opportunity for growth and the promise for higher returns. And we'll -- that's where our energies are going to be focused, and we think that's what's going to help to drive improved returns over time.\nGlennSchorr: Fair enough, the reserve at least have a big impact. Okay, and then in terms of that growth, I think a couple of questions danced around this, so it will be short. But given your answer to what Citi is and wants to be in terms of premier franchise and all those industries or business lines, I should say, how do you balance the -- doing what's right for stockholders in the near term, drive stock return versus making sure you invest for the future? Because each one of those is super competitive. Each one of them has competitors as early as today or as recent as today, spending a ton of money to compete in those spaces. How do you balance that -- invest for the long term, be great versus improve the stock short term?\nMarkMason: Yes. So let me start and then Jane feel free to add in if you'd like. So the first thing that I think's important to remember is the focus that we're trying to put on these core franchises that drive returns over time. So we're prioritizing how we're going to allocate our resources and our investments in part through the divestiture activity. The second thing I'd say is that we are investing in the franchise for the long term, right, as opposed to trying to hit some short-term metric. And so that does involve us putting that money to work where there is client demand and where it leverages the competitive advantages that we have developed. And so that is the way we approach this with, again, an eye towards ensuring that we're clear and transparent with our investors. And that if there's excess, that we're returning that to our shareholders, so that is not just sitting on the sidelines and not generating returns that they would expect of us.\nJaneFraser: I'd also just jump in when you look at the different businesses that we are investing in, as Mark said, they're high returning ones. So our services businesses are much capital lighter, high return. Wealth management, the same. I think the opportunities that we've been seeing to continually increase share in investment banking, another high returning business. So that will certainly be helping us over time on that mix that you're talking about. And not everything needs an enormous investment. If I look at wealth, for example, you put the different pieces together that we've already got, and we're putting them into a single integrated business and proposition, it's not things that we're starting from scratch. So a lot of this is incremental.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nVivekJuneja: Jane, Mark, a quick one firstly. Now that you're exiting Mexico, Singapore and Hong Kong were not part of the exits when you announced the exit from the 13 markets in the consumer business. Are you going to stay on with the consumer business in those markets, or meaning a traditional consumer business as you've had for years? Or is that going to change?\nJaneFraser: No, we find the franchises we have in Singapore and Hong Kong, just given the nature of them, are really naturally tight to the wealth franchise that we are building and investing in there of our existing very strong platform, as you say. So we expect to continue to provide the range of different services and capabilities that we have because they are so complementary and help support our wealth business in 2 of the most major wealth hubs in the world.\nVivekJuneja: Okay, great. And a follow-up question, if I may have. The NII change, Mark, that you made, what deposit beta are you assuming there? And how much of the change is coming from U.S. net interest income versus the rest of the currencies?\nMarkMason: Yes. So we haven't shared our deposit betas. But as you would imagine, the betas tend to be higher on the institutional side than on the retail side. And so that piece -- and I'm sorry, the second part of your question was what? Vivek?\nVivekJuneja: The second part was how much of the change in net interest income from the interest rate sensitivity change, Mark, that you're making? How much is it U.S. net interest income versus the rest of the currencies?\nMarkMason: The increase is roughly -- roughly skewed towards the international. So I'd say of a $3 billion increase, I'd say, about 2/3, 1/3 international.\nVivekJuneja: Okay. And that's because that's where you were assuming that runoff?\nMarkMason: Sorry?\nVivekJuneja: That's where you were assuming more of the balance sheet runoff.\nMarkMason: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.\nCharlesPeabody: Yes. A question regarding the regulatory and political risk to share buybacks. And I asked that because earlier this week in the Powell renomination hearings, you listened to the last 2 minutes of that testimony. Sherrod Brown went on a rail against buybacks in the banking industry. And then last year, I think President Biden had 2 speeches in which he spoke out against buybacks. So I'm trying to understand, is there -- I mean a transaction tax isn't going to stop you guys from doing buybacks. But are there other things being discussed out there other than just moral suasion to discourage buybacks?\nJaneFraser: We're going to do the right thing for our shareholders. And right now, particularly given where the stock is trading, buybacks are a very, very important and probably top of the stack for us action that we take. So no, we're very clear in terms of the importance of giving our shareholders back our excess capital.\nCharlesPeabody: No, I understand that you want to. I'm just trying to understand what the risk to your desires are from the regulatory or political side?\nJaneFraser: I don't believe there is one. We're extremely well capitalized. I think we've heard it consistently from Washington, the confidence in the capitalization of the banks both coming into and coming out of the pandemic, and we're not overly concerned on that front.\nMarkMason: We'll obviously adhere to regulatory guidelines as they exist or however they evolve, but that's exactly right.\nCharlesPeabody: All right. And then as a follow-up, just on that subject. Assuming these regulators are just getting into their seat, they're probably not going to be able to do anything this year on buybacks, but I'm assuming that they'll try and do something on buying backs next year. So you want to do as much buyback short term as you can, and you've talked about getting back to like a $3 billion pace here in the first quarter. How sustainable is that $3 billion pace?\nMarkMason: Yes. So look, I mean, it's -- first of all, with the SCB framework, we take decisions on the capital actions on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Obviously, there's another CCAR run that will all go through, that will determine at least part of the capital stack. And then obviously, there's the GCIB that's coming into play. So we factor all of those things in. In our case, as we develop the capital plan, we also will take a look at the divestitures. In some instances, the divestitures will generate TCE for us to return to shareholders. There may be other impacts from divestitures that are temporary in nature that need to be factored in. But it's part of an entire annual capital planning process that we go through that factors all of those things in.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerardCassidy: Can you guys share with us, when you think about the strategy refresh that is underway, are we 75% complete, 80% complete? Mark, you alluded to maybe some of the markets businesses that may not have the return as you want. It could be some area. But where are you there? And by the Investor Day, can we assume that will be completed?\nJaneFraser: In terms of the time line for this one, this particular exercise is drawing to a close in terms of what I call the big step back as a new CEO. So we said this is the last major structural decision that we're taking in Mexico, and we're now focused on pulling together everything from Investor Day. And that's where the new reporting structure, I think, that we've announced today, is also a very important foundation for that. So I'm confident that we've made the right big structural decisions and that we're looking forward to Investor Day, laying out the vision, the strategies and the plan for going forward.\nMarkMason: And let me be clear, Gerard, just in case I wasn't. I'm not suggesting we're exiting parts of our Markets business. That is not what I'm suggesting at all. What I'm suggesting is that as we would always do, we're constantly looking for opportunities to optimize the way we use our balance sheet, capital, RWA, et cetera, and where we identify the need to rid ourselves of low-returning and assets that we have, we do that, right? And so with rule changes like SACR and the like, either pricing will adjust or we'll have to take a hard look at some of those assets to see if it still makes sense. And that's more of what I meant than ever suggesting we were exiting part of the Markets business.\nGerardCassidy: No, they're very clear. And just as a quick follow-up. Obviously, some of the businesses you're committed to in the TSS and the investment banking area you guys clearly are players there, you have economies of scale. When you look at the other businesses that you're committed to stay in, where is the heavy lifting going to come from where you really kind of step it up to get those economies of scale similar to the ones that are quite obvious?\nJaneFraser: Yes, you're right. We have a number of businesses that are already extremely scaled in both markets. If we look at TTS, we are moving $4 trillion of volume daily there. So those are ones where the investments are much more around digitization, around data.  And in terms of where are we looking at getting more to -- of increasing our scale, commercial bank is obviously one where we have commercial banking presence in 30 different markets around the world. And they're very focused on the same target market I talked about in the vision, which are those mid-market companies with global needs or multi-market needs. And then the other areas in terms of wealth, where we've already begun, as you can see from our earlier remarks, building out our frontline scale on the back of the platforms and other investments that we're making.\nMarkMason: And to your point, Jane, Commercial Bank this year, a huge opportunity to leverage more of the TTS offering that we have. We're already seeing diversification in the commercial bank in terms of CMO and other markets products, and the revenue this year was up 12% year-over-year, and similar strength in acquisition of new clients in wealth, but those are 2 key areas. I agree.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahimPoonawala: Just quick couple of follow-ups. Mark, on the capital return, I just want to make sure we hear you correctly. When we think about the $3 billion piece you're going to get back to in 1Q, moving forward, is there more upside risk to that $3 billion? Or could that be actually lower? I just want to make sure we have that right in terms of expectations.\nMarkMason: Yes. I'm not giving expectations for the quarter-by-quarter capital buyback decisions, n part because, as I mentioned, with the new SCB rule, we're able to look at it on a quarterly basis. So I'm not giving guidance beyond that. We'll talk more about the capital plan on March 2 broadly, right?\nEbrahimPoonawala: And just, I guess, going back, Jane, on U.S., I think the question is, is there something more meaningful that we should expect at the Investor Day? And it's fine if you want to hold it till then. Because if I recall correctly, you were a partner with Google. That didn't play out. The big question that investors have is, is there a better definition to the U.S. retail franchise? And I'm just wondering, will we get that at the March Investor Day or there's nothing radical that you have in store, at least in the near term as far as U.S. retail is concerned?\nJaneFraser: You'll be certainly hearing directly from Anand, who is responsible for that business on Investor Day. And he'll lay out all of our U.S. personal banking strategy of what we're looking at, both from our top 2 cards franchise and what we're doing in personal lending, as well as what we're doing in wealth. And then obviously, the retail bank and the supporting role it is playing for those 2 core drivers of growth for us in the States. So yes.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.\nJimMitchell: Mark, maybe on just the expenses, I appreciate all the moving parts with the divestitures and you're not going to give us a full year expense guidance number. But can you help on the jumping off point in the first quarter we had? Compensation was up about $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. How much of that was just sort of the comp changes? Or is that a good run rate to think about? So if you could just help us, just the jumping off point for first quarter, it would be helpful.\nMarkMason: Yes. You know what? I'm not going to be able to give you kind of more guidance on that. I mean what I would say is, again, you've got a couple of things that played through 2021 that will be important factors in 2022. One, the hiring that we've done, we're going to get a full year impact of that, at least for part of that in 2022. So that's going to play out. Some of the -- if you think about the mix for the transformation spend, which is a mix of both hires, third-party spend as well as technology, that mix will start to shift over time away from third party for sure and towards the others. And so we're going to have some of that dynamic start to play out in 2022. In terms of the comps, specifically in the fourth quarter, we obviously tie -- the comp performance for the full year is tied to revenues. And so as we would expect to see some forward growth based on the drivers I mentioned earlier, we would expect to see comp related to that play out over the course of 2022. But I'd rather not get into the specifics here, given that we're going to give you a better sense for it in early March.\nJimMitchell: Okay. Just maybe as a follow-up on that, just so I understand the sequential drivers, so you're saying it's mostly incentive comp? Or was that more new hires or both, just on 3Q to 4Q change?\nMarkMason: Yes. In 3Q to 4Q, you've got both hires as well as incentive comp.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMattO'Connor: I just wanted to follow up. You had said the sale of Mexico wouldn't be an easy transaction. And was just hoping you could elaborate on that. And then just related, you talked about the capital is allocated to the business being freed up. But any kind of initial thoughts on whether the transaction -- the exit of the business will generate a gain or loss as we think about the combined or total capital impact?\nJaneFraser: Why don't I kick that off and Mark jump in. I just said it won't be a simple transaction because we separate the bank into the institutional business from the businesses that we're exiting, and that's something that we kicked off yesterday, that process. And then we'll be looking to go to the market in the spring and be active with buyers, potential buyers in a few months' time. So it's more just the complexity of separating the bank. We've got good plans behind this. And as I said in my remarks, these are terrific, these are at scale. These are great franchises. And there was obviously a lot of speculation in the press, which really is too early to comment on. But we do think this is a jewel for someone. It's just not for us.\nMarkMason: Yes, I agree. And I think it's premature to speculate on the structure of the deal and things of that sort. You're right, we do have about $4 billion of TCE allocated to the business. The other layer of complexity is around the CTA, and you've heard us spend some time on that when we talked about the Australia sale. And I introduced it as a complexity because there's an accounting treatment associated with the CTA that happens at signing, that is separate from the capital implication that happens at closing. So with a CTA, the capital impact flows through AOCI, but it's neutral once the deal is closed. And Mexico, the consumer business would have a DTA of a little bit less than $3 billion or so. And so that's another factor that's involved with the transaction.\nJaneFraser: CTA, not a DTA.\nMarkMason: Did I say DTA? I'm sorry, CTA, currency translation adjustment. Thank you. CTA. Thank you very much, Jane.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nStevenChubak: Well, actually, even before asking my question, I just wanted to echo some of the earlier remarks, the new presentation, the additional detail, it's really helpful. So I appreciate the new disclosure. Mark, I was going to ask -- well, I guess technically one question, but it's really a 3-parter. You might need to grab a pen and paper. But I wanted to just unpack some of the comments you made on the NII sensitivity and reporting differences versus peers. You noted a more than 3x increase in NII, assuming a static balance sheet, but there's still a lot of investors that just question your rate sensitivity profile given the fairly modest NII growth that we saw in the last cycle. And the first question, I just wanted to start by asking, given your heavier institutional deposit gearing, wouldn't it be reasonable for us to expect that your deposit runoff would actually be greater than peers? Two, does the NII guidance contemplate liability sensitivity in the markets business? And could you help us size that potential drag? And then just lastly, it's more of a catch all. Any idiosyncratic factors that you could speak to that would support a better NII outcome or higher rate benefit versus what we saw in the last cycle?\nMarkMason: Yes, sure. So look, we provided the sensitivity because we think comparability is important here. And you can see the magnitude of that difference is pretty sizable. There's still going to be a difference between us and peers, but that difference narrows when you put it on a comparable basis. We do have a skew towards institutional clients, and they do carry a higher beta associated with them. But we also have a skew towards international currencies and we make good spreads there as well.  In terms of the impact through markets, the impact -- I think the market's impact can come in any number of ways. I think rate moves and other uncertainty and volatility in the market can drive broader markets revenues, which we would potentially see depending on how investors have to reposition their books. In terms of the last part of your question, I don't think there's anything else that I would point to. I mean, obviously, with the excess liquidity that we've seen and been carrying in the market, we've been putting that to work in investments. We've increased our investment portfolio by some $70 billion. We expanded the duration to about 2.85, and we still have significant dry powder to -- with the -- work with either client demand or in an increasing rate environment, which we expect.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler.\nJeffHarte: I'm sorry, I thought I've taken myself out of the queue. My questions have been answered and you all must be getting tired. So I'm done.\nOperator: Your final question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMikeMayo: I have one more question. What's the hardest part of the cultural change?\nJaneFraser: Probably it's been breaking down some of the silos. And that -- the point on the principles we laid out, Mike, have connected is really a key piece of it. We've -- we rolled out some new leadership principles last year, and it's very much around how do we get the firm very well connected and really realize the full synergies. So breaking some of those old habits, I would say, the new structure is certainly helping as are the different initiatives we're taking.\nMikeMayo: And how long do you think that will take? Because you're breaking down a culture that's been ingrained for quite some time.\nJaneFraser: Yes. I would say I'm really happy with the progress. We've been -- one of the first things I did was lay the front 2 on our culture out when I took over, and we've got a terrific team of people been working at this for a year. So I'm very happy with the progress we make. I think everyone is clear. We want the culture to be one of accountability, of excellence and acting with urgency and part of that is well underway. But it will take a little bit longer.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\nJen Landis: Thank you all for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to IR with any follow-up questions. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes Citi's fourth quarter earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thanks, Jen, and happy New Year, everyone. I am delighted to join you again today. Well, we've been busy, and we have a lot to talk about today. I'm going to start with an update on our strategy refresh. Then I'll share my thoughts on our fourth quarter and end on all the progress that we've made against our major priorities. As you saw earlier this week, we announced that we intend to focus our franchise in Mexico solely on our institutional and wealth management businesses, and therefore, to exit the consumer small business and middle-market banking operations there. This was not a decision we took lightly. We took a clinical look at our franchise in Mexico, and we drew the hard conclusion that the noninstitutional businesses do not fit our new strategic direction. Now to be clear, these are terrific, they're scaled, high returning franchises. But our strategic goal is to invest in businesses that are fully aligned with our core strengths and to simplify our firm. As we did the work, it was also clear that there continues to be a tremendous opportunity for our Institutional Clients Group in Mexico. Citi is Mexico's leading institutional bank. We've served corporate clients and investors there for almost a century, and that isn't going to change. Mexico has a bright future, and we are committed to playing an important role in building it. We expect Mexico will be a major recipient of global investment and trade flows in the years ahead. Therefore, we plan to maintain a significant, locally licensed bank there and invest to capture growth in a core and high-returning hub of our institutional network. This won't be a simple transaction. We have spent the last several months working through how to get the best results for our shareholders and be true to our local stakeholders. We will begin the separation process immediately and expect to begin the sales process in the spring. And of course, there will be an opportunity to return excess capital from the transaction to our shareholders. This is our final decision in terms of market exits as we conclude our strategy refresh and approach Investor Day. I'm really looking forward to talking to you about the future Citi on March 2. Today, we are going to talk you through the changes we're making to align our organization and financial reporting with our refreshed strategy. Now these changes will also allow us to reduce structural complexity and its associated costs. Amongst other things, this is going to help make Citi easier for our investors to understand. You'll be able to see and assess more simply the core businesses that make up Citi going forward. First, we're creating a new personal banking and wealth management segment, which will be run by Anand Selva. This will consist of two distinct reporting units: Our U.S. personal banking businesses; and our global wealth management business, which is going to include the private bank. Second, on the institutional side of the house, which will continue to be run by Paco Ybarra, we will begin reporting under three units: services, banking and markets. Services will include Treasury and Trade Solutions and security services, and this reflects just how important we believe these businesses are to Citi's future. Finally, we will create a new segment, legacy franchises, which will house all the businesses we intend to exit. We're going to begin reporting our financials along these segments and reporting units no later than the second quarter, to ensure you have the information you need to measure our progress and hold us accountable, and we really look forward to sharing our strategy and plans for how these businesses will work together and deliver for our shareholders on Investor Day in March. Now turning to earnings. We had a decent end to 2021. As you can see on Slide 2, we closed out the quarter with net income of $3.2 billion and EPS of $1.46. That includes a $1.2 billion hit to EBIT, primarily related to the wind down of our Korean consumer business. Excluding those impacts, our net income would be $4.2 billion, with an EPS of $1.99. Our net income for the full year of $22 billion reflects an improved credit environment and we had a resulting RoTCE of 13.4%. In ICG, we had another strong quarter in investment banking and gained share for the year in M&A. And we continue to make significant investments in talent, and we see a very solid pipeline of transactions ahead of us. Now while we could have had a better balanced performance in fixed income in the quarter, equities finished 2021 up 25% for the year. The rebound TTS is seeing in trade flows and cash volumes was not quite enough to offset the current rate environment, but it bodes well for 2022. Indeed, we think the cycle has turned for this business and it is poised to benefit as monetary policy changes and growth accelerates. You've heard Mark and I talk about improving the revenue mix of our institutional businesses as a priority, and it's yielding results with another quarter of strong momentum in fee growth across products. Parts of our consumer businesses are still weathering COVID's disruptive impact on customer behavior. In the U.S., strong purchase sales continued to be offset by elevated payment rates, but we did see loans increase in branded cards this quarter. Deposits and AUM continued to grow, with digital deposits up nearly 20% for the full year. For the year, we returned nearly $12 billion in capital to our shareholders and we grew our tangible book value per share by 7% to $79.16. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 12.2% on a standardized basis as we built the capital needed to resolve the impact of [stack up]. Now keep in mind, that regulatory change didn't take effect until January 1. While this caused us to temporarily pause our stock buyback, we will resume buybacks this quarter now that, that impact has been addressed. Finally, as Slide 3 shows, we are executing and delivering against our priorities: The strategy refresh, the transformation and our culture, and we are doing so with a real sense of urgency. First, on the strategy. We are laser focused on swiftly and successfully implementing the strategic decisions we made over the past year to improve returns to our investors.  We have signed deals in 6 of the Asia consumer markets including the agreement to sell 4 markets that we announced yesterday. This means that within 8 months of making the decision to exit these 13 businesses, we have a clear path in a majority of them, and we are well into the process in the remaining markets. In Korea, we were decisive in determining the best path for our shareholders was to wind down our consumer operation, and we're able to get most of that charge behind us this quarter. Another area where we haven't wasted any time is wealth management, where we grew our ranks by a net 800 advisers relationship managers and others over the course of the year. They helped us add about 750 private bank clients and 45,000 Citi gold clients in 2021.  In what we know as U.S. Personal Banking, we've seen good uptake of new products such as the custom cash card, and we've been building out digital platforms to capture opportunities in installment lending. And in addition to the progress we're seeing in TTS, we've also been building out our security services platform. We couldn't be more pleased to deepen our relationship with BlackRock by becoming the largest custodian for their iShares ETFs. Second priority, we continue to execute on our transformation agenda in order to demonstrably strengthen our risk and controls as well as modernize our bank for a digital world. This work, it's foundational for everything we want to achieve. We are enhancing our operating model to improve long-term efficiency and our service to clients. As it relates to the consent orders, we are deep into execution mode. We continue to be in constructive dialogue with our regulators as we get their feedback and incorporate it into our ongoing execution and project plans. Third, and relatedly, we are building a culture that expects excellence and demands accountability. We're driving this effort in a variety of ways, including a more robust performance management process at this past year-end, shifting the mix of compensation to better align with shareholders' interest and various culture-changing initiatives.  A culture of excellence also means creating a record of achievement that our people can be proud of. One area that our people take particular pride in is our ESG efforts. Later this month, we will share with you our plan to reach net zero by 2050, a commitment I made on my first day as CEO 10 months ago. And of course, we are going to do all this with a singular focus on our clients as we help them navigate COVID. We certainly hope Omicron is the final disruptive phase of this pandemic, but there are also quite a few other issues to navigate, whether macroeconomic, such as inflation, or geopolitical such as tensions with Russia. We have seen the resilience and the importance of Citi as we supported our clients through unchartered waters, and we will be with them in the next chapter as well. So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we would be delighted to take your questions. All right. I love that question. So I would say that our vision for Citi is to be the preeminent bank for institutions with cross-border needs. We'll be a leader in -- global leader in wealth, a major player in consumer payments and lending in the home market. And that is future Citi and our vision for it. It's simplified, more focused. It's much better connected. It's certainly simpler to operate, characterized by culture of excellence and accountability. And I think as I hope we've shown today, one that should be easier for everybody to understand and fully aligned with our shareholders' interest. Our shareholders are an enormous priority for us. And Mike, I know we need to make the bank more shareholder-aligned and friendly, and we are doing so. So let me give you four examples. Our strategy will generate and we will return excess capital to shareholders. And as you say, given where the stock is trading, it makes buybacks highly attractive. Second, we're taking the structure and strategic decisions to put the bank in the best position to drive shareholder value. And you can see we're executing and we are delivering with urgency, and we're very driven to get the valuation in a far higher place than it is today. Third, we're changing many elements of the financial reporting that's easier for our shareholders to understand the bank, and we're going to be as transparent as possible, so you can measure our progress and results. And I think the structure that Mark laid out and I gave a high level on, it will make that job much easier.  And then finally, and a topic I know you've been quite vocal around, we are also making changes to compensation. So more of our senior business leaders will be on the PSUs for this coming year. We've moved to 100% deferred stock versus a mix of stock and cash in the geographies that we're permitted to do so. And we're increasing the importance of returns in determining performance evaluations. There is a myriad and rounds of different actions that we're taking because our shareholders matter to us. And we want to get our valuation up to one that we think has -- realizes its full potential So Erika, we've got a pretty diverse funding base. When we look at it from the institutional side, we've got the #1 TTS franchise globally. And that has material funding from our -- for our -- from our cash management and dominant position in cash management there. Our wealth franchise, both from the ultra high net worth down to the affluent clients is also a source of material and very attractive deposits and funding for us. Obviously, we are making the exits on the international consumer banking front. And we've been focused in the retail bank in the U.S. in driving digital deposit growth and continuing to make sure that, that business generates a stable, low-cost funding for the firm here in the U.S. And we'll expect to continue growing that going forward. I assume you're referring to the transformation award. Is that correct, Mike? Yes. So that one, it's -- while it's paid in cash for the first 2 pieces, the last 50% is pegged to our 3-year stock performance. And we felt that, that was the appropriate balance here. As we said, transformation is our highest priority. We need to successfully address the concerns raised, and that's 100% in our shareholders' interest. One of the pieces that's important in that is that we need to have collective accountability to succeed in addressing these concerns. The shift in our culture -- and this award is one that is therefore dependent upon shared success versus individual incentives here. So it's an important part of delivering. And of course, if we fail to deliver, the outcomes of the transformation and they're not successful in the execution, there will be no award. The PSUs are given to the executive management team, and now we're extending that to the broader operating team, which includes the leaders of our major businesses. And you'll see that information delivered in the proxy when we issue that in March. So you'll get all of that information at roughly at the same time. I'd also just jump in when you look at the different businesses that we are investing in, as Mark said, they're high returning ones. So our services businesses are much capital lighter, high return. Wealth management, the same. I think the opportunities that we've been seeing to continually increase share in investment banking, another high returning business. So that will certainly be helping us over time on that mix that you're talking about. And not everything needs an enormous investment. If I look at wealth, for example, you put the different pieces together that we've already got, and we're putting them into a single integrated business and proposition, it's not things that we're starting from scratch. So a lot of this is incremental. No, we find the franchises we have in Singapore and Hong Kong, just given the nature of them, are really naturally tight to the wealth franchise that we are building and investing in there of our existing very strong platform, as you say. So we expect to continue to provide the range of different services and capabilities that we have because they are so complementary and help support our wealth business in 2 of the most major wealth hubs in the world. We're going to do the right thing for our shareholders. And right now, particularly given where the stock is trading, buybacks are a very, very important and probably top of the stack for us action that we take. So no, we're very clear in terms of the importance of giving our shareholders back our excess capital. I don't believe there is one. We're extremely well capitalized. I think we've heard it consistently from Washington, the confidence in the capitalization of the banks both coming into and coming out of the pandemic, and we're not overly concerned on that front. In terms of the time line for this one, this particular exercise is drawing to a close in terms of what I call the big step back as a new CEO. So we said this is the last major structural decision that we're taking in Mexico, and we're now focused on pulling together everything from Investor Day. And that's where the new reporting structure, I think, that we've announced today, is also a very important foundation for that. So I'm confident that we've made the right big structural decisions and that we're looking forward to Investor Day, laying out the vision, the strategies and the plan for going forward. Yes, you're right. We have a number of businesses that are already extremely scaled in both markets. If we look at TTS, we are moving $4 trillion of volume daily there. So those are ones where the investments are much more around digitization, around data.  And in terms of where are we looking at getting more to -- of increasing our scale, commercial bank is obviously one where we have commercial banking presence in 30 different markets around the world. And they're very focused on the same target market I talked about in the vision, which are those mid-market companies with global needs or multi-market needs. And then the other areas in terms of wealth, where we've already begun, as you can see from our earlier remarks, building out our frontline scale on the back of the platforms and other investments that we're making. You'll be certainly hearing directly from Anand, who is responsible for that business on Investor Day. And he'll lay out all of our U.S. personal banking strategy of what we're looking at, both from our top 2 cards franchise and what we're doing in personal lending, as well as what we're doing in wealth. And then obviously, the retail bank and the supporting role it is playing for those 2 core drivers of growth for us in the States. So yes. Why don't I kick that off and Mark jump in. I just said it won't be a simple transaction because we separate the bank into the institutional business from the businesses that we're exiting, and that's something that we kicked off yesterday, that process. And then we'll be looking to go to the market in the spring and be active with buyers, potential buyers in a few months' time. So it's more just the complexity of separating the bank. We've got good plans behind this. And as I said in my remarks, these are terrific, these are at scale. These are great franchises. And there was obviously a lot of speculation in the press, which really is too early to comment on. But we do think this is a jewel for someone. It's just not for us. CTA, not a DTA. Probably it's been breaking down some of the silos. And that -- the point on the principles we laid out, Mike, have connected is really a key piece of it. We've -- we rolled out some new leadership principles last year, and it's very much around how do we get the firm very well connected and really realize the full synergies. So breaking some of those old habits, I would say, the new structure is certainly helping as are the different initiatives we're taking. Yes. I would say I'm really happy with the progress. We've been -- one of the first things I did was lay the front 2 on our culture out when I took over, and we've got a terrific team of people been working at this for a year. So I'm very happy with the progress we make. I think everyone is clear. We want the culture to be one of accountability, of excellence and acting with urgency and part of that is well underway. But it will take a little bit longer."

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start by walking you through the financial reporting changes we plan on making in more detail. Then I'm going to walk you through the 2021 financial impact from the 13 Asia market exits as well as Mexico, and changes we are making to our financial disclosure. And then finally, the quarterly results. As part of our strategy refresh, we've started to make changes to better align with our vision and strategy. We refreshed our earnings presentation and included additional metrics and key drivers for the ICG businesses. Our goal is to simplify our financial reporting to make it much easier for our investors to understand our performance and our key assets. Turning to Slide 4, we lay out the details of the changes in the financial reporting that Jane mentioned. First, we intend to move the consumer, small business and middle market banking operations of Citi Banamex, and the 13 Asia consumer exits under a new segment called Legacy Franchises. This will allow you to better understand the financials of the remaining company that will exist post these exits. We've experienced managing businesses being divested and are putting a dedicated team in place to manage the new segment. This will free up the management teams of the go-forward businesses to fully focus on executing on the firm's strategy. Second, we are reorganizing our reporting units to help you better understand the financials of our businesses and the value they bring to Citi. Starting with ICG, we will move TTS and security services to a reporting unit called Services. These businesses are foundational for us as they have a unique position given their global footprint and full suite product offering. Markets will, therefore, no longer include security services and instead will only include equity and fixed income markets. And lastly on ICG, banking will only include advisory, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and corporate lending. The Global Consumer Bank, GCB, will be renamed Personal Banking and Wealth Management, PBWM. The Private Bank will move from ICG to PBWM.  As a reminder, we announced in January of last year that we created a single wealth management organization under Citi Global Wealth, now called Global Wealth Management, which is a distinct reporting unit. The creation of this unit unifies the wealth management teams creating a single, integrated platform serving clients across the wealth continuum from the affluent segment to the ultra-high net worth clients. North America Consumer will be renamed to U.S. Personal Banking and will remain a reporting unit under PBWM. This unit will continue to include branded cards, retail services and retail banking. We plan on providing the financials for the new reporting units on this page under the ICG and PBWM segments, starting no later than the second quarter earnings. And our Investor Day will be a natural opportunity to bring together all the work over the past year and lay out our medium-term vision and strategy for the firm. Slide 5 shows the contribution of the Citi Banamex businesses that we plan to exit as well as the contribution from the 13 Asia markets. Hopefully, this gives you a better sense of the financial results for the combined exits. And in the appendix on Page 18, we have more detail on the 13 Asia exit markets and the deals that we've announced to date. Turning to Mexico. As Jane mentioned, we remain committed to Mexico and will continue to serve our institutional and private bank clients there. That said, upon very careful consideration and analysis, we decided that we are no longer the optimal owner for the businesses that we're exiting. Mexico consumer and small business banking operations included in the intended exit represents the entirety of the Latin America Global Consumer Banking unit and the Mexico middle market banking business that is currently included in Citi's Institutional Clients Group segment. On the left side of the page, we show key figures for 2020 and 2021 for the businesses we intend to exit in Mexico. In 2021, the businesses contributed $4.7 billion of revenue and $1.1 billion of net income. The businesses in total had $20 billion of loans, $31 billion of deposits and approximately $4 billion of allocated TCE. Again, we do not yet have a transaction and are pursuing multiple divestiture path, so the ultimate financial impact of a transaction is not yet known. We will keep you updated on our progress as we run a thoughtful process that takes into consideration what is in the best interest of our shareholders as well as our clients and employees in Mexico. In addition to the opportunity to return additional capital to shareholders, these divestitures will also allow us to simplify the management and organizational structure across the firm. Now turning to Slide 6. As we've gone through our strategy refresh and simplification, we've been reviewing our disclosure in terminology and have decided that now is the right time to more closely align with our peers. First, revenue that we previously referred to as net interest revenue will now be called net interest income, and revenue that we previously referred to as non-NIR will now be called noninterest revenue. Second, as you can see on the page, we've revised how we account for insurance paid on our deposits, including FDIC and foreign deposit insurance. We have previously accounted for the deposit insurance as a control revenue and net interest income. However, beginning this quarter, we will report it as an expense and remove it from net interest income. And as a reminder, this change is earnings neutral. We've made this change to make it easier for you to compare us to our peers, and we have revised prior years to reflect the same reporting treatment to assist with comparability for 2019 to 2021, and the rest of the presentation will also reflect these 2 changes. On Slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $3.2 billion and an EPS of $1.46, an RoTCE of 7.4% on $17 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are costs of approximately $1.2 billion primarily related to the voluntary retirement program we offered in conjunction with the wind down of our Korea consumer business, as well as some additional Asia exit impacts which I will collectively refer to as the Asia divestiture impacts going forward. Excluding these impacts, EPS would have been $1.99, with an RoTCE of approximately 10%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 1% from last year as strength in noninterest revenue driven by ICG, specifically TTS, Security Services and Investment Banking, was mostly offset by lower net interest income across GCB and ICG. Our results include expenses of $13.5 billion, an increase of 18% versus the prior year. Excluding the Asia divestiture cost, expenses would have increased by 8%.  Increased expenses were largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a net benefit in the quarter, primarily driven by an ACL release of approximately $1.4 billion related to the improved macro backdrop and continued improvement in portfolio quality. Now turning to the full year. Our revenues were down 5%, driven by the normalization in markets as well as elevated payment rates in consumer, somewhat offset by strong noninterest revenue growth across ICG and in particular, in investment banking, TTS and security services. Our full year expenses were up 9%, but excluding Asia divestiture costs, our expenses were up 6%. Also for the full year, we generated RoTCE of 13% and 14% excluding Asia-related divestiture impacts. As a reminder, we had a benefit of close to $9 billion in ACL releases for the full year. On Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2021, excluding Asia divestiture impacts, expenses were up 6%, in line with previous guidance. Looking forward, we recognize that we have a lot more work to do. The divestitures provide an opportunity to simplify our management and organizational structure. We're also taking a hard look at our structural expenses, with an eye towards operating as efficiently and soundly as possible and self-funding investments. We have a lot more to say about this at our Investor Day. On Slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $130 million on a sequential basis, driven by North America Consumer. Sequentially, net interest margin remained relatively stable. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was flat. Also on a year-over-year basis, average deposits grew in the quarter as we continue to deepen relationships with our institutional clients as well as our consumer clients, particularly in North America. Average loans were roughly flat year-over-year as growth in the ICG was offset by a decline in GCB. As the probability of higher rates has increased over the last few quarters, let me make a few comments regarding the potential impact from higher rates. In our 10-Q, we disclosed interest rate sensitivity assuming a parallel shift and a runoff balance sheet. This is different from our peers' methodology, which tends to assume a static balance sheet. Assuming a static balance sheet and a 100 basis point parallel shift, we would expect Citi's total net interest income across all currencies to increase by over 3x more than what was disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q, or roughly $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net interest income. On Slide 10, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.3 trillion balance sheet, about 25% or $530 billion consists of HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. And we continue to optimize our balance sheet, deploying excess liquidity into securities as we took advantage of opportunities in the market, as well as reducing our short-term and long-term debt sequentially and year-over-year. On the loan side, corporate loans represent approximately 60% of total loans with loans to corporates outside of the U.S., representing approximately 30% of total loans. And as we've mentioned in the past, about 80% of our total corporate loans are investment grade. From a capital perspective, we ended the year with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 12.2%, as we prepared to adopt SACR on January 1. Having adopted SACR and maintained our capital ratio target, we are resuming buybacks this quarter to similar levels to what you saw in the second and third quarter of 2021. As we look into the remainder of the year, there are a number of variables with respect to capital. These include regulatory headwinds that are impacting us, along with the rest of the industry, such as elevated GSIB surcharges, as well as the timing and impact from the divestitures of the 13 Asia exits and Mexico. In light of this, you should expect us to manage to a CET1 ratio closer to 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GSIB surcharge increase at the beginning of 2023. That said, we remain focused on all aspects of capital with the goal of maintaining a CET1 ratio of 11.5%. And as you know, under the SCB framework, we can assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks, and we will continue to do so throughout the year with the goal of returning excess capital to shareholders. On Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year, driven by investment banking, private bank and security services fees, partially offset by a decline in markets. Expenses increased 10% year-over-year, driven by transformation, business-led investments and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.  Cost of credit was a net benefit of approximately $300 million as net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL release. And we continue to see strong credit performance, with net credit losses declining on a year-over-year basis and nonaccrual loans down sequentially and year-over-year. This resulted in net income of $2.5 billion, down approximately 22% from the prior year, largely driven by the higher expenses and a smaller ACL release versus the prior year. And ICG delivered a 10.8% RoTCE for the quarter. We also saw a 5% growth in both loans and deposits on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. As for the full year, ICG delivered approximately $16 billion of net income on $44 billion of revenue with an RoTCE of roughly 17%. On Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and key drivers for our ICG business for the fourth quarter. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were slightly down versus the prior year, driven by continued headwinds from rates offset by 18% growth in fees, in fact our highest fee quarter ever. And revenue did increase sequentially, driven by both net interest income and strong fee growth. We continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS on a year-over-year basis that indicate continued strong client activity. Since this is the first time we are showing key metrics that demonstrate this momentum, I want to briefly walk you through each one and what it represents. U.S. dollar clearing transactions are up 4%, which reflect the clearing and settlement activity of commercial and treasury flows for financial institutions. Cross-border flows were up 15%. These flows represent our global payment flows, where we provide cross-border solutions for our clients that are fully integrated across our TTS and Markets business and over 145 currencies. And importantly, this client activity drives recurring fee revenues and generate significant operating deposits. Commercial card volumes, which reflect travel, purchase and virtual card activity across all clients are up 48%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and, on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Investment banking revenues were up 43% year-over-year, driven by growth across products, including record advisory performance, the best advisory quarter we've had in over a decade. Private Bank revenues were up 6% year-over-year as we continue to see strong momentum in new client acquisitions. Overall markets revenues were down 17% versus last year. And while there were different dynamics that played through fixed income and equity markets performance, the performance is against a very strong quarter last year. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 20% year-over-year. While we had solid growth in FX and commodities, this was more than offset by a decline in rates and spread products. Equity Markets revenues were down 3% year-over-year as continued growth in prime finance balances and structured activities was offset by a decline in cash. Security Services revenues grew 5% year-over-year as fees grew 11%, driven by higher settlement volumes and higher assets under custody, partially offset by interest rate headwinds. Now turning to Slide 13. Here we show the results for our Global Consumer Banking business for the fourth quarter in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year-over-year, driven by lower revenues across regions. Expenses were up 34% year-over-year, driven by the Asia divestiture costs. Excluding these costs, expenses were up 9%, driven by transformation and business-led investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $105 million benefit this quarter as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. The NCL rate for the quarter was 1.2%, a decline of 61 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. We released over $900 million of ACL this quarter related to continued improvement in our economic outlook and portfolio quality, partially offset by volume growth.  This resulted in a net income decline of 42% and an RoTCE of 8%. Excluding the Asia divestitures impacts, Net income would have grown 44% and resulted in an RoTCE of 20%. As for the full year, GCB delivered $6 billion of net income on $27 billion of revenues, with an RoTCE of 17% and 22% excluding Asia divestiture impacts. On Slide 14, we show GCB revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics for the fourth quarter. Branded cards revenues declined 3% year-over-year on higher payment rates and portfolio mix. We're seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 43%, card sales volumes up 24% and average loans up 3%. In fact, the fourth quarter acquisitions exceeded the same quarter in 2019 by 2%, the first quarter to do so since the onset of the pandemic. Retail Services revenues declined 10% year-over-year, driven by a 2% decline in net interest income due to elevated payment rates as well as by higher partner payments driven by improved credit performance. But despite this, we are seeing positive underlying drivers with account acquisitions up 6% and spend up 16% on a year-over-year basis. While we're encouraged by these underlying drivers in both cards businesses, payment rates do remain stubbornly high, impacting our loan growth and revenue growth in both cards businesses. Retail banking revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower deposit spreads as well as lower mortgage revenue. However, underlying drivers remained strong, with deposits up 13%, Citigold households up 9% and assets under management up 8% year-over-year as we continue to execute on our North America retail strategy with a focus on our global wealth unit. Asia revenues declined 7% year-over-year largely driven by rate headwinds and higher payment rates. Performance in the wealth hubs exceeded that of the overall region with deposit growth of 12%, AUM growth of 13% and 16% growth in Citigold and CPC clients. Latin America revenues declined 3% year-over-year, mainly due to lower loan volumes in both retail and cards. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased year-over-year, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down year-over-year, largely due to the wind down of legacy assets. Cost of credit was benign. At this point, we typically give a full year outlook. However, since we have our Investor Day coming up on March 2, we plan on bringing everything together at that point to talk about 2022 in the full context of our strategy and medium-term performance expectations. As part of our strategy refresh, our goal is to be as simple and transparent as possible. And I hope you like the new earnings presentation, and we will continue to evolve it going forward. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Sure. Thank you, and good morning, John. So on Slide 9 is where I kind of covered that. You will recall, John, that historically, we have looked in our disclosure at a run-off balance sheet. And that obviously has deposits running off as they term out, that has loans running off as they mature. Others take an approach where they look at a static balance sheet, right? And so we've run the analysis around assuming a static balance sheet and assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in a rising rate environment, obviously, across all currencies. We obviously have a mix of U.S. dollar and foreign currencies as well. And when we run that analysis, now assuming that the balance sheet is static, that is the deposit levels, loan levels, et cetera, that delivers 3x more than what we disclosed in the Q -- in the third quarter. So that's the $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net interest income. So obviously, retaining -- or assuming that the deposit levels stay the same, allow us to generate more net interest income and that's a major driver in the number range or the range that I provided. In terms of... Sorry? Great. In terms of the forward look, I'm not going to give you guidance, as you mentioned. But I think there are a couple of things that are important to keep in mind that we're looking at for 2022. One is the drivers that we mentioned earlier. So a lot of the underlying drivers in our franchise look very strong and are driving healthy fee revenue growth. And I would expect with an outlook for positive GDP that, that's going to continue to play to our advantage in 2022. The second thing I'd point out is the assumptions around interest rate hikes in 2022. I have many as three or four depending on the economists' view that you listen to. And that obviously is going to play to our favor as well when you think about the number of accrual businesses that we have, whether it's our TTS franchise, or our private bank, et cetera, et cetera. So those are important factors that impact the top line, and that we expect to help contribute to some growth coming out of 2022. I mentioned the loan growth on the branded cards portfolio. For cards, it's really going to be about payment rates. I mean, how they taper off \u2013 hopefully, taper off. They've been stubbornly high through all of 2021. So hopefully, we start to see some of that taper off and we get a little bit of growth in average interest-earning balances in the back half of the year, but those are important factors that need to play through into 2022. Yes. So obviously, we look at capital planning with a -- in the context of our strategy and our ability to actually deploy that capital, but to return as much excess capital as we can to our shareholders. And so as we think about the divestitures, which are underway as that capital frees up, we're going to factor that into the capital plan for the year and the quarter. And where we can, we're going to return that to shareholders. So a number of deals are scheduled to close in 2022. That will be part of our plan, and we'll be looking forward to taking those actions in the outer part of the year. I have to apologize. You broke up through much of that question. Would you mind just repeating the tail end of it. There's a lot of static on the line here. Say a little bit more. We're getting a lot of static, should we come back? Yes. Good question. So we are looking at, obviously, how we continue to invest in the franchise, particularly where there are areas of growth. At the same time, ensure that we're delivering buybacks or share -- return to shareholders. As I look at the CET1 ratio, we're ending the year at about 12.2%. As you know, SACR kicks in -- or has kicked in on January 1. We're ending therefore, on January 1 at roughly around where our target is. And over the course of the year, we'll be able to absorb growth in the businesses where there is a need to do that while continuing to identify offsets to both SACR but also low-returning assets that we may have and ridding ourselves of those and generating income as well as the capital from the divestitures that we will be able to close throughout the course of the year. And so as we look at that plan, the start of the year, which is close to our target, towards the end of 2022 we will have to build that back up to about 12% in order to absorb the GCIB headwind, assuming there's no relief provided to that, which then kicks in at the beginning of 2023. And so through the course of the year, we'll utilize through RWA, we'll free up capital and return capital to shareholders. We'll generate more earnings. But at the end of the year, we'll need to kind of end on the higher end or towards that 12%. It's not a major driver as to the decision, as Jane has kind of framed out. But it is -- but it does factor into the points that you've raised. So from a GCIB point of view, there's, I don't know, $31 billion or so of deposits that are tied to our Mexico consumer business. That would drive about 10 basis points or so, or 10 points I should say, on the GCIB score. The total for the divestitures that were -- that we've earmarked, it's about $85 billion in deposits. And so you can do the math that we'd get some benefit from that. You're right, and I don't have numbers that I would share at this point, but -- and in part because the Fed has to run their analysis. But you're right, from a CCAR point of view, when you think about the stress capital buffer, there's an impact to PPNR, but more importantly, to stress losses that will play through as well. As you know, that impact as well as the deposit impact won't really come into play until we've closed on these transactions. But it certainly is a factor to how we think about the longer-term capital planning. And it certainly is something that I'm going to talk more about at Investor Day on March 2. Yes. Yes. There's -- I'm not looking to be specific on where the low-returning assets we're getting out, but we're certainly looking at our markets franchise to see where those low-returning assets exist, as well as to see where their client relationships that are single product and don't necessarily link across the franchise. And so this is something that Jane and I, along with Paco are keenly focused on. We realized that while we've seen growth in markets and in FIC, it has come with growth in the balance sheet, and we want to make sure that we're optimizing the use of the capital. Yes, great question. I'm not going to give guidance on 2022, but let me try and frame out how we're thinking about it because I think it is important. Both Jane and I recognize that we've got -- a lot of static we're getting, excuse me. So in terms of the expenses, we obviously have a large expense base. We've seen growth play out this year. But I think there's some real opportunities over time to attack the expense base, and that's exactly what we intend to do. So if you think about the divestitures, I'll stop here for a second. There's some $6.8 billion of expenses tied to divestitures. As those divestitures get closed out, some of that will naturally go away. The balance of that, which tends to be referred to as stranded cost, we are already putting in place a team to focus on attacking and driving out that stranded cost. The second point that I'll bring up around this is the transformation. The transformation has driven 3 percentage points of growth this year. I do expect that there's more growth associated with that, particularly since we're still doing more hiring. There's more tech spend that will be required. But the transformation over time will deliver efficiencies, will reduce the manual touch points, will drive straight-through processing and therefore, will allow for us to bring our expenses down. And the final piece that I'll mention is the strategy. And so Jane mentioned in our strategy, a focus on core businesses. And that's going to allow for us to look at the organizational structure and identify more simplification opportunities in the way we manage and run the firm.  We do about $300 million to $400 million of productivity savings a quarter. That's not enough. We think there's more opportunity for efficiencies than that. And it's those opportunities that we're going to chase down in order to fund some of this investment spend that we expect in the next couple of years. More on that at Investor Day. Yes, sure. So -- as I've mentioned before, I mean when you look at what's going on with cards across the board, we are seeing increases in spend volume. So branded card spend volume is up 24%. Retail services spend volume is up 16%. So very healthy spend volume. People are using our cards, which is a good thing. In terms of the liquidity that's still out there in the market, even though savings rates have started to normalize, there's still a significant amount of liquidity that's out there in the market. And that's showing up in payment rates in both branded cards and retail services and, frankly, in some of the international card businesses as well. And that has not subsided. And so we did start to see growth in branded cards loans. Average loans are up 3%, branded cards. The end-of-period loans were up 5%. What matters a lot when you come out of a crisis like this is how you reinvest. And so we've spent a lot of time focused on targeting new customers and driving new account acquisitions. Our new account acquisitions are up 43% in branded cards. And we've been also driving that just generally across the board in retail services as well. So getting a good -- a very good response in terms of new accounts coming on board. We've also been focused on how we drive installment lending activity, just kind of to broaden the lending that we're doing with this customer base, and we've seen significant growth in our Flex Loan and Flex Pay products as we've targeted customers who have historically been transactors to really move them onto that product. So very good growth there. In fact, in 2021, we've not only gotten the growth just in aggregate. But if I look at kind of installment lending, we've got 90% of the total installment sales are in digital sales, which is another kind of low-cost acquisition approach that we've taken. So good underlying indicators there. But again, it's not until payment rates start to subside we would expect, hope that, that would start to show up towards the back half of 2022. In terms of the losses, which was the other part of your question, very low loss levels. You heard me mention the delinquency rates earlier. When I look at -- well, the loss rates earlier, when I look at delinquency trends, there's really nothing to focus on there. They remain quite low. And we don't see any signs or any areas of concern, I would say. But I would imagine those 2 would start to normalize as payment rates start to come down. Yes. The investment banking pipeline looks very strong. We ended the year with significant growth in advisory, up 146% year-over-year, well above the wallet. We've grown share there. ECM was up about 16%, again above the wallet. And really that, reflecting some of the fees coming from SPAC activity. So very good growth. EMEA and North America are both up year-over-year due to continued momentum in M&A. So we feel very good about it. We think the pipeline still looks very strong. We think the investments that we've made and bringing on bankers in some of the sectors we needed to beef up, sectors such as health care, technology, sponsors group, those investments are certainly starting to pay off. So we feel good about it. Yes. So thank you, Glenn. So look, if you look at 2021 with a 13.4% RoTCE and reserve releases that get close to $9 billion, I'd have to say yes, right? Because those reserve releases drive a considerable amount of that. Now it's important to compare that to 2020, where we had the opposite effect because we were building meaningful reserves. But as I -- as we look at the forward look, which we'll take you through in more detail, as Jane mentioned we're focused on core parts of the franchise that show the opportunity for growth and the promise for higher returns. And we'll -- that's where our energies are going to be focused, and we think that's what's going to help to drive improved returns over time. Yes. So let me start and then Jane feel free to add in if you'd like. So the first thing that I think's important to remember is the focus that we're trying to put on these core franchises that drive returns over time. So we're prioritizing how we're going to allocate our resources and our investments in part through the divestiture activity. The second thing I'd say is that we are investing in the franchise for the long term, right, as opposed to trying to hit some short-term metric. And so that does involve us putting that money to work where there is client demand and where it leverages the competitive advantages that we have developed. And so that is the way we approach this with, again, an eye towards ensuring that we're clear and transparent with our investors. And that if there's excess, that we're returning that to our shareholders, so that is not just sitting on the sidelines and not generating returns that they would expect of us. Yes. So we haven't shared our deposit betas. But as you would imagine, the betas tend to be higher on the institutional side than on the retail side. And so that piece -- and I'm sorry, the second part of your question was what? Vivek? The increase is roughly -- roughly skewed towards the international. So I'd say of a $3 billion increase, I'd say, about 2/3, 1/3 international. Sorry? Yes. We'll obviously adhere to regulatory guidelines as they exist or however they evolve, but that's exactly right. Yes. So look, I mean, it's -- first of all, with the SCB framework, we take decisions on the capital actions on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Obviously, there's another CCAR run that will all go through, that will determine at least part of the capital stack. And then obviously, there's the GCIB that's coming into play. So we factor all of those things in. In our case, as we develop the capital plan, we also will take a look at the divestitures. In some instances, the divestitures will generate TCE for us to return to shareholders. There may be other impacts from divestitures that are temporary in nature that need to be factored in. But it's part of an entire annual capital planning process that we go through that factors all of those things in. And let me be clear, Gerard, just in case I wasn't. I'm not suggesting we're exiting parts of our Markets business. That is not what I'm suggesting at all. What I'm suggesting is that as we would always do, we're constantly looking for opportunities to optimize the way we use our balance sheet, capital, RWA, et cetera, and where we identify the need to rid ourselves of low-returning and assets that we have, we do that, right? And so with rule changes like SACR and the like, either pricing will adjust or we'll have to take a hard look at some of those assets to see if it still makes sense. And that's more of what I meant than ever suggesting we were exiting part of the Markets business. And to your point, Jane, Commercial Bank this year, a huge opportunity to leverage more of the TTS offering that we have. We're already seeing diversification in the commercial bank in terms of CMO and other markets products, and the revenue this year was up 12% year-over-year, and similar strength in acquisition of new clients in wealth, but those are 2 key areas. I agree. Yes. I'm not giving expectations for the quarter-by-quarter capital buyback decisions, n part because, as I mentioned, with the new SCB rule, we're able to look at it on a quarterly basis. So I'm not giving guidance beyond that. We'll talk more about the capital plan on March 2 broadly, right? Yes. You know what? I'm not going to be able to give you kind of more guidance on that. I mean what I would say is, again, you've got a couple of things that played through 2021 that will be important factors in 2022. One, the hiring that we've done, we're going to get a full year impact of that, at least for part of that in 2022. So that's going to play out. Some of the -- if you think about the mix for the transformation spend, which is a mix of both hires, third-party spend as well as technology, that mix will start to shift over time away from third party for sure and towards the others. And so we're going to have some of that dynamic start to play out in 2022. In terms of the comps, specifically in the fourth quarter, we obviously tie -- the comp performance for the full year is tied to revenues. And so as we would expect to see some forward growth based on the drivers I mentioned earlier, we would expect to see comp related to that play out over the course of 2022. But I'd rather not get into the specifics here, given that we're going to give you a better sense for it in early March. Yes. In 3Q to 4Q, you've got both hires as well as incentive comp. Yes, I agree. And I think it's premature to speculate on the structure of the deal and things of that sort. You're right, we do have about $4 billion of TCE allocated to the business. The other layer of complexity is around the CTA, and you've heard us spend some time on that when we talked about the Australia sale. And I introduced it as a complexity because there's an accounting treatment associated with the CTA that happens at signing, that is separate from the capital implication that happens at closing. So with a CTA, the capital impact flows through AOCI, but it's neutral once the deal is closed. And Mexico, the consumer business would have a DTA of a little bit less than $3 billion or so. And so that's another factor that's involved with the transaction. Did I say DTA? I'm sorry, CTA, currency translation adjustment. Thank you. CTA. Thank you very much, Jane. Yes, sure. So look, we provided the sensitivity because we think comparability is important here. And you can see the magnitude of that difference is pretty sizable. There's still going to be a difference between us and peers, but that difference narrows when you put it on a comparable basis. We do have a skew towards institutional clients, and they do carry a higher beta associated with them. But we also have a skew towards international currencies and we make good spreads there as well.  In terms of the impact through markets, the impact -- I think the market's impact can come in any number of ways. I think rate moves and other uncertainty and volatility in the market can drive broader markets revenues, which we would potentially see depending on how investors have to reposition their books. In terms of the last part of your question, I don't think there's anything else that I would point to. I mean, obviously, with the excess liquidity that we've seen and been carrying in the market, we've been putting that to work in investments. We've increased our investment portfolio by some $70 billion. We expanded the duration to about 2.85, and we still have significant dry powder to -- with the -- work with either client demand or in an increasing rate environment, which we expect."

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Mrs. Landis, you may begin.\nJennifer Landis: Thank you, Operator. Good morning. And thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filing. Before we get started, I'd like to thank Liz Lynn for being such an incredible partner during these last few months. I really enjoyed getting to know the entire Citi team, and I'm honored to be the next Head of Investor Relations. And I look forward to working with you all. With that, I will turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Jen, and good morning everyone. I'm delighted to join you today. So let's kick off the call with what we're seeing from a macro perspective and the tremendous engagement we continue to experience with clients before I give you an update on our results and priorities. Certainly, the recovery from the pandemic continues to drive corporate and consumer confidence. I particularly like the robust pipelines we see through the rest of the year and beyond. Corporate client sentiment remains very positive with healthy cash flows and liquidity driving M&A activity and deleveraging. And consumer Balance Sheets remain unusually strong on the back of the increasing consumer network during the pandemic. Now all that said, growth has come off the ball a tad. We're watching three things very closely: the slowdown in China and its impact on global growth; inflation and supply constraints in labor, materials, and energy; and finally, what happens next with the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations. These are also the issues that repeatedly surfaced in our conversations with clients. So turning to the quarter, we reported a net income of $4.6 billion and EPS of $2.15. Embedded in these results is a pre-tax loss related to the sale of our Australia consumer business, which Mark's going to provide the details on. Excluding this transaction, our 3rd quarter revenues would have been up 3% over last year, and our EPS would have been $2.44. In the institutional client's group, we grew revenues by 4% year-over-year as we continue to see strong client engagement with momentum in Investment Banking, equity markets, and Securities Services more than offsetting the 16% decline in the fixed income market. I'm very proud to tell you that it was Citi's best M&A quarter and the second-best investment banking quarter in a decade. And lending in the ICG grew again this quarter, albeit modest state. We also had a very strong quarter in the equity market with revenues up 40% year-over-year. So despite that normalization in fixed income versus the pretty extraordinary performance of 2020, overall markets revenues were only down 5% and they were up 11% versus the third quarter of 2019. We continue to successfully execute our strategy to grow fee revenue across the ICG businesses. For example, while TTS continues to be impacted by interest rate headwinds, our fees this quarter was the highest in a decade. You can also see how our global network uniquely positions us to help our clients navigate the supply chain challenges so many of them are facing; a dynamic that we expect to exist for the near future. Similarly, we drove double-digit fee revenue growth in Securities Services and the Private Bank as client assets under custody, and assets under management continued their vigorous growth trajectory. In Global Consumer Banking, a healthy consumer balance sheet, and persistently elevated payment rates, did mean that loan growth remained under pressure. The other key drivers are a bit more encouraging, however, U.S. branded card purchase sales are well above 2019 levels, and acquisitions across branded cards, Mexico and the Asia hubs are also all now at or above pre - COVID levels. Ultimately, we continue to benefit from double-digit growth in deposits and assets under management across the franchise. Let me briefly touch on our U.S. retail strategy. Now, our digital strategy and investments are starting to pay dividends. Digital deposits stand at $19 billion, having grown 26% in the last year. And we see more than 2/3 of our digital deposit balances coming from customers outside of our branch footprint, with about half of those deposits from our cardholders who did not previously have a retail relationship with us. Now obviously, we were disappointed by Google's decision to discontinue Google Plex. But we learned a lot through the effort and the vast majority of the investments will be leveraged for our proprietary efforts and future partnerships. So all in all, we ended the quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 11.7% on a standardized basis. And our Tangible Book Value per share increased to $79.07, up over 10% from a year ago. So far this year, we've returned close to $11 billion to shareholders, through a healthy dividend and share repurchases. We remain committed to returning excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise and to maintain our safety and soundness. So overall, I'm quite pleased with these results given the environment we're operating in. And while we have much work ahead, we're seeing the results of the previous investments that we have made. Now, I'd like to update you on our strategic priorities. Turning to slide three, we've included a page that clearly lays out our top priorities and some of the actions we've taken to date against them. And we're going to share this page with you each quarter to ensure you're up-to-date on where we are and the milestones and progress along the way. And as you can see, we've been hard at work acting against the priorities that I've laid out, the transformation, the strategy refresh, and our culture and talent. Now, clearly, the transformation is our number one priority right now. And the key to that transformation is our safety and soundness and addressing the consent orders by modernizing our risk and control environment. During the quarter, we submitted our plans to our regulators, and continue to have a constructive dialog with them, as we pivot now firmly towards execution. We're already well underway in the investments in our risk and control environment. And we're really bringing a culture of excellence to this effort and we are moving with urgency. We also continued to make progress, refreshing our strategy. In addition to announcing the sale of our consumer business in Australia, we're deep in the 2nd round of bids for the remaining exit markets. We began the work on how these exits will enable us to simplify our operations in Asia, and eliminate stranded costs. And we're really looking forward to bringing you all the strategy work together for you on Investor Day and presenting our vision for the firm. And as Mark's going to touch on, we've begun executing on many of the decisions that we've already made, including in TTS, wealth, and commercial banking, with investments in front-office, hires, as well as enhanced digital products and service offerings. And we're already starting to see the impact of these investments emerge through key drivers across these businesses. And finally, turning to culture and talent, we continue to attract high-caliber external talent, whilst driving towards our diversity goals, ensuring clear accountability, and breaking down the silos that have historically impeded our progress as a Company. It's a new Citi. And all of this work has one overarching goal -- to responsibly narrow the returns gap with our peers. We will update you with the metrics and milestones that we'll use to hold ourselves accountable, so you can hold us accountable to them as well. And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to go through our performance in more detail. And then we will both be delighted to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 4, as Jane mentioned, Citigroup reported a third-quarter net income of $4.6 billion, EPS of $2.15, and an ROTCE of 11% on $17.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results is a pre-tax loss of $680 million related to the sale of our Australia Consumer business. Excluding this item, EPS would've been $2.44 with an ROTCE of 12.5%. As a reminder, while we received a premium to book on the sale of the business, we did incur a pre-tax loss primarily related to the currency translation adjustment that has built up over time and is already included in our capital. Upon closing, the capital impact of this loss will be largely neutralized, and we will release approximately $800 million of capital allocated to the business. Revenues declined 1% from the prior year, excluding the loss on the sale, revenues would have been up 3%, largely driven by Investment Banking fees, as well as strong growth in Equity Markets and Securities Services. Expenses were up 5% year-over-year, and constant dollar expenses were up 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our expenses have grown by 5% with two main drivers: investments in the transformation, including the six programs to address the consent orders, which drove about 3% of the growth so far this year. And business-led investments which focus on our front office expansion in the Investment Bank, Wealth, and Security Services, and investments to improve our client experience and digitize our network. So far this year, we added over 500 bankers, advisors, and other front office support in Wealth, including Private Bank and the consumer wealth businesses, and 200 corporate and investment bankers globally in high-growth areas, including senior hires across tech, healthcare, fintech, and private equity coverage. In our services businesses, TTS and Security Services, we continue to improve client experience and digital capabilities, which is enabling us to capture significant new mandates. In Consumer, these investments include development and marketing for new offerings like the Custom Cash Card and installment lending, as well as investments in our mobile and digital user experience. In addition, there were also increases in volume and revenue-related expenses, as well as businesses' usual expenses which were largely offset by efficiency savings. As a reminder, we will continue to analyze our expenses to look for opportunities to self-fund investments. And now turning to credit, credit performance remained strong with net credit losses of just under $1 billion more than offset by an ACL release of $1.2 billion, largely reflecting continued improvement in portfolio quality. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans were down 1% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the Australia exit. Excluding this impact, loans would have been up 1% year-over-year, driven by active client engagement in TTS, Private Bank, and end-of-period of-period deposits were up 6% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients, as well as continued momentum in client acquisition and deepening across both corporate clients and consumers. Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $11 the lion in the capital so far this year. And while we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise, we will continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Turning now to east business. Slide five shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year and sequentially, mainly driven by Investment Banking, Equity Markets, and Securities Services. Expenses increased 9%, with about half of the increase driven by transformation, and the other half business-lediness led investments and higher revenue-related costs, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit costs were largely benign in the quarter as minimal net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL reserve release. This resa resulted in a net income of $3.4 billion, which grew 21% in the quarter and 60% on a year-to-date basis. And ICG delivered an ROTCE of 14.5% for the quarter and 18.8% year-to-date. Slide 6 shows revenues for the insticlient'sl client's group in more detail. On the banking side, revenues were up 11% and Treasury and Trade Solutions continued growth in fee revenues of 20% year-over-year, the highest quarter for fees in a decade reflected solid client engagement and client acquisition, as well as a recovery in commercial Card revenues. However, all of this was more than offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads, driving total revenues down 4%. We're continuing to see momentum across our payment busina ess with 15% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearings transactions over the past year. As of quarter-end, TTS loans grew 15%, mainly in trade loans where our technology invest the ments in supply chain and deep local knowledge is enabling us to meet our clients' needs across the globe. Investment Banking revenues were up 39% year-over-year, largely driven by M&A as we continue to see the benefits from our front office investments, which positioned us well to take advantage of increased deal activity. As Jane mentioned, this was the 2nd best quarter for Investment Banking revenues and the best quarter for M&A in a decade. Private Bank revenues grew 4% driven by growth in assets under management, loans, and deposits, reflecting momentum with new and existing clients. This quarter, we added almost 200 bankers, investment counselors, and other front office support, and onboarded over 200 new clients. Our investments in talent continue to drive growth, which bodes well for our overall strategy and wealth. Corporate lending revenues were up 17% primarily driven by lower cost of funds and a modest gain on sale, partially offset by lower loan volumes. Total markets and Security Services revenues decreased 4% from last year. Fixed income revenues decreased 16% reflecting the continued normalization in market activity across rates and spread products. However, we saw strong activity with our Corporate clients, engaging with them in foreign exchange products to support their global operations, and hedging solutions to assist with their risk mitigation efforts. Equity Markets revenues were up 40%; our second-best quarter in a decade, driven by cash equities, derivatives, and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. This is another business where we see our investments in talent and technology paying off. In Security, Services revenues were up 10%. Here we saw strong growth in fee revenues as the investments that we've been making in our platform and product capabilities enabled us to grow revenue with both new and existing clients, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. Finally, looking at year-to-date results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from Investment Banking and Equity Markets, as well as solid results in the Private Bank and Securities Services, which helped to offset the expected normalization and fixed income markets. Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars, on Slide 7. Revenues declined 14%, and 5% excluding the loss on the sale, as solid deposit growth and momentum in investment management were more than offset by lower card balances and lower deposit spreads. Expenses increased 5% with about half driven by transformation, and the remainder driven by business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. Cost of credit was a modest benefit this quarter, as a roughly $1 billion ACL reserve release, more than offset net credit losses. This resulted in a net income of $1.3 billion, which grew 44%. And GCB delivered a 15% ROTCE and a 21.5% ROTCE, excluding the loss on the sale. Finally, looking at year-to-date results, we've seen steady improvement in our drivers over the course of the year with purchase sales up 5% relative to 2019, and acquisitions nearing pre - COVID levels globally. And the business delivered 22.4% ROTCE, excluding the loss on the sale. Slide 8 shows the results for North American consumers in more detail. Total third-quarter revenues were down 4% from last year as we continue to see headwinds from higher payment rates and deposit spreads. That said, we are encouraged by the trends we're seeing in both cards and retail banking. In branded cards and retail services, purchased sales were up versus the prior year by 24% and 14% respectively, with both above 2019 levels. And in retail banking, average deposits, and within that, checking deposits, were both up 14%. AUMs were up 16% and Citigold households were up 13% this quarter. We're also making progress on our U.S. digital strategy. U.S. digital deposits grew 26% compared to the prior year. An installment loan balances, including our Flex Loan and Flex Pay products, have also grown substantially, up 22% compared to the prior year, and over 80% of these loans are originated digitally. On slide 9, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 30% year-over-year in the third quarter. Excluding the loss on the sale, revenues declined 5% with a 7% decline in Latin America and a 4% decline in Asia. Looking at International Consumer overall, we're seeing good momentum and investment management with 10% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia, and the growth is meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the four international Wealth hubs. Purchase sales grew 8% versus the prior year. And average deposits grew 3%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. Credit remained favorable again this quarter across all regions. And given the delinquency trends, we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021. Slide 11 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues increased by over $300 million driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses declined by $300 million due to the absence of the civil money penalty, which we incurred in the 3rd quarter of last year, offset by an increase in expenses related to the transformation. Credit costs were still a benefit in the quarter or reflect the lower ACL release in the legacy portfolio relative to last year. Finally, EBT was a loss of $330 million. Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends, as well as non-interest revenues on a reported basis. In the third quarter, net interest revenue of $10.4 billion declined roughly $100 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates. On a year-to-date basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $2.3 billion. Turning to non-interest revenues, on the bottom of the slide. In the third quarter, non-NIR declined by approximately $50 million year-over-year. Driven by the impact from the loss on the sale of the Australia Consumer business. Excluding the loss, non-interest revenues would have grown by over $600 million or 9% driven by strong growth in fees in ICG. On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio ticked down to 11.7%. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was largely unchanged at 5.8%. And our Tangible Book Value per share grew by 10% year-over-year to $79.07, driven by Net Income. Before we move to Q&A, let me touch briefly on our outlook for 2021. On the top line for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a reported basis, excluding any divestiture-related impacts. On the expense side, we continue to expect full-year expenses to be up in the mid-single-digit range, excluding any divestiture-related impacts as we continue to transform our risk and control environment and invest in our businesses. And we will continue to look for ways to partially self-fund these investments over time. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator's Instruction] Please limit your questions to one question. Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Hi. Good morning. Mark --\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nJohn McDonald: I wanted to ask about the net interest income. It seems like, overall, it came in a little bit better than you might have expected when you spoke at the Barclays conference in September. Could you give us a little more color on what drove the improvement in the core ex-markets NII this quarter and how that makes you feel about the setup for NII growing from here?\nMark Mason: Sure. Good morning, John. When we look at it, it's on page 12, we came in at about $10.4 billion. I think there were a couple of factors that play through here. One was the Treasury investments that we've been making contributed to that as we put some of the excess liquidity that we have to work. On the 2nd, I mentioned earlier that we saw some loan growth in Cards, sequentially, branded cards, in particular, up 3%, but also, within that, we saw some of the late fees and bow con fees and cards playthrough.  As you know, there's an extra day in the quarter. And so the combination of those things contributed to the tick up here that we've seen. In terms of the balance of the year, that all feeds into the guidance that I've given for total revenues, and that really hasn't changed, but we continue to look to invest in the cards portfolio through new acquisitions with a long-term perspective of how we grow loans over time there.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And just as a follow-up. On capital returns, while your total return is very healthy, it doesn't look like it increased much from the $4 billion that you did in the 2nd quarter, despite the Fed lifting its restrictions. Is this something you are being conservative on, giving a lot of change going on at the Company right now? As you free up capital from the business exits, your stocks trading in a low valuation, how are you thinking about allocating that freed-up capital between investing in the business and returning it to shareholders?\nMark Mason: Yeah sure. So look, our philosophy really has not changed on this in terms of -- you've heard me say a number of times, that as we generate income, as we utilize our DTA over time, as capital gets released from the transactions that we do, we want to ensure that we're able to serve our clients. We want to ensure that we can invest in the business, and then anything in excess of that we want to return to the shareholders.  That perspective has not changed. Obviously, the SCB allows for us to make those decisions in the given quarter, based on what we're seeing in terms of our expected performance and based on all of the other factors I mentioned, including the capital release, and SA-CCR, and things of that sort, and so we'll continue to make those decisions with that philosophy in mind, which is how do we return any excess we have to shareholders over time.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Two interesting things outside [Indiscernible]. Wonder if we get your quick comments on perspective. One was you became the first custodian to receive regulatory approval in onshore business -- custody business in China.  I wonder if you could frame my perspective on how material that opportunity is. And then the same kind of thing on your plans and to enter the Australian buy now pay later market, and what that means for not just Australia, but more globally, how you're viewing that in connection with the rest of your consumer business? Thanks so much.\nJane Fraser: Thanks, Glen. Why don't I take that one? In terms of start-up, our operations, and business in China, I'd say we've been in that country for 100 years, we understand the dynamics in the local market well. We're currently serving a very large number of investors in that market. 70% of the Fortune 500 corporations in China, how they operate on the ground and gain access to China's Capital Market.  And we're looking at -- we're very happy to have the custody license in China. It will also help support our operations in Hong Kong. And it's part of the growth of our Securities Services strategy that we've got. You've seen the benefits starting to [Indiscernible] through in this quarter's results from some of those previous investments. And this is just another one of the investments that we're making that business that we like a lot and we think we're well-positioned in.  And in terms of buy-now-pay-later, I think this is one way, obviously, we're divesting our operations in Asia on that front, but we've certainly taken -- we've taken the learnings from our operations throughout the Asian region, and particularly been applying them to the U.S. over the last few years. So we've certainly not been sitting still in the U.S. We've been building out our personal lending platform since 2019, and that's part of our broader digitization strategy in the U.S. consumer.  We've been seeing very strong growth in our Flex portfolios, both as we leverage some of our existing partnerships such as American Airlines. And we watch it expand with new partners in POS. And one of the areas I'm particularly excited about is the partnering that we're doing with the largest e-commerce player, Amazon, on point-of-sale lending for our Cards customers.  And those capabilities are and will be leveraged with many additional partners and channels in the state and into Mexico. And finally, we've been expanding our product suite by developing off Cards lending capabilities. And if you've heard from Mark, payments on installment loans to existing Cards customers, 88% of those total sales are in digital channels.  So if we look at all of this, I would say, clearly, there's a trend towards multiple different formats of how a customer can and wants to pay. And we're really on the front for this, and making some strong progress on the back of the investments that we've been making over the last few years and will continue to do so.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: Wanted to understand a little bit more about what you think you can do in the U.S. cards business. I know we just spoke a little bit about some of the things that you have been executing on. But when I look at the Card business while it's up on a year-on-year basis, it is trending a bit below some of the peers in terms of growth rates.  And then you've got the Retail Partner Card program, which has some opportunities there to, in my opinion, get a little bit of a refresh to be as dynamic as some of your best-in-class peers. So wondering how you're thinking about that and as well on the deposit side in the U.S. with Google Now partnership not going forward.  What are you thinking about with regard to leveraging your mobile app across the U.S. in a way that might not be understood well by the investor community because it seems like you've got a great app and it's just under penetrating your opportunity side with your brand?\nMark Mason: Thanks for that. Why don't I get started and Jane may want to jump in, and I'll start with your comments related to Cards. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, particularly when you look at U.S. branded Cards, we did start to see a tick up there as it relates to loan balances. The loans Were up about one percent year-over-year. They were up about 3% quarter-over-quarter. You know what I think is really important here is the market re-entry.  Because as you're seeing, purchase sales are up, but payment rates are still quite high. And we've got to see how stimulus and liquidity play out over time. And so what we're focused on is how we're reentering into the market, and we're doing that both through our Custom Cash launch, which is helping to drive new acquisitions. In fact, our new acquisition volumes are back to 2019 levels. Over half of those acquisitions are in proprietary cards.  We're being thoughtful about that, so over the last 5 years, we've been shortening our promotional periods and adding higher fees for balanced transfers, and targeting a lower mix of promotional balances. And those things, as you know, will feed future average interest-earning balances as our experiences that roughly half of those balances ultimately convert to revolving over time. So that's an important step.  The second thing that I'll mention is just to reiterate what Jane pointed out, which is worth thinking about lending more broadly. And we're driving growth on the On-Card lending products like Flex Pay and Flex Loan. And those don't have promotional periods associated with them and they start to generate interest from day one.  And so we're, we're keenly focused on this. We're obviously a big player here. It's obviously an important part of our portfolio and generates healthy returns. But we need to be positioned to capture growth. As the economy continues to recover and behavior normalizes and we need to be prepared if Behavior doesn't normalize as quickly as we'd like with things like broader lending products.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, good morning. My question is maybe just focus a little on rates. I think we're so focused on U.S. rates, but given your global exposure, we've seen rate hikes in Mexico, Brazil. Now we're contemplating rate hikes soon in the UK. How do we think about your rate sensitivity to the rest of the world? And do you see some benefits coming up over the next few quarters on the NII side?\nMark Mason: Yeah. Look, I mean, we have seen a number of rate hikes, and then with the talk of rate hikes here in the U.S. As you look at our IRE that we report, we're not that sensitive to the short-end or long-end, but that said, the rate in price increases are beneficial for us. And so we've got a lot of liquidity that's available for us to invest as we see rates increase.  But also have enough dry powder to ensure that we're taking advantage of client demand as that starts to return as well. But for our firm, as you pointed out, the global impact on rates is quite important. And increases internationally helped to fuel our performance in parts of the franchise like TTS and elsewhere.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Good Morning. Thanks for your update on just the reiterated cost guide for this year. And I know, might early to talk about next year. But can you just help us understand just the moving parts underneath incentive comp transformation, and what we should be thinking about in terms of run-rate costs from here? If we can even stay away from what next year's growth looks like. But any color, the question that's coming up a lot for sure across the large bank group in terms of required investments versus other things going on at the bank. Thanks.\nMark Mason: Yes. Sure. So look, let me start by saying, as I pointed out in prepared remarks, our expenses in the aggregate are on guidance, so to speak. Both as it relates to the transformation expected span which year-to-date is up 3%, as well as our total expenses which are up 5% year-to-date. Again, consistent with the guidance. As I think about this, those are 2 very important categories of spend.  As Jane has pointed out, transformation's our top priority, and we're going to spend what's necessary to get that done, and we need to ensure that we're investing long-term across the franchise, and so we're going to continue to do that. But I would also highlight that expenses are something that we control.  So we're very deliberate about the spending that you are seeing. And in fact, I'm scrubbing -- we are scrubbing every single expense line that we have to ensure that the dollars that we're putting to work are being put to work in an optimal fashion, that they're necessary dollars to be spent. And in doing that, we're also looking for productivity and efficiency opportunities.  And in fact, we've seen that play through the expense levels that you see today. If you look at -- if we -- as we look at our expenses, we've generated somewhere between 300 and $400 million quarter inefficiencies through 2021. Right. Expense management is something that we're very disciplined about, were very deliberate about, and we handle that in a very controlled fashion, recognizing the priorities that we pointed out.  I'm not going to give you guidance for 2022, I will tell you that our guidance hasn't changed for the balance of 2021. We're obviously in the middle of our budget season. And as we firm that up and finalize that, we'll share that with you and our investors more broadly.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi. My question's for Jane. Jane, you said on this call, it's a new Citigroup. And I'm just referring to the 8-K from August where it announced a bonus scheme for top executives. Apparently, that'll be broadened out to many more. And so we as shareholders and those who represent shareholders we see this bonus scheme before we see the targets, so my question is, do you have the targets, and if so, can you reveal those, although I suspect that won't be until March 2nd, or do you not have targets yet, or what's happening. Because either way doesn't feel good for us investors. Thanks.\nJane Fraser: Mike, I'm actually really glad you brought this up, as we obviously saw your note the other day. If you'll bear with me for a minute, let's just take a step back and start with our compensation for Las Vegas. I think it's really important for our shareholders to understand this. So the compensation of the management team is designed to be performance-based. It's aligned with the interest of our shareholders. Most importantly.  So first, any of the deferred of what we have, have downside built-in and we clearly saw this last year in the PSU performance, which paid out only 28% of its target. And then, secondly, the annual process hold management accountable for is out as we also saw last year with meaningful comp reductions resulting from the consent orders. So then -- if we then turn to the transformation program, as I said in the opening, there isn't anything that's more important than the successful execution of the program.  It's our number one priority. We want to make sure the bank is modernized in its risk and control environment and it will also benefit our shareholders in terms of the performance of the bank. The board and I hold the senior leaders driving that transformation accountable for its successful execution. I'm certainly driving this program with urgency.  And I also need to retain key talent because it's a pretty tight talent market right now, as we all know. And we need to do this so that we can hit the milestones and deliver with excellence. To hold people accountable and drive the outcomes, we need both carrots, and we need sticks.  And to your question, we're going to put in rigorous metrics, to determine if the rewards get paid out at all. And if so, what percentage will be paid out? And we laid out the criteria in the 8-K and the final metrics will be ones that reflect input from the Board, from me, and the other stakeholders involved.  And we'll make a note of, obviously, [Indiscernible] in the proxy, etc., so you'll see them. So as you can see, the main message for me is there will be consequences if we fall short of what is expected, just as there were last year for the management and the leaders of the program. I'm accountable, my team's accountable, and very simply we must and we will deliver.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I just want to, Jane, go back to -- you mentioned disappointment at Google Plex pulling out. Just talk to us in terms of did you view that as a critical client acquisition tool, and given that that's not moving forward, does that put some urgency in terms of other partnerships that you may strike to improve sort of the deposit gathering efforts?\nJane Fraser: Yes, obviously as I said in the opening, we were disappointed in their decision. But it is just one part of our digital strategy. We certainly didn't have all the eggs in that basket, as we've been talking about for a few quarters now. And what I am pleased with is the strength of the digital engagement that we are seeing across the U.S. It's lagged in other geographies around the world across the industry on this dimension. And also the growth in a sticky digital deposit that we're seeing in the U.S.  The piece I like is we deliberately invested in very reusable capabilities for future partnerships and existing ones that we have, as well as our own proprietary efforts. I can try and make that come a bit alive. We've added APIs, which really make it very easy to operate with partners. We've developed a whole suite of embedded services that are ready to deploy. That's things like real-time, digital alerts, partner branded communications.  And probably most importantly, and maybe this is the geek in me, we put together new tech stacks and we've learned a lot about doing this. But it's very valuable for what we're doing right now and for partnerships going forward. So at the end of the day, I think all the things that we've been doing both in some of the work with Google, but also with partnerships around the world, is going to further our digitization strategy and U.S. consumers continue helping us grow and drive the returns here. And I would say, we're always feeling the urgency in improving the performance, the growth, and returns in the consumer franchises.\nJennifer Landis: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nJane Fraser: Hey, Matt.\nMatt O'Connor: So you submitted the plan to the regulators this quarter. Can you give us a sense of when you expect to hear back from them? And then what kind of things you'll be able to communicate to all of us. I know there are always limited abilities in what you can discuss about the regulatory stuff. But what are the data points that you're looking for internally, and when do you think you can share them?\nJane Fraser: Yeah, as you heard from me, this is our number 1 priority. I think it's the benefit of all of us stakeholders that we get this done with excellence and we get this done right. And as we said, we submitted our plan in the 3rd quarter, I'm personally very proud of it. It is a multi-year plan.  As Mark said, it comprises six major programs. And it will position us to operate with excellence in the years ahead in a digital world. In particular, it provides very clear target states for our risk and controls and for our core operating model element. As we said, we've now firmly pivoted to executing that plan. And I have to say we have very constructive, and frankly, a really helpful dialogue that's been ongoing with our regulators. So is not as if you submit and then you haven't spoken as being -- This has been very constructive all the way through.  In terms of execution, in a way, we're going full steam ahead here. I'm really pleased with the caliber of talent we brought in from inside and outside of the firm, as Mark talked about, so we can ensure that we're executing with excellence, know some of the areas on new hires and data.  And I think importantly, with putting as much effort on culture as on modernization, Karen Peetz and her team are ensuring we have the capabilities and rigorous governance, so we're executing in a very disciplined way. We deliver the outcomes from the investments we're making. We put in a new accountability framework.  I have to say our board is certainly holding us firmly and regularly to account. So we'll be sharing more details, obviously at Investor Day and as we go through this, but I think the main message for me is we've pivoted to execution and we're getting on with this.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, Jane. Just wanted to clarify this compensation 8-K that you talked about. You always had bonuses for short-term and you've had a long-term incentive comp that you always paid your Executives, similar to everybody else.  So the transformation project seems to be over and above that, shouldn't that be part of what long-term compensation and incentive rewards are meant for? I'm trying to understand the logic behind adding an additional payment here is. Because that's what management is already being partly compensated for, which is longer-term moves and changes and performance.\nJane Fraser: Look, I think it's exactly as I will first of all thank you. Thank you for that. I think it's as I said earlier in answer to Mike's questions. We want to drive the program with the agency. We need to retain key talent and it is a very tight talent market, as you know, and I want to make sure that there is no question from anyone involved in the programs that this is their number 1 priority, for the bank to execute this with excellence, that there are both carrots and sticks here.  And those come through the individual program and the individual assessments that everyone participates in every year, as well as in this piece. So I think this is fully aligned with the shareholders' interest. You want to have management incentives to deliver this with excellence, but equally with all the downsides if we fail to do so. And the program is designed to do just that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Lim with Associate General.\nAndrew Lim: Morning. Thanks for taking my question. It's a bit of a technical one. Wondering if you could give a bit of color on the SA-CCR implementation for the CET1 ratio in terms of the quantum of the impacts and the timing of the implementation? Thank you.\nMark Mason: Sure. Thank you. Look, we're working towards the mandatory compliance date, which will be January of 2022. We've not adopted SA-CCR early and we don't plan to. Obviously, the impact can range from impacting risk-weighted assets to impacting one's G-SIB score. What we're -- like I said, we're working through that now. I'm not prepared to share that with you, but it is a factor in how we're doing our planning and we'll share that when we adopted it at a later day.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Jane. How are you?\nJane Fraser: Hey.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys share with us, in looking at your Global Consumer Banking business in North America in your supplement, I think it's page 8, you guys give us a nice breakdown between the Retail Banking's, Citi -branded cards, and Citi Retail Services. And I noticed that in Retail Banking, there was a loss in the quarter. And can you just give us some color on what's maybe driving that and just the outlook for that part of the business? Thank you.\nMark Mason: On the retail banking performance, the drag there is in part the higher expenses from the transformation spend that's playing through and impacting income there.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi, I just wanted to follow up again. The follow-up to my other question and as Vivek expressed. Jane and Mark, you mentioned that you have to serve regulator, it's number one. I think that's clear to everybody in this call. And then you mentioned serving stakeholders. I think the comp question really gets to -- what's being done for shareholders? And shareholders have been left behind at Citigroup over almost any time frame. And why -- and Mark, maybe I might disagree with the philosophy a little bit. Your philosophy said \"Is first serve clients, then investment business, then you do buybacks. \" What you definitely changed in your philosophy is because the discount to book value is just getting greater and greater. Your discount versus peer has increased. Citi has worst-in-class returns, adjusted efficiency, and stock market valuations.  So why not a little change in that philosophy to more buybacks versus investing, if you have such a great opportunity with your share price? So what can you do from a symbolic nature, as everyone gets paid in stock, or what can you do about the capital freed up from the sale of Australia and use all that to buyback stock, or what can you do to show that obviously regulars matter, stakeholders matter, but what can you do to show that shareholders also matter, given such the underperformance of the share price?  And then, since we're only giving one question at a time, just a little bit more follow-up on your U.S. consumer strategy as far as digital deposits, cross-selling credit cards, point-of-sale with Amazon, a little bit more on that. Thank you.\nJane Fraser: Okay, Mike. It's Jane. Let's go, obviously. Let me kick this one-off. Unequivocally, our shareholders are incredibly important to us. And when we look at where we're trading on that and the underperformance around that, it is something that we all determined in the strategy refresh, in the transformation of what we're doing, and in the culture and talent work we're doing to address this.  We're going to do what is necessary to narrow the gap with our peers. We're going to ensure we have the right business mix and strategies to drive up the returns. And you're starting to see where that is -- where we're headed to with that from the different decisions we've already announced, and obviously, it will all come together Investor Day, but secondly, we're also going to do it by running the bank better.  And we've laid out, on page 3 of the presentation, what are the different priorities so that our investors realize the value that we think lies in Citi and what we are going to be doing to unlock that for their benefit. I think -- I hope it's pretty clear in terms of the framework that we're using and the principles around that.  In terms of, as Mark said, from not only unlocking the value that we see in Citi, which I really do think is pretty tremendous and I'm quite excited about, is also then, what will we do with our excess capital? You've heard me say, given where we trade so disappointingly below book, obviously share repurchases make sense for our shareholders.  We also do have a healthy dividend yield, but that's an important part of the mix. But there's no question around the attractiveness for shareholders relatively at the stock buybacks. And we will certainly be returning excess capital to our shareholders and be very mindful of the bar that is required for investment internally.  And you've seen that with the decisions that we've made on the exits in Asia on Consumer and some of the other moves, that we will exit the businesses. We think of their returning and reinvest where appropriate, but we'll return that to shareholders. And I can see my CFO is chomping at the bit here to jump in as well.\nMark Mason: Yes, thanks. I think you answered it very wide, I just add a couple of quick things. One, that when we invest in the business towards clients, or more broadly in the business, we're doing it where returns are above our cost of capital.  We're making smart decisions about how to redeploy that capital to ensure that we're narrowing that gap to peers. The 2nd thing I'd point out is that, in the 1st couple of quarters of the year, we've maxed out the capital return that was available for us to deliver before the SCB came into play. That is because our shareholders are so important. And then the third, as Jane mentioned, is that we have a skew towards buybacks. Again, just given where the stock is trading and given where our dividend yield is. So thank you for the question.\nOperator: Your final question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for squeezing me in here. Good morning, Jane and Mark. Jane, I was hoping to ask about the wealth management opportunity. And this is an area of great competitive intensity. You have a large -- many large peers have been investing heavily in this space for years. And I know you're going to cover some of this on Investor Day and provide more detail. But just at a high level, I was hoping if you could speak to what differentiates Citi's value prop from some of the peers in the space, whether you have the technology or infrastructure in place to support some of your growth ambitions. And then, just lastly, whether you can engage in M&A, or is that precluded under the consent order, if you were to look to expand into that arena inorganically.\nJane Fraser: Yeah. Thank you so much, Steven. So I'm pretty pleased with our opportunities here because we have all the pieces to be very successful. We have a strong brand amongst the affluent, not just here in the States of our Retail Banking franchise. We've got a pretty heavily affluent base, but around the world, and when you go into Asia, in particular, this is the aspirational wealth management brand on the ground there.  We've also got a real breadth s of client relationships, and this is where the connectivity points also become important in those full principles that we laid out for the strategy refresh. We have Commercial Banking operations in certain geographies around the world, where they've been operating for many years now. This is the engine of wealth creation in the world, and we have a relationship with the owner already.  And so, the synergies that we will be out to generate by much more closely connecting them will be very important. Similarly, the elevator from the affluent client base in our consumer franchise all the way up to the ultra-high net worth in the Private Bank is obviously a natural area to build out that we haven't really invested in that elevator.  I'm thinking of it that way. We have a great -- we have some great platforms. Our institutional client business around the world means that we've got top 2 platforms for our Private Banking clients, in particular, to take advantage of, but it's also ones that our consumer clients have as well, so the opportunity here is to bring all these different pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients in the U.S. and in the global offshore Wealth centers.  And I would also point to the fact that we are already the top 3 players in Asia. It's not as if we don't have scale, and that this is a startup business here. And we've already seen that this is coming to fruition quickly. We obviously announced the focus on Wealth at the beginning of the year.  We've already acquired 21.5 thousand new-to-bank clients in Asia so far this year. We've added over 500 bankers, advisors, and other front office support year-to-date. We've done one of the biggest tech releases for wealth in the 3rd quarter of this year, with over 70 plus features going live on the back of the digital platform we launched last quarter.  I think the fact that we got all these different pieces, we're putting them all together, is really giving us momentum and accelerating your opportunity for us. And this is a trend, the Wealth trend is going to be one that is one of those unstoppable trends, particularly at our Asia in the years ahead. We would look at acquisitions at the moment. Obviously, it's more focused around what are digital capabilities, what are other things to enhance the value propositions and the technological side. And those aren't just acquisitions, it's partnerships and the like that we've been investing in so that we really serve the wealthy client across the full spectrum of their needs, rather than just narrowly as some of the other players are. In just this [Indiscernible] investment products, we've got the benefit across the board.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\nJennifer Landis: Thank you all for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to IR with any follow-up questions. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes Citi's 3rd Quarter earning call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good morning everyone. I'm delighted to join you today. So let's kick off the call with what we're seeing from a macro perspective and the tremendous engagement we continue to experience with clients before I give you an update on our results and priorities. Certainly, the recovery from the pandemic continues to drive corporate and consumer confidence. I particularly like the robust pipelines we see through the rest of the year and beyond. Corporate client sentiment remains very positive with healthy cash flows and liquidity driving M&A activity and deleveraging. And consumer Balance Sheets remain unusually strong on the back of the increasing consumer network during the pandemic. Now all that said, growth has come off the ball a tad. We're watching three things very closely: the slowdown in China and its impact on global growth; inflation and supply constraints in labor, materials, and energy; and finally, what happens next with the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations. These are also the issues that repeatedly surfaced in our conversations with clients. So turning to the quarter, we reported a net income of $4.6 billion and EPS of $2.15. Embedded in these results is a pre-tax loss related to the sale of our Australia consumer business, which Mark's going to provide the details on. Excluding this transaction, our 3rd quarter revenues would have been up 3% over last year, and our EPS would have been $2.44. In the institutional client's group, we grew revenues by 4% year-over-year as we continue to see strong client engagement with momentum in Investment Banking, equity markets, and Securities Services more than offsetting the 16% decline in the fixed income market. I'm very proud to tell you that it was Citi's best M&A quarter and the second-best investment banking quarter in a decade. And lending in the ICG grew again this quarter, albeit modest state. We also had a very strong quarter in the equity market with revenues up 40% year-over-year. So despite that normalization in fixed income versus the pretty extraordinary performance of 2020, overall markets revenues were only down 5% and they were up 11% versus the third quarter of 2019. We continue to successfully execute our strategy to grow fee revenue across the ICG businesses. For example, while TTS continues to be impacted by interest rate headwinds, our fees this quarter was the highest in a decade. You can also see how our global network uniquely positions us to help our clients navigate the supply chain challenges so many of them are facing; a dynamic that we expect to exist for the near future. Similarly, we drove double-digit fee revenue growth in Securities Services and the Private Bank as client assets under custody, and assets under management continued their vigorous growth trajectory. In Global Consumer Banking, a healthy consumer balance sheet, and persistently elevated payment rates, did mean that loan growth remained under pressure. The other key drivers are a bit more encouraging, however, U.S. branded card purchase sales are well above 2019 levels, and acquisitions across branded cards, Mexico and the Asia hubs are also all now at or above pre - COVID levels. Ultimately, we continue to benefit from double-digit growth in deposits and assets under management across the franchise. Let me briefly touch on our U.S. retail strategy. Now, our digital strategy and investments are starting to pay dividends. Digital deposits stand at $19 billion, having grown 26% in the last year. And we see more than 2/3 of our digital deposit balances coming from customers outside of our branch footprint, with about half of those deposits from our cardholders who did not previously have a retail relationship with us. Now obviously, we were disappointed by Google's decision to discontinue Google Plex. But we learned a lot through the effort and the vast majority of the investments will be leveraged for our proprietary efforts and future partnerships. So all in all, we ended the quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 11.7% on a standardized basis. And our Tangible Book Value per share increased to $79.07, up over 10% from a year ago. So far this year, we've returned close to $11 billion to shareholders, through a healthy dividend and share repurchases. We remain committed to returning excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise and to maintain our safety and soundness. So overall, I'm quite pleased with these results given the environment we're operating in. And while we have much work ahead, we're seeing the results of the previous investments that we have made. Now, I'd like to update you on our strategic priorities. Turning to slide three, we've included a page that clearly lays out our top priorities and some of the actions we've taken to date against them. And we're going to share this page with you each quarter to ensure you're up-to-date on where we are and the milestones and progress along the way. And as you can see, we've been hard at work acting against the priorities that I've laid out, the transformation, the strategy refresh, and our culture and talent. Now, clearly, the transformation is our number one priority right now. And the key to that transformation is our safety and soundness and addressing the consent orders by modernizing our risk and control environment. During the quarter, we submitted our plans to our regulators, and continue to have a constructive dialog with them, as we pivot now firmly towards execution. We're already well underway in the investments in our risk and control environment. And we're really bringing a culture of excellence to this effort and we are moving with urgency. We also continued to make progress, refreshing our strategy. In addition to announcing the sale of our consumer business in Australia, we're deep in the 2nd round of bids for the remaining exit markets. We began the work on how these exits will enable us to simplify our operations in Asia, and eliminate stranded costs. And we're really looking forward to bringing you all the strategy work together for you on Investor Day and presenting our vision for the firm. And as Mark's going to touch on, we've begun executing on many of the decisions that we've already made, including in TTS, wealth, and commercial banking, with investments in front-office, hires, as well as enhanced digital products and service offerings. And we're already starting to see the impact of these investments emerge through key drivers across these businesses. And finally, turning to culture and talent, we continue to attract high-caliber external talent, whilst driving towards our diversity goals, ensuring clear accountability, and breaking down the silos that have historically impeded our progress as a Company. It's a new Citi. And all of this work has one overarching goal -- to responsibly narrow the returns gap with our peers. We will update you with the metrics and milestones that we'll use to hold ourselves accountable, so you can hold us accountable to them as well. And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to go through our performance in more detail. And then we will both be delighted to take your questions. Thanks, Glen. Why don't I take that one? In terms of start-up, our operations, and business in China, I'd say we've been in that country for 100 years, we understand the dynamics in the local market well. We're currently serving a very large number of investors in that market. 70% of the Fortune 500 corporations in China, how they operate on the ground and gain access to China's Capital Market.  And we're looking at -- we're very happy to have the custody license in China. It will also help support our operations in Hong Kong. And it's part of the growth of our Securities Services strategy that we've got. You've seen the benefits starting to [Indiscernible] through in this quarter's results from some of those previous investments. And this is just another one of the investments that we're making that business that we like a lot and we think we're well-positioned in.  And in terms of buy-now-pay-later, I think this is one way, obviously, we're divesting our operations in Asia on that front, but we've certainly taken -- we've taken the learnings from our operations throughout the Asian region, and particularly been applying them to the U.S. over the last few years. So we've certainly not been sitting still in the U.S. We've been building out our personal lending platform since 2019, and that's part of our broader digitization strategy in the U.S. consumer.  We've been seeing very strong growth in our Flex portfolios, both as we leverage some of our existing partnerships such as American Airlines. And we watch it expand with new partners in POS. And one of the areas I'm particularly excited about is the partnering that we're doing with the largest e-commerce player, Amazon, on point-of-sale lending for our Cards customers.  And those capabilities are and will be leveraged with many additional partners and channels in the state and into Mexico. And finally, we've been expanding our product suite by developing off Cards lending capabilities. And if you've heard from Mark, payments on installment loans to existing Cards customers, 88% of those total sales are in digital channels.  So if we look at all of this, I would say, clearly, there's a trend towards multiple different formats of how a customer can and wants to pay. And we're really on the front for this, and making some strong progress on the back of the investments that we've been making over the last few years and will continue to do so. Mike, I'm actually really glad you brought this up, as we obviously saw your note the other day. If you'll bear with me for a minute, let's just take a step back and start with our compensation for Las Vegas. I think it's really important for our shareholders to understand this. So the compensation of the management team is designed to be performance-based. It's aligned with the interest of our shareholders. Most importantly.  So first, any of the deferred of what we have, have downside built-in and we clearly saw this last year in the PSU performance, which paid out only 28% of its target. And then, secondly, the annual process hold management accountable for is out as we also saw last year with meaningful comp reductions resulting from the consent orders. So then -- if we then turn to the transformation program, as I said in the opening, there isn't anything that's more important than the successful execution of the program.  It's our number one priority. We want to make sure the bank is modernized in its risk and control environment and it will also benefit our shareholders in terms of the performance of the bank. The board and I hold the senior leaders driving that transformation accountable for its successful execution. I'm certainly driving this program with urgency.  And I also need to retain key talent because it's a pretty tight talent market right now, as we all know. And we need to do this so that we can hit the milestones and deliver with excellence. To hold people accountable and drive the outcomes, we need both carrots, and we need sticks.  And to your question, we're going to put in rigorous metrics, to determine if the rewards get paid out at all. And if so, what percentage will be paid out? And we laid out the criteria in the 8-K and the final metrics will be ones that reflect input from the Board, from me, and the other stakeholders involved.  And we'll make a note of, obviously, [Indiscernible] in the proxy, etc., so you'll see them. So as you can see, the main message for me is there will be consequences if we fall short of what is expected, just as there were last year for the management and the leaders of the program. I'm accountable, my team's accountable, and very simply we must and we will deliver. Yes, obviously as I said in the opening, we were disappointed in their decision. But it is just one part of our digital strategy. We certainly didn't have all the eggs in that basket, as we've been talking about for a few quarters now. And what I am pleased with is the strength of the digital engagement that we are seeing across the U.S. It's lagged in other geographies around the world across the industry on this dimension. And also the growth in a sticky digital deposit that we're seeing in the U.S.  The piece I like is we deliberately invested in very reusable capabilities for future partnerships and existing ones that we have, as well as our own proprietary efforts. I can try and make that come a bit alive. We've added APIs, which really make it very easy to operate with partners. We've developed a whole suite of embedded services that are ready to deploy. That's things like real-time, digital alerts, partner branded communications.  And probably most importantly, and maybe this is the geek in me, we put together new tech stacks and we've learned a lot about doing this. But it's very valuable for what we're doing right now and for partnerships going forward. So at the end of the day, I think all the things that we've been doing both in some of the work with Google, but also with partnerships around the world, is going to further our digitization strategy and U.S. consumers continue helping us grow and drive the returns here. And I would say, we're always feeling the urgency in improving the performance, the growth, and returns in the consumer franchises. Hey, Matt. Yeah, as you heard from me, this is our number 1 priority. I think it's the benefit of all of us stakeholders that we get this done with excellence and we get this done right. And as we said, we submitted our plan in the 3rd quarter, I'm personally very proud of it. It is a multi-year plan.  As Mark said, it comprises six major programs. And it will position us to operate with excellence in the years ahead in a digital world. In particular, it provides very clear target states for our risk and controls and for our core operating model element. As we said, we've now firmly pivoted to executing that plan. And I have to say we have very constructive, and frankly, a really helpful dialogue that's been ongoing with our regulators. So is not as if you submit and then you haven't spoken as being -- This has been very constructive all the way through.  In terms of execution, in a way, we're going full steam ahead here. I'm really pleased with the caliber of talent we brought in from inside and outside of the firm, as Mark talked about, so we can ensure that we're executing with excellence, know some of the areas on new hires and data.  And I think importantly, with putting as much effort on culture as on modernization, Karen Peetz and her team are ensuring we have the capabilities and rigorous governance, so we're executing in a very disciplined way. We deliver the outcomes from the investments we're making. We put in a new accountability framework.  I have to say our board is certainly holding us firmly and regularly to account. So we'll be sharing more details, obviously at Investor Day and as we go through this, but I think the main message for me is we've pivoted to execution and we're getting on with this. Look, I think it's exactly as I will first of all thank you. Thank you for that. I think it's as I said earlier in answer to Mike's questions. We want to drive the program with the agency. We need to retain key talent and it is a very tight talent market, as you know, and I want to make sure that there is no question from anyone involved in the programs that this is their number 1 priority, for the bank to execute this with excellence, that there are both carrots and sticks here.  And those come through the individual program and the individual assessments that everyone participates in every year, as well as in this piece. So I think this is fully aligned with the shareholders' interest. You want to have management incentives to deliver this with excellence, but equally with all the downsides if we fail to do so. And the program is designed to do just that. Hey. Okay, Mike. It's Jane. Let's go, obviously. Let me kick this one-off. Unequivocally, our shareholders are incredibly important to us. And when we look at where we're trading on that and the underperformance around that, it is something that we all determined in the strategy refresh, in the transformation of what we're doing, and in the culture and talent work we're doing to address this.  We're going to do what is necessary to narrow the gap with our peers. We're going to ensure we have the right business mix and strategies to drive up the returns.

We think of their returning and reinvest where appropriate, but we'll return that to shareholders. And I can see my CFO is chomping at the bit here to jump in as well. Yeah. Thank you so much, Steven. So I'm pretty pleased with our opportunities here because we have all the pieces to be very successful. We have a strong brand amongst the affluent, not just here in the States of our Retail Banking franchise. We've got a pretty heavily affluent base, but around the world, and when you go into Asia, in particular, this is the aspirational wealth management brand on the ground there.  We've also got a real breadth s of client relationships, and this is where the connectivity points also become important in those full principles that we laid out for the strategy refresh. We have Commercial Banking operations in certain geographies around the world, where they've been operating for many years now. This is the engine of wealth creation in the world, and we have a relationship with the owner already.  And so, the synergies that we will be out to generate by much more closely connecting them will be very important. Similarly, the elevator from the affluent client base in our consumer franchise all the way up to the ultra-high net worth in the Private Bank is obviously a natural area to build out that we haven't really invested in that elevator.  I'm thinking of it that way. We have a great -- we have some great platforms. Our institutional client business around the world means that we've got top 2 platforms for our Private Banking clients, in particular, to take advantage of, but it's also ones that our consumer clients have as well, so the opportunity here is to bring all these different pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients in the U.S. and in the global offshore Wealth centers.  And I would also point to the fact that we are already the top 3 players in Asia. It's not as if we don't have scale, and that this is a startup business here. And we've already seen that this is coming to fruition quickly. We obviously announced the focus on Wealth at the beginning of the year.  We've already acquired 21.5 thousand new-to-bank clients in Asia so far this year. We've added over 500 bankers, advisors, and other front office support year-to-date. We've done one of the biggest tech releases for wealth in the 3rd quarter of this year, with over 70 plus features going live on the back of the digital platform we launched last quarter.  I think the fact that we got all these different pieces, we're putting them all together, is really giving us momentum and accelerating your opportunity for us. And this is a trend, the Wealth trend is going to be one that is one of those unstoppable trends, particularly at our Asia in the years ahead. We would look at acquisitions at the moment. Obviously, it's more focused around what are digital capabilities, what are other things to enhance the value propositions and the technological side. And those aren't just acquisitions, it's partnerships and the like that we've been investing in so that we really serve the wealthy client across the full spectrum of their needs, rather than just narrowly as some of the other players are. In just this [Indiscernible] investment products, we've got the benefit across the board."

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 4, as Jane mentioned, Citigroup reported a third-quarter net income of $4.6 billion, EPS of $2.15, and an ROTCE of 11% on $17.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results is a pre-tax loss of $680 million related to the sale of our Australia Consumer business. Excluding this item, EPS would've been $2.44 with an ROTCE of 12.5%. As a reminder, while we received a premium to book on the sale of the business, we did incur a pre-tax loss primarily related to the currency translation adjustment that has built up over time and is already included in our capital. Upon closing, the capital impact of this loss will be largely neutralized, and we will release approximately $800 million of capital allocated to the business. Revenues declined 1% from the prior year, excluding the loss on the sale, revenues would have been up 3%, largely driven by Investment Banking fees, as well as strong growth in Equity Markets and Securities Services. Expenses were up 5% year-over-year, and constant dollar expenses were up 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our expenses have grown by 5% with two main drivers: investments in the transformation, including the six programs to address the consent orders, which drove about 3% of the growth so far this year. And business-led investments which focus on our front office expansion in the Investment Bank, Wealth, and Security Services, and investments to improve our client experience and digitize our network. So far this year, we added over 500 bankers, advisors, and other front office support in Wealth, including Private Bank and the consumer wealth businesses, and 200 corporate and investment bankers globally in high-growth areas, including senior hires across tech, healthcare, fintech, and private equity coverage. In our services businesses, TTS and Security Services, we continue to improve client experience and digital capabilities, which is enabling us to capture significant new mandates. In Consumer, these investments include development and marketing for new offerings like the Custom Cash Card and installment lending, as well as investments in our mobile and digital user experience. In addition, there were also increases in volume and revenue-related expenses, as well as businesses' usual expenses which were largely offset by efficiency savings. As a reminder, we will continue to analyze our expenses to look for opportunities to self-fund investments. And now turning to credit, credit performance remained strong with net credit losses of just under $1 billion more than offset by an ACL release of $1.2 billion, largely reflecting continued improvement in portfolio quality. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans were down 1% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the Australia exit. Excluding this impact, loans would have been up 1% year-over-year, driven by active client engagement in TTS, Private Bank, and end-of-period of-period deposits were up 6% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients, as well as continued momentum in client acquisition and deepening across both corporate clients and consumers. Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $11 the lion in the capital so far this year. And while we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise, we will continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Turning now to east business. Slide five shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year and sequentially, mainly driven by Investment Banking, Equity Markets, and Securities Services. Expenses increased 9%, with about half of the increase driven by transformation, and the other half business-lediness led investments and higher revenue-related costs, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit costs were largely benign in the quarter as minimal net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL reserve release. This resa resulted in a net income of $3.4 billion, which grew 21% in the quarter and 60% on a year-to-date basis. And ICG delivered an ROTCE of 14.5% for the quarter and 18.8% year-to-date. Slide 6 shows revenues for the insticlient'sl client's group in more detail. On the banking side, revenues were up 11% and Treasury and Trade Solutions continued growth in fee revenues of 20% year-over-year, the highest quarter for fees in a decade reflected solid client engagement and client acquisition, as well as a recovery in commercial Card revenues. However, all of this was more than offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads, driving total revenues down 4%. We're continuing to see momentum across our payment busina ess with 15% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearings transactions over the past year. As of quarter-end, TTS loans grew 15%, mainly in trade loans where our technology invest the ments in supply chain and deep local knowledge is enabling us to meet our clients' needs across the globe. Investment Banking revenues were up 39% year-over-year, largely driven by M&A as we continue to see the benefits from our front office investments, which positioned us well to take advantage of increased deal activity. As Jane mentioned, this was the 2nd best quarter for Investment Banking revenues and the best quarter for M&A in a decade. Private Bank revenues grew 4% driven by growth in assets under management, loans, and deposits, reflecting momentum with new and existing clients. This quarter, we added almost 200 bankers, investment counselors, and other front office support, and onboarded over 200 new clients. Our investments in talent continue to drive growth, which bodes well for our overall strategy and wealth. Corporate lending revenues were up 17% primarily driven by lower cost of funds and a modest gain on sale, partially offset by lower loan volumes. Total markets and Security Services revenues decreased 4% from last year. Fixed income revenues decreased 16% reflecting the continued normalization in market activity across rates and spread products. However, we saw strong activity with our Corporate clients, engaging with them in foreign exchange products to support their global operations, and hedging solutions to assist with their risk mitigation efforts. Equity Markets revenues were up 40%; our second-best quarter in a decade, driven by cash equities, derivatives, and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. This is another business where we see our investments in talent and technology paying off. In Security, Services revenues were up 10%. Here we saw strong growth in fee revenues as the investments that we've been making in our platform and product capabilities enabled us to grow revenue with both new and existing clients, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. Finally, looking at year-to-date results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from Investment Banking and Equity Markets, as well as solid results in the Private Bank and Securities Services, which helped to offset the expected normalization and fixed income markets. Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars, on Slide 7. Revenues declined 14%, and 5% excluding the loss on the sale, as solid deposit growth and momentum in investment management were more than offset by lower card balances and lower deposit spreads. Expenses increased 5% with about half driven by transformation, and the remainder driven by business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. Cost of credit was a modest benefit this quarter, as a roughly $1 billion ACL reserve release, more than offset net credit losses. This resulted in a net income of $1.3 billion, which grew 44%. And GCB delivered a 15% ROTCE and a 21.5% ROTCE, excluding the loss on the sale. Finally, looking at year-to-date results, we've seen steady improvement in our drivers over the course of the year with purchase sales up 5% relative to 2019, and acquisitions nearing pre - COVID levels globally. And the business delivered 22.4% ROTCE, excluding the loss on the sale. Slide 8 shows the results for North American consumers in more detail. Total third-quarter revenues were down 4% from last year as we continue to see headwinds from higher payment rates and deposit spreads. That said, we are encouraged by the trends we're seeing in both cards and retail banking. In branded cards and retail services, purchased sales were up versus the prior year by 24% and 14% respectively, with both above 2019 levels. And in retail banking, average deposits, and within that, checking deposits, were both up 14%. AUMs were up 16% and Citigold households were up 13% this quarter. We're also making progress on our U.S. digital strategy. U.S. digital deposits grew 26% compared to the prior year. An installment loan balances, including our Flex Loan and Flex Pay products, have also grown substantially, up 22% compared to the prior year, and over 80% of these loans are originated digitally. On slide 9, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 30% year-over-year in the third quarter. Excluding the loss on the sale, revenues declined 5% with a 7% decline in Latin America and a 4% decline in Asia. Looking at International Consumer overall, we're seeing good momentum and investment management with 10% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia, and the growth is meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the four international Wealth hubs. Purchase sales grew 8% versus the prior year. And average deposits grew 3%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. Credit remained favorable again this quarter across all regions. And given the delinquency trends, we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021. Slide 11 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues increased by over $300 million driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses declined by $300 million due to the absence of the civil money penalty, which we incurred in the 3rd quarter of last year, offset by an increase in expenses related to the transformation. Credit costs were still a benefit in the quarter or reflect the lower ACL release in the legacy portfolio relative to last year. Finally, EBT was a loss of $330 million. Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends, as well as non-interest revenues on a reported basis. In the third quarter, net interest revenue of $10.4 billion declined roughly $100 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates. On a year-to-date basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $2.3 billion. Turning to non-interest revenues, on the bottom of the slide. In the third quarter, non-NIR declined by approximately $50 million year-over-year. Driven by the impact from the loss on the sale of the Australia Consumer business. Excluding the loss, non-interest revenues would have grown by over $600 million or 9% driven by strong growth in fees in ICG. On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio ticked down to 11.7%. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was largely unchanged at 5.8%. And our Tangible Book Value per share grew by 10% year-over-year to $79.07, driven by Net Income. Before we move to Q&A, let me touch briefly on our outlook for 2021. On the top line for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a reported basis, excluding any divestiture-related impacts. On the expense side, we continue to expect full-year expenses to be up in the mid-single-digit range, excluding any divestiture-related impacts as we continue to transform our risk and control environment and invest in our businesses. And we will continue to look for ways to partially self-fund these investments over time. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Good morning. Sure. Good morning, John. When we look at it, it's on page 12, we came in at about $10.4 billion. I think there were a couple of factors that play through here. One was the Treasury investments that we've been making contributed to that as we put some of the excess liquidity that we have to work. On the 2nd, I mentioned earlier that we saw some loan growth in Cards, sequentially, branded cards, in particular, up 3%, but also, within that, we saw some of the late fees and bow con fees and cards playthrough.  As you know, there's an extra day in the quarter. And so the combination of those things contributed to the tick up here that we've seen. In terms of the balance of the year, that all feeds into the guidance that I've given for total revenues, and that really hasn't changed, but we continue to look to invest in the cards portfolio through new acquisitions with a long-term perspective of how we grow loans over time there. Yeah sure. So look, our philosophy really has not changed on this in terms of -- you've heard me say a number of times, that as we generate income, as we utilize our DTA over time, as capital gets released from the transactions that we do, we want to ensure that we're able to serve our clients. We want to ensure that we can invest in the business, and then anything in excess of that we want to return to the shareholders.  That perspective has not changed. Obviously, the SCB allows for us to make those decisions in the given quarter, based on what we're seeing in terms of our expected performance and based on all of the other factors I mentioned, including the capital release, and SA-CCR, and things of that sort, and so we'll continue to make those decisions with that philosophy in mind, which is how do we return any excess we have to shareholders over time. Good morning. Thanks for that. Why don't I get started and Jane may want to jump in, and I'll start with your comments related to Cards. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, particularly when you look at U.S. branded Cards, we did start to see a tick up there as it relates to loan balances. The loans Were up about one percent year-over-year. They were up about 3% quarter-over-quarter. You know what I think is really important here is the market re-entry.  Because as you're seeing, purchase sales are up, but payment rates are still quite high. And we've got to see how stimulus and liquidity play out over time. And so what we're focused on is how we're reentering into the market, and we're doing that both through our Custom Cash launch, which is helping to drive new acquisitions. In fact, our new acquisition volumes are back to 2019 levels. Over half of those acquisitions are in proprietary cards.  We're being thoughtful about that, so over the last 5 years, we've been shortening our promotional periods and adding higher fees for balanced transfers, and targeting a lower mix of promotional balances. And those things, as you know, will feed future average interest-earning balances as our experiences that roughly half of those balances ultimately convert to revolving over time. So that's an important step.  The second thing that I'll mention is just to reiterate what Jane pointed out, which is worth thinking about lending more broadly. And we're driving growth on the On-Card lending products like Flex Pay and Flex Loan. And those don't have promotional periods associated with them and they start to generate interest from day one.  And so we're, we're keenly focused on this. We're obviously a big player here. It's obviously an important part of our portfolio and generates healthy returns. But we need to be positioned to capture growth. As the economy continues to recover and behavior normalizes and we need to be prepared if Behavior doesn't normalize as quickly as we'd like with things like broader lending products. Yeah. Look, I mean, we have seen a number of rate hikes, and then with the talk of rate hikes here in the U.S. As you look at our IRE that we report, we're not that sensitive to the short-end or long-end, but that said, the rate in price increases are beneficial for us. And so we've got a lot of liquidity that's available for us to invest as we see rates increase.  But also have enough dry powder to ensure that we're taking advantage of client demand as that starts to return as well. But for our firm, as you pointed out, the global impact on rates is quite important. And increases internationally helped to fuel our performance in parts of the franchise like TTS and elsewhere. Yes. Sure. So look, let me start by saying, as I pointed out in prepared remarks, our expenses in the aggregate are on guidance, so to speak. Both as it relates to the transformation expected span which year-to-date is up 3%, as well as our total expenses which are up 5% year-to-date. Again, consistent with the guidance. As I think about this, those are 2 very important categories of spend.  As Jane has pointed out, transformation's our top priority, and we're going to spend what's necessary to get that done, and we need to ensure that we're investing long-term across the franchise, and so we're going to continue to do that. But I would also highlight that expenses are something that we control.  So we're very deliberate about the spending that you are seeing. And in fact, I'm scrubbing -- we are scrubbing every single expense line that we have to ensure that the dollars that we're putting to work are being put to work in an optimal fashion, that they're necessary dollars to be spent. And in doing that, we're also looking for productivity and efficiency opportunities.  And in fact, we've seen that play through the expense levels that you see today. If you look at -- if we -- as we look at our expenses, we've generated somewhere between 300 and $400 million quarter inefficiencies through 2021. Right. Expense management is something that we're very disciplined about, were very deliberate about, and we handle that in a very controlled fashion, recognizing the priorities that we pointed out.  I'm not going to give you guidance for 2022, I will tell you that our guidance hasn't changed for the balance of 2021. We're obviously in the middle of our budget season. And as we firm that up and finalize that, we'll share that with you and our investors more broadly. Good morning. Sure. Thank you. Look, we're working towards the mandatory compliance date, which will be January of 2022. We've not adopted SA-CCR early and we don't plan to. Obviously, the impact can range from impacting risk-weighted assets to impacting one's G-SIB score. What we're -- like I said, we're working through that now. I'm not prepared to share that with you, but it is a factor in how we're doing our planning and we'll share that when we adopted it at a later day. On the retail banking performance, the drag there is in part the higher expenses from the transformation spend that's playing through and impacting income there. Yes, thanks. I think you answered it very wide, I just add a couple of quick things. One, that when we invest in the business towards clients, or more broadly in the business, we're doing it where returns are above our cost of capital.  We're making smart decisions about how to redeploy that capital to ensure that we're narrowing that gap to peers. The 2nd thing I'd point out is that, in the 1st couple of quarters of the year, we've maxed out the capital return that was available for us to deliver before the SCB came into play. That is because our shareholders are so important. And then the third, as Jane mentioned, is that we have a skew towards buybacks. Again, just given where the stock is trading and given where our dividend yield is. So thank you for the question."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Lynn, you may begin.\nElizabeth Lynn: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation which is available for download on our website citigroup.com may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital, and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 20 Form 10-K. Before we get started, I'd also like to welcome our incoming Head of IR, Jennifer Landis, who will be joining Citi next month and hosting this call beginning in October as I leave the seat to assume a new role within Citi, I'd like to thank you all for your partnership and support over the past few years. With that said, let me turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Liz, and good morning to everyone. I am delighted to join you again today. And first, I'm going to discuss the results of my first full quarter as CEO and then update you on the progress against our strategic priorities. For the quarter, we reported $6.2 billion in net income or $2.85 per share. We continue to benefit from an improving macro environment as evidenced by another significant release of our allowances for credit losses. Indeed, the pace of the macro recovery is exceeding earlier expectations across the globe, and with it comes growing consumer and corporate confidence. And this also came through loud and clear in my conversations with clients over the course of the week I just spent in London. Now clearly, we have to remain mindful of the unevenness in that global recovery due to continued contagion and challenges in vaccine distribution in several parts of the world, but we are optimistic about the momentum ahead and as a result, we deliberately accelerated some of our investments. In our institutional businesses, we saw the expected normalization of fixed income trading compared to the striking volatility of Q2 last year and our equities franchise had a particularly strong quarter. Looking forward, we do expect the volatile markets to be higher than pre-COVID levels. Performance in our Investment Banking franchise remained healthy with good momentum in M&A and a very solid pipeline ahead for the rest of the year. We saw very good progress in our strategies to increase fee revenues with double-digit growth in our ICG fee revenues and specifically over 20% year-over-year fee growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions and Securities Services, and in the private bank. Now, TTS is the backbone of the unique global network we deliver for our clients. And while the business continues to be impacted by lower rates, we particularly like how we are positioned here from a market share perspective as the post-pandemic recovery takes shape. In Consumer Banking, while our loan book and revenues were impacted by the elevated payment rates in cards, spending is well above pre-COVID levels now with a 38% increase in global purchase sales year-over-year. We expect this to translate into loan growth in the second half of the year. And we continue to have good momentum in both deposit growth and AUMs across our consumer franchises. In the U.S., as we discussed, we are investing in our home market as demonstrated by the well-received launch of our innovative Custom Cash Card in June. Internationally, the picture for our consumer business is the budget. So, while there is still the softness in the Mexican economy, in Asia, loan growth returned and that's despite new COVID outbreaks. Turning to capital. For the first two quarters of 2021, we returned close to $7 billion to our shareholders, which was the maximum amount permitted under the Federal Reserve's rules. Going forward, we are committed to returning any excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise. So, while our stress capital buffer increased to 3% as a result of the Fed's recent stress test, that won't impact the common equity Tier 1 target we would be managing to, of approximately 11.5%. We ended the quarter at 11.9% on a standardized basis and have excess capital to return to our shareholders through a healthy dividend and ongoing stock repurchase program. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $77.87, up over 9% from a year ago. Now let's turn to three of our strategic priorities: Strategy, Transformation, and Talent. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy refresh. We have moved swiftly to begin the sales process for the 13 consumer markets we plan to exit in Asia and EMEA. The first round of bids was very encouraging and competitive, which isn't a surprise because these are terrific businesses for the right owners. In those regions, we are off to a running start in our wealth strategy. We are making significant strategic investments in product capabilities, technology, and talent and have already seen this in increased client acquisition. We continue to do thorough and vigorous work to refresh our strategy across our consumer and institutional businesses guided by the four principles I outlined to you earlier in the year, being clinical, being focused and ensuring both connectivity and simplification. Our overarching goal is to increase the returns we generate and close the gap with our peers by investing in the franchises that will drive the most growth, the three most notable of which are TTS, wealth, and commercial banking. And I'm very confident in the growth and return prospects these connected franchises will afford us. As we have done so far, we will share our decisions with you as we make them on the strategy and we are also looking forward to presenting our plans to you more comprehensively during an Investor Day, which we intend to hold in the first quarter of next year. We're going to put our entire vision for the firm in front of view. So, you can then hold us accountable for executing against it. As we discussed in the call last quarter, we are also working very hard and diligently on our transformation. This is a significant, it's also an exciting body of work and we're working closely with our regulators to meet their expectations and we intend to submit our plans to them this quarter. Now, while addressing the consent orders is an intense focus of the transformation, our work here goes well beyond the orders themselves. We've set out to modernize our bank. We want to achieve nothing less than excellence and this means investing in our risk and control environment, but also in the infrastructure we need to serve our clients in an increasingly digital world. So, let me give you an example in TTS. These investments will improve the scalability of our platform, automation will drive efficiency and client experience, and investments in data will enhance revenues and the investments we're making will help position us to retain our leading position as the preeminent global corporate bank. And that leads me finally to talent, where we have made material progress over the last few months. I'm delighted with the caliber of talent we have been attracting to the firm to grow our businesses and support our transformation. We've enhanced our existing ranks with best-in-market hires in data, risk, strategy and controls, as well as in the front lines of wealth, the commercial bank, and BCMA, in particular. We continue to invest in a culture of excellence and our own people, providing them with new leadership and growth opportunities. And it\u2019s this combination of new perspective and our existing high-caliber talent pool that will enable us to take the firm forward with excellence, urgency, and accountability. Now, before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to thank Liz Lynn for her great work leading our Investor Relation efforts over the past several years. And as you know, and as she mentioned, she is going to be our Finance Lead for BCMA where we all know she is going to do a wonderful job. With that, Mark will go through our presentation. And then we'll both be happy to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3, Citigroup reported second-quarter net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $2.85, and a 15.2% RoTCE. Revenues declined 12% from the prior year, reflecting a normalization in fixed income markets along with lower card loans in consumer as well as the impact of lower interest rates. Expenses were up 7% year-over-year, in constant dollars expenses were up 4% reflecting a normalization relative to the low print last year along with continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Credit performance remained strong with net credit losses of $1.3 billion more than offset by an ACL release of $2.4 billion, reflecting portfolio improvements as well as the continued improvement in our macroeconomic outlook. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher repayment rates across institutional and consumer. Although, I would note that we are starting to see some pockets of loan growth emerge and for the first time in over a year loans were up sequentially. Deposits grew modestly up 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients. Looking at the first half of 2021, total revenues declined 9% year-over-year, and 10% in constant dollars mainly driven by the normalization in fixed income markets and lower card balances in consumer, although we did see strong fee revenue growth across consumer and in ICG excluding fixed income markets. Total expenses were up 6% on a reported basis and 3% in constant dollars midway through the year. I'll talk more about our outlook for the remainder of the year in a moment. Cost of credit was a benefit of roughly $3 billion as we released over $6 billion in reserves and we delivered roughly $14 billion in net income and in RoTCE of 17.6%. Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $7 billion in capital so far this year. And we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise as well as returning any excess capital to shareholders given the flexibility provided by the SCB framework. Turning now to each business. Slide 4 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. For the quarter ICG delivered EBIT of $4.9 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues decreased 14% driven mainly by the decline in fixed income markets, expenses increased 4% and were up 2% in constant dollars as investments in transformation along with other strategic investments were mostly offset by lower incentive compensation and efficiency savings. Credit costs were down considerably given a roughly $900 million ACL release as well as lower net credit losses. And ICG delivered a 16.4% return on allocated capital. Slide 5 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Product revenues were down 17% in the second quarter, primarily reflecting a comparison to a strong prior-year period, particularly in fixed income markets. However, we are continuing to see robust client engagement and strong underlying growth in our fee businesses across the franchise including TTS, Investment Banking, Securities Services, Commercial Banking, and the Private Bank. And excluding the markets related component non-interest revenues were up 24% this quarter and we are confident in our outlook for continued strong fee growth in the back half of the year. Looking at the results in greater detail, on the Banking side, revenues decreased 1%. In Treasury and Trade Solutions significant growth in fee revenues of roughly 25%, reflecting solid client engagement as well as growth in trade, were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates with revenues down 1%. We're continuing to see momentum across our Payments Business with 13% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearing volumes over the past year as well as the early days of a recovery in commercial cards. And as of the end of the quarter, TTS loans grew roughly 5% reflecting increasing client demand and improving macroeconomic conditions. Investment banking revenues were up 1% as higher M&A and equity underwriting revenues were largely offset by a decline in debt underwriting. While the overall DCM wallet was up in the second quarter, all the growth was in non-investment grade which did not benefit our results given our SKU to investment grade. But, looking at results versus a more normal year revenues were up 38% versus the second quarter of 2019 with strong growth across all products. Private Bank revenues grew 4% driven by higher fees and lending volumes reflecting momentum with both new and existing clients, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Corporate Lending revenues were down 15% primarily driven by lower volumes. Total markets and securities services revenues decreased 30% from last year. Fixed Income revenues decreased 43% reflecting a comparison to a strong prior-year period in both rates and spread products. However, we remained engaged with our clients with steady growth in both corporate and investor client revenues relative to the historical average. Equities revenues were up 37% versus last year, primarily driven by good performance in both derivatives and prime finance reflecting robust client activity and favorable market conditions. In securities services, revenues were up 9% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Here we saw strong growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients driven by growth in assets under custody and settlement volumes partially offset by lower spreads. Finally, looking at first-half results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from Investment Banking as well as good results in the Private Bank and Securities Services which helped to offset the expected normalization in fixed income markets. I would also note that equity markets revenues are up over 30%. Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 6. For the quarter, GCB delivered EBIT of $2.4 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues declined 10% as continued strong deposit growth albeit with lower spreads and momentum in Investment Management were more than offset by lower card balances across all three regions. In cards, while we are encouraged by the continued improvement in consumer spending with purchase sales up close to 40% versus last year and almost 20% versus last quarter, we are still seeing the impact of high-payment rates on revenues. Expenses increased 7%, reflecting continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments along with an acceleration in marketing and higher volume-related costs from the low point a year ago, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit remains healthy and credit costs decreased significantly, driven by the $1.4 billion ACL reserve release and lower net credit losses. And GCB delivered a 20.8% return on allocated capital. Finally, looking at results for the first half of the year, we've seen steady improvement in our drivers, which gives us confidence in our outlook as we move into the back half of the year. Slide 7, shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. Second-quarter revenues were down 11% from last year, primarily driven by lower cards revenues but better than the 15% decline last quarter on a year-over-year basis. Revenues declined in both branded cards and retail services by 12% and 14% respectively, reflecting continued headwinds from higher payment rates as consumers have continued to use liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt, driving lower loans and a shift in mix towards transactor balances. This is creating pressure on our net interest revenues, but it's also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends. However, we are continuing to see a recovery in sales activity with purchase sales now above pre-pandemic levels led by discretionary spend including travel and dining. In Branded Cards, total purchase sales were up 40% versus last year and importantly, up 11% versus the second quarter of 2019. And in Retail Services, purchase sales also grew versus both second quarter 2019 and 2020. So, the good news is that we're continuing to see the recovery in spend and we're also returning to pre-COVID acquisition levels. Looking ahead, we expect the growth in purchase sales to translate into loan growth by the end of the year as stimulus moderates and consumers return to more normal payment patterns. Turning to Retail Banking, revenues were down 7% year-over-year, reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads and lower mortgage revenues. That said, we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen our retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships. Average deposits were up 18% including 24% growth in checking and the number of Citigold households increased by 16% contributing to a 23% increase in AUMs. On slide 8, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year-over-year in the second quarter with an 11% decline in Latin America and a 3% decline in Asia. Looking at International Consumer overall, we are seeing good momentum in Investment Management with 15% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia and the numbers are meaningfully higher, if you look specifically at the four international wealth hubs. Average deposit growth remained strong at 8% albeit at lower deposit spreads. And similar to the U.S., we saw a 26% increase in purchase sales year-over-year with cards loan growth remained a challenge this quarter. With average card loans down 8% due to elevated payment rates. Slide 9 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. In the U.S., both NCL and delinquency rates remained favorable, driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs. Given the delinquency trends we are seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021 and the ultimate timing and level of losses as we look into next year will depend on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit. And as expected, credit losses and delinquency rates trended downward in both Mexico and Asia following a peak in the first quarter of 2021. So, overall we are seeing a rebound in activity along with a consumer who is in a very healthy financial position suggesting good momentum as we move into the back half of the year. Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other, revenues were down slightly in dollar terms as episodic gains this quarter were more than offset by previously disclosed one-time items in the prior year. Expenses were up slightly in dollar terms, mainly reflecting the impact of FX, and similar to last quarter, we have further allocated cost to the businesses related to investments in infrastructure risk and controls. As we mentioned previously, this change had no impact to EBIT at the Citi level, however, we have recast prior periods to enable better comparability of results. Credit costs declined year-over-year driven by a release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year. Finally, EBIT was breakeven this quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect a quarterly pretax loss in the range of $200 million to $300 million for the remainder of 2021. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends as well as non-interest revenues on a reported basis. We've also provided net interest revenues in constant dollars on Slide 19 in the appendix for comparison to prior periods. In the second-quarter, net interest revenue of $10.2 billion declined $880 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize as the extra day in the quarter was offset by lower cards revenues. Net interest margin declined three basis points, driven by lower cards NIR and modest growth in the balance sheet due to deposits, partially offset by the increase in markets NIR in the quarter. Turning to non-interest revenues on the bottom of the slide, in the second quarter, non-NIR declined $1.4 billion driven by normalization in fixed income markets. However, outside of markets, we did see strong broad-based fee growth of over $600 million across GCB and ICG. And for the past two quarters, we've seen these fee revenues return to pre-pandemic levels of roughly $4.4 billion per quarter pointing to a somewhat faster than expected recovery. Looking at these results, midway through the year, we are comfortable with our prior outlook and continue to expect total Citi revenues to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a full-year basis. Although the composition is likely to be somewhat different, which I will talk more about in a moment. On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics, which remain strong and stable again this quarter, allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 11.9% as net income was mostly offset by buybacks and dividends. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.9%, a decline from the prior quarter, largely driven by the expiration of the temporary SLR relief. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% to $77.87 driven by net income. Before we move on to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. On the topline for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits on a reported basis. But as I mentioned, the composition is likely to be somewhat different than we originally anticipated. Year-to-date, we've seen stronger than expected growth in non-interest revenues and we do expect the strength in fee growth to continue in the back half of the year, driven primarily by ICG. Meanwhile, for net interest revenues, we expect continued stabilization in the back half and we should start to see some loan growth by the end of the year. So, while net interest revenues are down roughly $2.2 billion year-to-date just outside our original outlook for the full year, assuming this base case holds, we do not expect a significant further decline in net interest revenues from here on a full year basis. So, again in aggregate for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits. On the expense side, based on our latest work on the strategic refresh, we've made the decision to further accelerate certain strategic investments in part in reaction to what is shaping up to be a faster than expected recovery. As a result, we now expect total Citigroup expenses to be up mid-single digits. These are strategic investments that we are making to strengthen our franchise and drive long-term growth. For example, we've accelerated investments where we believe there are significant opportunities for growth, including holistically across Wealth and the Commercial Bank. We've also doubled down on our existing strengths and businesses like TTS, Securities Services, and the Investment Banking business. Finally, given the faster recovery we are seeing today, we are accelerating investments in areas like cards marketing to capture this upside. All of these investments will have significant benefits over time. Meanwhile, expenses related directly to the transformation, which we had expected to drive the 2% to 3% increase in total Citi expenses this year, are coming in largely as expected. These investments include the work around the consent order as well as the broader work to modernize the bank, which will improve our risk and control environment as well as allow us to better meet the needs of our customers and clients through an improved operating environment, leading to faster decision-making, better efficiency, and improved client experience. And I'd point out that the mix of this spend is 30% technology and 70% non-tech related investments. Finally, this outlook includes the realization of productivity savings as a byproduct of the investments we've been making over the past few years. And to be clear, we will continue as we have done in the past to look for ways to operate as efficiently as possible during this investment period. And one additional note, we could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing. And as I've mentioned previously, we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials. So, in summary, we feel good about the investments that we're making and firmly believe these investments will position us well to close our return gap to peers over time. Before we get started with questions also want to take a moment to thank Liz Lynn for her time as the Head of Citi Investor Relations. Liz has been with the Citi IR team since 2013 and has led the Group since 2019. I know that she has built strong relationships with all of you and has been a key part of my team since I was named CFO, a little over two years ago. She will be moving on to be the Chief Financial Officer for our Investment Banking business. And as Liz mentioned, Jen Landis will be joining us in August as our new Head of Investor Relations. I hope you will all join me in congratulating Liz on her new role and welcoming Jen to Citi on our next earnings call. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your questions.\nJohn McDonald: Hi, good morning. Mark, thanks for the comments at the end there about the expense outlook and the revision to your outlook for this year. I was wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit more. You're not the only bank that's been kind of raising expense guidance. So, I was wondering how much of this might be inflationary to the cost of doing business as a big bank here, how much is Citi specific? And does the run rate that you're expecting to be on expenses in the back half of this year feel like that's the run rate you would go into next year with or are there things that are elevated this year? Thank you.\nMark Mason: Yes. Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. Look, I'll start by saying and repeating a little bit of what I said in my remarks, which is that we are taking a very deliberate decision on how we manage the franchise, right? And so what I spoke to was Jane and I, along with the leadership team, are going through a very thoughtful strategy refresh. And as we go through that we are identifying, particularly given the pace of the recovery, some real strategic opportunities to invest in the franchise. And we don't want to - we're not going to miss this window of opportunity. You've heard me mentioned that before. And it's in parts of the franchise that will undoubtedly grow and are high returning. So, when we talk about TTS, we talk about the Commercial Banking business, we talk about Wealth, those are businesses that have strong growth prospects and have returns that are north of 20% in a normal environment. And so, like I said, we're jumping at that. On the transformation side, I've been very clear and consistent that we expected that to drive the 3% - 2% to 3% increase year over year, that's coming in largely as expected and again the right thing to do, an important thing to do to modernize this bank. Inflation of course is going to be a factor, particularly as we look at labor and the competition for talent, but again that's - we deal with that on a regular basis, and we continue to look for productivity and efficiency savings that largely tend to offset that. In terms of 2022, I'm not going to give any guidance on that, but again this is, I think, an important period of time as we come out of this to ensure we're putting money to work in a smart fashion that prepares the firm for the future.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.\nJim Mitchell: Sorry, I was on mute there for a second. Good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nJim Mitchell: Maybe the first question - hey, good morning. Maybe first question on branded cards in North America. Average balances were pretty flat, but there's a little pressure on spread. Can you just maybe clear that up, is that just sort of greater teaser rate activity, or does that bounce back. How do we think about the revenue trajectory there and the spread compression we saw this quarter?\nMark Mason: Yes. So again the dynamic on cards revenues, branded cards in particular in North America, which were down 12% is largely driven by what we're seeing in the way of - in the way of loan balances. And if you look at average interest-earning balances, our average interest-earning balances for branded cards are down about 11%. Now, the good news is, as we've said, purchase sale activity is up meaningfully year-over-year and relative to the prior quarter, but it's really those payment rates are remaining quite high, quite elevated. The good news is that plays through in the form of a benefit as it relates to cost of credit, lower losses than expected, and now lower reserves as we see releases, but it's really that dynamic of payment rates high, lower loan volumes, average interest-earning in particular that is putting pressure on the top line.\nJim Mitchell: All right. That's helpful for the clarification on the transactor balances. And then maybe just more broadly on the Wealth business, you guys put out a press release saying you made some significant investments and new hires in Asia Wealth with a pretty substantial and aggressive target to grow headcount. Where do you stand on that build out? And are you making similar investments in other markets?\nJane Fraser: Yes, look, I think as we said, we're pretty excited about the wealth opportunity for us because we have all the different pieces to be successful here, the brand, the client relationships, the platform, the commercial banking franchise, and we are already a sizable player. We're number three in Asia, for example, where a lot of the growth is coming from. The opportunity for us is pulling all of the pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients. And so we've been investing in that platform, the technology, you'll have seen the announcement yesterday in the U.S. about a self-directed digital offering there. We've been expanding and growing talent in the front line as well, and very pleased as well with the investment product revenue growth, which is - where from a mix point of view, we see the greatest upside for us. So, early days in the execution of this, but I think pleasing progresses as we pull this together into this single integrated offering, invest behind it and you'll see the benefits in terms of growth as well as obviously return and revenue mix going forward for the bank.\nMark Mason: Yes. Jane, only thing I'd add to that, we are already seeing good performance in the quarter, right? So, Private Bank revenues up 4%; our continued strong growth in client assets up 26%, including AUMs that were up 29% and deposit strength, et cetera. And as Jane mentioned, even as we invest in strengthening the platform, we just announced yesterday that we were launching the self-directed investment digital offering, which again is targeted towards U.S. consumer and wealth management clients and so good progress while we invest and position ourselves to capture further opportunity here.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Hello, Betsy. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. And we will move to the next question in queue. Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning, Jane and Mark.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nKen Usdin: Wanted to ask you a little bit just on capital, when we got the SCB results, you had indicated a dividend of at least 51% and implied that you'd be buying back stock. But just wondering if you could help us just flush that out a little bit more in terms of how we should be thinking about the type of capital return or any increases that you might consider on the dividend from here and how to put that into context with prospective changes in the SCB and your minimums?\nMark Mason: Sure. But the first thing I'd say is that, as you can tell through the second quarter, we bought back as much as the regulatory rules would allow for in the way of the average four quarters of net income. And so we continue to be very excited about the prospect of continued capital return. As it relates to the SCB and the recent results, as you know, we have a target of approximately 11.5% from a CET1 ratio point of view. The target includes an estimate for the stress capital buffer that's somewhere between 2.5% and 3%, up until this recent set of results, the prior couple had been at the 2.5%. The 3% will go into effect at the end of the third quarter. And more importantly, we will actively manage the drivers that impact that Stress Capital Buffer. That is to say PPNR as well as the balance sheet risk-weighted assets and we intend to do so with an eye towards how we bring that Stress Capital Buffer back down. As we think about capital actions, as you know, with the SCB in place, we have the flexibility to take those decisions in a given quarter, in line with our - with the reg minimums and we intend to do that. Given where the stock trades, it makes a lot of sense for us to be buying back shares and so, we'll continue to skew towards that. And as of right now, our dividend is going to remain at 51%, but as I mentioned, we will continue to look at that quarter-to-quarter given the flexibility from the SCB.\nJane Fraser: And the only piece I'd add in is, as we are doing this work on the strategy and the plans going forward. Both Mark and I have a high degree of confidence around the capital generating capability of the franchise and look forward to returning excess capital to you over and above what we'll be doing to invest and close that return gap with our peers group.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMike O'Connor: I just wanted to follow up on the dividend commentary. I understand a preference to buyback stock and you are very explicit about wanting to do that below tangible books, that makes sense. But I guess just kind of signal to the market keeping a stable dividend. Is there, like a message there about the underlying earnings power or limited ability to increase the dividend. So, I would think you'd want to at least top it up by a couple of pennies just to signal a positive trend, if it doesn't take that much capital to do that. So, maybe you can elaborate a little bit on the dividend. Again, specifically on should we read into implied underlying earnings power, are there any limits on interest from dividend? Thank you.\nMark Mason: Yes. Let me be very clear. There is no underlying message there at all, right. It's, as I stated in terms of where the stock is trading and in making sense to do buybacks. Our dividend yield is quite comparable to that of peers that close to 3%. And so, and there is no constraint on our ability to take capital actions and we don't have any concerns about the earning power of the franchise. And in fact many of the areas as I mentioned earlier and as Jane has mentioned, we know are going to contribute to continued strength in our earnings power. So, well capitalized, we feel good about our earnings power and no concerns or no underlying message to the capital actions and direction of them that we spoke to and again, we have the flexibility given the stress capital buffer, as we go quarter to quarter to adjust as we sit see fit in the best interest of our investors.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Hello, Steven, your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Sorry, I was muted as well. My apologies. Mark, I was hoping to unpack just some of the NII guidance. I think there was just a little bit of confusion how it should be interpreted. So, it sounds like were down $2.2 billion year-to-date and that we - the full year, we shouldn't see any incremental declines from there. So, that would imply about a $10.5 billion NII run rate in the back half. I just wanted to make sure that's the right way to interpret the remarks.\nMark Mason: Yes. So look again. We do see kind of the NIR stabilizing and you see some of that particularly ex markets, but also in total on the page, again the guidance for total revenues unchanged at down 5% or mid - down mid-single digits, excuse me. You're right, as of the half, we're it down $2.2 billion as it relates to net interest revenues. Look the market's component of that can often be hard to predict, but what I'm suggesting is that any offset or any further pressure there will be offset likely in the fee momentum that we expect to see given the strength coming through this quarter.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: I do have a question for Jane and you Mark, the question has to do with how you're thinking about the importance of scale in the business refresh, I guess I could call it that you're doing. And Jane really, maybe you could help us understand how important scale is in what you're looking to execute here. I ask because many times I get questions from investors around what is - what is that you are doing on the pieces of the business that don't have as much scale as you know the stand-out areas like Global Search or Treasury services or Mexico?\nJane Fraser: Yes. First of all, scale is clearly very, very important here, particularly in a more digital world. And as you point out Betsy, TTS for example has - we're moving $4 trillion of volume a day around the world and we've got a number of franchises that have material scale and we expect them to be growing. And this is where the transformation program will be very helpful in ensuring the scalability of our platforms. We made the decision on Asia-Pac and EMEA to exit the 13 markets where we didn't believe that we would be able to achieve the scale needed to compete in those very local part of the business. So, that we can focus our firepower in those areas where either ensuring we retain a leading market position or in other areas where we want to be investing to attain the scale that we think is going to be needed going forward. U.S. consumer is an obvious example of that. So, I think as we will hear from us going forward more and more focus around what are our plans for those businesses for retaining the leading positions in this, aided by the transformation program or in the areas where we'll be investing to attain greater scale and as I say, U.S. consumer is the obvious one, there are pockets in Commercial Bank we're excited by Securities Services, one where we think it is very, very readily attainable particularly given our pre and post-trade capabilities. And part of that scale finally, it will come from the linkages between our businesses as we create more connectivity that will also provide us scale. So, collectively the different franchises we have will be competitively advantaged and not just individually strong.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please, proceed.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Just a quick follow-up, understand you're being deliberate in terms of strategy, leading up to I guess the Investor Day you mentioned next - first quarter next year. But as we think about just the investment spend and the expense outlook handicap, Mark, if you could the risk that we could see a little bit of expense creep as you dig further deeper into this, both in terms of your guidance for mid-single-digit expense growth this year and as we think about just the duration of that investment cycle over the next few years?\nMark Mason: Yes. Look, again, this is - this is something that we control, right? So, again, I want to reiterate that we are making very deliberate decisions around the opportunities that we see across the franchise and it's the right thing to do, right. So, we're going to continue to do that. In terms of kind of risk to it, I don't think there are any surprises here, right. So, if revenues come in meaningfully different, there is a certain component of our expense base that's tied to revenues and so that would obviously move around, but aside from those volume-related expenses, transaction, compensation, et cetera, you should expect what I've guided towards, in terms of the very deliberate decisions to put the money to work in this fashion and we're going to continue to do that. If we see more investment opportunities in '21 or 2022, we're going to go after them. Because again, we know that we can deliver on the benefits and the returns that are associated with putting that money to work.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Mark, you said something interesting about the investment banking business revenues. I think you said that they were 39% or 38% higher than 2019 or lower. I don't - or higher, I'm checking my notes here. So, your business is still nicely above the 2019 levels and we came through period, up until the pandemic that you're well aware of that. It was somewhat challenging, the growth in this investment banking and trading businesses. As you look forward, when you talk to your people in Investment Banking and in Global Markets, why do they see this, because there seems to be an elevated amount of business due to what we just came through in the last 18 months. Do they think it's sustainable or do we get back to 2019? What are those guys telling you about the next 12 to 24 months in those businesses?\nMark Mason: Yes. I'd start by saying we continue to have very, very good dialog with our clients across the franchise and specifically in Investment Banking. And if you think about it, many businesses, many companies across industries are really having to take a look at their business model. And think about how they want to transform their businesses coming out of this pandemic. Everything from how to think about digitization, how to think about going direct to consumers, what the pandemic means for supply chains, how people work remotely, how they manage their liquidity levels, what to do with that excess liquidity, should they be buying or what and so we're part of that dialogue which is incredibly representative, I think, it represents strongly the franchise that we have. The general view from our clients is optimistic in terms of the go-forward environment. Yes, there are some things to kind of manage too, but there is a general level of optimism. And so what I represented relative to '19 is, while we are seeing normalization, we're normalizing at a higher level than where we ended in 2019 and we'd expect continued momentum and we'd expect to take - continue to take share over time. Jane, anything you want to add to that?\nJane Fraser: Yes. Mark, I think you covered it very well. There is a high level of client engagement with us at the moment, really around the world and a lot of demand we are seeing in addition to the investment banking side, the shift to e-commerce with clients needing our TTS services or cross-border flows that we are seeing this translating into demand in trade starting to tick up nicely. The commercial banking side is another area that we're seeing a lot of new demand coming through from clients, both from strategic activity with our investment bank as well as their own expansion globally that we are supporting them through our Treasury Services and the like. So, I think there is a general sense of optimism. We have a fabulous pipeline, one never wants to jinx these things, but we really have a fabulous pipeline heading into the second half of the year around the world and it does give you a good sense of confidence of continued momentum.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: I'm going to ask my question here and then re-queue. The real question is just on capital. I mean, you're not blind to the fact that your tangible book value is $78 and your stock price of $68. So, we should probably be selling your desk chairs and you're silverware, and anything you can to buyback your stock, I would think. So, along those lines, the first question is when you're looking the sales of assets in 13 consumer markets, do you expect to have a gain on those or loss on those relative to where they are marked currently?\nMark Mason: Yes, so, look. I think I'd tell you Mike that we, as Jane mentioned, we've seen strong interest from buyers as it relates to those assets. And there's no surprise, just given we think those are good businesses just not of scale, as Jane mentioned, for us. We've got to run that process through and see what that result in, and I'll continue to be transparent with you as to where gains and losses or how it flows through our financials. But I'm not going to sit here and tell you whether it's gains or losses or what it means specifically for those 13 markets. What I will tell you is that as capital is freed up from those transactions, we'll continue to make very deliberate decisions around what to do with that capital. First looking at growth opportunities that can deliver returns above our cost of capital and then looking towards how we can return as much of it to shareholders as it makes sense in the form of buybacks, dividends et cetera. And we've been disciplined about that to date, and we're going to continue to be disciplined about that.\nMike Mayo: So, to clarify, if I got this right, your CET1 ratio was 11.9 and your return on capital above 11.5. So if you were to quantify the dollar amount of that, how much would that mean in potential buybacks at this point and then I assume that would not include any capital freed up from any sales. So, you could have potential buyback of a lot of stock if you were willing and able, is that correct?\nMark Mason: A little bit over $4 billion of excess capital between the 11.5 and the 11.9 and so that's what that equates to.\nOperator: Your next and final question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nVivek Juneja: Mark, any comments on promotional trends that you're seeing and card pricing given everybody is back focusing on the business you mentioned marketing spend, but can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in promotional pricing in that?\nMark Mason: Yes. I guess, what I'd say is simply that as expenses would suggest and as we stated, we are lagging back into bringing on new card customers. And so - and what we're seeing is that our acquisitions are largely at pre-COVID, pre-crisis, or pre-pandemic levels and frankly, we're seeing normal behaviors as those card customers come on and has always been the case, it is going to be a mix in terms of the acquisition strategy, but thus far, we're seeing normal behaviors, if you will. And look, the new account acquisitions skew towards branded cards and they are in products that are less reliant on the 0% offers and products like Flex Pay and Flex Loan, which will generate interest immediately as those balances grow.\nOperator: We do have one more question in queue from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: An unrelated question. Just, Jane, as you think about the technology approach doing it yourself through Citigroup and pairing up with partners, what's the status of the relationship with Google and Google Plex and your desire to use third parties to gather new customers at lower initial cost that maybe not as much lifetime value. If you think of that trade-off, what's your current thinking today and we haven't heard much about the Google relationship despite some initial headlines. Thanks.\nJane Fraser: Yes. Hey there, Mike. Excellent question. The part the partnership with big tech is an important part of our disruptive strategy in the U.S. as we are looking at both, how do we enhance value propositions to customers, the customer base itself and then these new ecosystems that are evolving. And I think there's no question that COVID has accelerated the embedded finance model in the U.S., just think of the travel ecosystem, think of home improvement ecosystems and the benefit we've got is that for us, it's not a new space to us. We've been very much engaged with partners in Asia, Grab, Paytm and We Bank as well as our traditional partners. What we find with these partnerships is that we learn a lot, because it is still early days in the development of these new ecosystems. We learn a lot about marketing, about user experiences around the tech stacks. It certainly enables us to tap into next generation customer bases, but also importantly it goes beyond consumer and so if we look on the corporate side, our partnership with Stripe, the work that we're doing in TTS with Project Spring of enabling payments around is a core piece, particularly as wholesale and retail, kind of collapses some of these payment chains into one. So, with the Google Plex and several other tech partnerships that we have in the States and elsewhere in the world, we are very deliberately going about creating a broad suite of APIs and partner integration capabilities. So that we're able to integrate other partners into our offerings, develop more innovative solutions without necessarily having to build it or buy it all ourselves and Citi plex with Google is an example of that. We are actively testing features with our own employees at the moment. We'll be finalizing dates, we'll share with that - we'll share that with you when available. But it's one of many different partnerships that we have and an important partner for us, but far from the only one here in the States to help us disrupt and grow going forward.\nOperator: We do have a follow-up question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja: But, I have a second question and that's on capital. Given that you're headed towards a higher GSIB bucket, Mark, Jane, what you're all thinking in terms of that in terms of not just capital targets, anything you can do about that, because I know that's a year or a little over a year away from going into effect, but obviously you're thinking about target capital, we'll have to keep in mind, what's coming down the pipe for you?\nMark Mason: Sure. And look, as you, as you know, with all of the liquidity in the market, many of us have seen pressure on our GSIB score. That certainly has been the case for us and it wouldn't go into effect, the higher GSIB score of 3.5% until the beginning of 2023. And we look at the entire capital stack holistically, the 11.5% target in our case, which is well above reg minimums, but certainly does consider that - consider that and there are elements of that, as I mentioned earlier, that we can influence and control. So, the stress capital buffer is part of that and I talked earlier about our ability to influence those levers without having full understanding of the Fed models, we know we can influence PPNR, we know we can influence the balance sheet and how it gets allocated and ultimately what stress losses come out of it. And so we will continue to manage that. We will still have a buffer obviously even with a higher GSIB score. And as you know, regulators continue to talk about capital as being at about the right levels in the system. And they will continue to look at drivers that influence the stack as well including GSIB and balance sheet size et cetera and we'll see how that evolves. But again, we feel good about where we are. We are well-capitalized, we have a good sense for the drivers going forward that will create capital capacity for us and we intend to again invest that where it makes sense and return that otherwise to our shareholders.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Elizabeth Lynn for closing remarks.\nElizabeth Lynn: Thank you all for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to us in IR with any follow-up questions, thank you again and have a nice day.\nOperator: This concludes the Citi's second quarter 2021 earnings review. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz, and good morning to everyone. I am delighted to join you again today. And first, I'm going to discuss the results of my first full quarter as CEO and then update you on the progress against our strategic priorities. For the quarter, we reported $6.2 billion in net income or $2.85 per share. We continue to benefit from an improving macro environment as evidenced by another significant release of our allowances for credit losses. Indeed, the pace of the macro recovery is exceeding earlier expectations across the globe, and with it comes growing consumer and corporate confidence. And this also came through loud and clear in my conversations with clients over the course of the week I just spent in London. Now clearly, we have to remain mindful of the unevenness in that global recovery due to continued contagion and challenges in vaccine distribution in several parts of the world, but we are optimistic about the momentum ahead and as a result, we deliberately accelerated some of our investments. In our institutional businesses, we saw the expected normalization of fixed income trading compared to the striking volatility of Q2 last year and our equities franchise had a particularly strong quarter. Looking forward, we do expect the volatile markets to be higher than pre-COVID levels. Performance in our Investment Banking franchise remained healthy with good momentum in M&A and a very solid pipeline ahead for the rest of the year. We saw very good progress in our strategies to increase fee revenues with double-digit growth in our ICG fee revenues and specifically over 20% year-over-year fee growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions and Securities Services, and in the private bank. Now, TTS is the backbone of the unique global network we deliver for our clients. And while the business continues to be impacted by lower rates, we particularly like how we are positioned here from a market share perspective as the post-pandemic recovery takes shape. In Consumer Banking, while our loan book and revenues were impacted by the elevated payment rates in cards, spending is well above pre-COVID levels now with a 38% increase in global purchase sales year-over-year. We expect this to translate into loan growth in the second half of the year. And we continue to have good momentum in both deposit growth and AUMs across our consumer franchises. In the U.S., as we discussed, we are investing in our home market as demonstrated by the well-received launch of our innovative Custom Cash Card in June. Internationally, the picture for our consumer business is the budget. So, while there is still the softness in the Mexican economy, in Asia, loan growth returned and that's despite new COVID outbreaks. Turning to capital. For the first two quarters of 2021, we returned close to $7 billion to our shareholders, which was the maximum amount permitted under the Federal Reserve's rules. Going forward, we are committed to returning any excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise. So, while our stress capital buffer increased to 3% as a result of the Fed's recent stress test, that won't impact the common equity Tier 1 target we would be managing to, of approximately 11.5%. We ended the quarter at 11.9% on a standardized basis and have excess capital to return to our shareholders through a healthy dividend and ongoing stock repurchase program. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $77.87, up over 9% from a year ago. Now let's turn to three of our strategic priorities: Strategy, Transformation, and Talent. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy refresh. We have moved swiftly to begin the sales process for the 13 consumer markets we plan to exit in Asia and EMEA. The first round of bids was very encouraging and competitive, which isn't a surprise because these are terrific businesses for the right owners. In those regions, we are off to a running start in our wealth strategy. We are making significant strategic investments in product capabilities, technology, and talent and have already seen this in increased client acquisition. We continue to do thorough and vigorous work to refresh our strategy across our consumer and institutional businesses guided by the four principles I outlined to you earlier in the year, being clinical, being focused and ensuring both connectivity and simplification. Our overarching goal is to increase the returns we generate and close the gap with our peers by investing in the franchises that will drive the most growth, the three most notable of which are TTS, wealth, and commercial banking. And I'm very confident in the growth and return prospects these connected franchises will afford us. As we have done so far, we will share our decisions with you as we make them on the strategy and we are also looking forward to presenting our plans to you more comprehensively during an Investor Day, which we intend to hold in the first quarter of next year. We're going to put our entire vision for the firm in front of view. So, you can then hold us accountable for executing against it. As we discussed in the call last quarter, we are also working very hard and diligently on our transformation. This is a significant, it's also an exciting body of work and we're working closely with our regulators to meet their expectations and we intend to submit our plans to them this quarter. Now, while addressing the consent orders is an intense focus of the transformation, our work here goes well beyond the orders themselves. We've set out to modernize our bank. We want to achieve nothing less than excellence and this means investing in our risk and control environment, but also in the infrastructure we need to serve our clients in an increasingly digital world. So, let me give you an example in TTS. These investments will improve the scalability of our platform, automation will drive efficiency and client experience, and investments in data will enhance revenues and the investments we're making will help position us to retain our leading position as the preeminent global corporate bank. And that leads me finally to talent, where we have made material progress over the last few months. I'm delighted with the caliber of talent we have been attracting to the firm to grow our businesses and support our transformation. We've enhanced our existing ranks with best-in-market hires in data, risk, strategy and controls, as well as in the front lines of wealth, the commercial bank, and BCMA, in particular. We continue to invest in a culture of excellence and our own people, providing them with new leadership and growth opportunities. And it's this combination of new perspective and our existing high-caliber talent pool that will enable us to take the firm forward with excellence, urgency, and accountability. Now, before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to thank Liz Lynn for her great work leading our Investor Relation efforts over the past several years. And as you know, and as she mentioned, she is going to be our Finance Lead for BCMA where we all know she is going to do a wonderful job. With that, Mark will go through our presentation. And then we'll both be happy to take your questions. Yes, look, I think as we said, we're pretty excited about the wealth opportunity for us because we have all the different pieces to be successful here, the brand, the client relationships, the platform, the commercial banking franchise, and we are already a sizable player. We're number three in Asia, for example, where a lot of the growth is coming from. The opportunity for us is pulling all of the pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients. And so we've been investing in that platform, the technology, you'll have seen the announcement yesterday in the U.S. about a self-directed digital offering there. We've been expanding and growing talent in the front line as well, and very pleased as well with the investment product revenue growth, which is - where from a mix point of view, we see the greatest upside for us. So, early days in the execution of this, but I think pleasing progresses as we pull this together into this single integrated offering, invest behind it and you'll see the benefits in terms of growth as well as obviously return and revenue mix going forward for the bank. And the only piece I'd add in is, as we are doing this work on the strategy and the plans going forward. Both Mark and I have a high degree of confidence around the capital generating capability of the franchise and look forward to returning excess capital to you over and above what we'll be doing to invest and close that return gap with our peers group. Yes. First of all, scale is clearly very, very important here, particularly in a more digital world. And as you point out Betsy, TTS for example has - we're moving $4 trillion of volume a day around the world and we've got a number of franchises that have material scale and we expect them to be growing. And this is where the transformation program will be very helpful in ensuring the scalability of our platforms. We made the decision on Asia-Pac and EMEA to exit the 13 markets where we didn't believe that we would be able to achieve the scale needed to compete in those very local part of the business. So, that we can focus our firepower in those areas where either ensuring we retain a leading market position or in other areas where we want to be investing to attain the scale that we think is going to be needed going forward. U.S. consumer is an obvious example of that. So, I think as we will hear from us going forward more and more focus around what are our plans for those businesses for retaining the leading positions in this, aided by the transformation program or in the areas where we'll be investing to attain greater scale and as I say, U.S. consumer is the obvious one, there are pockets in Commercial Bank we're excited by Securities Services, one where we think it is very, very readily attainable particularly given our pre and post-trade capabilities. And part of that scale finally, it will come from the linkages between our businesses as we create more connectivity that will also provide us scale. So, collectively the different franchises we have will be competitively advantaged and not just individually strong. Yes. Mark, I think you covered it very well. There is a high level of client engagement with us at the moment, really around the world and a lot of demand we are seeing in addition to the investment banking side, the shift to e-commerce with clients needing our TTS services or cross-border flows that we are seeing this translating into demand in trade starting to tick up nicely. The commercial banking side is another area that we're seeing a lot of new demand coming through from clients, both from strategic activity with our investment bank as well as their own expansion globally that we are supporting them through our Treasury Services and the like. So, I think there is a general sense of optimism. We have a fabulous pipeline, one never wants to jinx these things, but we really have a fabulous pipeline heading into the second half of the year around the world and it does give you a good sense of confidence of continued momentum. Yes. Hey there, Mike. Excellent question. The part the partnership with big tech is an important part of our disruptive strategy in the U.S. as we are looking at both, how do we enhance value propositions to customers, the customer base itself and then these new ecosystems that are evolving. And I think there's no question that COVID has accelerated the embedded finance model in the U.S., just think of the travel ecosystem, think of home improvement ecosystems and the benefit we've got is that for us, it's not a new space to us. We've been very much engaged with partners in Asia, Grab, Paytm and We Bank as well as our traditional partners. What we find with these partnerships is that we learn a lot, because it is still early days in the development of these new ecosystems. We learn a lot about marketing, about user experiences around the tech stacks. It certainly enables us to tap into next generation customer bases, but also importantly it goes beyond consumer and so if we look on the corporate side, our partnership with Stripe, the work that we're doing in TTS with Project Spring of enabling payments around is a core piece, particularly as wholesale and retail, kind of collapses some of these payment chains into one. So, with the Google Plex and several other tech partnerships that we have in the States and elsewhere in the world, we are very deliberately going about creating a broad suite of APIs and partner integration capabilities. So that we're able to integrate other partners into our offerings, develop more innovative solutions without necessarily having to build it or buy it all ourselves and Citi plex with Google is an example of that. We are actively testing features with our own employees at the moment. We'll be finalizing dates, we'll share with that - we'll share that with you when available. But it's one of many different partnerships that we have and an important partner for us, but far from the only one here in the States to help us disrupt and grow going forward."

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3, Citigroup reported second-quarter net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $2.85, and a 15.2% RoTCE. Revenues declined 12% from the prior year, reflecting a normalization in fixed income markets along with lower card loans in consumer as well as the impact of lower interest rates. Expenses were up 7% year-over-year, in constant dollars expenses were up 4% reflecting a normalization relative to the low print last year along with continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Credit performance remained strong with net credit losses of $1.3 billion more than offset by an ACL release of $2.4 billion, reflecting portfolio improvements as well as the continued improvement in our macroeconomic outlook. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher repayment rates across institutional and consumer. Although, I would note that we are starting to see some pockets of loan growth emerge and for the first time in over a year loans were up sequentially. Deposits grew modestly up 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients. Looking at the first half of 2021, total revenues declined 9% year-over-year, and 10% in constant dollars mainly driven by the normalization in fixed income markets and lower card balances in consumer, although we did see strong fee revenue growth across consumer and in ICG excluding fixed income markets. Total expenses were up 6% on a reported basis and 3% in constant dollars midway through the year. I'll talk more about our outlook for the remainder of the year in a moment. Cost of credit was a benefit of roughly $3 billion as we released over $6 billion in reserves and we delivered roughly $14 billion in net income and in RoTCE of 17.6%. Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $7 billion in capital so far this year. And we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise as well as returning any excess capital to shareholders given the flexibility provided by the SCB framework. Turning now to each business. Slide 4 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. For the quarter ICG delivered EBIT of $4.9 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues decreased 14% driven mainly by the decline in fixed income markets, expenses increased 4% and were up 2% in constant dollars as investments in transformation along with other strategic investments were mostly offset by lower incentive compensation and efficiency savings. Credit costs were down considerably given a roughly $900 million ACL release as well as lower net credit losses. And ICG delivered a 16.4% return on allocated capital. Slide 5 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Product revenues were down 17% in the second quarter, primarily reflecting a comparison to a strong prior-year period, particularly in fixed income markets. However, we are continuing to see robust client engagement and strong underlying growth in our fee businesses across the franchise including TTS, Investment Banking, Securities Services, Commercial Banking, and the Private Bank. And excluding the markets related component non-interest revenues were up 24% this quarter and we are confident in our outlook for continued strong fee growth in the back half of the year. Looking at the results in greater detail, on the Banking side, revenues decreased 1%. In Treasury and Trade Solutions significant growth in fee revenues of roughly 25%, reflecting solid client engagement as well as growth in trade, were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates with revenues down 1%. We're continuing to see momentum across our Payments Business with 13% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearing volumes over the past year as well as the early days of a recovery in commercial cards. And as of the end of the quarter, TTS loans grew roughly 5% reflecting increasing client demand and improving macroeconomic conditions. Investment banking revenues were up 1% as higher M&A and equity underwriting revenues were largely offset by a decline in debt underwriting. While the overall DCM wallet was up in the second quarter, all the growth was in non-investment grade which did not benefit our results given our SKU to investment grade. But, looking at results versus a more normal year revenues were up 38% versus the second quarter of 2019 with strong growth across all products. Private Bank revenues grew 4% driven by higher fees and lending volumes reflecting momentum with both new and existing clients, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Corporate Lending revenues were down 15% primarily driven by lower volumes. Total markets and securities services revenues decreased 30% from last year. Fixed Income revenues decreased 43% reflecting a comparison to a strong prior-year period in both rates and spread products. However, we remained engaged with our clients with steady growth in both corporate and investor client revenues relative to the historical average. Equities revenues were up 37% versus last year, primarily driven by good performance in both derivatives and prime finance reflecting robust client activity and favorable market conditions. In securities services, revenues were up 9% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Here we saw strong growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients driven by growth in assets under custody and settlement volumes partially offset by lower spreads. Finally, looking at first-half results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from Investment Banking as well as good results in the Private Bank and Securities Services which helped to offset the expected normalization in fixed income markets. I would also note that equity markets revenues are up over 30%. Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 6. For the quarter, GCB delivered EBIT of $2.4 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues declined 10% as continued strong deposit growth albeit with lower spreads and momentum in Investment Management were more than offset by lower card balances across all three regions. In cards, while we are encouraged by the continued improvement in consumer spending with purchase sales up close to 40% versus last year and almost 20% versus last quarter, we are still seeing the impact of high-payment rates on revenues. Expenses increased 7%, reflecting continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments along with an acceleration in marketing and higher volume-related costs from the low point a year ago, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit remains healthy and credit costs decreased significantly, driven by the $1.4 billion ACL reserve release and lower net credit losses. And GCB delivered a 20.8% return on allocated capital. Finally, looking at results for the first half of the year, we've seen steady improvement in our drivers, which gives us confidence in our outlook as we move into the back half of the year. Slide 7, shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. Second-quarter revenues were down 11% from last year, primarily driven by lower cards revenues but better than the 15% decline last quarter on a year-over-year basis. Revenues declined in both branded cards and retail services by 12% and 14% respectively, reflecting continued headwinds from higher payment rates as consumers have continued to use liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt, driving lower loans and a shift in mix towards transactor balances. This is creating pressure on our net interest revenues, but it's also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends. However, we are continuing to see a recovery in sales activity with purchase sales now above pre-pandemic levels led by discretionary spend including travel and dining. In Branded Cards, total purchase sales were up 40% versus last year and importantly, up 11% versus the second quarter of 2019. And in Retail Services, purchase sales also grew versus both second quarter 2019 and 2020. So, the good news is that we're continuing to see the recovery in spend and we're also returning to pre-COVID acquisition levels. Looking ahead, we expect the growth in purchase sales to translate into loan growth by the end of the year as stimulus moderates and consumers return to more normal payment patterns. Turning to Retail Banking, revenues were down 7% year-over-year, reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads and lower mortgage revenues. That said, we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen our retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships. Average deposits were up 18% including 24% growth in checking and the number of Citigold households increased by 16% contributing to a 23% increase in AUMs. On slide 8, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year-over-year in the second quarter with an 11% decline in Latin America and a 3% decline in Asia. Looking at International Consumer overall, we are seeing good momentum in Investment Management with 15% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia and the numbers are meaningfully higher, if you look specifically at the four international wealth hubs. Average deposit growth remained strong at 8% albeit at lower deposit spreads. And similar to the U.S., we saw a 26% increase in purchase sales year-over-year with cards loan growth remained a challenge this quarter. With average card loans down 8% due to elevated payment rates. Slide 9 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. In the U.S., both NCL and delinquency rates remained favorable, driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs. Given the delinquency trends we are seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021 and the ultimate timing and level of losses as we look into next year will depend on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit. And as expected, credit losses and delinquency rates trended downward in both Mexico and Asia following a peak in the first quarter of 2021. So, overall we are seeing a rebound in activity along with a consumer who is in a very healthy financial position suggesting good momentum as we move into the back half of the year. Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other, revenues were down slightly in dollar terms as episodic gains this quarter were more than offset by previously disclosed one-time items in the prior year. Expenses were up slightly in dollar terms, mainly reflecting the impact of FX, and similar to last quarter, we have further allocated cost to the businesses related to investments in infrastructure risk and controls. As we mentioned previously, this change had no impact to EBIT at the Citi level, however, we have recast prior periods to enable better comparability of results. Credit costs declined year-over-year driven by a release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year. Finally, EBIT was breakeven this quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect a quarterly pretax loss in the range of $200 million to $300 million for the remainder of 2021. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends as well as non-interest revenues on a reported basis. We've also provided net interest revenues in constant dollars on Slide 19 in the appendix for comparison to prior periods. In the second-quarter, net interest revenue of $10.2 billion declined $880 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize as the extra day in the quarter was offset by lower cards revenues. Net interest margin declined three basis points, driven by lower cards NIR and modest growth in the balance sheet due to deposits, partially offset by the increase in markets NIR in the quarter. Turning to non-interest revenues on the bottom of the slide, in the second quarter, non-NIR declined $1.4 billion driven by normalization in fixed income markets. However, outside of markets, we did see strong broad-based fee growth of over $600 million across GCB and ICG. And for the past two quarters, we've seen these fee revenues return to pre-pandemic levels of roughly $4.4 billion per quarter pointing to a somewhat faster than expected recovery. Looking at these results, midway through the year, we are comfortable with our prior outlook and continue to expect total Citi revenues to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a full-year basis. Although the composition is likely to be somewhat different, which I will talk more about in a moment. On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics, which remain strong and stable again this quarter, allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 11.9% as net income was mostly offset by buybacks and dividends. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.9%, a decline from the prior quarter, largely driven by the expiration of the temporary SLR relief. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% to $77.87 driven by net income. Before we move on to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. On the topline for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits on a reported basis. But as I mentioned, the composition is likely to be somewhat different than we originally anticipated. Year-to-date, we've seen stronger than expected growth in non-interest revenues and we do expect the strength in fee growth to continue in the back half of the year, driven primarily by ICG. Meanwhile, for net interest revenues, we expect continued stabilization in the back half and we should start to see some loan growth by the end of the year. So, while net interest revenues are down roughly $2.2 billion year-to-date just outside our original outlook for the full year, assuming this base case holds, we do not expect a significant further decline in net interest revenues from here on a full year basis. So, again in aggregate for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits. On the expense side, based on our latest work on the strategic refresh, we've made the decision to further accelerate certain strategic investments in part in reaction to what is shaping up to be a faster than expected recovery. As a result, we now expect total Citigroup expenses to be up mid-single digits. These are strategic investments that we are making to strengthen our franchise and drive long-term growth. For example, we've accelerated investments where we believe there are significant opportunities for growth, including holistically across Wealth and the Commercial Bank. We've also doubled down on our existing strengths and businesses like TTS, Securities Services, and the Investment Banking business. Finally, given the faster recovery we are seeing today, we are accelerating investments in areas like cards marketing to capture this upside. All of these investments will have significant benefits over time. Meanwhile, expenses related directly to the transformation, which we had expected to drive the 2% to 3% increase in total Citi expenses this year, are coming in largely as expected. These investments include the work around the consent order as well as the broader work to modernize the bank, which will improve our risk and control environment as well as allow us to better meet the needs of our customers and clients through an improved operating environment, leading to faster decision-making, better efficiency, and improved client experience. And I'd point out that the mix of this spend is 30% technology and 70% non-tech related investments. Finally, this outlook includes the realization of productivity savings as a byproduct of the investments we've been making over the past few years. And to be clear, we will continue as we have done in the past to look for ways to operate as efficiently as possible during this investment period. And one additional note, we could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing. And as I've mentioned previously, we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials. So, in summary, we feel good about the investments that we're making and firmly believe these investments will position us well to close our return gap to peers over time. Before we get started with questions also want to take a moment to thank Liz Lynn for her time as the Head of Citi Investor Relations. Liz has been with the Citi IR team since 2013 and has led the Group since 2019. I know that she has built strong relationships with all of you and has been a key part of my team since I was named CFO, a little over two years ago. She will be moving on to be the Chief Financial Officer for our Investment Banking business. And as Liz mentioned, Jen Landis will be joining us in August as our new Head of Investor Relations. I hope you will all join me in congratulating Liz on her new role and welcoming Jen to Citi on our next earnings call. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Yes. Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. Look, I'll start by saying and repeating a little bit of what I said in my remarks, which is that we are taking a very deliberate decision on how we manage the franchise, right? And so what I spoke to was Jane and I, along with the leadership team, are going through a very thoughtful strategy refresh. And as we go through that we are identifying, particularly given the pace of the recovery, some real strategic opportunities to invest in the franchise. And we don't want to - we're not going to miss this window of opportunity. You've heard me mentioned that before. And it's in parts of the franchise that will undoubtedly grow and are high returning. So, when we talk about TTS, we talk about the Commercial Banking business, we talk about Wealth, those are businesses that have strong growth prospects and have returns that are north of 20% in a normal environment. And so, like I said, we're jumping at that. On the transformation side, I've been very clear and consistent that we expected that to drive the 3% - 2% to 3% increase year over year, that's coming in largely as expected and again the right thing to do, an important thing to do to modernize this bank. Inflation of course is going to be a factor, particularly as we look at labor and the competition for talent, but again that's - we deal with that on a regular basis, and we continue to look for productivity and efficiency savings that largely tend to offset that. In terms of 2022, I'm not going to give any guidance on that, but again this is, I think, an important period of time as we come out of this to ensure we're putting money to work in a smart fashion that prepares the firm for the future. Good morning. Yes. So again the dynamic on cards revenues, branded cards in particular in North America, which were down 12% is largely driven by what we're seeing in the way of - in the way of loan balances. And if you look at average interest-earning balances, our average interest-earning balances for branded cards are down about 11%. Now, the good news is, as we've said, purchase sale activity is up meaningfully year-over-year and relative to the prior quarter, but it's really those payment rates are remaining quite high, quite elevated. The good news is that plays through in the form of a benefit as it relates to cost of credit, lower losses than expected, and now lower reserves as we see releases, but it's really that dynamic of payment rates high, lower loan volumes, average interest-earning in particular that is putting pressure on the top line. Yes. Jane, only thing I'd add to that, we are already seeing good performance in the quarter, right? So, Private Bank revenues up 4%; our continued strong growth in client assets up 26%, including AUMs that were up 29% and deposit strength, et cetera. And as Jane mentioned, even as we invest in strengthening the platform, we just announced yesterday that we were launching the self-directed investment digital offering, which again is targeted towards U.S. consumer and wealth management clients and so good progress while we invest and position ourselves to capture further opportunity here. Good morning. Sure. But the first thing I'd say is that, as you can tell through the second quarter, we bought back as much as the regulatory rules would allow for in the way of the average four quarters of net income. And so we continue to be very excited about the prospect of continued capital return. As it relates to the SCB and the recent results, as you know, we have a target of approximately 11.5% from a CET1 ratio point of view. The target includes an estimate for the stress capital buffer that's somewhere between 2.5% and 3%, up until this recent set of results, the prior couple had been at the 2.5%. The 3% will go into effect at the end of the third quarter. And more importantly, we will actively manage the drivers that impact that Stress Capital Buffer. That is to say PPNR as well as the balance sheet risk-weighted assets and we intend to do so with an eye towards how we bring that Stress Capital Buffer back down. As we think about capital actions, as you know, with the SCB in place, we have the flexibility to take those decisions in a given quarter, in line with our - with the reg minimums and we intend to do that. Given where the stock trades, it makes a lot of sense for us to be buying back shares and so, we'll continue to skew towards that. And as of right now, our dividend is going to remain at 51%, but as I mentioned, we will continue to look at that quarter-to-quarter given the flexibility from the SCB. Yes. Let me be very clear. There is no underlying message there at all, right. It's, as I stated in terms of where the stock is trading and in making sense to do buybacks. Our dividend yield is quite comparable to that of peers that close to 3%. And so, and there is no constraint on our ability to take capital actions and we don't have any concerns about the earning power of the franchise. And in fact many of the areas as I mentioned earlier and as Jane has mentioned, we know are going to contribute to continued strength in our earnings power. So, well capitalized, we feel good about our earnings power and no concerns or no underlying message to the capital actions and direction of them that we spoke to and again, we have the flexibility given the stress capital buffer, as we go quarter to quarter to adjust as we sit see fit in the best interest of our investors. Yes. So look again. We do see kind of the NIR stabilizing and you see some of that particularly ex markets, but also in total on the page, again the guidance for total revenues unchanged at down 5% or mid - down mid-single digits, excuse me. You're right, as of the half, we're it down $2.2 billion as it relates to net interest revenues. Look the market's component of that can often be hard to predict, but what I'm suggesting is that any offset or any further pressure there will be offset likely in the fee momentum that we expect to see given the strength coming through this quarter. Yes. Look, again, this is - this is something that we control, right? So, again, I want to reiterate that we are making very deliberate decisions around the opportunities that we see across the franchise and it's the right thing to do, right. So, we're going to continue to do that. In terms of kind of risk to it, I don't think there are any surprises here, right. So, if revenues come in meaningfully different, there is a certain component of our expense base that's tied to revenues and so that would obviously move around, but aside from those volume-related expenses, transaction, compensation, et cetera, you should expect what I've guided towards, in terms of the very deliberate decisions to put the money to work in this fashion and we're going to continue to do that. If we see more investment opportunities in '21 or 2022, we're going to go after them. Because again, we know that we can deliver on the benefits and the returns that are associated with putting that money to work. Yes. I'd start by saying we continue to have very, very good dialog with our clients across the franchise and specifically in Investment Banking. And if you think about it, many businesses, many companies across industries are really having to take a look at their business model. And think about how they want to transform their businesses coming out of this pandemic. Everything from how to think about digitization, how to think about going direct to consumers, what the pandemic means for supply chains, how people work remotely, how they manage their liquidity levels, what to do with that excess liquidity, should they be buying or what and so we're part of that dialogue which is incredibly representative, I think, it represents strongly the franchise that we have. The general view from our clients is optimistic in terms of the go-forward environment. Yes, there are some things to kind of manage too, but there is a general level of optimism. And so what I represented relative to '19 is, while we are seeing normalization, we're normalizing at a higher level than where we ended in 2019 and we'd expect continued momentum and we'd expect to take - continue to take share over time. Jane, anything you want to add to that? Yes, so, look. I think I'd tell you Mike that we, as Jane mentioned, we've seen strong interest from buyers as it relates to those assets. And there's no surprise, just given we think those are good businesses just not of scale, as Jane mentioned, for us. We've got to run that process through and see what that result in, and I'll continue to be transparent with you as to where gains and losses or how it flows through our financials. But I'm not going to sit here and tell you whether it's gains or losses or what it means specifically for those 13 markets. What I will tell you is that as capital is freed up from those transactions, we'll continue to make very deliberate decisions around what to do with that capital. First looking at growth opportunities that can deliver returns above our cost of capital and then looking towards how we can return as much of it to shareholders as it makes sense in the form of buybacks, dividends et cetera. And we've been disciplined about that to date, and we're going to continue to be disciplined about that. A little bit over $4 billion of excess capital between the 11.5 and the 11.9 and so that's what that equates to. Yes. I guess, what I'd say is simply that as expenses would suggest and as we stated, we are lagging back into bringing on new card customers. And so - and what we're seeing is that our acquisitions are largely at pre-COVID, pre-crisis, or pre-pandemic levels and frankly, we're seeing normal behaviors as those card customers come on and has always been the case, it is going to be a mix in terms of the acquisition strategy, but thus far, we're seeing normal behaviors, if you will. And look, the new account acquisitions skew towards branded cards and they are in products that are less reliant on the 0% offers and products like Flex Pay and Flex Loan, which will generate interest immediately as those balances grow. Sure. And look, as you, as you know, with all of the liquidity in the market, many of us have seen pressure on our GSIB score. That certainly has been the case for us and it wouldn't go into effect, the higher GSIB score of 3.5% until the beginning of 2023. And we look at the entire capital stack holistically, the 11.5% target in our case, which is well above reg minimums, but certainly does consider that - consider that and there are elements of that, as I mentioned earlier, that we can influence and control. So, the stress capital buffer is part of that and I talked earlier about our ability to influence those levers without having full understanding of the Fed models, we know we can influence PPNR, we know we can influence the balance sheet and how it gets allocated and ultimately what stress losses come out of it. And so we will continue to manage that. We will still have a buffer obviously even with a higher GSIB score. And as you know, regulators continue to talk about capital as being at about the right levels in the system. And they will continue to look at drivers that influence the stack as well including GSIB and balance sheet size et cetera and we'll see how that evolves. But again, we feel good about where we are. We are well-capitalized, we have a good sense for the drivers going forward that will create capital capacity for us and we intend to again invest that where it makes sense and return that otherwise to our shareholders."

Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. Ms. Lynn, you may begin.\nElizabeth Lynn: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the cautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2020 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Liz, and good morning to everyone. I am delighted to join you for my first earnings call as the Citi's CEO. Mark and I have a lot to cover today, so let's get cracking. Earlier today, we announced our earnings for the first quarter as well as the initial strategic actions we're taking in our Global Consumer Bank to focus on our competitive advantages and to improve our returns to our shareholders. I'll start with some observations, therefore, in the first quarter, and then I'll update you on the ongoing work on our strategy. It's been a much better-than-expected start of the year, and we are optimistic about the recovery ahead of us, and we're positioning the bank for a period of sustained growth. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $3.62 per share on net income of $7.9 billion. This was a record quarter in net income, driven by good performance in our Institutional business, and a release of $3.9 billion from our allowance for credit losses as a result of the improving economic outlook. In the Institutional Clients Group, our Markets businesses benefited yet again from an active environment. We saw solid performance in fixed income after a very strong first quarter last year and a record quarter in Equities. We also had a record quarter in Investment Banking, reflecting high levels of activity in equity underwriting. Treasury and Trade Solutions, which is the backbone of our global network grew deposits even though revenues continued to be impacted by low interest rates. Global Consumer Banking revenues were down quarter-over-quarter as a result of the pandemic. However, we clearly see a recovery taking root in Asia as well as the U.S., and that was reflected in our ACL release. And I'd note, this is the healthiest we have seen the consumer emerge from a crisis in recent history, driven in large part by the U.S. government stimulus package. Now while loan demand was down, we did see strong growth in wealth management and in digital engagement, both of which are central to the consumer franchise we are building. And our capital levels remained strong and stable, allowing us to respond to the needs of our clients and to return capital to our shareholders. At 11.7%, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was unchanged from the fourth quarter, and we resumed the repurchase of common stock which we voluntarily paused at the onset of the pandemic. Our tangible book value increased to $75.50, up 5% from a year ago. Now turning to our strategy. When we spoke in January, I pointed to 4 principles which we're using to guide the refresh of our strategy. First, we said we will be clinical in assessing which businesses we can retain or secure leading market positions in. Next, we're going to be focused by directing resources to high-returning businesses and away from the others. Third, we're going to be connected so we ensure our businesses fit well together and that they generate synergies. And last, we're going to be simpler to better serve our clients, fulfill our obligations to our regulators, and unlock value for our shareholders. We also committed to take the strategic decisions needed to best position Citi to win and to close the gap in return with our competitors, and we committed to share these decisions with you as we make them, and that's what we're doing again today. When I spoke in January about our new focus on wealth. we believe we're very well positioned to capture strong growth and attractive returns in this business, particularly in Asia and the U.S. Today, wealth at Citi represents roughly $6.5 billion in revenues, with three quarters of $1 trillion of client assets. And there's many synergies with our markets, BCMA, and commercial banking franchises across our global network. Yesterday, we announced the management team for Citi Global Wealth and the work in investments are well underway on the business strategy and growth plans. And today, we announced our decision to focus our consumer banking franchise in Asia and EMEA solely on 4 wealth centers, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE, and London. This positions us to capture the full spectrum of the wealth opportunity through these important hubs where we can serve onshore and offshore clients. And in Asia, this will allow us to continue operating our leading consumer businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong, which are both scaled and very high returning. We will, therefore, pursue exits of our consumer businesses in the remaining 13 markets in Asia and EMEA. Now, while these are excellent franchises, we don't have the scale we need to compete, and we've decided we simply aren't the best owners of them over the long term. So, consistent with the principles we outlined for the strategy refresh, we believe our capital, our investment dollars, and our other resources are better redeployed against higher returning opportunities elsewhere. What does this mean? This means that Global Consumer Banking will consist of 2 scale [ph] franchises in the U.S. and Mexico and these 4 hubs serving 100 million customers in total. Let me be very clear on one very important point. Citi will continue to invest behind and serve our institutional clients in these 13 new markets. We have a high-returning and leading institutional franchise in Asia, and it is an absolutely central part of our success going forward. And we see important opportunities to invest and gain share with our institutional clients regionwide. Indeed, I saw from my own experience in Latin America how the institutional businesses in each market really benefited from the increased focus once we have exited our subscale consumer franchises and simplified the operating model in the region. I fully expect the same will be true in Asia. And in the meantime, the comprehensive work on our strategy refresh continues. We will continue to share the decisions we make with you as we work to close the gap in returns with our peers. In parallel, we are, of course, hard at work on our transformation. We're making our next submission to the SEC this quarter. It's a massive body of work. We continue to work closely with our regulators to meet their expectations, and we expect to submit our complete plan to both regulators no later than the third quarter. We've identified the end states, performed the gap analyses and are currently working through the detailed resourcing and program plans and interdependencies and we've begun execution on several fronts. The investments required go hand-in-hand with our strategy work. So, for example, when we talk about simplification, we're pursuing it through changes to our operating model, but also by removing manual processes and controls and make no mistake about it. We want to achieve nothing less than a fundamental transformation by delivering excellence in our risk and controlled environment in our operations and in our service to clients. So, I am excited about the road ahead, and I have no doubt that these investments and others that we're going to make in talent and technology are all going to help us modernize the bank and position Citi to win. And finally, I want to update you on some of the commitments we're making in terms of ESG. Now we've prided ourselves in being a leader in many dimensions of ESG over the years. I see it as embedded in what we offer to our clients and the communities we serve around the world. And as you may know, on my first day as CEO in the beginning of March, I committed that Citi would reach net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and we will deliver our plan on how we will do so within the next 12 months. Critical to helping our clients transition to a low-carbon economy is a support we provide them through our environmental finance activities. So to that end, we're going to extend our current environmental finance target from $250 billion by 2025 to $500 billion by 2030. And in addition, we finance other activities in support of the UN's sustainable development goals outside of environmental finance. And these include our important investments in affordable housing, in health care and workforce development. We are committing an additional $500 billion to these activities by 2030, making our total sustainable development goal commitment $1 trillion by 2030. And with that, I am going to turn over to Mark, and then we will both be delighted to take your questions. Mark?\nMark Mason: Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Let me briefly review the results for the quarter, and then I'll go into more detail on the strategic refresh and specific actions we announced earlier today. Overall, we had a stronger-than-expected start to the year, driven by a constructive capital markets backdrop as well as a benefit from the cost of credit for the quarter. For the quarter, Citigroup reported net income of $7.9 billion. Revenues declined 7% from the prior year, while we saw continued strength in Investment Banking and a solid markets performance, it was more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates, along with lower card loans in consumer and the absence of the prior year mark-to-market gains on loan hedges. Expenses were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued investments in our transformation, including infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit performance remained strong, with net credit losses of $1.7 billion, more than offset by an ACL release of $3.9 billion driven primarily by an improvement in our macroeconomic outlook as well as lower loan balances. EPS was $3.62 and RoTCE was just over 20%. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 10% year-over-year, reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer. Deposits grew 7%, reflecting consistent client engagement with both corporate and consumer clients continuing to hold higher levels of liquidity. Before I go into more detail on each business, on Slide 4, I'd like to cover the strategic refresh that Jane discussed earlier. Last quarter, we spoke about the significant opportunity wealth represents for Citi going forward and announced the formation of Citi Global Wealth in order to better connect assets and capabilities across the consumer and institutional franchises and to transform the way we serve clients across the wealth spectrum. We've continued the build-out of Citi Global Wealth this quarter and have provided some details on the scope of the business on the slide, with additional information on key drivers in the appendix. Citi Global Wealth represented roughly $6.6 billion in allocated annual revenues. And it delivered 15% growth in investment revenues last year, driven by higher client activity and growth in client investment assets. As we continue to integrate the component businesses into a single wealth platform, we will finalize how best to implement this strategy from an organizational standpoint over the coming quarters and update you accordingly. Turning next to the actions we announced today. Given our strategic focus on global wealth management, we announced the decision to focus our Global Consumer Banking presence in Asia and EMEA on 4 wealth centers. As Jane mentioned, this strategic shift will allow us to simplify our operating model, while directing investments and resources to the businesses where we have competitive advantages and the scale necessary to drive higher returns over the long run. Let me describe the 13 markets where we will pursue an exit, shown on the slide, with added details in the appendix. Last year, these businesses contributed roughly $4 billion of revenues. And while historically profitable, like other consumer businesses, the impact of CECL weighed on full year results given the pandemic, with cost of credit nearly doubling in these markets year-over-year. Total assets were $82 billion as of the end of 2020, and the businesses are supported by roughly $7 billion of allocated TCE. We have a good track record of reducing expenses in similar situations. However, as noted on the slide, we are including fully allocated expenses to these markets, which could differ somewhat from the ultimate expense reductions. We will continue to manage these markets as part of the GCB franchise but we already have relevant actions well underway. We plan to share more information with you as we make progress against these and other actions as part of our ongoing strategy refresh. Finally, I want to emphasize a point that Jane made earlier. We will continue to serve ICG clients, including our commercial banking clients, in all these markets. And more broadly, this strategic shift will allow us to focus more investments on ICG in Asia. Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients group. We delivered a solid performance in the quarter, driven by strong execution in the constructive operating environment. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $7.7 billion, up 65% from last year. Revenues decreased 2%, reflecting the absence of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges seen last year. Excluding this, revenues were up 5%, with 9% growth in banking and 2% growth in markets and security services. Expenses increased 8%, reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls, along with other strategic investments, higher compensation cost and volume-driven growth. Credit costs were down considerably, given a $1.9 billion ACL release. The release this quarter primarily reflected improvements in the outlook for global GDP as well as modest improvements in portfolio credit quality. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.1%, including 3.6% on the non-investment-grade portion. Total net credit losses were $186 million, and ICG delivered a 25.7% return on allocated capital. Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Product revenues were up 5%, driven by record revenues in both equity underwriting and equity trading. Looking at these strong results across our overarching equities franchise, we feel good about the strategic investments we've been making which enabled us to leverage our full service model to better monetize the current market. On the banking side, revenues increased 9%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were down 10% in constant dollars, as good client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenues. Despite these headwinds, we continue to see strength in our underlying business drivers, including 14% growth in average deposits in constant dollars this quarter. And over the past year, we've seen significant increases in digital adoption and penetration as well as 7% growth in cross-border flows and 6% growth in clearing volumes. Investment Banking experienced its best quarter ever with revenues up 46%, driven by equity underwriting given our leading position in the SPAC market. Private Bank revenues grew 8%, also its best quarter ever, driven by higher lending volumes and managed investments revenues. Corporate Lending revenues were also up 8%, reflecting the absence of prior year marks, partially offset by lower volumes. Total Markets & Securities Services revenues increased 2% from last year. Fixed Income revenues decreased 5%, reflecting a strong performance in rates and currencies last year. However, spread products revenues were up from the prior year as clients search for yield in this low rate environment, with steady demand across flow and structured products. Equities revenues were up 26% versus last year, driven by cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and roughly flat in constant dollars. Here, we saw good growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients driven by growth in deposits, assets under custody and settlement volumes, offset by lower spreads. Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 7. While we are still seeing the impact of the pandemic and high payment rates on revenues, consumer spending continues to improve and credit remains healthy, pointing to a recovery as we move through the year. For the quarter, GCB delivered EBIT of $2.8 billion, up significantly from last year, primarily driven by improved credit costs. Revenues declined 15% as lower card balances and lower interest rates across all 3 regions were partially offset by continued strong deposit growth and momentum in wealth management. Expenses decreased 1% as efficiency savings and lower volume-related costs were partially offset by investments. Credit costs decreased significantly driven by an ACL reserve release in all 3 regions and lower net credit losses. The release this quarter primarily reflected lower volumes as well as improvements in the macro outlook. And GCB delivered a 25% return on allocated capital. Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues were down 15% from last year, primarily driven by lower cards revenues. Branded cards revenues were down 11%, reflecting a 15% decline in average loans as clients are using the liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt. Retail Services revenues were down 26%, reflecting higher partner payments as well as lower average loans. Net interest revenues were down 18% as average loans declined by 13% on higher payment rates. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower forecasted losses and, therefore, higher income sharing. Looking more broadly on our cards businesses, we're continuing to see a recovery in sales activity. In Branded Cards, total purchase sales were unchanged year-over-year, but essential spend was up 12%, and we are starting to see the recovery in areas like travel and dining. And in Retail Services, purchase sales grew 4%. So purchase sales are improving slightly faster than our prior expectations. And with the vaccine rollout, this should support a further recovery in discretionary spend. The bigger impact on loans is from the high payment rates. This is creating revenue pressure, but it's also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends. So the good news is that we're seeing the recovery in spend, which should continue, and our credit portfolio is proving to be quite resilient. We are now focused on loan and revenue recovery through driving spend activity, reentering the market for new account acquisitions, and investing in lending capabilities and new value propositions. Turning to Retail Banking. Revenues were down 8% year-over-year, reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads. That said, we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships. Average deposits were up 22%, including 30% growth in checking. And AUMs were up 32%. We're also continuing to broaden our digital capabilities to extend from deposits to wealth management to mortgage lending. As Jane mentioned, we're committed to the franchise, and all of this gives us confidence in our ability to scale our U.S. retail bank with a digitally led, client-centric approach supported by light physical expansion in new markets over time. On Slide 9, we show the results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 12% year-over-year in the first quarter. We continue to see good momentum in wealth management as investment revenues grew 22% with a 14% increase in Citigold clients and 13% growth in net new money. And the numbers are meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the 4 global wealth hubs. Average deposit growth remained strong at 13%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Card revenues remained under pressure year-over-year, with purchase sales down 5% and average loans down 13%, given a continued significant impact on travel in the region. However, we are seeing some signs of a recovery, with the pickup in new card acquisitions and purchase sales year-over-year in the month of March. Turning to Latin America. Total consumer revenues declined 16% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits and assets under management in Mexico this quarter, with average balances up 9% and AUMs up 17%. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continue to decline given the macro environment. Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. In the U.S., both NCL and delinquency rates remained favorable, driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs. Given the delinquency trends we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021. And so peak losses may not occur until late 2022, depending on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit. By contrast, in both Mexico and Asia, we saw a peak in credit losses in the first quarter of 2021. This was expected driven by the impact of customer accounts rolling off relief programs. The impact was pronounced in Mexico, with a peak NCL rate of over 10%, as we saw most customers roll off the relief programs at the end of the third quarter of last year. Excluding those accounts that participated in relief programs, our credit trends in both Mexico and Asia remain stable. And you can see improvement this quarter in delinquency rates. Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were roughly flat in dollar terms as the impact of lower rates was offset by the absence of marks versus the prior year as well as some episodic gains this quarter. Expenses were down 1% as investments in infrastructure, risk and controls were roughly offset by the allocation of certain costs to the businesses. This change had no impact to EBIT at the Citi level. And given it was immaterial, we have not reflected the change retrospectively. Credit costs declined year-over-year driven by a release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year. Finally, the pretax loss was $231 million this quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect a quarterly pretax loss in the range of $500 million for the remainder of 2021, although with some variation quarter-to-quarter. Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.2 billion this quarter declined $1.4 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances as well as the impact of 1 fewer day versus last year, partially offset by slightly higher trading-related NIR. Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize and, excluding the impact of 2 fewer days in the quarter, was roughly flat to the fourth quarter. And net interest margin declined 5 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenues, partially offset by treasury actions and balance sheet optimization. Turning to noninterest revenues. In the first quarter, non-NIR declined slightly to just over $9 billion, predominantly driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges offsetting strong Investment Banking revenues. On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics, which, as Jane mentioned, remained strong and stable again this quarter, allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders. Our CET1 capital ratio remained 11.7% as net income was roughly offset by buybacks and dividends, along with the impact of OCI and an increase in risk-weighted assets. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $2.7 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $1.6 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% to $75.50, driven by net income. Before we move to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. First, our full year top line outlook has improved since last quarter. At that time, coming off the performance of 2020, we had expected industry wallets to return closer to the 2019 levels this year. Given the strong start to the year as well as the increasingly positive signs of a recovery ahead, we now believe wallets will be somewhat higher relative to 2019. Meanwhile, our outlook for net interest revenues is unchanged, and we continue to expect a decline in net interest revenues of somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion, with stabilization continuing into the second quarter and an improvement in the back half. Taken together, this suggests revenues down in the mid single-digit range, better than our prior guidance for a mid- to high single-digit range decline. Second, on the expense side, we continue to expect full year expenses to increase in the range of 2% to 3%, mostly driven by investments related to our transformation agenda. In addition, we could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing. And as I mentioned earlier, we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials. Finally, on cost of credit, we continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to credit performance. And depending on the macroeconomic outlook, we could see further reserve releases, although given the size of the reserve release this quarter, we would not expect to see the same magnitude of ACL release going forward. With that, Jane and I are happy to take any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Jane, I wanted to ask you a bit of a strategic question. Just for some more color on this idea that the investments you're making in the risk and controls will also help advance your goal of modernizing Citi's technology for the benefit of customers. Could you elaborate on that a little bit? And maybe give us some examples of where you've seen technology gaps as you've done your listening tour across the company.\nJane Fraser: Thank you very much, John. So, it's fascinating at the moment. I have a chance to go and talk to the CEOs of banks who are our clients all around the world and all of us talk about the same thing, which is there's a major transformation that's going on, a digital transformation in the industry. And so, as we look at the consent order and the transformation, the transformation we're going through is much broader than just the consent orders, although they're obviously a very critical component of it. And so as we look at the -- as we look at the investments we're making, I look at the ones that we're making in our infrastructure, in our data as very much linked into a strategic need, as well as what's being required and asked of us from the consent orders. So I gave you one of the examples just earlier. But data would be an obvious example of this, where investment that we make in the quality of our data will have a big impact for our shareholders in terms of driving revenues, improving our client experience in making faster decision-making on risk or on business decisions as well as making sure that the data that we do have is properly governed from a safety and soundness perspective. So many of the investments we've got at the moment are really the strategy and transformation work coming together as it is for many banks.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And then a quick follow-up on that for Mark. Mark, how should investors think about the multiyear cost of this transformation? Obviously, you've given us some sense of what's embedded to get to your expense guidance for this year of up 2% to 3%, but is this something that does get spread out over multiple years? It doesn't sound like an easy or a quick project.\nMark Mason: Yes. Thanks, John. As Jane has referenced, it is, and I've referenced in the past, it is a multiyear effort, and we've been working very diligently on identifying the gaps that we have and identifying the root causes. And as Jane has mentioned, we're working very aggressively on constructing the plans to move towards more comprehensive execution, but those plans have to come together, and we're still working through that. And as you've mentioned, I've been very clear as we develop the information as to what we can expect in the way of headwinds, that 2% to 3% this year, $1 billion in the prior year. And as we as we bring those plans together, I'll continue to share openly what our best estimates are for how the expenses continue to evolve. What I would say, John, is that, and I say this a lot, I guess, these are investments. As Jane mentioned, there are benefits that we expect from them. The data was a great example as to how we leverage that with our clients but also how getting that quality data in and not having to rework it and reconcile it, et cetera, et cetera, saves us on the operating cost as well. And I highlight that because as we make more investments, we will undoubtedly continue to seek out productivity opportunities that move to offset those.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: I guess a simple one that's probably not so simple to answer is if there's not this -- there's not a huge revenue or earnings impact from divesting the 13 markets, but there is a lot of like resources and bandwidth freed up. I guess my question is, what do you do with the capital? Just conceptual, meaning everyone has been looking to you for a huge capital return story, which you are. But putting the consent order aside, how do you think about using that capital offensively to augment the businesses that you're doubling down on?\nMark Mason: Sure. Look, I think this is one of the reasons why it's so important that we're doing a refresh that Jane has described. It allows us to very clearly focus on the parts of the franchise where we think we have a significant competitive advantage. And as Jane has mentioned, those are going to be the parts of the franchise where we allocate more resources, both in the way of expense dollars and investments, but also in the way of capital allocation so that we can capture the growth that we see with client opportunities there. And after that, after kind of ensuring that we're capturing those opportunities that deliver returns, that are consistent with our objective of narrowing the gap to peers, then we want to, obviously return excess capital to shareholders as we've been doing. So that's the way we think about it. First, let's lead with what is the strategy. Second, let's make sure that strategy is rooted in growth opportunities and commensurate returns that make sense for us. Let's allocate capital there to take advantage of that. And then what's left, let's return it to shareholders.\nJane Fraser: Yes. And I would just jump in on this one as well. I mean I've been on a great listening tour with our investors and hearing their perspectives, and I'm very clear around our priorities, which is closing the return gap with all our peers, making sure that we put a strategy in place that has the investment profile as well as the different actions to do so. And as Mark said, this is our #1 priority.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. I'd love to follow up on just one piece. So on that front, wealth is definitely something that sets a high-return profile. You mentioned you're doubling down. I'd love to discuss, as a combined entity, what metrics do you think we'll be looking at to determine success? What are the important linkages with the other businesses that can be maximized better? What systems and product platforms do you need to add to get to these higher aspirations?\nJane Fraser: I better be careful because I could talk for hours on this one. I think we're incredibly well positioned in wealth. Mike gave you -- Mark gave you some of the visibility into the size and scale of the business today. When I look at it, we've got a phenomenal brand name, an aspirational one, in the wealth space, particularly in Asia, but around the world. We have our commercial bank which operates in 30 different geographies around the world and is where a lot of the wealth is being created. So we have relationships and are helping with the actual wealth generation and source of wealth from many of our clients as well as obviously in ICG. We've got a top-tier institutional platform and capability. And we've got our presence very well established in these major wealth hubs around the world. So I do feel we're incredibly well positioned when we can bring these different assets and capabilities into a single platform. So the investments that we've already begun making is putting a single wealth platform organization in place. We made the announcement yesterday around the leadership, you'd have seen that. We've started investing in growing our relationship managers and FAs around the world and really bringing together the best of the firm. And I expect, as we work on the technology plan, we'll have some different tech stack lined up against that, too. So Jim O'Donnell, putting the plans together right now, but we see this as a tremendous opportunity, and you'll be able to measure us and hold us to account for this in terms of the returns that we generate, the growth in the fee income and continuing to steadily capture share in the years ahead.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nErika Najarian: Yes, just a follow-up on Glenn's question. So Jane, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you were now refocusing on consumer businesses where you have scale, and that's the U.S. and Mexico. And I guess we're wondering, I'm sure you're still in the middle of your strategic review, what is your vision for the Citi consumer franchise in the U.S.? And as we move past a world where hopefully your multiple is more reflective of your ROE potential and you're past the consent order, would you entertain inorganic opportunities for market share growth in the United States?\nJane Fraser: Erika, great question and certainly what I have heard loud and clear from many of our investors as well as we've been talking with them. Look, the U.S. is our home market. We have to get it right. It's a great franchise in terms of brand, the client base that we have around the country. We certainly see upside potential in wealth, as we've been talking about. We have a large cards business where the pandemic has accelerated the cross-sale of our broader banking proposition. And I think the broader theme of digitization, we have very high-quality clients in and out of footprint. And they've been very digitally engaged, and that's only increased. 50% of the new accounts this quarter in the retail bank were acquired digitally and about 75% of our clients, for example, are digitally engaged already. And we have tremendous partnerships. So I think we've got some -- we've got terrific assets and building blocks. But as you said, the work is going on right now on the strategy refresh. And we're looking forward to coming back to you in reasonably short order when we've done the work and have the plan on what actions we will take. We're looking longer run. And for now, partnerships are going to be very important. But we'd love to do inorganic moves if they make sense for our shareholders and for us further down the line. But at the moment, we'll focus on partnerships.\nErika Najarian: And my second question is with Mark. Is this probably partially -- how you laid out guidance probably partially answers this question. But investors seem to believe that there could be upside to revenue for banks, whether it's continued expansion of wallet in your ICG business or in more traditional NIR sources. And I'm wondering -- it's a 2-part question. One, if we get a better revenue from here, could you still achieve the 2% to 3% expense target? And as a follow-up, on the expenses that would be carved out from those exits, we heard from one of your peers that if you exclude overhead or expenses allocated to businesses exited, we would see a sort of a net expense saves of about 75% to 80% of identified expenses. And I'm wondering if that's the right ratio to think about those 13 markets that you're exiting.\nMark Mason: Sure. Thank you. So the first thing, just in terms of revenue, I did speak to this in the guidance. And what I referenced was, I talked about in the last quarter, the normalization of the markets' wallets and what we're seeing just at the on start of this year and the strong start that Jane referenced is that while I do expect there'll be some normalization, I would expect at this point that the market wallets will be above the 2019 levels. And so we do think that, that presents some upside. I talked about the -- and that's what kind of feeds in part the down mid-single-digit guidance that I gave for total revenues. You're right with the steepening of the curve. That does present some opportunities. We've got dry powder to put liquidity to work. And we've done some of that, but we have more dry powder to do that. With that said, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing higher payment rates from the consumer business that offsets some of that potential upside. And I did describe the NIR in the way of a range, down $1 billion to $2 billion. And so that range gives you some sense for the ability or the opportunity if we were to capture more of that upside. In terms of the expenses, two things. One, you mentioned relative to revenues. And the answer is that if wallets continue to perform even stronger or the recovery is even more significant on the lending side or consumer side or ICG side for that matter, then that will come with higher expenses, transaction expenses, compensation expenses. But I think everyone would agree that, that would be good cholesterol. And so we'll see how that plays out. Obviously, I did mention episodic costs associated with the exits. What I'd say about that is -- and your point around allocations, both Jane and I have deep experience at this. I have experience from Citi Holdings and being part of that team and ultimately running Citi Holdings. Jane has run Latin America. Both of those parts of the franchise historically have exited countries, and we have both been keenly focused on ensuring that we get as much of the stranded costs associated with exits out of the organization in the past. And you can rest assure that, that would be the same type of focus we put to these exits. So that's kind of the view there. I don't have a ratio that I'd want to share at this point. But please know that, that will be a focal point for us in order to ensure that we get the most value out of this decision.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew O'Connor: I know this is a tough question to answer, but as we think about the timing of the consent orders, should we think about the ones that came out in October of last year as essentially restarting the clock? Or since some of them was going on for several years and the Fed and OCC acknowledged that you've made progress, maybe don't think about it as a resetting the clock. And the reason I'm asking is, if we look at other consent orders in the industry, it tends to take several years, 3, 4, 5 years. And it's a little bit trickier with you guys because, again, it's not like you're starting from scratch. But I was wondering if there's anything you could comment with respect to the timing and how I frame that.\nMark Mason: Yes, sure. Why don't I start and then, Jane, you may have some thoughts on it as well. What I'd say is, look, this is -- the consent order was clear in its way of directives in areas that we need to focus. As Jane has described, we're looking at this, frankly, a little bit broader. We're looking at this as a transformation. And it will take -- it is a multiyear effort that is underway here. Yes, there are some things that you heard us referenced that we had started even before the order. There were a number of remediation efforts that were underway in some of the areas that are referenced in the order. We're leveraging the work that we had started already. But candidly, what's different about this transformation versus a remediation is that we're looking at this end-to-end as opposed to a very narrow or silo or tactical approach to an issue that's identified. And in order to do that, you do have to pause for a second, take a step back and look at things on the front end of a process where things come into our systems and understand how you can improve those processes, the technology that support them, the governance around that. I highlight that because your answer is -- your question is a tough question. There's some of it that we will keep accelerating, but we want to make sure that we do that in a broader context so that we get it right. And that's what's really important to us. Jane, anything you want to add to that?\nJane Fraser: No, I think you said it very well, Mark. Remediation is tactical. Transformation is more strategic and much more fundamental, and that's what we're doing. We take a soup to nuts approach. We're looking at the target states we want to get to, making sure that we've got real excellence in what we do. And that is the focus. So we're looking forward rather than looking backwards.\nMatthew O'Connor: And then just a follow-up there. Like isn't the reality that you need to kind of fix the regulatory issues so that you can accomplish some of the things that you want in the transformation, right? Because I think your ability to do deals, ability to open branches, there's just a lot of restrictions. So I think it's good to hear about like the long-term vision. But you kind of need to get the house in order first, right, before you can accomplish some of those things? Or can you do both at the same time?\nJane Fraser: Oh, you can -- you absolutely do both at the same time, and that's what we're very focused on. As I say, the transformation and the -- the work on the transformation, the strategy in many ways go hand-in-hand and are getting us to the same goal, which is make sure we're excellent for our investors, for our clients as well as for our regulators and the safety and soundness agenda. So the two go very much hand-in-hand. Risk and controls are clearly important, particularly in a digital world, and we need them to be at a very high standard to operate as one of the world's most significant financial institutions. That's the intention as is the intention to make sure our operations are the same. So one in the same goal here.\nMark Mason: To your point, Jane, exiting these 13 countries, that simplifies the organization, right? Creating Citi Global Wealth and bringing what was the private bank and our wealth organization and consumer together allows for us to come up with an investment platform, a unified investment platform. That simplifies the organization, makes it easier to have controls in place around those processes. So Jane is exactly right, the strategy is aligned with the transformation that's underway in many ways.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.\nSaul Martinez: I have a bit of a hodge-podge of questions related to your strategic refresh. So first, you gave a lot of color on the financial metrics of the 13 exit markets. But do you also happen to have what the reserves are on the balance sheet that could be released over time in those countries? Second, time horizon. I know you indicated, Mark, that you'll give us more detail as it presents itself. But just any sort of guidance on the time horizon, are we looking at quarters? Or is this going to play out over a number of years? Just any guideposts. And then I guess thirdly, I'll just finish up. Maybe more importantly, Banamex, any -- how are you thinking about Banamex in the context of your strategy refresh? I mean it certainly is not a subscale business, but Mexico does have some macro challenges, as you guys have highlighted, and a government that has very heterodox views, policy views on a whole host of things. So just any thoughts on how you're thinking about Banamex right now.\nMark Mason: Jane, you want to start? And then I can piggyback on that.\nJane Fraser: Yes, so in terms of -- why don't we go start off with timing and...\nMark Mason: Yes, and then I'll take the reserver.\nJane Fraser: Yes, I can chuck the reserve one over to you, Mark. So in terms of timing, look, we're already getting going, there's no dillydallying here. What we're looking at doing is we've begun the work. The actions are underway in several markets. We'll look to complete the exits in a timely fashion and we expect to be out in some markets this quarter. Equally, this is -- we're going to be thoughtful about who the buyers are and the -- how we do this and the value that we create for shareholders in the process. So while there is urgency on action, we're going to make sure that this is a good move for our shareholders and act appropriately. And the timing is going to be driven by regulatory approvals in different geographies. So as Mark said, as we know more, we'll update you on the process, but we've been very transparent about what we're intending to do. And then in terms of Mexico, look, Mexico is a scaled franchise. When I compare Mexico to our Asian consumer franchises, they really benefit from their scale. The returns are good. And there's a lot of upside potential there. The investments in digitization have really paid off. So while the country is going through a very challenging time at the moment, there's a lot to like in the franchise over the longer term. And we'll give you a better sense of the strategy there as we carry on the strategy refresh work. But a lot to like. Mark, do you want to cover the reserves? Yes.\nMark Mason: Yes. So let me just -- I guess I'll make a couple of comments and I don't think I'm going to get into a specific reserve number, so apologies for that. But what I will say is, as you see what we shared on the page that it's roughly breakeven in 2020, and we all recognize in 2020 there were significant reserves established in light of the pandemic, what I'd say is if we would look at 2019, which would have been a more normalized year, the EBIT associated with the 13 markets would have been a little bit under $1 billion or so. And so it gives you some sense for how the build in reserves, at least to some extent, has impacted what the financials are that we've shared here. And again, as we go through these transactions, we'll be appropriately transparent with the impact that we see from them.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Mayo: Jane, so about -- what are you, 45 days in the job, and you announced the asset disposition, so I guess you're not wasting any time. As you think about these assets dispositions or future dispositions, how do you -- what lens do you use? Because you can consider returns. You can consider growth. You can consider synergies with the rest of the firm. You could potentially consider regulatory benefits as it relates to consent order. Do you get credit for simplifying less systems to resolve? Or what other measures do you use? I note that the -- it looks like the exit of the 13 consumer markets, those were capital hogs. So I can't imagine the returns were very good. But there's a lot of parameters you can look at. What lens do you use?\nJane Fraser: So interesting question, Mike. And frankly, I look at it in terms of what we want to be, not what we don't, because what you don't want to be kind of falls out a bit pretty easily. So the main consideration we have is how do we close the return gap with our peers and make sure that the businesses we're in that can win. And we're very disciplined about going back to those principles I laid out at the very beginning and we talked about back in January, we've been using this consistently in the strategy refresh work. So the first thing we're looking at is, is this sector or is this client segment or is this business? Does it have attractive dynamics as we look out over the medium and long term? And importantly, within those dynamics, can we win? Does this make -- can we be well positioned in this? And I think we're certainly seeing in the world of financial services today that scale is obviously a very important consideration. So the corollary of that is if you don't have scale, that's usually a disadvantage. We look at it in terms of connectivity. I think it's very, very important that we have synergies across our major platforms and our client segments. And you'll hear us talking about that a lot more going forward and what are some of the metrics that we'll look at to demonstrate that we're really capturing those synergies. We look at fees and returns. So therefore, if it's capital, is it generating returns? Are we getting the growth? We're efficient on the fee revenues relative to what Mark and I would like to be. So that becomes a consideration. And then does it really fit with the strategic identity that we have for Citi and we're working on as part of the refresh? If it's yes, then this is a candidate for investment, laying out what the strategy is. If it's not, it's the opposite. And dispositions, we're always going to take into time -- into consideration timing. As I said in the last question, there's no fire sales here. We are going to be thoughtful on how we ensure we generate value for shareholders on the exit at the potential value of partnerships with the potential buyers, et cetera and how best can we monetize and generate value as we do this. So in many ways, it's a little bit of all of the above on your list, but we kind of -- we start in the opposite place, if you know what I mean. What are we going to be, and then focus on making sure that we generate the greatest value from that. And the other decisions kind of fall out of it pretty quickly. And I think you can see that being demonstrated in the decisions we made on both why wealth and the hubs that we're investing in, in Asia and EMEA, but then equally, the other decisions on the remaining 13 markets on consumer being the exit.\nMichael Mayo: And then one follow-up. It is early, but do you have a sense of what sort of return you'd ultimately like to achieve? And ultimately, what is the identity that you would like to have for Citigroup? Who is Citigroup? What's your -- what's your elevator summary, elevator pitch?\nJane Fraser: Citigroup is fabulous, Mike. When -- again, when I go back to what have our investors been talking to me about, the areas that -- as we've been going around and listening to them, they want us to have -- they want us to close the gap of the returns with our peers. I think Mark's given some indication. I mean as we see a more normal -- when we see a normalized rate environment, we get the strategy there, a mid-tier range seems reasonable, but I would certainly add and let us do the work, because I want to make sure that we have a very thoughtful strategy and we've got clarity around it. And when you ask us about what is Citi going to be, we'll be back to you with, again, a lot more precision and clarity around it. But I think you can see from some of the moves that we've got, we want to be -- we really want to be excellent. And that's not just in terms of how we serve our clients, many of whom are very -- have global needs, and there's a lot of consistency around that. But also, I would say what Citi is, I want the word excellent to be one that is used about us in our operations, in our culture, in our accountability and in what we do. And so that's the word you'll hear from me a lot, and that's the standard I'm holding myself and the firm to.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So I wanted to start off with a question. Just looking at the strategic actions that you guys had taken, if I think back to 2014, right, and what was outlined then, Jane, was actually pretty similar in terms of the profitability profile of the businesses that you are exiting, the capital benefits that were ultimately going to be reaped. And it was at least difficult to see some of those benefits if I look at how the profitability profile has changed. So I guess from your point of view, having been at the firm when that was undertaken, what lessons did you learn from that process? And are there any differences in the approach that you might take this goal around to potentially drive maybe more conspicuous or clear benefits to the bottom line?\nJane Fraser: So sorry, just in terms -- I just want to make sure I'm understanding the question, you're asking in terms of the benefits of digitization?\nSteven Chubak: Not in digitization, just if I think back to the exits, there were strategic actions that you had pursued in 2014, exiting a handful of markets to try to optimize that global consumer footprint. And it was very similar in terms of the disclosure around the exit markets were barely profitable, there were capital benefits that were going to be reaped. But ultimately, we didn't see those benefits at least translate into bottom line impacts. And curious if you could just speak to some of the learnings from that experience and what approach you might take a bit differently.\nJane Fraser: Yes. When I look at the -- in LatAm, the benefits we got were pretty tremendous. So I think, first of all, we were able to very much focus on our strengths in our institutional franchise. We were able to make sure that we had truly world-class talent. We invested in our technology and platforms. We were very focused on that client base of the multinationals we serve there, in particular, in the investor base, engaged in Latin America. And we drove the returns up from teenagers to mid-20s in a pretty short period of time. We rose up the rankings in the banking side and really solidified our leadership on the institutional front. I'd also say we simplified the management structure as well in the region and gained quite a lot of benefits from simplification that hit the bottom line as well. So I'd say my experience has been one in which there's real benefit from focus. You get better at the businesses that you're in. You get strong talent and you're able to bring more focused talent. That's what's different. And you get -- you're able to really get the linkages across the different businesses and hone in on them. Mark, I don't think -- I don't know if you've got anything else to add because you and I are both in these journeys together.\nMark Mason: Yes, Jane, I think you captured it well. The only thing I'd emphasize in terms of kind of what's different now as we go at this is -- or the last couple of points you made, which is that keen focus on making sure that you've got -- that we've got the right talent in the right places as we go through this strategy refresh and ensuring that the org structure supports that. Again, I go back to the wealth example and the resetting of that org structure. You can point to the idea of moving commercial into ICG to ensure that you got that focus against that strategy and you can really capture the linkages across the firm. And then the last piece is the focused investment. We're moving away from kind of a spreading of the investments and really wanting to focus them on where we think the biggest growth opportunities are and where the highest returns are. But I think you captured it all, Jane.\nSteven Chubak: No, that's great color. And just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the TTS business. It's a really strong franchise and like the underlying balance growth historically has been quite strong and relatively steady-eddie. In more recent quarters, there's been some pressure. It feels like a lot of that's actually NII- or rate-related. But I was hoping to give some perspective on what are some of the underlying trends that you're seeing in that business. What's your outlook at least from here and now that most of the rate pressure at least should be fully absorbed or reflected in the run rate?\nMark Mason: Yes, sure, why don't I start? And then Jane, you can add on as you'd like in terms of some of the client perspective. But look, the revenues, you're right, were down about 10% year-over-year on an ex FX basis. And you hit it right on the head. I mean, the low rate environment that we've been in is a very big driver in what we've seen in the aggregate TTS revenues now. Now we have seen higher deposit volumes, and that obviously plays through with that impact. What I would say in terms of your broader question, what we look at is, one, the engagement that we have with clients. And we have very meaningful, significant engagement with clients throughout the entire crisis that we've been managing through. And that engagement kind of plays through. And the increase in number of accounts, digital accounts that we've opened for them, really kind of reinforcing some of the investments that we've been making in onboarding and enhancing -- and in enhancing our digital capability, that engagement plays through in the clearing activity and cross-border transactions that we've seen, which are both up 6% and 7% over the past 12 months. So good solid underlying drivers. While we do see pressure on commercial card activity, fee revenues ex commercial card activity has been good. And frankly, as we see the economy recover and we look at some of the GDP forecast and that starts to play out, we would expect to see the business activity turn in a way that starts to play through the top line. But we see again, very, very strong continued engagement with our clients and with how they're evolving their own strategies. And the last example I'd mention is many of our clients with the acceleration of digitization are focused on business-to-consumer activity. And that's an important area of growth. And we're part of that dialogue. We're part of creating that solution as it relates to their business model or business models. Jane, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that.\nJane Fraser: Yes. You're going to hear quite a lot more about our TTS business and the services platform it represents for so many of our clients around the world. The client -- in my discussion with clients over the last few months, they love our TTS platform. More than that, they depend upon it. It is strategic for them, the different services, the data it represents, the other dimensions of it. And so the growth that we're going to see from this next year is, I think it's going to be very material. You'll hear us also talk more about the commercial bank going forward as well because the mid-market clients and the born digital clients are ones who use our TTS platform and their capabilities and services around it to also themselves start growing internationally and it becomes a core part of them. So this is -- we've got more to grow with our existing clients. We've got a lot of new clients that are coming on board this. And this is going to be an exciting part of the story going forward and the underlying opportunities here separate to the rates environment.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Jane, Mark, I was wondering if I could ask you just about global recovery and pacing. As you look through the supplement, you see different growth rates when you look -- whether you look at loans, cards or deposits at different paces and as the currency translation impacts as well, of course. But just how would you help us understand, as you look forward to revenue stabilization over time, just how do you see the global customer base recovering in terms of pacing, U.S., non-U.S.? And if you can juxtapose that to any extent in the wholesale side, that would be great as well.\nJane Fraser: Yes. I'll kick off with a little bit more on the macro side. Mark will jump in on some of the other important dimensions for ourselves. Look, it's asynchronous growth out there is what we're seeing. I think you're seeing that U.S. and China is certainly leading the recovery with Asia. Europe is delayed, but certainly not derailed. And parts of the emerging markets are struggling. So you do see a different picture in different parts of the world. And as I think you heard from me at the beginning of the call, we're pretty optimistic about the U.S. in particular over the next few years. There's a lot of unspent savings out there with consumers. Huge amount of liquidity in the market. Corporate balance sheets are broadly healthy. And then you've also got a lot of dynamism from digitization that's changing consumer behaviors and driving investment. So overall, it's certainly a very improved outlook around the world, but it is an asynchronous one. And we're seeing, as Mark had talked about, strong pipelines, a lot of client engagement, a lot of client activity. But Mark, why don't I turn to you on how you're seeing some of this translate?\nMark Mason: Yes. Let me make a -- I guess I'll make a couple of comments. One, we are seeing continued pressure on our consumer business, right? So we talked about loan volumes being down, particularly in Branded Cards, almost 15% or 15%. Retail Services average loans, down 13%. What I would say is we are seeing signs of the recovery. And while those loans are down, payment rates remain high. That helps from a cost of credit point of view. And purchase sales are starting to show some good signs. So Branded Cards purchase sales were flat year-over-year. The Retail Services purchase sales were up 4% year-over-year. And the outlook is positive in terms of kind of GDP and unemployment. And so the stimulus that's out there still has to play out in North America. But we are optimistic that consumer spending trends look like they're going to go favorable. And that will undoubtedly help the forecast that I spoke to, which is recovery in NIR and some loan activity towards the back half of the year. On the corporate ICG side, similarly, we're certainly seeing good signs as it relates to the markets activity, we've talked about that, and that's continued since last year. But when I think about even ICG loans, we've seen loan activity in the private bank. We've seen loan activity in parts of markets. And so those are good. And loan activity as it relates to trade, which is -- which are all good signs of the recovery that we're all marching towards.\nKen Usdin: Yes. And one follow-up on card, Mark. You had mentioned in your prepared remarks about how we knew that we would get the bounce in card losses. But you mentioned generically that card losses would still remain pretty low. Any way of helping us kind of understand just how you expect card losses to traject overall?\nMark Mason: Yes. Let me mention a couple of things on that. So one is -- let's take it in pieces. So Latin America, on the chart on Slide 10, big jump in the -- in the quarter, almost 11% of NCLs. But again, that is a byproduct of customers coming off of the relief program in the third quarter. And as we look at the delinquency buckets, we're not seeing meaningful signs of increases in those buckets. And that gives us comfort in the case of Latin America that we've reached the peak there. Similarly for other regions, there are no signs in the delinquency bucket to suggest that we're going to see big increases in our NCLs. And in fact, in North America, what you heard me say is that we likely would not see that until late in 2022. And so it's the payment rates that we're seeing. It's the low activity as it relates to the delinquency buckets. It's obviously the impact of stimulus playing through all of that, that give us some comfort at this stage that we're not likely to see a pop in NCL certainly in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: So yes, I have two questions. Maybe first on the corporate lending. Balances there were down 30% year-on-year. I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is driven by client demand versus overall risk appetite. Maybe it's -- just trying to see if you get more risk appetite that those loan balances could come back sooner.\nMark Mason: Yes. I mean, look, as you know, we're managing through this crisis. But if you look back to early last year and the second quarter last year, this was about ensuring that clients had an appropriate level of liquidity. And that has continued to happen, as you see in our deposit growth, as you've heard others mention, as you've seen monetary action there. Our corporate clients have lots of liquidity by and large. And they have a -- many of the clients we serve have the option of how they want to access the market for that liquidity. And you saw that in some of the ECM, DCM activity through the balance of last year and even some of it continuing. So long-winded way of saying it is -- this is a client-driven business. This is about client demand. And so it's not a question of risk appetite. Risk appetite is always important. We operate inside of our risk appetite framework always. But the dynamic that you're seeing here is about client demand.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Okay. And the second question on cards. And I heard you desire to grow new card accounts. Can you maybe just go into a little bit deeper on the strategy behind that? Is it more going back to promotional balances and opening up that back again? Or how you're going to grow those new card accounts?\nMark Mason: Yes. Again, the card dynamic here is about ensuring that we get the timing right as it relates to market reentry, right? And so obviously coming into this, we wanted to be very thoughtful about how we managed our risk and we tightened risk criteria in order to ensure that we would manage responsibly through this pandemic. And now as we sit here and see all the signs of recovery that you've heard us mention, it's about a responsible reopening, right, and ensuring that we're targeting the customers that we want longer term, the existing customers that we're opening line availability to them where that makes sense, in the case of our Retail Services that we are pursuing new account acquisitions both there as well as in Branded Cards. So it's about that reentry strategy and consistent with the target market customer that you've heard us describe before, which tends to be of a higher quality.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.\nChris Kotowski: My question is on the exit markets, and in particular on the markets in the Pacific Rim, are there operational linkages between the operations in all those countries that would make those companies better to sell as a unit to one of the pan national companies? Or is it very modular and could be pulled apart in each country sold to the highest bidder? And then secondly, I was wondering also, do you -- do the Citi Branded Cards go with these dispositions? Or do you maintain that separately and continues to try to solicit and grow the card base?\nJane Fraser: Chris, so in terms of the exit markets, I'd say it's probably a tad early to speculate on the buyers. These are fabulous franchises, and we've got really tremendous talent, tremendous capabilities there in the individual markets. And so we expect to get a lot of interest. But as to who and what, I'm certainly not going to speculate yet. When you ask about operational linkages, I mean this is something, as Mark said, he and I have gone through quite a few divestitures in different geographies. And we are well skilled at how to make sure that we can separate out the consumer franchises and then invest in the capabilities for the ICG businesses. It's not been a problem in any of the divestitures that we've done, which were many. I think it was about 11 or 12 across Latin America and others before. So our team is good at this. It's not going to be an issue. And in fact, it will enable us, as we said, to target our investments more into the institutional platforms and wealth in the hubs, as we talked about. And then in terms of Branded Cards, do Branded Cards go as part of the sale? Yes is the very simple answer to that one. Transaction services, of course, remains an important part of the franchises in these 13 geographies. And so our capabilities in commercial cards and our capabilities and payments, et cetera, for the GTS side of the business remain intact and will be invested in.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Mark, can you share with us -- many of us are trying to take a look at what your bank and your peers will look like when we get back to some sort of normality were beyond the pandemic. And one of the areas of focus is loan loss reserves since, as you and your peers said, you built them up dramatically. Now you're drawing them down, of course. Can you share with us -- I think if I recall back on day 1, January '20, when the new CECL rules came into place, your loan loss reserve to loans was about 2.6%. And I think today, it's about 3.3%. Can you give us some color of directionally do you think you could get there? I know there's a lot of moving parts in change of mix of loans and different economic outlooks. But the economy looks a heck a lot better in the next 12 months than it did prepandemic and when you guys all did the day 1 reserves. And that was, of course, we didn't know the pandemic was coming back then, of course.\nMark Mason: Yes. Yes. It's a really tough question to answer because there's so many moving pieces that come into play here. So while we sit at 3.3%, as you pointed out, the macro environment continues to improve, this is based on an outlook. And as those economic variables change, whether it be U.S. unemployment or GDP, but also as our balances change, so as we continue to reenter the market, as I kind of suggested in my other response, we're going to start growing balances and we're going to start -- and that's going to impact the mix of balances that we have. And so all of those factors on top of, in our case, how the probability and severity of a downside continues to morph, become important considerations in not only answering your question, but also how we think about future reserve releases. And so I'm not trying to dodge your questions at all, but it is a question that will be a kind of a byproduct of how we get to some sense of normalcy and how the portfolio continues to evolve.\nGerard Cassidy: Got it. No, I completely understood. And Jane, I may have missed this, but I obviously sense the excitement in your voice about the new refresh on the strategy. How long -- if you have to sit back, is this a 3-, 5-year project? Any idea of the -- how long it will take to get Citi to the place where you wanted to go to?\nJane Fraser: That's an interesting question. I mean what we're looking at as we do the strategy refresh work is looking with a long-term perspective for the firm. I don't think it takes us a long time to complete the strategy refresh work, and we'll be looking forward to sharing that with everybody as we go along, as we said. And we get on with execution as soon as it makes sense. So I don't honestly know, as a former consultant, as to whether you're ever done with strategy. This world is highly dynamic. It's a fascinating world. I think part of the excitement is I'm excited about the franchise. I'm excited about the prospects of the firm. I'm also realistic, we've got quite a bit of work to do. And we're very -- Mark and I are very clear on what our priorities are. So I don't think it's going to take us very long to come back to everybody with a clearer view of where we're going. I'm looking forward to doing so and, more than anything, looking forward to getting on with it. And I don't think we're ever done.\nMark Mason: I can assure you, Gerard, that Jane is moving all of us with a sense of urgency. And that's the right focus that we should have on the strategy refresh. But Jane, you're absolutely right, strategy doesn't just stop, right? So well said.\nOperator: Your final question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja: Jane, I wanted to get -- understand from you. So you've gone through these exits as you've talked about in Latin America and now you're doing in the consumer bank and that you've announced for Asia now. What do you see as the differences in your consumer franchise in Asia versus Latin America? And pointedly, the investment sales, what is that as a percentage of revenue, for instance, in your Asia consumer bank versus Latin America? That's a little second detail on that. And will that -- will those revenues also go away? So two different questions, 1 a little higher level, but tied to it is this whole investment sales and where do you see that. And implications for your -- because what I'm trying to get is a sense of implications for your private banking revenues, which I guess are different than this investment sales revenue that shows up in the consumer bank.\nJane Fraser: Yes, and I think the differences between our Asia consumer franchises and Latin America, Latin America, let's be clear, is our franchise and Citi Banamex only today. And that's a single geography with about 20% market share and a full -- and is a full offering to the consumer as opposed to our franchises in Asia that were a bit of smaller. They're excellent franchises. As you know, they've got a good brand name. They've got terrific card franchises and an affluent client base, but they haven't had the same scale that we have in Mexico. So I do view them as rather different. And in terms of what are there -- I guess the question you're asking is what's the ramification of the divestitures for this -- for our wealth business in Asia. If you look at the individual Asian markets, the domestic capital markets are not that well developed. And so the offshore markets in Hong Kong and Singapore, and indeed in the Middle East and in the states and in London and the like, become very important markets. So the onshore wealth opportunity is usually massively dwarfed by the offshore wealth opportunity. And that's where we feel we're best placed to focus our attention and resources. What I would also say, though, is one of the advantages for Citi is we're not just an investment sales proposition, that we also do have the deposit franchise, the card franchise. We have the capital market platform for sure. We've got the ability to offer our clients tremendous managed investments. The content that we're able to offer, thanks to our ICG franchise, that's really best-in-class. I know it's quite extraordinary in the asset allocation advice. So this is really the capabilities we can provide. The client is very well diversified from lending, banking as well as the investment and the managed investment capital market revenues that you see. So I don't just think of this as investment sales. This is something that we're able to offer that's much more broad in those wealth center hubs. And the offshore is far greater than the onshore opportunity in those 13 markets. And we'll get -- you'll get more guidance on this as we go forward, as Mark said, and as Jim fleshes out the strategy and the plan that we've got. So you can expect to get some more details.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.\nElizabeth Lynn: Thank you all for joining today. Please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you again, and have a nice day.\nOperator: This concludes the first quarter 2021 earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz, and good morning to everyone. I am delighted to join you for my first earnings call as the Citi's CEO. Mark and I have a lot to cover today, so let's get cracking. Earlier today, we announced our earnings for the first quarter as well as the initial strategic actions we're taking in our Global Consumer Bank to focus on our competitive advantages and to improve our returns to our shareholders. I'll start with some observations, therefore, in the first quarter, and then I'll update you on the ongoing work on our strategy. It's been a much better-than-expected start of the year, and we are optimistic about the recovery ahead of us, and we're positioning the bank for a period of sustained growth. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $3.62 per share on net income of $7.9 billion. This was a record quarter in net income, driven by good performance in our Institutional business, and a release of $3.9 billion from our allowance for credit losses as a result of the improving economic outlook. In the Institutional Clients Group, our Markets businesses benefited yet again from an active environment. We saw solid performance in fixed income after a very strong first quarter last year and a record quarter in Equities. We also had a record quarter in Investment Banking, reflecting high levels of activity in equity underwriting. Treasury and Trade Solutions, which is the backbone of our global network grew deposits even though revenues continued to be impacted by low interest rates. Global Consumer Banking revenues were down quarter-over-quarter as a result of the pandemic. However, we clearly see a recovery taking root in Asia as well as the U.S., and that was reflected in our ACL release. And I'd note, this is the healthiest we have seen the consumer emerge from a crisis in recent history, driven in large part by the U.S. government stimulus package. Now while loan demand was down, we did see strong growth in wealth management and in digital engagement, both of which are central to the consumer franchise we are building. And our capital levels remained strong and stable, allowing us to respond to the needs of our clients and to return capital to our shareholders. At 11.7%, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was unchanged from the fourth quarter, and we resumed the repurchase of common stock which we voluntarily paused at the onset of the pandemic. Our tangible book value increased to $75.50, up 5% from a year ago. Now turning to our strategy. When we spoke in January, I pointed to 4 principles which we're using to guide the refresh of our strategy. First, we said we will be clinical in assessing which businesses we can retain or secure leading market positions in. Next, we're going to be focused by directing resources to high-returning businesses and away from the others. Third, we're going to be connected so we ensure our businesses fit well together and that they generate synergies. And last, we're going to be simpler to better serve our clients, fulfill our obligations to our regulators, and unlock value for our shareholders. We also committed to take the strategic decisions needed to best position Citi to win and to close the gap in return with our competitors, and we committed to share these decisions with you as we make them, and that's what we're doing again today. When I spoke in January about our new focus on wealth. we believe we're very well positioned to capture strong growth and attractive returns in this business, particularly in Asia and the U.S. Today, wealth at Citi represents roughly $6.5 billion in revenues, with three quarters of $1 trillion of client assets. And there's many synergies with our markets, BCMA, and commercial banking franchises across our global network. Yesterday, we announced the management team for Citi Global Wealth and the work in investments are well underway on the business strategy and growth plans. And today, we announced our decision to focus our consumer banking franchise in Asia and EMEA solely on 4 wealth centers, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE, and London. This positions us to capture the full spectrum of the wealth opportunity through these important hubs where we can serve onshore and offshore clients. And in Asia, this will allow us to continue operating our leading consumer businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong, which are both scaled and very high returning. We will, therefore, pursue exits of our consumer businesses in the remaining 13 markets in Asia and EMEA. Now, while these are excellent franchises, we don't have the scale we need to compete, and we've decided we simply aren't the best owners of them over the long term. So, consistent with the principles we outlined for the strategy refresh, we believe our capital, our investment dollars, and our other resources are better redeployed against higher returning opportunities elsewhere. What does this mean? This means that Global Consumer Banking will consist of 2 scale [ph] franchises in the U.S. and Mexico and these 4 hubs serving 100 million customers in total. Let me be very clear on one very important point. Citi will continue to invest behind and serve our institutional clients in these 13 new markets. We have a high-returning and leading institutional franchise in Asia, and it is an absolutely central part of our success going forward. And we see important opportunities to invest and gain share with our institutional clients regionwide. Indeed, I saw from my own experience in Latin America how the institutional businesses in each market really benefited from the increased focus once we have exited our subscale consumer franchises and simplified the operating model in the region. I fully expect the same will be true in Asia. And in the meantime, the comprehensive work on our strategy refresh continues. We will continue to share the decisions we make with you as we work to close the gap in returns with our peers. In parallel, we are, of course, hard at work on our transformation. We're making our next submission to the SEC this quarter. It's a massive body of work. We continue to work closely with our regulators to meet their expectations, and we expect to submit our complete plan to both regulators no later than the third quarter. We've identified the end states, performed the gap analyses and are currently working through the detailed resourcing and program plans and interdependencies and we've begun execution on several fronts. The investments required go hand-in-hand with our strategy work. So, for example, when we talk about simplification, we're pursuing it through changes to our operating model, but also by removing manual processes and controls and make no mistake about it. We want to achieve nothing less than a fundamental transformation by delivering excellence in our risk and controlled environment in our operations and in our service to clients. So, I am excited about the road ahead, and I have no doubt that these investments and others that we're going to make in talent and technology are all going to help us modernize the bank and position Citi to win. And finally, I want to update you on some of the commitments we're making in terms of ESG. Now we've prided ourselves in being a leader in many dimensions of ESG over the years. I see it as embedded in what we offer to our clients and the communities we serve around the world. And as you may know, on my first day as CEO in the beginning of March, I committed that Citi would reach net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and we will deliver our plan on how we will do so within the next 12 months. Critical to helping our clients transition to a low-carbon economy is a support we provide them through our environmental finance activities. So to that end, we're going to extend our current environmental finance target from $250 billion by 2025 to $500 billion by 2030. And in addition, we finance other activities in support of the UN's sustainable development goals outside of environmental finance. And these include our important investments in affordable housing, in health care and workforce development. We are committing an additional $500 billion to these activities by 2030, making our total sustainable development goal commitment $1 trillion by 2030. And with that, I am going to turn over to Mark, and then we will both be delighted to take your questions. Mark? Thank you very much, John. So, it's fascinating at the moment. I have a chance to go and talk to the CEOs of banks who are our clients all around the world and all of us talk about the same thing, which is there's a major transformation that's going on, a digital transformation in the industry. And so, as we look at the consent order and the transformation, the transformation we're going through is much broader than just the consent orders, although they're obviously a very critical component of it. And so as we look at the -- as we look at the investments we're making, I look at the ones that we're making in our infrastructure, in our data as very much linked into a strategic need, as well as what's being required and asked of us from the consent orders. So I gave you one of the examples just earlier. But data would be an obvious example of this, where investment that we make in the quality of our data will have a big impact for our shareholders in terms of driving revenues, improving our client experience in making faster decision-making on risk or on business decisions as well as making sure that the data that we do have is properly governed from a safety and soundness perspective. So many of the investments we've got at the moment are really the strategy and transformation work coming together as it is for many banks. Yes. And I would just jump in on this one as well. I mean I've been on a great listening tour with our investors and hearing their perspectives, and I'm very clear around our priorities, which is closing the return gap with all our peers, making sure that we put a strategy in place that has the investment profile as well as the different actions to do so. And as Mark said, this is our #1 priority. I better be careful because I could talk for hours on this one. I think we're incredibly well positioned in wealth. Mike gave you -- Mark gave you some of the visibility into the size and scale of the business today. When I look at it, we've got a phenomenal brand name, an aspirational one, in the wealth space, particularly in Asia, but around the world. We have our commercial bank which operates in 30 different geographies around the world and is where a lot of the wealth is being created. So we have relationships and are helping with the actual wealth generation and source of wealth from many of our clients as well as obviously in ICG. We've got a top-tier institutional platform and capability. And we've got our presence very well established in these major wealth hubs around the world. So I do feel we're incredibly well positioned when we can bring these different assets and capabilities into a single platform. So the investments that we've already begun making is putting a single wealth platform organization in place. We made the announcement yesterday around the leadership, you'd have seen that. We've started investing in growing our relationship managers and FAs around the world and really bringing together the best of the firm. And I expect, as we work on the technology plan, we'll have some different tech stack lined up against that, too. So Jim O'Donnell, putting the plans together right now, but we see this as a tremendous opportunity, and you'll be able to measure us and hold us to account for this in terms of the returns that we generate, the growth in the fee income and continuing to steadily capture share in the years ahead. Erika, great question and certainly what I have heard loud and clear from many of our investors as well as we've been talking with them. Look, the U.S. is our home market. We have to get it right. It's a great franchise in terms of brand, the client base that we have around the country. We certainly see upside potential in wealth, as we've been talking about. We have a large cards business where the pandemic has accelerated the cross-sale of our broader banking proposition. And I think the broader theme of digitization, we have very high-quality clients in and out of footprint. And they've been very digitally engaged, and that's only increased. 50% of the new accounts this quarter in the retail bank were acquired digitally and about 75% of our clients, for example, are digitally engaged already. And we have tremendous partnerships. So I think we've got some -- we've got terrific assets and building blocks. But as you said, the work is going on right now on the strategy refresh. And we're looking forward to coming back to you in reasonably short order when we've done the work and have the plan on what actions we will take. We're looking longer run. And for now, partnerships are going to be very important. But we'd love to do inorganic moves if they make sense for our shareholders and for us further down the line. But at the moment, we'll focus on partnerships. No, I think you said it very well, Mark. Remediation is tactical. Transformation is more strategic and much more fundamental, and that's what we're doing. We take a soup to nuts approach. We're looking at the target states we want to get to, making sure that we've got real excellence in what we do. And that is the focus. So we're looking forward rather than looking backwards. Oh, you can -- you absolutely do both at the same time, and that's what we're very focused on. As I say, the transformation and the -- the work on the transformation, the strategy in many ways go hand-in-hand and are getting us to the same goal, which is make sure we're excellent for our investors, for our clients as well as for our regulators and the safety and soundness agenda. So the two go very much hand-in-hand. Risk and controls are clearly important, particularly in a digital world, and we need them to be at a very high standard to operate as one of the world's most significant financial institutions. That's the intention as is the intention to make sure our operations are the same. So one in the same goal here. Yes, so in terms of -- why don't we go start off with timing and... Yes, I can chuck the reserve one over to you, Mark. So in terms of timing, look, we're already getting going, there's no dillydallying here. What we're looking at doing is we've begun the work. The actions are underway in several markets. We'll look to complete the exits in a timely fashion and we expect to be out in some markets this quarter. Equally, this is -- we're going to be thoughtful about who the buyers are and the -- how we do this and the value that we create for shareholders in the process. So while there is urgency on action, we're going to make sure that this is a good move for our shareholders and act appropriately. And the timing is going to be driven by regulatory approvals in different geographies. So as Mark said, as we know more, we'll update you on the process, but we've been very transparent about what we're intending to do. And then in terms of Mexico, look, Mexico is a scaled franchise. When I compare Mexico to our Asian consumer franchises, they really benefit from their scale. The returns are good. And there's a lot of upside potential there. The investments in digitization have really paid off. So while the country is going through a very challenging time at the moment, there's a lot to like in the franchise over the longer term. And we'll give you a better sense of the strategy there as we carry on the strategy refresh work. But a lot to like. Mark, do you want to cover the reserves? Yes. So interesting question, Mike. And frankly, I look at it in terms of what we want to be, not what we don't, because what you don't want to be kind of falls out a bit pretty easily. So the main consideration we have is how do we close the return gap with our peers and make sure that the businesses we're in that can win. And we're very disciplined about going back to those principles I laid out at the very beginning and we talked about back in January, we've been using this consistently in the strategy refresh work. So the first thing we're looking at is, is this sector or is this client segment or is this business? Does it have attractive dynamics as we look out over the medium and long term? And importantly, within those dynamics, can we win? Does this make -- can we be well positioned in this? And I think we're certainly seeing in the world of financial services today that scale is obviously a very important consideration. So the corollary of that is if you don't have scale, that's usually a disadvantage. We look at it in terms of connectivity. I think it's very, very important that we have synergies across our major platforms and our client segments. And you'll hear us talking about that a lot more going forward and what are some of the metrics that we'll look at to demonstrate that we're really capturing those synergies. We look at fees and returns. So therefore, if it's capital, is it generating returns? Are we getting the growth? We're efficient on the fee revenues relative to what Mark and I would like to be. So that becomes a consideration. And then does it really fit with the strategic identity that we have for Citi and we're working on as part of the refresh? If it's yes, then this is a candidate for investment, laying out what the strategy is. If it's not, it's the opposite. And dispositions, we're always going to take into time -- into consideration timing. As I said in the last question, there's no fire sales here. We are going to be thoughtful on how we ensure we generate value for shareholders on the exit at the potential value of partnerships with the potential buyers, et cetera and how best can we monetize and generate value as we do this. So in many ways, it's a little bit of all of the above on your list, but we kind of -- we start in the opposite place, if you know what I mean. What are we going to be, and then focus on making sure that we generate the greatest value from that. And the other decisions kind of fall out of it pretty quickly. And I think you can see that being demonstrated in the decisions we made on both why wealth and the hubs that we're investing in, in Asia and EMEA, but then equally, the other decisions on the remaining 13 markets on consumer being the exit. Citigroup is fabulous, Mike. When -- again, when I go back to what have our investors been talking to me about, the areas that -- as we've been going around and listening to them, they want us to have -- they want us to close the gap of the returns with our peers. I think Mark's given some indication. I mean as we see a more normal -- when we see a normalized rate environment, we get the strategy there, a mid-tier range seems reasonable, but I would certainly add and let us do the work, because I want to make sure that we have a very thoughtful strategy and we've got clarity around it. And when you ask us about what is Citi going to be, we'll be back to you with, again, a lot more precision and clarity around it. But I think you can see from some of the moves that we've got, we want to be -- we really want to be excellent. And that's not just in terms of how we serve our clients, many of whom are very -- have global needs, and there's a lot of consistency around that. But also, I would say what Citi is, I want the word excellent to be one that is used about us in our operations, in our culture, in our accountability and in what we do. And so that's the word you'll hear from me a lot, and that's the standard I'm holding myself and the firm to. So sorry, just in terms -- I just want to make sure I'm understanding the question, you're asking in terms of the benefits of digitization? Yes. When I look at the -- in LatAm, the benefits we got were pretty tremendous. So I think, first of all, we were able to very much focus on our strengths in our institutional franchise. We were able to make sure that we had truly world-class talent. We invested in our technology and platforms. We were very focused on that client base of the multinationals we serve there, in particular, in the investor base, engaged in Latin America. And we drove the returns up from teenagers to mid-20s in a pretty short period of time. We rose up the rankings in the banking side and really solidified our leadership on the institutional front. I'd also say we simplified the management structure as well in the region and gained quite a lot of benefits from simplification that hit the bottom line as well. So I'd say my experience has been one in which there's real benefit from focus. You get better at the businesses that you're in. You get strong talent and you're able to bring more focused talent. That's what's different. And you get -- you're able to really get the linkages across the different businesses and hone in on them. Mark, I don't think -- I don't know if you've got anything else to add because you and I are both in these journeys together. Yes. You're going to hear quite a lot more about our TTS business and the services platform it represents for so many of our clients around the world. The client -- in my discussion with clients over the last few months, they love our TTS platform. More than that, they depend upon it. It is strategic for them, the different services, the data it represents, the other dimensions of it. And so the growth that we're going to see from this next year is, I think it's going to be very material. You'll hear us also talk more about the commercial bank going forward as well because the mid-market clients and the born digital clients are ones who use our TTS platform and their capabilities and services around it to also themselves start growing internationally and it becomes a core part of them. So this is -- we've got more to grow with our existing clients. We've got a lot of new clients that are coming on board this. And this is going to be an exciting part of the story going forward and the underlying opportunities here separate to the rates environment. Yes. I'll kick off with a little bit more on the macro side. Mark will jump in on some of the other important dimensions for ourselves. Look, it's asynchronous growth out there is what we're seeing. I think you're seeing that U.S. and China is certainly leading the recovery with Asia. Europe is delayed, but certainly not derailed. And parts of the emerging markets are struggling. So you do see a different picture in different parts of the world. And as I think you heard from me at the beginning of the call, we're pretty optimistic about the U.S. in particular over the next few years. There's a lot of unspent savings out there with consumers. Huge amount of liquidity in the market. Corporate balance sheets are broadly healthy. And then you've also got a lot of dynamism from digitization that's changing consumer behaviors and driving investment. So overall, it's certainly a very improved outlook around the world, but it is an asynchronous one. And we're seeing, as Mark had talked about, strong pipelines, a lot of client engagement, a lot of client activity. But Mark, why don't I turn to you on how you're seeing some of this translate? Chris, so in terms of the exit markets, I'd say it's probably a tad early to speculate on the buyers. These are fabulous franchises, and we've got really tremendous talent, tremendous capabilities there in the individual markets. And so we expect to get a lot of interest. But as to who and what, I'm certainly not going to speculate yet. When you ask about operational linkages, I mean this is something, as Mark said, he and I have gone through quite a few divestitures in different geographies. And we are well skilled at how to make sure that we can separate out the consumer franchises and then invest in the capabilities for the ICG businesses. It's not been a problem in any of the divestitures that we've done, which were many. I think it was about 11 or 12 across Latin America and others before. So our team is good at this. It's not going to be an issue. And in fact, it will enable us, as we said, to target our investments more into the institutional platforms and wealth in the hubs, as we talked about. And then in terms of Branded Cards, do Branded Cards go as part of the sale? Yes is the very simple answer to that one. Transaction services, of course, remains an important part of the franchises in these 13 geographies. And so our capabilities in commercial cards and our capabilities and payments, et cetera, for the GTS side of the business remain intact and will be invested in. That's an interesting question. I mean what we're looking at as we do the strategy refresh work is looking with a long-term perspective for the firm. I don't think it takes us a long time to complete the strategy refresh work, and we'll be looking forward to sharing that with everybody as we go along, as we said. And we get on with execution as soon as it makes sense. So I don't honestly know, as a former consultant, as to whether you're ever done with strategy. This world is highly dynamic. It's a fascinating world. I think part of the excitement is I'm excited about the franchise. I'm excited about the prospects of the firm. I'm also realistic, we've got quite a bit of work to do. And we're very -- Mark and I are very clear on what our priorities are. So I don't think it's going to take us very long to come back to everybody with a clearer view of where we're going. I'm looking forward to doing so and, more than anything, looking forward to getting on with it. And I don't think we're ever done. Yes, and I think the differences between our Asia consumer franchises and Latin America, Latin America, let's be clear, is our franchise and Citi Banamex only today. And that's a single geography with about 20% market share and a full -- and is a full offering to the consumer as opposed to our franchises in Asia that were a bit of smaller. They're excellent franchises. As you know, they've got a good brand name. They've got terrific card franchises and an affluent client base, but they haven't had the same scale that we have in Mexico. So I do view them as rather different. And in terms of what are there -- I guess the question you're asking is what's the ramification of the divestitures for this -- for our wealth business in Asia. If you look at the individual Asian markets, the domestic capital markets are not that well developed. And so the offshore markets in Hong Kong and Singapore, and indeed in the Middle East and in the states and in London and the like, become very important markets. So the onshore wealth opportunity is usually massively dwarfed by the offshore wealth opportunity. And that's where we feel we're best placed to focus our attention and resources. What I would also say, though, is one of the advantages for Citi is we're not just an investment sales proposition, that we also do have the deposit franchise, the card franchise. We have the capital market platform for sure. We've got the ability to offer our clients tremendous managed investments. The content that we're able to offer, thanks to our ICG franchise, that's really best-in-class. I know it's quite extraordinary in the asset allocation advice. So this is really the capabilities we can provide. The client is very well diversified from lending, banking as well as the investment and the managed investment capital market revenues that you see. So I don't just think of this as investment sales. This is something that we're able to offer that's much more broad in those wealth center hubs. And the offshore is far greater than the onshore opportunity in those 13 markets. And we'll get -- you'll get more guidance on this as we go forward, as Mark said, and as Jim fleshes out the strategy and the plan that we've got. So you can expect to get some more details."

            "content": "Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Let me briefly review the results for the quarter, and then I'll go into more detail on the strategic refresh and specific actions we announced earlier today. Overall, we had a stronger-than-expected start to the year, driven by a constructive capital markets backdrop as well as a benefit from the cost of credit for the quarter. For the quarter, Citigroup reported net income of $7.9 billion. Revenues declined 7% from the prior year, while we saw continued strength in Investment Banking and a solid markets performance, it was more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates, along with lower card loans in consumer and the absence of the prior year mark-to-market gains on loan hedges. Expenses were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued investments in our transformation, including infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit performance remained strong, with net credit losses of $1.7 billion, more than offset by an ACL release of $3.9 billion driven primarily by an improvement in our macroeconomic outlook as well as lower loan balances. EPS was $3.62 and RoTCE was just over 20%. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 10% year-over-year, reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer. Deposits grew 7%, reflecting consistent client engagement with both corporate and consumer clients continuing to hold higher levels of liquidity. Before I go into more detail on each business, on Slide 4, I'd like to cover the strategic refresh that Jane discussed earlier. Last quarter, we spoke about the significant opportunity wealth represents for Citi going forward and announced the formation of Citi Global Wealth in order to better connect assets and capabilities across the consumer and institutional franchises and to transform the way we serve clients across the wealth spectrum. We've continued the build-out of Citi Global Wealth this quarter and have provided some details on the scope of the business on the slide, with additional information on key drivers in the appendix. Citi Global Wealth represented roughly $6.6 billion in allocated annual revenues. And it delivered 15% growth in investment revenues last year, driven by higher client activity and growth in client investment assets. As we continue to integrate the component businesses into a single wealth platform, we will finalize how best to implement this strategy from an organizational standpoint over the coming quarters and update you accordingly. Turning next to the actions we announced today. Given our strategic focus on global wealth management, we announced the decision to focus our Global Consumer Banking presence in Asia and EMEA on 4 wealth centers. As Jane mentioned, this strategic shift will allow us to simplify our operating model, while directing investments and resources to the businesses where we have competitive advantages and the scale necessary to drive higher returns over the long run. Let me describe the 13 markets where we will pursue an exit, shown on the slide, with added details in the appendix. Last year, these businesses contributed roughly $4 billion of revenues. And while historically profitable, like other consumer businesses, the impact of CECL weighed on full year results given the pandemic, with cost of credit nearly doubling in these markets year-over-year. Total assets were $82 billion as of the end of 2020, and the businesses are supported by roughly $7 billion of allocated TCE. We have a good track record of reducing expenses in similar situations. However, as noted on the slide, we are including fully allocated expenses to these markets, which could differ somewhat from the ultimate expense reductions. We will continue to manage these markets as part of the GCB franchise but we already have relevant actions well underway. We plan to share more information with you as we make progress against these and other actions as part of our ongoing strategy refresh. Finally, I want to emphasize a point that Jane made earlier. We will continue to serve ICG clients, including our commercial banking clients, in all these markets. And more broadly, this strategic shift will allow us to focus more investments on ICG in Asia. Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients group. We delivered a solid performance in the quarter, driven by strong execution in the constructive operating environment. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $7.7 billion, up 65% from last year. Revenues decreased 2%, reflecting the absence of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges seen last year. Excluding this, revenues were up 5%, with 9% growth in banking and 2% growth in markets and security services. Expenses increased 8%, reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls, along with other strategic investments, higher compensation cost and volume-driven growth. Credit costs were down considerably, given a $1.9 billion ACL release. The release this quarter primarily reflected improvements in the outlook for global GDP as well as modest improvements in portfolio credit quality. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.1%, including 3.6% on the non-investment-grade portion. Total net credit losses were $186 million, and ICG delivered a 25.7% return on allocated capital. Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Product revenues were up 5%, driven by record revenues in both equity underwriting and equity trading. Looking at these strong results across our overarching equities franchise, we feel good about the strategic investments we've been making which enabled us to leverage our full service model to better monetize the current market. On the banking side, revenues increased 9%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were down 10% in constant dollars, as good client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenues. Despite these headwinds, we continue to see strength in our underlying business drivers, including 14% growth in average deposits in constant dollars this quarter. And over the past year, we've seen significant increases in digital adoption and penetration as well as 7% growth in cross-border flows and 6% growth in clearing volumes. Investment Banking experienced its best quarter ever with revenues up 46%, driven by equity underwriting given our leading position in the SPAC market. Private Bank revenues grew 8%, also its best quarter ever, driven by higher lending volumes and managed investments revenues. Corporate Lending revenues were also up 8%, reflecting the absence of prior year marks, partially offset by lower volumes. Total Markets & Securities Services revenues increased 2% from last year. Fixed Income revenues decreased 5%, reflecting a strong performance in rates and currencies last year. However, spread products revenues were up from the prior year as clients search for yield in this low rate environment, with steady demand across flow and structured products. Equities revenues were up 26% versus last year, driven by cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and roughly flat in constant dollars. Here, we saw good growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients driven by growth in deposits, assets under custody and settlement volumes, offset by lower spreads. Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 7. While we are still seeing the impact of the pandemic and high payment rates on revenues, consumer spending continues to improve and credit remains healthy, pointing to a recovery as we move through the year. For the quarter, GCB delivered EBIT of $2.8 billion, up significantly from last year, primarily driven by improved credit costs. Revenues declined 15% as lower card balances and lower interest rates across all 3 regions were partially offset by continued strong deposit growth and momentum in wealth management. Expenses decreased 1% as efficiency savings and lower volume-related costs were partially offset by investments. Credit costs decreased significantly driven by an ACL reserve release in all 3 regions and lower net credit losses. The release this quarter primarily reflected lower volumes as well as improvements in the macro outlook. And GCB delivered a 25% return on allocated capital. Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues were down 15% from last year, primarily driven by lower cards revenues. Branded cards revenues were down 11%, reflecting a 15% decline in average loans as clients are using the liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt. Retail Services revenues were down 26%, reflecting higher partner payments as well as lower average loans. Net interest revenues were down 18% as average loans declined by 13% on higher payment rates. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower forecasted losses and, therefore, higher income sharing. Looking more broadly on our cards businesses, we're continuing to see a recovery in sales activity. In Branded Cards, total purchase sales were unchanged year-over-year, but essential spend was up 12%, and we are starting to see the recovery in areas like travel and dining. And in Retail Services, purchase sales grew 4%. So purchase sales are improving slightly faster than our prior expectations. And with the vaccine rollout, this should support a further recovery in discretionary spend. The bigger impact on loans is from the high payment rates. This is creating revenue pressure, but it's also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends. So the good news is that we're seeing the recovery in spend, which should continue, and our credit portfolio is proving to be quite resilient. We are now focused on loan and revenue recovery through driving spend activity, reentering the market for new account acquisitions, and investing in lending capabilities and new value propositions. Turning to Retail Banking. Revenues were down 8% year-over-year, reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads. That said, we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships. Average deposits were up 22%, including 30% growth in checking. And AUMs were up 32%. We're also continuing to broaden our digital capabilities to extend from deposits to wealth management to mortgage lending. As Jane mentioned, we're committed to the franchise, and all of this gives us confidence in our ability to scale our U.S. retail bank with a digitally led, client-centric approach supported by light physical expansion in new markets over time. On Slide 9, we show the results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 12% year-over-year in the first quarter. We continue to see good momentum in wealth management as investment revenues grew 22% with a 14% increase in Citigold clients and 13% growth in net new money. And the numbers are meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the 4 global wealth hubs. Average deposit growth remained strong at 13%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Card revenues remained under pressure year-over-year, with purchase sales down 5% and average loans down 13%, given a continued significant impact on travel in the region. However, we are seeing some signs of a recovery, with the pickup in new card acquisitions and purchase sales year-over-year in the month of March. Turning to Latin America. Total consumer revenues declined 16% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits and assets under management in Mexico this quarter, with average balances up 9% and AUMs up 17%. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continue to decline given the macro environment. Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. In the U.S., both NCL and delinquency rates remained favorable, driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs. Given the delinquency trends we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021. And so peak losses may not occur until late 2022, depending on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit. By contrast, in both Mexico and Asia, we saw a peak in credit losses in the first quarter of 2021. This was expected driven by the impact of customer accounts rolling off relief programs. The impact was pronounced in Mexico, with a peak NCL rate of over 10%, as we saw most customers roll off the relief programs at the end of the third quarter of last year. Excluding those accounts that participated in relief programs, our credit trends in both Mexico and Asia remain stable. And you can see improvement this quarter in delinquency rates. Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were roughly flat in dollar terms as the impact of lower rates was offset by the absence of marks versus the prior year as well as some episodic gains this quarter. Expenses were down 1% as investments in infrastructure, risk and controls were roughly offset by the allocation of certain costs to the businesses. This change had no impact to EBIT at the Citi level. And given it was immaterial, we have not reflected the change retrospectively. Credit costs declined year-over-year driven by a release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year. Finally, the pretax loss was $231 million this quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect a quarterly pretax loss in the range of $500 million for the remainder of 2021, although with some variation quarter-to-quarter. Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.2 billion this quarter declined $1.4 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances as well as the impact of 1 fewer day versus last year, partially offset by slightly higher trading-related NIR. Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize and, excluding the impact of 2 fewer days in the quarter, was roughly flat to the fourth quarter. And net interest margin declined 5 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenues, partially offset by treasury actions and balance sheet optimization. Turning to noninterest revenues. In the first quarter, non-NIR declined slightly to just over $9 billion, predominantly driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges offsetting strong Investment Banking revenues. On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics, which, as Jane mentioned, remained strong and stable again this quarter, allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders. Our CET1 capital ratio remained 11.7% as net income was roughly offset by buybacks and dividends, along with the impact of OCI and an increase in risk-weighted assets. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $2.7 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $1.6 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% to $75.50, driven by net income. Before we move to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. First, our full year top line outlook has improved since last quarter. At that time, coming off the performance of 2020, we had expected industry wallets to return closer to the 2019 levels this year. Given the strong start to the year as well as the increasingly positive signs of a recovery ahead, we now believe wallets will be somewhat higher relative to 2019. Meanwhile, our outlook for net interest revenues is unchanged, and we continue to expect a decline in net interest revenues of somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion, with stabilization continuing into the second quarter and an improvement in the back half. Taken together, this suggests revenues down in the mid single-digit range, better than our prior guidance for a mid- to high single-digit range decline. Second, on the expense side, we continue to expect full year expenses to increase in the range of 2% to 3%, mostly driven by investments related to our transformation agenda. In addition, we could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing. And as I mentioned earlier, we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials. Finally, on cost of credit, we continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to credit performance. And depending on the macroeconomic outlook, we could see further reserve releases, although given the size of the reserve release this quarter, we would not expect to see the same magnitude of ACL release going forward. With that, Jane and I are happy to take any questions. Yes. Thanks, John. As Jane has referenced, it is, and I've referenced in the past, it is a multiyear effort, and we've been working very diligently on identifying the gaps that we have and identifying the root causes. And as Jane has mentioned, we're working very aggressively on constructing the plans to move towards more comprehensive execution, but those plans have to come together, and we're still working through that. And as you've mentioned, I've been very clear as we develop the information as to what we can expect in the way of headwinds, that 2% to 3% this year, $1 billion in the prior year. And as we as we bring those plans together, I'll continue to share openly what our best estimates are for how the expenses continue to evolve. What I would say, John, is that, and I say this a lot, I guess, these are investments. As Jane mentioned, there are benefits that we expect from them. The data was a great example as to how we leverage that with our clients but also how getting that quality data in and not having to rework it and reconcile it, et cetera, et cetera, saves us on the operating cost as well. And I highlight that because as we make more investments, we will undoubtedly continue to seek out productivity opportunities that move to offset those. Sure. Look, I think this is one of the reasons why it's so important that we're doing a refresh that Jane has described. It allows us to very clearly focus on the parts of the franchise where we think we have a significant competitive advantage. And as Jane has mentioned, those are going to be the parts of the franchise where we allocate more resources, both in the way of expense dollars and investments, but also in the way of capital allocation so that we can capture the growth that we see with client opportunities there. And after that, after kind of ensuring that we're capturing those opportunities that deliver returns, that are consistent with our objective of narrowing the gap to peers, then we want to, obviously return excess capital to shareholders as we've been doing. So that's the way we think about it. First, let's lead with what is the strategy. Second, let's make sure that strategy is rooted in growth opportunities and commensurate returns that make sense for us. Let's allocate capital there to take advantage of that. And then what's left, let's return it to shareholders. Sure. Thank you. So the first thing, just in terms of revenue, I did speak to this in the guidance. And what I referenced was, I talked about in the last quarter, the normalization of the markets' wallets and what we're seeing just at the on start of this year and the strong start that Jane referenced is that while I do expect there'll be some normalization, I would expect at this point that the market wallets will be above the 2019 levels. And so we do think that, that presents some upside. I talked about the -- and that's what kind of feeds in part the down mid-single-digit guidance that I gave for total revenues. You're right with the steepening of the curve. That does present some opportunities. We've got dry powder to put liquidity to work. And we've done some of that, but we have more dry powder to do that. With that said, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing higher payment rates from the consumer business that offsets some of that potential upside. And I did describe the NIR in the way of a range, down $1 billion to $2 billion. And so that range gives you some sense for the ability or the opportunity if we were to capture more of that upside. In terms of the expenses, two things. One, you mentioned relative to revenues. And the answer is that if wallets continue to perform even stronger or the recovery is even more significant on the lending side or consumer side or ICG side for that matter, then that will come with higher expenses, transaction expenses, compensation expenses. But I think everyone would agree that, that would be good cholesterol. And so we'll see how that plays out. Obviously, I did mention episodic costs associated with the exits. What I'd say about that is -- and your point around allocations, both Jane and I have deep experience at this. I have experience from Citi Holdings and being part of that team and ultimately running Citi Holdings. Jane has run Latin America. Both of those parts of the franchise historically have exited countries, and we have both been keenly focused on ensuring that we get as much of the stranded costs associated with exits out of the organization in the past. And you can rest assure that, that would be the same type of focus we put to these exits. So that's kind of the view there. I don't have a ratio that I'd want to share at this point. But please know that, that will be a focal point for us in order to ensure that we get the most value out of this decision. Yes, sure. Why don't I start and then, Jane, you may have some thoughts on it as well. What I'd say is, look, this is -- the consent order was clear in its way of directives in areas that we need to focus. As Jane has described, we're looking at this, frankly, a little bit broader. We're looking at this as a transformation. And it will take -- it is a multiyear effort that is underway here. Yes, there are some things that you heard us referenced that we had started even before the order. There were a number of remediation efforts that were underway in some of the areas that are referenced in the order. We're leveraging the work that we had started already. But candidly, what's different about this transformation versus a remediation is that we're looking at this end-to-end as opposed to a very narrow or silo or tactical approach to an issue that's identified. And in order to do that, you do have to pause for a second, take a step back and look at things on the front end of a process where things come into our systems and understand how you can improve those processes, the technology that support them, the governance around that. I highlight that because your answer is -- your question is a tough question. There's some of it that we will keep accelerating, but we want to make sure that we do that in a broader context so that we get it right. And that's what's really important to us. Jane, anything you want to add to that? To your point, Jane, exiting these 13 countries, that simplifies the organization, right? Creating Citi Global Wealth and bringing what was the private bank and our wealth organization and consumer together allows for us to come up with an investment platform, a unified investment platform. That simplifies the organization, makes it easier to have controls in place around those processes. So Jane is exactly right, the strategy is aligned with the transformation that's underway in many ways. Jane, you want to start? And then I can piggyback on that. Yes, and then I'll take the reserver. Yes. So let me just -- I guess I'll make a couple of comments and I don't think I'm going to get into a specific reserve number, so apologies for that. But what I will say is, as you see what we shared on the page that it's roughly breakeven in 2020, and we all recognize in 2020 there were significant reserves established in light of the pandemic, what I'd say is if we would look at 2019, which would have been a more normalized year, the EBIT associated with the 13 markets would have been a little bit under $1 billion or so. And so it gives you some sense for how the build in reserves, at least to some extent, has impacted what the financials are that we've shared here. And again, as we go through these transactions, we'll be appropriately transparent with the impact that we see from them. Yes, Jane, I think you captured it well. The only thing I'd emphasize in terms of kind of what's different now as we go at this is -- or the last couple of points you made, which is that keen focus on making sure that you've got -- that we've got the right talent in the right places as we go through this strategy refresh and ensuring that the org structure supports that. Again, I go back to the wealth example and the resetting of that org structure. You can point to the idea of moving commercial into ICG to ensure that you got that focus against that strategy and you can really capture the linkages across the firm. And then the last piece is the focused investment. We're moving away from kind of a spreading of the investments and really wanting to focus them on where we think the biggest growth opportunities are and where the highest returns are. But I think you captured it all, Jane. Yes, sure, why don't I start? And then Jane, you can add on as you'd like in terms of some of the client perspective. But look, the revenues, you're right, were down about 10% year-over-year on an ex FX basis. And you hit it right on the head. I mean, the low rate environment that we've been in is a very big driver in what we've seen in the aggregate TTS revenues now. Now we have seen higher deposit volumes, and that obviously plays through with that impact. What I would say in terms of your broader question, what we look at is, one, the engagement that we have with clients. And we have very meaningful, significant engagement with clients throughout the entire crisis that we've been managing through. And that engagement kind of plays through. And the increase in number of accounts, digital accounts that we've opened for them, really kind of reinforcing some of the investments that we've been making in onboarding and enhancing -- and in enhancing our digital capability, that engagement plays through in the clearing activity and cross-border transactions that we've seen, which are both up 6% and 7% over the past 12 months. So good solid underlying drivers. While we do see pressure on commercial card activity, fee revenues ex commercial card activity has been good. And frankly, as we see the economy recover and we look at some of the GDP forecast and that starts to play out, we would expect to see the business activity turn in a way that starts to play through the top line. But we see again, very, very strong continued engagement with our clients and with how they're evolving their own strategies. And the last example I'd mention is many of our clients with the acceleration of digitization are focused on business-to-consumer activity. And that's an important area of growth. And we're part of that dialogue. We're part of creating that solution as it relates to their business model or business models. Jane, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that. Yes. Let me make a -- I guess I'll make a couple of comments. One, we are seeing continued pressure on our consumer business, right? So we talked about loan volumes being down, particularly in Branded Cards, almost 15% or 15%. Retail Services average loans, down 13%. What I would say is we are seeing signs of the recovery. And while those loans are down, payment rates remain high. That helps from a cost of credit point of view. And purchase sales are starting to show some good signs. So Branded Cards purchase sales were flat year-over-year. The Retail Services purchase sales were up 4% year-over-year. And the outlook is positive in terms of kind of GDP and unemployment. And so the stimulus that's out there still has to play out in North America. But we are optimistic that consumer spending trends look like they're going to go favorable. And that will undoubtedly help the forecast that I spoke to, which is recovery in NIR and some loan activity towards the back half of the year. On the corporate ICG side, similarly, we're certainly seeing good signs as it relates to the markets activity, we've talked about that, and that's continued since last year. But when I think about even ICG loans, we've seen loan activity in the private bank. We've seen loan activity in parts of markets. And so those are good. And loan activity as it relates to trade, which is -- which are all good signs of the recovery that we're all marching towards. Yes. Let me mention a couple of things on that. So one is -- let's take it in pieces. So Latin America, on the chart on Slide 10, big jump in the -- in the quarter, almost 11% of NCLs. But again, that is a byproduct of customers coming off of the relief program in the third quarter. And as we look at the delinquency buckets, we're not seeing meaningful signs of increases in those buckets. And that gives us comfort in the case of Latin America that we've reached the peak there. Similarly for other regions, there are no signs in the delinquency bucket to suggest that we're going to see big increases in our NCLs. And in fact, in North America, what you heard me say is that we likely would not see that until late in 2022. And so it's the payment rates that we're seeing. It's the low activity as it relates to the delinquency buckets. It's obviously the impact of stimulus playing through all of that, that give us some comfort at this stage that we're not likely to see a pop in NCL certainly in 2021. Yes. I mean, look, as you know, we're managing through this crisis. But if you look back to early last year and the second quarter last year, this was about ensuring that clients had an appropriate level of liquidity. And that has continued to happen, as you see in our deposit growth, as you've heard others mention, as you've seen monetary action there. Our corporate clients have lots of liquidity by and large. And they have a -- many of the clients we serve have the option of how they want to access the market for that liquidity. And you saw that in some of the ECM, DCM activity through the balance of last year and even some of it continuing. So long-winded way of saying it is -- this is a client-driven business. This is about client demand. And so it's not a question of risk appetite. Risk appetite is always important. We operate inside of our risk appetite framework always. But the dynamic that you're seeing here is about client demand. Yes. Again, the card dynamic here is about ensuring that we get the timing right as it relates to market reentry, right? And so obviously coming into this, we wanted to be very thoughtful about how we managed our risk and we tightened risk criteria in order to ensure that we would manage responsibly through this pandemic. And now as we sit here and see all the signs of recovery that you've heard us mention, it's about a responsible reopening, right, and ensuring that we're targeting the customers that we want longer term, the existing customers that we're opening line availability to them where that makes sense, in the case of our Retail Services that we are pursuing new account acquisitions both there as well as in Branded Cards. So it's about that reentry strategy and consistent with the target market customer that you've heard us describe before, which tends to be of a higher quality. Yes. Yes. It's a really tough question to answer because there's so many moving pieces that come into play here. So while we sit at 3.3%, as you pointed out, the macro environment continues to improve, this is based on an outlook. And as those economic variables change, whether it be U.S. unemployment or GDP, but also as our balances change, so as we continue to reenter the market, as I kind of suggested in my other response, we're going to start growing balances and we're going to start -- and that's going to impact the mix of balances that we have. And so all of those factors on top of, in our case, how the probability and severity of a downside continues to morph, become important considerations in not only answering your question, but also how we think about future reserve releases. And so I'm not trying to dodge your questions at all, but it is a question that will be a kind of a byproduct of how we get to some sense of normalcy and how the portfolio continues to evolve. I can assure you, Gerard, that Jane is moving all of us with a sense of urgency. And that's the right focus that we should have on the strategy refresh. But Jane, you're absolutely right, strategy doesn't just stop, right? So well said."

        "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to Citi\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJen Landis: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Jen and Happy New Year to, everyone, joining us today. We are very much off and running as we start 2023. Today, I will share our perspective on the macro environment before recapping our performance in the fourth quarter. And then I will take a few minutes to reflect on our progress in 2022 and our strategic priorities for the coming year. The global macro environment played out largely as we anticipated during the second half of last year. As we enter 2023, environments have had better than we all expected for the time being at least, despite the aggressive tightening by Central Bank. In Europe, a warmer December reduced the stress on energy supplies and inflation is beginning to ease off its peak. That said, we still expect softening of economic conditions across the Eurozone this year given some of the structural challenges it is grappling with. In Asia, while the public health impact in China are unfortunately likely to be severe, the abrupt end of COVID Zero should begin to drive growth and improve sentiment generally. And here at home, the labor market remains strong and holiday spending was better than expected, in part because consumers have been dipping into their savings. The Fed remains resolute in tackling core inflation however and therefore, we continue to see the U.S. entering into a mild recession in the second half of the year. Now turning to how we performed. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $2.5 billion and EPS of $1.16. Our full year revenue growth of 3% ex-divestitures was in line with the guidance we gave you at Investor Day as was the case with our expenses. We delivered an ROTCE of nearly 9% and a CET1 ratio of 13%. This quarter, our businesses performed similarly to how they did throughout the year and we are quite pleased with some and less happy with the performance of others. Services continues to deliver cracking revenue growth. Our markets businesses are navigating the environment very well and we are seeing good momentum in U.S. Personal Banking. On the flipside, investment banking felt the pain of a drastically smaller wallet in \u201922, and the environment for wealth remained a challenging one. Unpacking that a bit, services delivered another excellent quarter and we have gained significant share in both Treasury and Trade Solutions and security services. TTS, the business most emblematic of the power of our global network had revenues up 36% year-over-year as we execute on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. Thanks to strong business drivers, coupled with higher rates, TTS is performing ahead of our expectations. Likewise, Securities Services was up a strong 22%. We ended the year having onboarded $1.2 trillion of new assets under administration and custody. Markets had the best fourth quarter in recent memory, with revenues up 18% from 2021. We have the number one FICC franchise on the street during the first three quarters of the year and fixed income was up 31% in the final quarter. Equities was down as the mix of client activity, again, did not play to our strength in derivatives. With the wallet down significantly, our investment banking revenues were off by about 60% this quarter. While the pipeline looks more promising and client sentiment is improving, it would be hard to precisely predict when the tide will turn in \u201823. Wealth Management\u2019s performance was disappointing. Revenues were down 6% in the quarter, with the macro environment creating headwinds in investment fees and AUM globally, but most acutely in Asia. However, we have been steadily improving the business as demonstrated by continued momentum in client acquisitions across the spectrum and net new investment flows. Similarly, we continue to build our client advisor base albeit at a slower pace given this environment. We would expect to see these investments pay off as the markets recover. In U.S. Personal Banking, both cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth for the second straight quarter as purchase sales and revolving balances continued to grow strongly. Whilst in retail banking, we clearly have some more work to do. As you know, we have been actively managing our balance sheet and risk. Our cost of credit increased in line with our guidance. We built reserves in Personal Banking this quarter on the back of volume growth as well as in anticipation of a mild recession. And in the U.S., net credit losses in cards continue to normalize as we had expected, still well below pre-COVID levels. Corporate credit remains healthy and our low overall cost of credit was similar to last quarter, reflecting the quality of our corporate loan portfolio. In terms of capital, we increased the CET1 ratio by about 70 basis points to 13% during the fourth quarter. And finally, our tangible book value per share increased to $81.65 and we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through our common dividend. Now, let me step back and discuss what we accomplished in 2022. One of our major goals last year was to put in place a strategic plan designed to create long-term value for our shareholders and to get that plan swiftly off the ground. I am pleased with the significant progress we have already made. We simplified the bank, closing sales of our consumer businesses in 5 markets, including 3 in the fourth quarter. And we have made rapid progress winding down our consumer business in Korea as well as our franchise in Russia. We continue to invest in our transformation to address our consent orders and to modernize our bank. We are streamlining our processes and making them more automated whilst improving the quality and accessibility of our data. This will make us a better bank. We brought in very strong talent, met our representation goals and strengthened our culture by increasing accountability and shareholder alignment. To that end, I am pleased we delivered against our financial guidance for the year. We also released our first plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, expanded our impact investing and announced the findings from an external law firm, which reviewed our racial equity efforts in the U.S. Finally, I\u2019m very proud of how our people handled the macro and geopolitical shocks, which define 2022 and supported our clients and our communities with excellent and compassion throughout. Before I hand over to Mark, let\u2019s turn to the next few years and in particular, the path to achieving our medium-term return targets that we laid out on Page 5. At Investor Day, we talked about the path coming in three phases, with Phase 1 characterized by both disciplined execution and investment. 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1, laying the foundation for driving long-term shareholder value. We are focused on changing our business mix to drive revenues and returns with the expectation that our businesses will close out \u201823 competitively stronger. Services entered \u201823 with strategic momentum and a pipeline of major new innovation and market-leading product capabilities. Markets should continue to benefit from our active corporate client base with the franchise further advancing on the back of investments and the businesses focused on capital productivity. Banking and Wealth are well positioned for when the cycle turns. Thanks o the investments we have made in top talent and technology as well as the synergies realized across the franchise. As you saw, we felt this was the right time to make a change in well and we started a search to identify the next leader of this business. I asked Jim O\u2019Donnell to take on a new role focused on senior clients across the firm. This will leverage his deep expertise and relationships and when combined with the new GoG\u2019s additional role as North America Head, it\u2019s designed to help us capture more of what is a significant business opportunity in our home market. U.S. Personal Banking will continue to benefit from the recovery and borrowing, taking full advantage of our market leading digital platforms and new products, particularly in the card space. We will make further progress on our international consumer exits, enabling us to simplify the firm and reduce our cost base. And we will, of course, focus on our clients, deepening relationship and bringing on new clients in line with our strategy. We will continue making disciplined investments in our franchise, including the investments in our transformation and controls. However, we will pace some of our business investments to reflect the operating environment. Looking further out, we will begin to bend the curve of our expenses to deliver against our medium-term targets. We will do so through a combination of our divestitures, realizing the financial benefits of our transformation and further simplification and Mark will cover this in more detail shortly. We fully recognize this suppresses our returns in the near-term, but we are deliberately taking the tough strategic actions and the investments necessary to reach our medium-term return targets and to create long-term shareholder value. We are carrying not just our momentum, but our determination into 2023. Despite the macro headwinds, we are very much on track to reach the medium-term return targets we shared with you on Investor Day. We intentionally designed a strategy that can deliver for our shareholders in different environments. We are running the bank differently with a relentless focus on execution and we will continue to transparently share our proof points with you along the way. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today\u2019s call. I am going to start with the fourth quarter and full year financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons, unless I indicate otherwise. I will also discuss our progress against our medium-term KPI targets and end with our guidance for 2023. On Slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the fourth quarter, we reported net income of approximately $2.5 billion and an EPS of $1.16 and an ROTCE of 5.8% on $18 billion of revenue. Embedded in these results are pre-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $192 million, largely driven by gains on divestitures. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.10 with an ROTCE of approximately 5.5%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 6% or 5% excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across services, market and U.S. Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in investment banking, wealth and the revenue reduction from the closed exit. Our results include expenses of $13 billion, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year. Excluding divestiture-related costs from both the fourth quarter of this year and last year, expenses increased by 5%, largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments and higher volume-related expenses partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reduction from the exit. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses, particularly in retail services and an ACL build of $645 million, largely related to growth in cards and some deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. And on a full year basis, we delivered $14.8 billion of net income and an ROTCE [Technical Difficulty]. Now turning to the full year revenue walk on Slide 7. In 2022, we reported revenue of approximately $75 billion, up 3%, excluding the impact of divestitures and in line with our guidance of low single-digit growth. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were up 32%, driven by continued benefit from rates as well as business actions such as managing deposit repricing, deepening with existing clients and winning new clients across all segments. Higher wins have accelerated due to the investments that we have been making in market leading product capabilities. These products include the first 24/7 U.S. dollar clearing capability in the industry, the 7-day cash suite product that we launched earlier this year, and instant payment, which is live in 33 markets, reaching over 60 countries. So while the rate environment drove about half of the growth this year, business action and investments drove the remaining half. In Security Services, revenues grew 15% as net interest income grew 59%, driven by higher interest rates across currency, partially offset by a 1% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuation. For the full year, we onboarded approximately $1.2 trillion of assets under custody and administration from significant client wins and we continue to feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. In markets, we grew revenue 7%, mainly driven by strength in rates and FX as we continue to serve our corporate and investor clients while optimizing capital. This was partially offset by the pressures in equity markets, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives. On the flipside, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 39%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. In cards, we grew revenues 8% as we continue to see benefits from the investments that we made in 2022 along with the rebound in consumer borrowing levels. And in wealth, revenues were down 2%, largely driven by market valuations in China lockdown. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 3%. Corporate Other also benefited from higher NII in part as the shorter duration of our investment portfolio allowed us to benefit from higher short-term rates. And as you can see on the slide, in legacy franchises, excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues decreased by about $1.3 billion as we closed 5 of the exit markets and continue to wind down Russia and Korea consumer. Going forward, we would expect legacy franchises to continue to be an offset to overall revenue growth as we close and wind down the remaining exit market. On Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2022, excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses were up roughly 8% in line with our guidance. Transformation grew 2%, with about two-thirds of the increase related to risk, control, data and finance program and approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments, which include improving and adding scalability to our TTS and Security Services platform, enhancing client experiences across all businesses and developing new product capabilities. We also continue to invest in front office talent, albeit at a more measured pace, given the environment. And volume-related expenses were up 1%, largely driven by market and cards. The remainder of the growth was driven by structural expenses, which include an increase to risk and control investments to support the front office as well as macro impacts like inflation. These expenses were partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exit market. Across the firm, technology-related expenses increased by 13% this year. On Slide 9, we show our 2022 results versus the medium-term KPI targets that we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you as we make progress along the way. Macro factors and market conditions, including those driven by monetary tightening at levels we didn\u2019t anticipate at Investor Day, impacted some KPIs positively and others negatively. However, we were able to offset some of the impacts as we executed against our strategy. In TTS, we continue to see healthy underlying drivers that indicate consistently strong activity from both new and existing clients as we rollout new product offerings and invest in the client experience, which is a key part of our strategy. Client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments. And these again include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client\u2019s primary operating bank. For the third quarter year-to-date, we estimate that we gained about 70 basis points of share and maintained our number one position with large institutional clients. In addition, we have onboarded over 8,700 suppliers this year, helping our clients manage their supply chain to address the evolving global landscape. And in Security Services, we onboarded new client assets, which offset some of the decline in market valuation. And we estimate that we have gained about 50 basis points of share in Security Services through the third quarter of this year, including in our home market. In markets, we strengthened our leadership position in fixed income by gaining share while making progress towards our revenue to RWA card. In cards, loan growth exceeded our expectations in both branded cards and retail services. Card spend volumes were up 14%, end-of-period loans up 13% and most importantly, interest-earning balances up 14%. That said, in areas like investment banking, we lost share this year, but maintained our market position. And in wealth, while we have brought on new advisors and new client assets, given the impact of market valuation, this didn\u2019t translate into growth in client assets or top line growth at this point. So in summary, we made good progress against our medium-term KPI targets despite the significant changes in the macroeconomic backdrop since Investor Day. This highlights that our diversified business model is adaptable to many environments and we have the right strategy to achieve our return targets over the medium-term. Now turning back to the fourth quarter on Slide 10, we show net interest income, deposits and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $710 million on a sequential basis, largely driven by services, cards and markets. Average loans were down as growth in cards was more than offset by declines in ICG and legacy franchise. Excluding foreign exchange translation, loans were flat. And average deposits were down by approximately 1%, largely driven by declines in legacy franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Excluding foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 2%. Sequentially, average deposits were up driven by growth in ICG and PBWM and our net interest margin increased by 8 basis points. On Slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit mix. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $19 billion of reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio, is approximately 2.6%. And within that, PBWM and U.S. card is 3.8% and 7.6% respectively, both just above Day 1 CECL level. And we feel very good about the high quality nature of our portfolio. In PBWM, 45% of our lending exposures are in U.S. cards. And of that, branded cards makes up 66% and retail services makes up 34%. Additionally, just over 80% of our total card exposure is to prime customers. And NCL rates continue to be well below pre-COVID levels. In our ICT portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 39 basis points of total loans. That said we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentration under a range of scenarios. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels. On Slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about a quarter or just under $600 billion consists of H3LA and we maintained [Technical Difficulty]. And our tangible book value per share was $81.65, up 3% from a year ago. On Slide 13, we show a sequential CET1 wall to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our targets over the next few quarters. Walking from the end of the third quarter, first, we generated $2.3 billion of net income to common, which added 19 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividend, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points. Third, the impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove an 8 basis point increase. And finally, the remaining 56 basis point increase was largely driven by the closing of exits, RWA optimization and market moves towards the end of the quarter. We ended the quarter with a 13% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 70 basis points higher than the last quarter. As you can see, we hit our 13% CET1 target, which includes 100 basis point internal management book. That will allow us to absorb any temporary impacts related to the Mexico consumer exit at signing while continuing to have ample capacity to serve our clients. And as it relates to buybacks this quarter, we will remain on pause and continue to make that decision quarter-by-quarter. On Slide 14, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased by 3% this quarter, with TTS up 36% on continued strength in NII; Security Services revenues up 22%; Markets revenue, up 18% on strength in fixed income, partially offset by a decline in equity; and Investment Banking revenues down 58%, which is in the range of the overall decline in industry volume. Expenses increased 6%, driven by transformation, business-led investments, specifically in services and volume-related expenses partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings. Cost of credit was $56 million, driven by net credit losses of $104 million, partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of approximately $1.9 billion, down 18%, driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. ICG delivered a 7.9% ROTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down slightly, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and our continued capital optimization efforts. Excluding FX, loans were up 1%. Average deposits were roughly flat. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 3%, and sequentially, deposits were up 4%. As for the full year, ICT grew revenues by 3% to $41 billion and delivered approximately $10.7 billion of net income, with an ROTCE of 11.1%. Now turning to Slide 15, we show the results of our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 5% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in non-interest revenue driven by lower investment product revenue in wealth and higher partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 7%, driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.7 billion, which included a reserve build driven by card volume growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. NCLs were up, reflecting ongoing normalization particularly in retail services. Average loans increased 6%, while average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 1.4%, driven by the ACL build this quarter and higher expenses. For the full year, PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 10.2% on $24.2 billion in revenue. On Slide 16, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues decreased 6%, primarily driven by the closing of five exit markets as well as the impact of the wind down. Expenses decreased 38%, largely driven by the absence of divestiture-related impact last year related to Korea. On Slide 17, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down driven by lower consulting expenses. On Slide 19, we summarize our guidance for 2023. As Jane mentioned earlier, 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1. We will continue to execute and invest, laying the foundation for the future with an eye towards driving long-term shareholder value. With that as a backdrop, we expect revenue to be in the range of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding any potential 2023 divestiture-related impacts, expenses to be roughly $54 billion, also excluding 2023 divestiture-related impact. Net credit losses in cards are expected to continue to normalize. And as we said earlier, we met our 13% CET1 target, and we will continue to evaluate the target as we go through the next DFAST cycle and close additional exit and announce others. On Slide 20, on the right side of the page, we show our revenue for 2021 and 2022 and our expectations for 2023, excluding the impact of divestitures. In 2023, we expect the revenue growth I just mentioned to be driven by NII and NIR. In TTS, we expect revenues to grow but at a slower pace, driven by interest rates and business actions. And for Security Services, we expect a bit of a tailwind from increased market valuation and onboarding of additional client assets. We also assumed somewhat of a normalization in wealth as lockdowns in China and market valuations start to rebound. And we expect investment banking to begin to rebound as the macroeconomic backdrop becomes more conducive to client activity. As for market, we expect it to be relatively flat given the level of activity we saw in 2022. Now turning to the NII guidance for 2023, we expect both ICG and PBWM to contribute to NII growth as we grow volumes, particularly in cards, and we continue to get the benefit of U.S. and non-U.S. rate hikes in our services business. As a reminder, the guidance for revenue includes the reduction of revenue from the exit and legacy franchises that we closed in 2022, and we expect to close this year in 2023.  Turning to Slide 21. In 2023, the increase in expenses that I just mentioned reflects a number of decisions that we\u2019ve made to further our transformation and execute on our strategy. And the main drivers are, first, transformation as we continue to invest in data, risk and control and technology to enhance our infrastructure and ultimately make our company more efficient. Second, business-led investments as we execute against our strategy. Third, volume-related expenses in line with our revenue expectations. And fourth, elevated levels of inflation mainly impacting compensation expense, partially offset by productivity savings and expense benefits from the exit. And we are investing in technology across the firm with total technology-related expenses increasing by 5%. While we recognize this is a significant increase in expenses. These are investments that we have to make and I am certain that these investments will make us a better, more efficient company in the future. And finally, let\u2019s talk a little bit about the medium-term targets. At Investor Day, we said the medium term was 3 to 5 years. That time frame represented 2024 to 2026. So while a lot has changed in the macro environment since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are on a path to the 11% to 12% ROTCE target in the medium term. We continue to expect top line revenue growth, material expense reduction and capital levels largely consistent with our medium-term CET1 target range to contribute to the achievement of our 11% to 12% ROTCE target. So let me walk you through where we stand today. From a revenue perspective, rates have moved much higher and at a faster pace across the globe, which accelerated NII growth. And that, coupled with the execution of our strategy, has allowed certain businesses to accelerate. At the same time, other businesses such as wealth and investment banking have slowed. Despite this, consistent with Investor Day, we expect a 4% to 5% revenue CAGR in the medium term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exit. From an expense perspective, as we showed at Investor Day, expenses will need to normalize over the medium term. And we now expect to bend the curve on expenses towards the end of 2024. The three main drivers of the necessary expense reduction will be benefits from the exit, which will be included in legacy franchise the benefits from our investments in transformation and control and the simplification of the organizational structure. First, let me remind you, at this point, the ongoing expenses in legacy franchises are approximately $7 billion. Of the $7 billion, roughly $4 billion is transferred to the buyer upon closing or through a transition services agreement that typically lasts about a year. The remaining $3 billion relates to potentially stranded costs and wind down, which takes time to eliminate. Second, as our investment in transformation and control initiatives mature, we expect to realize efficiency as those programs transition from manually intensive processes, the technology-enabled one. And finally, we remain focused on simplifying the organization, and we expect to generate further opportunities for expense reduction in the future. From a credit perspective, we still expect net credit losses to continue to normalize and any future ACL build or releases will be a function of macro assumption and volume. So to wrap up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted, we remain on our path to achieve the 11% to 12% ROTCE in the medium term. And Jane, the rest of the firm and I, are prepared to continue to show proof points along the way and demonstrate our progress. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks so much, and definitely appreciate all these outlooks. They are very helpful. So my question on the outlook is if you take a look at the current medium-sized return on tangible and getting to your target, I heard many comments about the path to getting there is on track. Is it the expense spend at the end of \u201824, that is the material step up from here to there, if you will, and/or is credit like a really big determinant in the process? So I\u2019m trying to bridge the gap just in numbers from today\u2019s return on tangible targets. Thanks.\nMark Mason: Yes, sure. Good morning, Glenn, thanks for the question. So we did give you some guidance here we gave it to you both on the top line and the middle line for \u201823. And then importantly, when we talk about the medium term, it\u2019s both the continued revenue growth, the 4% to 5% CAGR that I referenced, but it\u2019s also bringing the expenses down from this \u201823 forecast. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the drivers of what\u2019s going to bring these expenses down. The combination of the exit of the businesses and the expenses going away associated with that with the benefits that we start to generate from the transformation spend and then org simplification that this type of strategic restructuring, if you will, in exiting all these countries will create an opportunity for. And so it\u2019s a combination of revenue growth, expense bending of that curve and coming down. The cost of credit is kind of as we\u2019ve been talking about for some time now, which is it normalizes over the next couple of years at levels that are consistent with what we\u2019ve seen kind of prior to this COVID cycle that we\u2019ve been managing through.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. Thank you. Just one quick follow-up on poly, not my norm, but I normally try to respect this type of process. But Mark, we consider your super important part of this transformation. there has been news out there that you talking to one of my other companies, but would you be able to make any comments? You mentioned just some moment staying on \u2013 sorry to put you on the spot, but I think a lot of people care.\nMark Mason: I appreciate that, Glenn, and Citi is an important firm. I\u2019m the CFO of this firm and this strategy is something that I\u2019m focused on with Jane, ensuring that we execute on right and in a way that creates shareholder value for our investors. And so we\u2019re committed to getting that done.\nJane Fraser: Together.\nMark Mason: Together.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nJohn McDonald: Hi, Mark. I wanted to dig into the revenue outlook for 2023. You\u2019ve got about the midpoint, it kind of implies about a 4% revenue growth this year, kind of consistent with what you talked about for that 4% to 5%. So for this year, the 2023 guide, it looks like the NII is guided to be up about 3.5%. And the markets you are assuming kind of flat. So what\u2019s enabling you to get to the 4%? Where are the drivers that are above 4%? Is it some of those fee businesses? And just a little more color there would be helpful?\nMark Mason: Sure. So let me make a comment first on the NII. Just keep in mind with that number that I\u2019ve given on the page is both the growth that occurs in some of our important services businesses, and that really comes from both the annualization of rate increases that we saw in the back half of the year, but also expected continue increases, particularly outside of the U.S. And given the makeup of our franchise, we will \u2013 that will contribute to the NII growth. And then keep in mind that we\u2019re growing over the legacy franchise reductions in NII that we would see in 2023. So underneath that is some real momentum in the NII, notwithstanding a slower pace, the fact that it would be a slower pace than what we saw in 2022. From an NIR point of view, I did mention that we do expect to see some normalization in market valuation. And that would play out both in banking, normalizing certainly relative to what we saw this year with while it\u2019s down 50% to 60% as well as some normalization in wealth and those would hit the NIR line, as you point out.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And then \u2013 sorry, if this is clear already. But just in terms of the idea of the cost curve bending at the end of 2024. Is that going to mean that for the early part of 2024, expenses kind of rise above 2023 and then they kind of peak out plateau towards the back half of \u201824. Is that how we should envision it?\nMark Mason: I\u2019m not going to kind of get into \u201824 guidance. We will kind of get through \u201823, and I\u2019m confident about our ability to get to that roughly 54 number that I put out for \u201823. I\u2019m equally confident that we will bend this curve, and we will bring it down to the levels that it needs to be in order for us to get to the ROTCE target, but I\u2019m not going to kind of get into, John, the specifics of 24 except to say that by the end of \u201824, we will see that curve bending.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: My first question is \u2013 again, thank you for all the clarification on the slide. Great job, Jane and Mark, obviously. But as we think about what it means to bend the curve, I think, your investors are appreciative that you are accelerating the investments relative to your transformation. As we think about when Citi can hit that medium-term ROTCE, how should we think about what\u2019s bending the curve really means? And I\u2019m not looking for guidance necessarily, but as we think about going past that hump, what\u2019s the better way of measuring \u2013 should we \u2013 is it an efficiency ratio? I think you mentioned something like is it the 60% to 63% efficiency ratio against that 4% to 5% revenue CAGR that you think you\u2019ll be able to hit by 2025? Can we think of it that way?\nMark Mason: Yes. So at Investor Day, we did talk about it, and we remain consistent and committed to that. We talked about getting to an efficiency ratio that\u2019s less than 60% in the medium-term period. And so that certainly will be part of the metric that we deliver on as we bring our costs down. I think the other thing I\u2019d mention just you mentioned the how, and I think there are a couple of important aspects that the exits are obvious in terms of those costs going away, at least a portion of it is. The portion that\u2019s tied to stranded cost, Jane has been very, very clear with our entire management team of the importance of rethinking the organization and ensuring that the potentially stranded costs go away, and that means rethinking the way we do business and the way we operate different parts of our operations. I think the third piece is that technology, right? And so right now, a lot of what we\u2019re doing is manual. And as we continue to invest in technology and technology is up pretty significantly this year, 14% or so, we expect it to be up 5% next year. That technology build-out, if you will, will allow for us to reduce a lot of that manual activity, and that will bring down the operational cost for running the firm. And so those are a couple of examples, I hope, of the how. But I think importantly, you will start to see it in an improved operating efficiency over that period of time and getting to the target that we talked about at Investor Day.\nJane Fraser: And I would say you can get some confidence around the past on many of these by the urgency with which we\u2019re executing the divestitures, for example, on getting those transactions closed. And we\u2019ve also tried to provide you as much clarity as possible about the timing of when these will be closing and the speed of the wind-downs that we\u2019re executing. So that will help. As Mark said, it\u2019s three big structural drivers of what will be in that curve.\nErika Najarian: Thank you. And Mark, I\u2019m sorry, for misspeaking. I was looking at the wrong borrowing efficiency. I have like 15 slides open in the computer. \nMark Mason: That\u2019s okay,\nErika Najarian: The second question and maybe this to you Jane, I think that your investors have appreciated your sense of urgency with regards to the divestitures. I think the elephant in the room continues to be I think investors sort of expected an announcement on Banamex right now. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re still considering just selling Banamex or are you thinking about different options on the table, such as an IPO?\nJane Fraser: So we\u2019re in active dialogue at the moment. So I\u2019m obviously not going to comment in great detail here. We do continue to pursue a dual path as you\u2019d expect, because both are very viable options here. And when we are in a position to give you clarity but we will do so. I think we\u2019ve been fairly clear about the timing. We are also separating out the two franchises, our institutional franchise from the consumer franchise that we\u2019re selling because we see the institutional franchise is a very important part of the global network. As you can imagine, in today\u2019s environment, Mexico is key for many of our corporate clients around the world for their supply chains. And we play a very important role there. That is a lot of work in that separation. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making in that underlying work. But we are pursuing the dual tracks and when we have something to announce, we will be delighted to do so.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I\u2019m still trying to get over at this revenue and expense guidance. So you\u2019re implying you\u2019ll have at a minimum flat operating leverage or positive operating leverage for 2023? Am I reading that correctly? So on the one hand you are not bending the cost curve until late 2024. On the other hand, you\u2019re guiding for positive operating leverage in 2023. Am I reading that correctly?\nMark Mason: Mike, when you do the math, I don\u2019t think it will get to the positive operating leverage in 2023. But we are, as you see on the slide, targeting a range that does reflect growth in the top line. That growth will likely be a little bit less than the growth that 54 number would \u2013 roughly 54 number would suggest but we are on the right track. And we are getting there in a way that\u2019s consistent with the strategy that we talked about. And we do feel confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we\u2019ve put out here similar to delivering on the guidance we gave last year, recognizing there are a lot of things going on in the broader environment.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And then a second follow-up \u2013 or a follow-up, and then I\u2019ll requeue for my other question. Your CET1 ratio is 13% now. And I think that\u2019s two quarters earlier than consensus had expected. You said it was up 70 basis points. So doesn\u2019t that allow you to repurchase stock now? Or I understand that if you go ahead and sell Banamex, that could have a temporary negative capital hit. So I\u2019m just thinking like don\u2019t sell Banamex, don\u2019t have that temporary capital hit, start buying back stock at a fraction of your tangible book value. So what\u2019s wrong with my logic or what part of that can you comment on?\nJane Fraser: I\u2019m going to jump in on the, don\u2019t sell Banamex, Mike. As you could imagine, so we are selling the consumer franchise. It does not fit with the strategy that we laid out in Investor Day. It\u2019s an emerging market consumer franchise, and we are clearly focused around the multinational clients and in institutions and high net worth individuals with cross-border needs as we laid out very clearly and businesses that have strong connectivity across the \u2013 between each other. So we are \u2013 we don\u2019t see Banamex having strategic fit in the consumer franchises in that perspective. And when we run all the math, it is in the shareholders\u2019 interest that we sell that franchise and deploy that capital to our shareholders or into some of the investments at higher returns. What you\u2019re suggesting is a very short-term move. And I think as you can see from the actions we\u2019re taking, we\u2019re very focused on our medium and long-term and not taking the short-term path that we would regret in the medium and long-term.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. I guess just one question as a follow-up on capital. As we think about post the second half of the year, let\u2019s say, you\u2019ve taken the hit from Banamex. But coming out of this test-test, any sense, Mark, if there is any reason why Citi would have an outsized negative impact from the Basel end game reforms. Just give us a sense, I\u2019m just wondering hopefully, we don\u2019t get another disappointment as we get our hopes it for buybacks in the back half and there is something idiosyncratic about the business mix that could come back to hurt the bank? Would love any perspective there?\nMark Mason: Yes. So look, as we pointed out, we\u2019ve built a significant amount of capital over the course of the year. We are ahead of the target we set for the middle of the year, middle of the year. We do have some exits that will have a temporary impact on that CET1 ratio. And we do obviously have a DFAST that\u2019s in front of us that we will have to see what the outcome is of that work. I think, look, the Basel end game and final views and decisions on that are still outstanding. And I think we will have to take those into consideration when they become available. That is an industry dynamic that will play out however it plays out. And similar to SACR, we will get after it in a very significant way to make sure that we\u2019re able to handle whatever headwinds or tailwinds may come along with that. But it really is difficult at this point to opine on exactly what that means for the industry in light of the fact that there aren\u2019t final rules out just yet.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And just back to your medium-term targets. I guess if we hit that bending the curve at the end of \u201824, it implies that this company should have an earnings power north of $10 by 25%, even at the lower end of the guidance. Am I missing anything there? Or like does that make sense?\nMark Mason: The only thing I\u2019d point out is what we\u2019ve described \u2013 what I\u2019ve described, what Jane described is the medium term is \u201824 through 2026. And \u2013 we\u2019ve given you guidance for \u201823. We intend to get to those return targets in the medium term. I haven\u2019t given you specific guidance on any of those individual years, and we will kind of take that year by year. And so just factor in. I think what\u2019s important is you\u2019ve got a view on \u201823, and I think we\u2019ve given you additional clarity on how we intend to get to that medium term, and I think that\u2019s important.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nJane Fraser: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I did want to ask a little bit about the strategy with Personal and Wealth Management. I know Jane, earlier you talked about the fact that \u2013 which you have announced looking for a new had to move that business forward. Could you just give us a sense as to where you think the opportunity sets are greatest within that franchise for growth because there is a bunch of different pieces, some on the advice channel, some of the more fee channels, some of the more balance sheet piece. And you already indicated U.S. as an opportunity to expand into. So I\u2019d just like to understand, from your perspective, which pieces are the most important to execute on. And that could help us understand how you\u2019re planning on shaping this business going forward? Thank you.\nJane Fraser: Great question, Betsy. And Mark and I are both smiling here because I think the answer is all of the above. So if we break it down, where do we see the various elements of upside? There is an important recovery that\u2019s going to occur in Asia. And you can see from our results last year, and across the board with other competitors with an Asian bent, that was materially impacted by COVID in China and the lockdowns and a slower pulling out of COVID in that market compared broadly in Asia compared to the U.S. So we see some exciting growth opportunities there from the pure fundamentals in Asia across the board. Absolutely you are right in the U.S., we start from a smaller scale there. We\u2019ve been bringing the different parts of that business together. The wealth of work franchises, one that\u2019s had particularly pleasing growth in it. And we\u2019ve also been seeing some good growth as we pulled a comprehensive offering together for our customers. The biggest upside there is the investment product. And I think we\u2019ve got a strong balance sheet franchise as it were, particularly the deposits, some of the margin lending and the like mortgages, but this is really about the investment offering in the state. Then finally, I\u2019d say there is also tremendous opportunity in the synergies, and we\u2019ve been showing you this in terms of linkages between our commercial bank, our banking franchise, the referrals up from the U.S. Personal Banking. We\u2019ve had about 60,000 referrals this year in the U.S. alone. From that, market also provides important results and even TTS. So the client referrals, there are business synergies between them common platforms. So we really see an opportunity for these multidimensional growth drivers in wealth over and above the recovery in the investment space that everybody in the market should be able to benefit from. And we will continue investing in \u2013 appropriately in building out that front line as well. So, this is a very important part of our strategy. We are excited about it. It\u2019s the key pillar of the shift in business mix as we go forward as well, looking at the medium-term. And we are looking forward to the next phase of growth and focus here.\nBetsy Graseck: And would you say that the investment spend required to execute on those revenue opportunities is likely to accelerate from here, or you have already done that investment spend and the investment is more sideways as opposed to accelerating?\nJane Fraser: I think look, in this current environment, as we have said \u2013 Mark and I have both said since the \u2013 really, the middle of last year, this is something that we are pacing, but we are continuing to invest behind you. And you can see that growth in our client advisors. And remember that net growth in client advisors, it includes the divestiture we made in Uruguay, for example. So, it\u2019s pretty strong. We don\u2019t have a huge amount that we need to invest because we have many pieces of the platform in place and it\u2019s more been a story of integrating them, and then making sure that we are putting the right digital and other investments behind it, but it\u2019s not such a large one in order to achieve the upside in the business. And we will pace that as appropriate with market conditions. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Mason: Only thing I would add \u2013 Betsy, you know this is \u2013 in a normal part of the cycle, this is a high margin, high returning business. And we have seen that in the past. And so we want to be well positioned for as the market turns, having brought on client advisors, having brought in new clients through client acquisitions, which were up 24% in 2022. And so I think we are well positioned for that. But as Jane mentioned, given where we are, we want to be smart about how we deploy the dollars. And so we will replace that as necessary, but ensure that we are ready for when things turn.\nJane Fraser: And I would just add, it was a couple of years ago that we put \u2013 we announced the strategy and started executing on it. So, we have the benefit of the historic investments that we are seeing the drivers playing out well. And as I say, well, we should be well positioned when the market turns here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Hi. I just want to follow-up on the comments about markets to be relatively flat in \u201823. Obviously, a very good 4Q. And I know I was concerned about some of the RWA management and FICC in the recent quarters. And I think going back not to be an issue as you think about leadership and revenue. But as you think about \u201823, like the wallets have been strong in recent years. And to your point, your leadership was strong this year. How confident are you in kind of that flat market? And maybe what\u2019s driving that view? Thank you.\nMark Mason: It\u2019s a market business, right. And so you know very well kind of the volatility that can come with any markets business. With that said, we have got a very, very strong FICC franchise. We had a very good year, a very good year this year. I think we are well positioned with the client base, and we are well positioned to maintain our number one position as we go into 2023. Now, how that market and market wallet moves, I think is it was going to predicate on a number of things, including how the macro continues to evolve and how central bank activity continues to evolve and how currencies move and the like. But again, I feel like we are well positioned to hold our position, if not gain more share as that plays out. And so I think flat relative to a year that we have had up as significantly as it is, is a reasonable call based on what we know now.\nJane Fraser: We have also seen some depression of areas of strength in this business as well. So, equity derivatives, for example, the real strength, this was an equity derivative year. So, there is some and the corporate world with the volatility that\u2019s out there from a macro geopolitical environment is another real strength of ours. And for better or for worse, we are expecting that strength to continue, certainly things so far.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, good morning or good afternoon.\nMark Mason: Good afternoon.\nJim Mitchell: Mark, maybe just digging into NII a little bit, if you look at 4Q annualized, you have a decent step down. But when you take a look at your deposit franchise, your mix of business, versus your peers, where they are seeing probably lagging retail deposits in the U.S., pricing that\u2019s going to hurt second half NII. Look, you guys, you already have high betas, mostly institutional. You mentioned the benefit from non-U.S. rates and you are growing deposits. So, why sort of the \u2013 a similar trend in NII versus peers when you have a pretty different dynamic going on? Just trying to think that through because it doesn\u2019t look like the legacy drag is very big in your chart?\nMark Mason: Similar dynamics you say in \u201823 or you are talking about fourth quarter. I am not sure I followed.\nJim Mitchell: No, I am just trying to talk about versus peers, some have guided similarly to down from 4Q annualized run rates, but you have a very different dynamic in terms of deposit growth, benefits from non-U.S. rates and a much higher beta.\nMark Mason: Yes. So, I think \u2013 I mean I think I would point to a couple of things on the NII side, just as it relates to us. One, importantly, that I mentioned in and you point out is when you think about our mix of deposits, we have got about 65% or so are in ICG and the balance, 35% in our PBWM business. We certainly skew to U.S. dollar, but we have got a 30% or so that is a non-U.S. dollar. And when I think about the potential or the forward curves and how rates will likely move next year, we will get the benefit of further rate increases on the non-U.S. side, right. And so if I think about our international presence, the betas tend to not be as high as they are here in the U.S. with our Corporate Clients segment. And so I think there are some re-pricing opportunities that we will continue to actively manage as we did here in the U.S. And so I do think it\u2019s that international footprint, the globality of our franchise that plays to our strength in 2023. The other thing that is apparent to us as we forecast this out is the continued growth from a volume point of view. And that volume growth, you have seen the momentum already pick up on the card side with significant growth in interest-earning balances. And we would expect that to continue, particularly as we see NCLs normalize and as we see payment rates start to temper. And so I think those things will be two major contributors. Mix is obviously a factor. As you point out, we will be growing over some of the drag or reduction from legacy, but is that active management of the client engagement that we have across both portfolios, that I think will be important factors to us delivering the growth that I talked about.\nJim Mitchell: That\u2019s all fair. But I guess maybe I didn\u2019t phrase my question right, but I felt it ex-markets, I think your forecast for 2013 would be less than the 4Q run rate ex-markets and yet you just...\nMark Mason: Sorry, finish your question. I am sorry.\nJim Mitchell: Well, just you shared a bunch of reasons why you have sort of a differentiated franchise. So, I am just trying to get a sense of what\u2019s driving the decline from 4Q levels.\nMark Mason: I think the thing you have got to pick up is really the legacy franchise and the NII. A large part of the legacy franchise revenues are NII revenues when you look at the mix of the products and the clients that we cover there. And so I think that\u2019s the important element here that we haven\u2019t quantified to a dollar amount, but that is explaining why it seems like muted growth relative to what you would have seen in the fourth quarter. Obviously, there is other factors, but that\u2019s important.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: I am Mark Hernandez [ph].\nMark Mason: Good afternoon.\nJane Fraser: Hi. Go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Mark, can you share with us on your comments regarding and this is true for your peers as well. The normalization of credit losses going forward since the industry has experienced incredibly low levels of credit losses. So, when you look at branded cards or retail sales, or retail services, how do you see that progressing through \u201823? One of your peers pointed out that they think that by the end of \u201823 they may be at that normalization rate that they look to for their numbers. But I am just trying to see what the trajectory is for what you guys are thinking?\nJane Fraser: Yes. Let me jump in and then I will hand it on to Mark. But I think we are expecting under the current trajectory to see the loss rates to reach the pre-COVID levels more at the year-end, early \u201824 level. If you think of branded cards, if I was to quantify sort of 20% of the way there now, CRS, we are about 40% of the way there now. Obviously, we have the benefit in CRS of sharing of the loss sharing with our partners that helps us. But I hope that gives you a sense around it. Probably the most important driver that we have been worried about it was very certain with what was happening with payment rates. And I think we have got much more clarity as they started that normalization path. So, that\u2019s driving a fair amount of more certainty around what the direction is happening there. Frankly, the big question more what\u2019s happening with spending than it is with the normalization right now. It\u2019s a bigger uncertainty. But Mark, any other observations?\nMark Mason: The only thing I would add is that, Gerard, you could see just depending on how this plays out. You could see kind of NCL rates tick up above normal levels and then come back down to normal levels in the timeline that Jane described. Again, just depending on how the macro factors continue to play out. But again, we \u2013 as we sit here and talk about these NPL rates, it\u2019s important to point out as well that we are very well reserved across all of these portfolios. And so to some extent, if you put macro assumptions aside and volumes aside, the NPLs kind of get funded by the reserves that have been established. But the trend line is exactly as Jane described, just recognizing that you could see a tick up above normal levels and then it come back down.\nJane Fraser: Also this is such an unusual market in the sense that you have got such strong labor market driven by frankly, supply shortage over as much as demand. And we have also got the consumers with still very high savings that they are dipping into, and we are seeing a bit more of the movements happening at the bottom end of all of this. But this is not going to be like a normal recession. It\u2019s why you are ticking here as that others will be about the manageability and the mildness of that likely if we do have one.\nUnidentified Analyst: And what kind of unemployment rates, are you guys assuming going into that kind of trajectory? Is it \u2013 we get the 5% unemployment by first quarter \u201824?\nMark Mason: I think a couple of things. So one, our base case scenario, if you think about what we just talked about includes kind of a mild recession in it, just and as we forecasted it, the downside would be something a bit more severe than that. I would say we are reserved for approximately a 5% unemployment rate, just kind of overall when you look at \u2013 when you average across the different scenarios that we have.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKen Usdin: Hi. Thanks. Just two quick questions here. First one, just on card, the card NIM has been kind of flattish. And I know that obviously, it has to do with just how you internally allocate the funding towards it. But can you just kind of talk us through what\u2019s happening either with rewards or either incremental rates on some of the new relationships? And should we see the card NIM expand from here?\nMark Mason: Yes. I am not going to get into Ken, kind of guidance on NIM. What I will say is that we have seen good traction in the early part of the year as it relates to acquisitions on the card side. We have made very good traction. And Jane, you may want to comment on kind of the relationships that we have with some of the partners and with American. And we have also launched a number of new products that I think is helping to fuel the growth that we have seen on the heels of those investments and some of the increase that we have seen in spend rates as well as some of the average interest-earning balance and loan growth that we have seen. But I really don\u2019t want to get into the NIM guidance at the card level or the aggregate at this point.\nJane Fraser: Yes. I mean we have a fabulous cards franchise. And when we look at strong track record in the digital, the other innovations that are driving growth, driving the profitability, driving the returns both in our proprietary products as well as our partners, and we are really seeing all of those drivers performing very, very strongly at the moment. From custom cash, it was 28% of new accounts acquisition. So, an important new product refresh that\u2019s driving things 80% of customers engaging digitally. Innovations like America is just a fantastic partner of us, really taking that to the next level. And you can see that with the growth in spend in the category. So, I think there is a lot of reasons to be pretty excited about the growth in the return and the margins and the other trajectories here, and as I say, a prime portfolio, which is always a good thing.\nKen Usdin: Great. Thanks. And my second question was, there was an article about changing management up in the wealth management business this week. And I just wonder if you can talk about that, but also just about the progress that you are making inside the wealth management relative to your \u2013 the KPIs and the goals that you have discussed at Analyst Day. Thanks.\nJane Fraser: Well, sure. I mean 2 years ago, I asked MacDonald to put the wealth business together from the various components that we had around the firm. And now as we move to the next phase, but as we have said, strategically important business. I thought it was the right time to change the leadership also because Jim is going to play an important role moving forward, supporting Paco with the ICG strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. He has got a lot of relationships with investors, family offices, private equity, sovereign wealth funds. And he is going to be helping drive those along with other investors to make sure we bring the firm\u2019s full capabilities to these clients. So, I felt the time was right to make the move. And we will be, as indicated, strictly moving to go out and have a look for our next leader of that business. And in the meantime, business as usual as we grow and follow the strategy that we have, and we are looking forward to the market turning, as I am sure everyone is and feel that we are well positioned to do so.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nSheng Wang: Hi. Good afternoon. This is actually Sheng Wang filling in for Steven. Just on the topic of credit, one of your peers noted this morning that they would expect to see an incremental $6 billion or so of reserves if they assume 6% unemployment under CECL. Can you \u2013 just wondering if you could provide some similar sensitivity to reserve levels and how should we think about the provision trajectory versus the 4Q base based on your macro outlook and potential growth math headwinds?\nMark Mason: Yes. Thank you. I will go ahead and I will take that. I am not going to kind of do sensitivity scenarios with you here on the fly. What I will say is that as we build these reserves, we are building them against three scenarios. That base scenario that I mentioned, the downside scenario and upside scenario, and we weight those scenarios. And the base that we used this quarter built in a mild recession. And in that baseline, unemployment was, call it, 4.4% or so in terms of the unemployment assumption. We also had a downside scenario. Unemployment in the downside scenario got to a 6.9% or so. And then we had an upside scenario. The weighted average across the quarters was about the 5.1% that I mentioned. And those were factors that went into the reserve that we established in the in the quarter. And largely, when you think about the weightings we have put on those scenarios, the weighting skew towards that base and that downside. The reserve we built this quarter was largely in the consumer business, PBWM and specifically around cards. And that really had to do the change quarter-over-quarter with the change in HPI. But what I would say is that it also reflects, as I have mentioned earlier, a cards portfolio that remains of a very good quality and with loss rates that are well below what they would be in a normal cycle. And it does pick up the fact that there is volume growth that we saw in the quarter there. So, I am not going to kind of run scenarios for you, but hopefully, that gives you some perspective as to what\u2019s underneath the models that we have used to establish these reserves. And obviously, we do that on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nJane Fraser: I would also just jump in one of the areas that sometimes gets mis-put about the firm, is on the corporate credit side. When we look at our corporate client portfolio don\u2019t equate where we take credit risk with the global footprint. When I look internationally, 90% of our international exposure with multinational firms and their subsidiaries, and these are \u2013 this is investment grade. So, I think that\u2019s another area where as we look at the quality of the corporate loan portfolio, as you saw with Russia and others, we will be conservative in the reserving we take. But I think important to understand the nature of where we take that corporate credit risk.\nSheng Wang: That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, it seems like a part of your revenue targets for 2023 depends on some improvement in the environment. For example, stabilizing equity markets, IB rebound? And Jane, you also noted that the medium-term targets are designed to be achievable in different environments. So, if the revenue backdrop continues to be challenged like we saw in 2022, can you just talk about some of the levers you might be able to pull that might provide an offset?\nMark Mason: Well, it kind of depends on what the drivers are of a different environment, right. Because you could have \u2013 I don\u2019t anticipate this, but you could have continued pressure in investment banking, but you could also have continued volatility in rates or currencies and that could mean more upside than flat for the markets business. So, there are a lot of puts and takes that one can scenario out. I think what\u2019s really important is that we have a diversified portfolio of businesses that have strategic connectivity to them. And so what that allows for is that as the environment shifts in some way that we may not have predicted that we were often able to still drive significant performance as we did this year. And so without calling exactly how it vary from what\u2019s here, that\u2019s what gives us the confidence to \u2013 around the guidance and really to remain steadfast on the strategy that we have talked about and really push execution, and that\u2019s exactly what we are doing.\nJane Fraser: And an important part of \u201823, it\u2019s not just the impact of the cycle, but also you will see the impact of the different investments that we have been making. And you have certainly seen that. For example, in services this year, and we have been very transparent around the 70 basis points increase. We have seen in wallet share in the 12 months leading up to the third quarter. So, you have not only got drivers here in terms of what\u2019s happening in the market, but you have also got the strategic drivers, also kicking in more and more together, as Mark referred to the synergies.\nMark Mason: It\u2019s a great point, Jane, because it may not always show up in the top line, which is why we put those KPIs out there. There are often indicators of some of the upside that\u2019s on the come as the market evolves.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nJane Fraser: Hello. Hey Mike.\nMike Mayo: Yes. So, one question and one follow-up. So, you have a \u2013 your slide says you have a CET1 target of 13% by midyear, but you are already there. And I guess if we go back to the Banamex thing, I guess is that kind of assuming potential capital impact from divestitures or why would you have a target six months out when you have already met it?\nMark Mason: Yes. Mike, I have to tell you that I am surprised that you are asking about Mexico, just given our history together, but I understand it. And what I would say is that a couple of things. One, we clearly see where we trade, right. And we are not happy about where we trade. And we think our strategy warrants us trading better than where we trade today. So, if we could buy back, right, we could do buybacks as soon as we are able to do buybacks, we will, right. I mean that is part of the way we deliver value for our shareholders. The second thing I would say is we did get to the 13% sooner. And that was, again, in accordance with executing against our strategy. And our parts of our business, particularly the markets business has done a really good job at delivering against the metric we put out of revenue to RWA. And we have been able to get there without damaging the franchise, which is what you see in the continued strength and performance in that business, particularly in fixed income. What\u2019s ahead of us, as you rightfully pointed out, is that we have got a number of exits that have to take place, puts and takes across many of them, but Mexico in particular, will have a temporary impact on our CET1 ratio. And so we want to be mindful of that as we manage over the next two quarters, so that we can absorb that. And we also want to make sure that we are positioned to continue to serve our clients over the next couple of quarters and always, but certainly over the next couple of quarters, while we manage the headwind, temporary headwind from that exit. So, hopefully that gives you a better sense for it, but we are actively managing this. And we have not lost focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders.\nJane Fraser: Yes. I want to reiterate that as well. I mean it\u2019s very important to us. And as Mark says, we know where we trade. We have made a number of moves to align ourselves to our shareholders\u2019 interest in compensation and management interest, all these various dimensions. And we just want to make sure that we hit what we say we are going to do and continue delivering against what we say we are going to be delivering. And with the CPA impact essentially in Mexico, we want to make sure that we are taking that into account.\nMike Mayo: Alright. That\u2019s very clear. And then lastly, your NII guide, excluding markets related is higher for 2023, but I think that implies a little step down from the fourth quarter level, not as much as JPMorgan was guiding down 10% from the fourth quarter level. I was thinking there might be some delayed benefits from being outside the U.S. What are some of the ins and outs there?\nMark Mason: Yes. You got a couple of points here. So, one is we won\u2019t see NII momentum as we have seen in 2022, just as betas start to increase on the ICG side and get to terminal levels, that\u2019s obviously going to slow or put pressure on the pricing as we go into \u201823. But some of the other important drivers of the growth will be the annualization of the rate hikes that happened late in the year. And so that will be a plus in 2023. You will also see, as I mentioned earlier, some of the rate increases that we anticipate outside of the U.S. and given our mix, that will benefit us in 2023. And then there will be a volume will contribute to that NII growth, particularly as we continue to see good momentum, which we anticipate on the card side, the offset will be that the legacy franchise, right. And so as those exits occur as the wind downs continue, as I mentioned earlier, that revenue mix does skew towards NII. And so we will have to grow over that and we will grow over that to kind of get to the target that we have set. So, those are the puts and takes.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\nJen Landis: Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to IR. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude the Citi fourth quarter 2022 earnings review call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen and Happy New Year to, everyone, joining us today. We are very much off and running as we start 2023. Today, I will share our perspective on the macro environment before recapping our performance in the fourth quarter. And then I will take a few minutes to reflect on our progress in 2022 and our strategic priorities for the coming year. The global macro environment played out largely as we anticipated during the second half of last year. As we enter 2023, environments have had better than we all expected for the time being at least, despite the aggressive tightening by Central Bank. In Europe, a warmer December reduced the stress on energy supplies and inflation is beginning to ease off its peak. That said, we still expect softening of economic conditions across the Eurozone this year given some of the structural challenges it is grappling with. In Asia, while the public health impact in China are unfortunately likely to be severe, the abrupt end of COVID Zero should begin to drive growth and improve sentiment generally. And here at home, the labor market remains strong and holiday spending was better than expected, in part because consumers have been dipping into their savings. The Fed remains resolute in tackling core inflation however and therefore, we continue to see the U.S. entering into a mild recession in the second half of the year. Now turning to how we performed. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $2.5 billion and EPS of $1.16. Our full year revenue growth of 3% ex-divestitures was in line with the guidance we gave you at Investor Day as was the case with our expenses. We delivered an ROTCE of nearly 9% and a CET1 ratio of 13%. This quarter, our businesses performed similarly to how they did throughout the year and we are quite pleased with some and less happy with the performance of others. Services continues to deliver cracking revenue growth. Our markets businesses are navigating the environment very well and we are seeing good momentum in U.S. Personal Banking. On the flipside, investment banking felt the pain of a drastically smaller wallet in '22, and the environment for wealth remained a challenging one. Unpacking that a bit, services delivered another excellent quarter and we have gained significant share in both Treasury and Trade Solutions and security services. TTS, the business most emblematic of the power of our global network had revenues up 36% year-over-year as we execute on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. Thanks to strong business drivers, coupled with higher rates, TTS is performing ahead of our expectations. Likewise, Securities Services was up a strong 22%. We ended the year having onboarded $1.2 trillion of new assets under administration and custody. Markets had the best fourth quarter in recent memory, with revenues up 18% from 2021. We have the number one FICC franchise on the street during the first three quarters of the year and fixed income was up 31% in the final quarter. Equities was down as the mix of client activity, again, did not play to our strength in derivatives. With the wallet down significantly, our investment banking revenues were off by about 60% this quarter. While the pipeline looks more promising and client sentiment is improving, it would be hard to precisely predict when the tide will turn in \u201823. Wealth Management's performance was disappointing. Revenues were down 6% in the quarter, with the macro environment creating headwinds in investment fees and AUM globally, but most acutely in Asia. However, we have been steadily improving the business as demonstrated by continued momentum in client acquisitions across the spectrum and net new investment flows. Similarly, we continue to build our client advisor base albeit at a slower pace given this environment. We would expect to see these investments pay off as the markets recover. In U.S. Personal Banking, both cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth for the second straight quarter as purchase sales and revolving balances continued to grow strongly. Whilst in retail banking, we clearly have some more work to do. As you know, we have been actively managing our balance sheet and risk. Our cost of credit increased in line with our guidance. We built reserves in Personal Banking this quarter on the back of volume growth as well as in anticipation of a mild recession. And in the U.S., net credit losses in cards continue to normalize as we had expected, still well below pre-COVID levels. Corporate credit remains healthy and our low overall cost of credit was similar to last quarter, reflecting the quality of our corporate loan portfolio. In terms of capital, we increased the CET1 ratio by about 70 basis points to 13% during the fourth quarter. And finally, our tangible book value per share increased to $81.65 and we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through our common dividend. Now, let me step back and discuss what we accomplished in 2022. One of our major goals last year was to put in place a strategic plan designed to create long-term value for our shareholders and to get that plan swiftly off the ground. I am pleased with the significant progress we have already made. We simplified the bank, closing sales of our consumer businesses in 5 markets, including 3 in the fourth quarter. And we have made rapid progress winding down our consumer business in Korea as well as our franchise in Russia. We continue to invest in our transformation to address our consent orders and to modernize our bank. We are streamlining our processes and making them more automated whilst improving the quality and accessibility of our data. This will make us a better bank. We brought in very strong talent, met our representation goals and strengthened our culture by increasing accountability and shareholder alignment. To that end, I am pleased we delivered against our financial guidance for the year. We also released our first plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, expanded our impact investing and announced the findings from an external law firm, which reviewed our racial equity efforts in the U.S. Finally, I'm very proud of how our people handled the macro and geopolitical shocks, which define 2022 and supported our clients and our communities with excellent and compassion throughout. Before I hand over to Mark, let's turn to the next few years and in particular, the path to achieving our medium-term return targets that we laid out on Page 5. At Investor Day, we talked about the path coming in three phases, with Phase 1 characterized by both disciplined execution and investment. 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1, laying the foundation for driving long-term shareholder value. We are focused on changing our business mix to drive revenues and returns with the expectation that our businesses will close out \u201823 competitively stronger. Services entered \u201823 with strategic momentum and a pipeline of major new innovation and market-leading product capabilities. Markets should continue to benefit from our active corporate client base with the franchise further advancing on the back of investments and the businesses focused on capital productivity. Banking and Wealth are well positioned for when the cycle turns. Thanks o the investments we have made in top talent and technology as well as the synergies realized across the franchise. As you saw, we felt this was the right time to make a change in well and we started a search to identify the next leader of this business. I asked Jim O'Donnell to take on a new role focused on senior clients across the firm. This will leverage his deep expertise and relationships and when combined with the new GoG's additional role as North America Head, it's designed to help us capture more of what is a significant business opportunity in our home market. U.S. Personal Banking will continue to benefit from the recovery and borrowing, taking full advantage of our market leading digital platforms and new products, particularly in the card space. We will make further progress on our international consumer exits, enabling us to simplify the firm and reduce our cost base. And we will, of course, focus on our clients, deepening relationship and bringing on new clients in line with our strategy. We will continue making disciplined investments in our franchise, including the investments in our transformation and controls. However, we will pace some of our business investments to reflect the operating environment. Looking further out, we will begin to bend the curve of our expenses to deliver against our medium-term targets. We will do so through a combination of our divestitures, realizing the financial benefits of our transformation and further simplification and Mark will cover this in more detail shortly. We fully recognize this suppresses our returns in the near-term, but we are deliberately taking the tough strategic actions and the investments necessary to reach our medium-term return targets and to create long-term shareholder value. We are carrying not just our momentum, but our determination into 2023. Despite the macro headwinds, we are very much on track to reach the medium-term return targets we shared with you on Investor Day. We intentionally designed a strategy that can deliver for our shareholders in different environments. We are running the bank differently with a relentless focus on execution and we will continue to transparently share our proof points with you along the way. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions. Together. And I would say you can get some confidence around the past on many of these by the urgency with which we're executing the divestitures, for example, on getting those transactions closed. And we've also tried to provide you as much clarity as possible about the timing of when these will be closing and the speed of the wind-downs that we're executing. So that will help. As Mark said, it's three big structural drivers of what will be in that curve. So we're in active dialogue at the moment. So I'm obviously not going to comment in great detail here. We do continue to pursue a dual path as you'd expect, because both are very viable options here. And when we are in a position to give you clarity but we will do so. I think we've been fairly clear about the timing. We are also separating out the two franchises, our institutional franchise from the consumer franchise that we're selling because we see the institutional franchise is a very important part of the global network. As you can imagine, in today's environment, Mexico is key for many of our corporate clients around the world for their supply chains. And we play a very important role there. That is a lot of work in that separation. I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we're making in that underlying work. But we are pursuing the dual tracks and when we have something to announce, we will be delighted to do so. I'm going to jump in on the, don't sell Banamex, Mike. As you could imagine, so we are selling the consumer franchise. It does not fit with the strategy that we laid out in Investor Day. It's an emerging market consumer franchise, and we are clearly focused around the multinational clients and in institutions and high net worth individuals with cross-border needs as we laid out very clearly and businesses that have strong connectivity across the \u2013 between each other. So we are \u2013 we don't see Banamex having strategic fit in the consumer franchises in that perspective. And when we run all the math, it is in the shareholders' interest that we sell that franchise and deploy that capital to our shareholders or into some of the investments at higher returns. What you're suggesting is a very short-term move. And I think as you can see from the actions we're taking, we're very focused on our medium and long-term and not taking the short-term path that we would regret in the medium and long-term. Hi, Betsy. Great question, Betsy. And Mark and I are both smiling here because I think the answer is all of the above. So if we break it down, where do we see the various elements of upside? There is an important recovery that's going to occur in Asia. And you can see from our results last year, and across the board with other competitors with an Asian bent, that was materially impacted by COVID in China and the lockdowns and a slower pulling out of COVID in that market compared broadly in Asia compared to the U.S. So we see some exciting growth opportunities there from the pure fundamentals in Asia across the board. Absolutely you are right in the U.S., we start from a smaller scale there. We've been bringing the different parts of that business together. The wealth of work franchises, one that's had particularly pleasing growth in it. And we've also been seeing some good growth as we pulled a comprehensive offering together for our customers. The biggest upside there is the investment product. And I think we've got a strong balance sheet franchise as it were, particularly the deposits, some of the margin lending and the like mortgages, but this is really about the investment offering in the state. Then finally, I'd say there is also tremendous opportunity in the synergies, and we've been showing you this in terms of linkages between our commercial bank, our banking franchise, the referrals up from the U.S. Personal Banking. We've had about 60,000 referrals this year in the U.S. alone. From that, market also provides important results and even TTS. So the client referrals, there are business synergies between them common platforms. So we really see an opportunity for these multidimensional growth drivers in wealth over and above the recovery in the investment space that everybody in the market should be able to benefit from. And we will continue investing in \u2013 appropriately in building out that front line as well. So, this is a very important part of our strategy. We are excited about it. It's the key pillar of the shift in business mix as we go forward as well, looking at the medium-term. And we are looking forward to the next phase of growth and focus here. I think look, in this current environment, as we have said \u2013 Mark and I have both said since the \u2013 really, the middle of last year, this is something that we are pacing, but we are continuing to invest behind you. And you can see that growth in our client advisors. And remember that net growth in client advisors, it includes the divestiture we made in Uruguay, for example. So, it's pretty strong. We don't have a huge amount that we need to invest because we have many pieces of the platform in place and it's more been a story of integrating them, and then making sure that we are putting the right digital and other investments behind it, but it's not such a large one in order to achieve the upside in the business. And we will pace that as appropriate with market conditions. Mark, anything to add? And I would just add, it was a couple of years ago that we put \u2013 we announced the strategy and started executing on it. So, we have the benefit of the historic investments that we are seeing the drivers playing out well. And as I say, well, we should be well positioned when the market turns here. We have also seen some depression of areas of strength in this business as well. So, equity derivatives, for example, the real strength, this was an equity derivative year. So, there is some and the corporate world with the volatility that's out there from a macro geopolitical environment is another real strength of ours. And for better or for worse, we are expecting that strength to continue, certainly things so far. Hi. Go ahead. Yes. Let me jump in and then I will hand it on to Mark. But I think we are expecting under the current trajectory to see the loss rates to reach the pre-COVID levels more at the year-end, early \u201824 level. If you think of branded cards, if I was to quantify sort of 20% of the way there now, CRS, we are about 40% of the way there now. Obviously, we have the benefit in CRS of sharing of the loss sharing with our partners that helps us. But I hope that gives you a sense around it. Probably the most important driver that we have been worried about it was very certain with what was happening with payment rates. And I think we have got much more clarity as they started that normalization path. So, that's driving a fair amount of more certainty around what the direction is happening there. Frankly, the big question more what's happening with spending than it is with the normalization right now. It's a bigger uncertainty. But Mark, any other observations? Also this is such an unusual market in the sense that you have got such strong labor market driven by frankly, supply shortage over as much as demand. And we have also got the consumers with still very high savings that they are dipping into, and we are seeing a bit more of the movements happening at the bottom end of all of this. But this is not going to be like a normal recession. It's why you are ticking here as that others will be about the manageability and the mildness of that likely if we do have one. Yes. I mean we have a fabulous cards franchise. And when we look at strong track record in the digital, the other innovations that are driving growth, driving the profitability, driving the returns both in our proprietary products as well as our partners, and we are really seeing all of those drivers performing very, very strongly at the moment. From custom cash, it was 28% of new accounts acquisition. So, an important new product refresh that's driving things 80% of customers engaging digitally. Innovations like America is just a fantastic partner of us, really taking that to the next level. And you can see that with the growth in spend in the category. So, I think there is a lot of reasons to be pretty excited about the growth in the return and the margins and the other trajectories here, and as I say, a prime portfolio, which is always a good thing. Well, sure. I mean 2 years ago, I asked MacDonald to put the wealth business together from the various components that we had around the firm. And now as we move to the next phase, but as we have said, strategically important business. I thought it was the right time to change the leadership also because Jim is going to play an important role moving forward, supporting Paco with the ICG strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. He has got a lot of relationships with investors, family offices, private equity, sovereign wealth funds. And he is going to be helping drive those along with other investors to make sure we bring the firm's full capabilities to these clients. So, I felt the time was right to make the move. And we will be, as indicated, strictly moving to go out and have a look for our next leader of that business. And in the meantime, business as usual as we grow and follow the strategy that we have, and we are looking forward to the market turning, as I am sure everyone is and feel that we are well positioned to do so. I would also just jump in one of the areas that sometimes gets mis-put about the firm, is on the corporate credit side. When we look at our corporate client portfolio don't equate where we take credit risk with the global footprint. When I look internationally, 90% of our international exposure with multinational firms and their subsidiaries, and these are \u2013 this is investment grade. So, I think that's another area where as we look at the quality of the corporate loan portfolio, as you saw with Russia and others, we will be conservative in the reserving we take. But I think important to understand the nature of where we take that corporate credit risk. And an important part of \u201823, it's not just the impact of the cycle, but also you will see the impact of the different investments that we have been making. And you have certainly seen that. For example, in services this year, and we have been very transparent around the 70 basis points increase. We have seen in wallet share in the 12 months leading up to the third quarter. So, you have not only got drivers here in terms of what's happening in the market, but you have also got the strategic drivers, also kicking in more and more together, as Mark referred to the synergies. Hello. Hey Mike. Yes. I want to reiterate that as well. I mean it's very important to us. And as Mark says, we know where we trade. We have made a number of moves to align ourselves to our shareholders' interest in compensation and management interest, all these various dimensions. And we just want to make sure that we hit what we say we are going to do and continue delivering against what we say we are going to be delivering. And with the CPA impact essentially in Mexico, we want to make sure that we are taking that into account."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I am going to start with the fourth quarter and full year financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons, unless I indicate otherwise. I will also discuss our progress against our medium-term KPI targets and end with our guidance for 2023. On Slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the fourth quarter, we reported net income of approximately $2.5 billion and an EPS of $1.16 and an ROTCE of 5.8% on $18 billion of revenue. Embedded in these results are pre-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $192 million, largely driven by gains on divestitures. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.10 with an ROTCE of approximately 5.5%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 6% or 5% excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across services, market and U.S. Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in investment banking, wealth and the revenue reduction from the closed exit. Our results include expenses of $13 billion, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year. Excluding divestiture-related costs from both the fourth quarter of this year and last year, expenses increased by 5%, largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments and higher volume-related expenses partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reduction from the exit. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses, particularly in retail services and an ACL build of $645 million, largely related to growth in cards and some deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. And on a full year basis, we delivered $14.8 billion of net income and an ROTCE [Technical Difficulty]. Now turning to the full year revenue walk on Slide 7. In 2022, we reported revenue of approximately $75 billion, up 3%, excluding the impact of divestitures and in line with our guidance of low single-digit growth. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were up 32%, driven by continued benefit from rates as well as business actions such as managing deposit repricing, deepening with existing clients and winning new clients across all segments. Higher wins have accelerated due to the investments that we have been making in market leading product capabilities. These products include the first 24/7 U.S. dollar clearing capability in the industry, the 7-day cash suite product that we launched earlier this year, and instant payment, which is live in 33 markets, reaching over 60 countries. So while the rate environment drove about half of the growth this year, business action and investments drove the remaining half. In Security Services, revenues grew 15% as net interest income grew 59%, driven by higher interest rates across currency, partially offset by a 1% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuation. For the full year, we onboarded approximately $1.2 trillion of assets under custody and administration from significant client wins and we continue to feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. In markets, we grew revenue 7%, mainly driven by strength in rates and FX as we continue to serve our corporate and investor clients while optimizing capital. This was partially offset by the pressures in equity markets, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives. On the flipside, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 39%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. In cards, we grew revenues 8% as we continue to see benefits from the investments that we made in 2022 along with the rebound in consumer borrowing levels. And in wealth, revenues were down 2%, largely driven by market valuations in China lockdown. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 3%. Corporate Other also benefited from higher NII in part as the shorter duration of our investment portfolio allowed us to benefit from higher short-term rates. And as you can see on the slide, in legacy franchises, excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues decreased by about $1.3 billion as we closed 5 of the exit markets and continue to wind down Russia and Korea consumer. Going forward, we would expect legacy franchises to continue to be an offset to overall revenue growth as we close and wind down the remaining exit market. On Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2022, excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses were up roughly 8% in line with our guidance. Transformation grew 2%, with about two-thirds of the increase related to risk, control, data and finance program and approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments, which include improving and adding scalability to our TTS and Security Services platform, enhancing client experiences across all businesses and developing new product capabilities. We also continue to invest in front office talent, albeit at a more measured pace, given the environment. And volume-related expenses were up 1%, largely driven by market and cards. The remainder of the growth was driven by structural expenses, which include an increase to risk and control investments to support the front office as well as macro impacts like inflation. These expenses were partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exit market. Across the firm, technology-related expenses increased by 13% this year. On Slide 9, we show our 2022 results versus the medium-term KPI targets that we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you as we make progress along the way. Macro factors and market conditions, including those driven by monetary tightening at levels we didn't anticipate at Investor Day, impacted some KPIs positively and others negatively. However, we were able to offset some of the impacts as we executed against our strategy. In TTS, we continue to see healthy underlying drivers that indicate consistently strong activity from both new and existing clients as we rollout new product offerings and invest in the client experience, which is a key part of our strategy. Client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments. And these again include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. For the third quarter year-to-date, we estimate that we gained about 70 basis points of share and maintained our number one position with large institutional clients. In addition, we have onboarded over 8,700 suppliers this year, helping our clients manage their supply chain to address the evolving global landscape. And in Security Services, we onboarded new client assets, which offset some of the decline in market valuation. And we estimate that we have gained about 50 basis points of share in Security Services through the third quarter of this year, including in our home market. In markets, we strengthened our leadership position in fixed income by gaining share while making progress towards our revenue to RWA card. In cards, loan growth exceeded our expectations in both branded cards and retail services. Card spend volumes were up 14%, end-of-period loans up 13% and most importantly, interest-earning balances up 14%. That said, in areas like investment banking, we lost share this year, but maintained our market position. And in wealth, while we have brought on new advisors and new client assets, given the impact of market valuation, this didn't translate into growth in client assets or top line growth at this point. So in summary, we made good progress against our medium-term KPI targets despite the significant changes in the macroeconomic backdrop since Investor Day. This highlights that our diversified business model is adaptable to many environments and we have the right strategy to achieve our return targets over the medium-term. Now turning back to the fourth quarter on Slide 10, we show net interest income, deposits and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $710 million on a sequential basis, largely driven by services, cards and markets. Average loans were down as growth in cards was more than offset by declines in ICG and legacy franchise. Excluding foreign exchange translation, loans were flat. And average deposits were down by approximately 1%, largely driven by declines in legacy franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Excluding foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 2%. Sequentially, average deposits were up driven by growth in ICG and PBWM and our net interest margin increased by 8 basis points. On Slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit mix. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $19 billion of reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio, is approximately 2.6%. And within that, PBWM and U.S. card is 3.8% and 7.6% respectively, both just above Day 1 CECL level. And we feel very good about the high quality nature of our portfolio. In PBWM, 45% of our lending exposures are in U.S. cards. And of that, branded cards makes up 66% and retail services makes up 34%. Additionally, just over 80% of our total card exposure is to prime customers. And NCL rates continue to be well below pre-COVID levels. In our ICT portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 39 basis points of total loans. That said we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentration under a range of scenarios. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels. On Slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about a quarter or just under $600 billion consists of H3LA and we maintained [Technical Difficulty]. And our tangible book value per share was $81.65, up 3% from a year ago. On Slide 13, we show a sequential CET1 wall to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our targets over the next few quarters. Walking from the end of the third quarter, first, we generated $2.3 billion of net income to common, which added 19 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividend, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points. Third, the impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove an 8 basis point increase. And finally, the remaining 56 basis point increase was largely driven by the closing of exits, RWA optimization and market moves towards the end of the quarter. We ended the quarter with a 13% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 70 basis points higher than the last quarter. As you can see, we hit our 13% CET1 target, which includes 100 basis point internal management book. That will allow us to absorb any temporary impacts related to the Mexico consumer exit at signing while continuing to have ample capacity to serve our clients. And as it relates to buybacks this quarter, we will remain on pause and continue to make that decision quarter-by-quarter. On Slide 14, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased by 3% this quarter, with TTS up 36% on continued strength in NII; Security Services revenues up 22%; Markets revenue, up 18% on strength in fixed income, partially offset by a decline in equity; and Investment Banking revenues down 58%, which is in the range of the overall decline in industry volume. Expenses increased 6%, driven by transformation, business-led investments, specifically in services and volume-related expenses partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings. Cost of credit was $56 million, driven by net credit losses of $104 million, partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of approximately $1.9 billion, down 18%, driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. ICG delivered a 7.9% ROTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down slightly, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and our continued capital optimization efforts. Excluding FX, loans were up 1%. Average deposits were roughly flat. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 3%, and sequentially, deposits were up 4%. As for the full year, ICT grew revenues by 3% to $41 billion and delivered approximately $10.7 billion of net income, with an ROTCE of 11.1%. Now turning to Slide 15, we show the results of our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 5% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in non-interest revenue driven by lower investment product revenue in wealth and higher partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 7%, driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.7 billion, which included a reserve build driven by card volume growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. NCLs were up, reflecting ongoing normalization particularly in retail services. Average loans increased 6%, while average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 1.4%, driven by the ACL build this quarter and higher expenses. For the full year, PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 10.2% on $24.2 billion in revenue. On Slide 16, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues decreased 6%, primarily driven by the closing of five exit markets as well as the impact of the wind down. Expenses decreased 38%, largely driven by the absence of divestiture-related impact last year related to Korea. On Slide 17, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down driven by lower consulting expenses. On Slide 19, we summarize our guidance for 2023. As Jane mentioned earlier, 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1. We will continue to execute and invest, laying the foundation for the future with an eye towards driving long-term shareholder value. With that as a backdrop, we expect revenue to be in the range of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding any potential 2023 divestiture-related impacts, expenses to be roughly $54 billion, also excluding 2023 divestiture-related impact. Net credit losses in cards are expected to continue to normalize. And as we said earlier, we met our 13% CET1 target, and we will continue to evaluate the target as we go through the next DFAST cycle and close additional exit and announce others. On Slide 20, on the right side of the page, we show our revenue for 2021 and 2022 and our expectations for 2023, excluding the impact of divestitures. In 2023, we expect the revenue growth I just mentioned to be driven by NII and NIR. In TTS, we expect revenues to grow but at a slower pace, driven by interest rates and business actions. And for Security Services, we expect a bit of a tailwind from increased market valuation and onboarding of additional client assets. We also assumed somewhat of a normalization in wealth as lockdowns in China and market valuations start to rebound. And we expect investment banking to begin to rebound as the macroeconomic backdrop becomes more conducive to client activity. As for market, we expect it to be relatively flat given the level of activity we saw in 2022. Now turning to the NII guidance for 2023, we expect both ICG and PBWM to contribute to NII growth as we grow volumes, particularly in cards, and we continue to get the benefit of U.S. and non-U.S. rate hikes in our services business. As a reminder, the guidance for revenue includes the reduction of revenue from the exit and legacy franchises that we closed in 2022, and we expect to close this year in 2023.  Turning to Slide 21. In 2023, the increase in expenses that I just mentioned reflects a number of decisions that we've made to further our transformation and execute on our strategy. And the main drivers are, first, transformation as we continue to invest in data, risk and control and technology to enhance our infrastructure and ultimately make our company more efficient. Second, business-led investments as we execute against our strategy. Third, volume-related expenses in line with our revenue expectations. And fourth, elevated levels of inflation mainly impacting compensation expense, partially offset by productivity savings and expense benefits from the exit. And we are investing in technology across the firm with total technology-related expenses increasing by 5%. While we recognize this is a significant increase in expenses. These are investments that we have to make and I am certain that these investments will make us a better, more efficient company in the future. And finally, let's talk a little bit about the medium-term targets. At Investor Day, we said the medium term was 3 to 5 years. That time frame represented 2024 to 2026. So while a lot has changed in the macro environment since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are on a path to the 11% to 12% ROTCE target in the medium term. We continue to expect top line revenue growth, material expense reduction and capital levels largely consistent with our medium-term CET1 target range to contribute to the achievement of our 11% to 12% ROTCE target. So let me walk you through where we stand today. From a revenue perspective, rates have moved much higher and at a faster pace across the globe, which accelerated NII growth. And that, coupled with the execution of our strategy, has allowed certain businesses to accelerate. At the same time, other businesses such as wealth and investment banking have slowed. Despite this, consistent with Investor Day, we expect a 4% to 5% revenue CAGR in the medium term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exit. From an expense perspective, as we showed at Investor Day, expenses will need to normalize over the medium term. And we now expect to bend the curve on expenses towards the end of 2024. The three main drivers of the necessary expense reduction will be benefits from the exit, which will be included in legacy franchise the benefits from our investments in transformation and control and the simplification of the organizational structure. First, let me remind you, at this point, the ongoing expenses in legacy franchises are approximately $7 billion. Of the $7 billion, roughly $4 billion is transferred to the buyer upon closing or through a transition services agreement that typically lasts about a year. The remaining $3 billion relates to potentially stranded costs and wind down, which takes time to eliminate. Second, as our investment in transformation and control initiatives mature, we expect to realize efficiency as those programs transition from manually intensive processes, the technology-enabled one. And finally, we remain focused on simplifying the organization, and we expect to generate further opportunities for expense reduction in the future. From a credit perspective, we still expect net credit losses to continue to normalize and any future ACL build or releases will be a function of macro assumption and volume. So to wrap up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted, we remain on our path to achieve the 11% to 12% ROTCE in the medium term. And Jane, the rest of the firm and I, are prepared to continue to show proof points along the way and demonstrate our progress. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. Yes, sure. Good morning, Glenn, thanks for the question. So we did give you some guidance here we gave it to you both on the top line and the middle line for \u201823. And then importantly, when we talk about the medium term, it's both the continued revenue growth, the 4% to 5% CAGR that I referenced, but it's also bringing the expenses down from this \u201823 forecast. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the drivers of what's going to bring these expenses down. The combination of the exit of the businesses and the expenses going away associated with that with the benefits that we start to generate from the transformation spend and then org simplification that this type of strategic restructuring, if you will, in exiting all these countries will create an opportunity for. And so it's a combination of revenue growth, expense bending of that curve and coming down. The cost of credit is kind of as we've been talking about for some time now, which is it normalizes over the next couple of years at levels that are consistent with what we've seen kind of prior to this COVID cycle that we've been managing through. I appreciate that, Glenn, and Citi is an important firm. I'm the CFO of this firm and this strategy is something that I'm focused on with Jane, ensuring that we execute on right and in a way that creates shareholder value for our investors. And so we're committed to getting that done. Together. Sure. So let me make a comment first on the NII. Just keep in mind with that number that I've given on the page is both the growth that occurs in some of our important services businesses, and that really comes from both the annualization of rate increases that we saw in the back half of the year, but also expected continue increases, particularly outside of the U.S. And given the makeup of our franchise, we will \u2013 that will contribute to the NII growth. And then keep in mind that we're growing over the legacy franchise reductions in NII that we would see in 2023. So underneath that is some real momentum in the NII, notwithstanding a slower pace, the fact that it would be a slower pace than what we saw in 2022. From an NIR point of view, I did mention that we do expect to see some normalization in market valuation. And that would play out both in banking, normalizing certainly relative to what we saw this year with while it's down 50% to 60% as well as some normalization in wealth and those would hit the NIR line, as you point out. I'm not going to kind of get into \u201824 guidance. We will kind of get through \u201823, and I'm confident about our ability to get to that roughly 54 number that I put out for \u201823. I'm equally confident that we will bend this curve, and we will bring it down to the levels that it needs to be in order for us to get to the ROTCE target, but I'm not going to kind of get into, John, the specifics of 24 except to say that by the end of \u201824, we will see that curve bending. Good morning. Yes. So at Investor Day, we did talk about it, and we remain consistent and committed to that. We talked about getting to an efficiency ratio that's less than 60% in the medium-term period. And so that certainly will be part of the metric that we deliver on as we bring our costs down. I think the other thing I'd mention just you mentioned the how, and I think there are a couple of important aspects that the exits are obvious in terms of those costs going away, at least a portion of it is. The portion that's tied to stranded cost, Jane has been very, very clear with our entire management team of the importance of rethinking the organization and ensuring that the potentially stranded costs go away, and that means rethinking the way we do business and the way we operate different parts of our operations. I think the third piece is that technology, right? And so right now, a lot of what we're doing is manual. And as we continue to invest in technology and technology is up pretty significantly this year, 14% or so, we expect it to be up 5% next year. That technology build-out, if you will, will allow for us to reduce a lot of that manual activity, and that will bring down the operational cost for running the firm. And so those are a couple of examples, I hope, of the how. But I think importantly, you will start to see it in an improved operating efficiency over that period of time and getting to the target that we talked about at Investor Day. That's okay, Mike, when you do the math, I don't think it will get to the positive operating leverage in 2023. But we are, as you see on the slide, targeting a range that does reflect growth in the top line. That growth will likely be a little bit less than the growth that 54 number would \u2013 roughly 54 number would suggest but we are on the right track. And we are getting there in a way that's consistent with the strategy that we talked about. And we do feel confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we've put out here similar to delivering on the guidance we gave last year, recognizing there are a lot of things going on in the broader environment. Yes. So look, as we pointed out, we've built a significant amount of capital over the course of the year. We are ahead of the target we set for the middle of the year, middle of the year. We do have some exits that will have a temporary impact on that CET1 ratio. And we do obviously have a DFAST that's in front of us that we will have to see what the outcome is of that work. I think, look, the Basel end game and final views and decisions on that are still outstanding. And I think we will have to take those into consideration when they become available. That is an industry dynamic that will play out however it plays out. And similar to SACR, we will get after it in a very significant way to make sure that we're able to handle whatever headwinds or tailwinds may come along with that. But it really is difficult at this point to opine on exactly what that means for the industry in light of the fact that there aren't final rules out just yet. The only thing I'd point out is what we've described \u2013 what I've described, what Jane described is the medium term is \u201824 through 2026. And \u2013 we've given you guidance for \u201823. We intend to get to those return targets in the medium term. I haven't given you specific guidance on any of those individual years, and we will kind of take that year by year. And so just factor in. I think what's important is you've got a view on \u201823, and I think we've given you additional clarity on how we intend to get to that medium term, and I think that's important. Good morning. Only thing I would add \u2013 Betsy, you know this is \u2013 in a normal part of the cycle, this is a high margin, high returning business. And we have seen that in the past. And so we want to be well positioned for as the market turns, having brought on client advisors, having brought in new clients through client acquisitions, which were up 24% in 2022. And so I think we are well positioned for that. But as Jane mentioned, given where we are, we want to be smart about how we deploy the dollars. And so we will replace that as necessary, but ensure that we are ready for when things turn. It's a market business, right. And so you know very well kind of the volatility that can come with any markets business. With that said, we have got a very, very strong FICC franchise. We had a very good year, a very good year this year. I think we are well positioned with the client base, and we are well positioned to maintain our number one position as we go into 2023. Now, how that market and market wallet moves, I think is it was going to predicate on a number of things, including how the macro continues to evolve and how central bank activity continues to evolve and how currencies move and the like. But again, I feel like we are well positioned to hold our position, if not gain more share as that plays out. And so I think flat relative to a year that we have had up as significantly as it is, is a reasonable call based on what we know now. Good afternoon. Similar dynamics you say in \u201823 or you are talking about fourth quarter. I am not sure I followed. Yes. So, I think \u2013 I mean I think I would point to a couple of things on the NII side, just as it relates to us. One, importantly, that I mentioned in and you point out is when you think about our mix of deposits, we have got about 65% or so are in ICG and the balance, 35% in our PBWM business. We certainly skew to U.S. dollar, but we have got a 30% or so that is a non-U.S. dollar. And when I think about the potential or the forward curves and how rates will likely move next year, we will get the benefit of further rate increases on the non-U.S. side, right. And so if I think about our international presence, the betas tend to not be as high as they are here in the U.S. with our Corporate Clients segment. And so I think there are some re-pricing opportunities that we will continue to actively manage as we did here in the U.S. And so I do think it's that international footprint, the globality of our franchise that plays to our strength in 2023. The other thing that is apparent to us as we forecast this out is the continued growth from a volume point of view. And that volume growth, you have seen the momentum already pick up on the card side with significant growth in interest-earning balances. And we would expect that to continue, particularly as we see NCLs normalize and as we see payment rates start to temper. And so I think those things will be two major contributors. Mix is obviously a factor. As you point out, we will be growing over some of the drag or reduction from legacy, but is that active management of the client engagement that we have across both portfolios, that I think will be important factors to us delivering the growth that I talked about. Sorry, finish your question. I am sorry. I think the thing you have got to pick up is really the legacy franchise and the NII. A large part of the legacy franchise revenues are NII revenues when you look at the mix of the products and the clients that we cover there. And so I think that's the important element here that we haven't quantified to a dollar amount, but that is explaining why it seems like muted growth relative to what you would have seen in the fourth quarter. Obviously, there is other factors, but that's important. Good afternoon. The only thing I would add is that, Gerard, you could see just depending on how this plays out. You could see kind of NCL rates tick up above normal levels and then come back down to normal levels in the timeline that Jane described. Again, just depending on how the macro factors continue to play out. But again, we \u2013 as we sit here and talk about these NPL rates, it's important to point out as well that we are very well reserved across all of these portfolios. And so to some extent, if you put macro assumptions aside and volumes aside, the NPLs kind of get funded by the reserves that have been established. But the trend line is exactly as Jane described, just recognizing that you could see a tick up above normal levels and then it come back down. I think a couple of things. So one, our base case scenario, if you think about what we just talked about includes kind of a mild recession in it, just and as we forecasted it, the downside would be something a bit more severe than that. I would say we are reserved for approximately a 5% unemployment rate, just kind of overall when you look at \u2013 when you average across the different scenarios that we have. Yes. I am not going to get into Ken, kind of guidance on NIM. What I will say is that we have seen good traction in the early part of the year as it relates to acquisitions on the card side. We have made very good traction. And Jane, you may want to comment on kind of the relationships that we have with some of the partners and with American. And we have also launched a number of new products that I think is helping to fuel the growth that we have seen on the heels of those investments and some of the increase that we have seen in spend rates as well as some of the average interest-earning balance and loan growth that we have seen. But I really don't want to get into the NIM guidance at the card level or the aggregate at this point. Yes. Thank you. I will go ahead and I will take that. I am not going to kind of do sensitivity scenarios with you here on the fly. What I will say is that as we build these reserves, we are building them against three scenarios. That base scenario that I mentioned, the downside scenario and upside scenario, and we weight those scenarios. And the base that we used this quarter built in a mild recession. And in that baseline, unemployment was, call it, 4.4% or so in terms of the unemployment assumption. We also had a downside scenario. Unemployment in the downside scenario got to a 6.9% or so. And then we had an upside scenario. The weighted average across the quarters was about the 5.1% that I mentioned. And those were factors that went into the reserve that we established in the in the quarter. And largely, when you think about the weightings we have put on those scenarios, the weighting skew towards that base and that downside. The reserve we built this quarter was largely in the consumer business, PBWM and specifically around cards. And that really had to do the change quarter-over-quarter with the change in HPI. But what I would say is that it also reflects, as I have mentioned earlier, a cards portfolio that remains of a very good quality and with loss rates that are well below what they would be in a normal cycle. And it does pick up the fact that there is volume growth that we saw in the quarter there. So, I am not going to kind of run scenarios for you, but hopefully, that gives you some perspective as to what's underneath the models that we have used to establish these reserves. And obviously, we do that on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Well, it kind of depends on what the drivers are of a different environment, right. Because you could have \u2013 I don't anticipate this, but you could have continued pressure in investment banking, but you could also have continued volatility in rates or currencies and that could mean more upside than flat for the markets business. So, there are a lot of puts and takes that one can scenario out. I think what's really important is that we have a diversified portfolio of businesses that have strategic connectivity to them. And so what that allows for is that as the environment shifts in some way that we may not have predicted that we were often able to still drive significant performance as we did this year. And so without calling exactly how it vary from what's here, that's what gives us the confidence to \u2013 around the guidance and really to remain steadfast on the strategy that we have talked about and really push execution, and that's exactly what we are doing. It's a great point, Jane, because it may not always show up in the top line, which is why we put those KPIs out there. There are often indicators of some of the upside that's on the come as the market evolves. Yes. Mike, I have to tell you that I am surprised that you are asking about Mexico, just given our history together, but I understand it. And what I would say is that a couple of things. One, we clearly see where we trade, right. And we are not happy about where we trade. And we think our strategy warrants us trading better than where we trade today. So, if we could buy back, right, we could do buybacks as soon as we are able to do buybacks, we will, right. I mean that is part of the way we deliver value for our shareholders. The second thing I would say is we did get to the 13% sooner. And that was, again, in accordance with executing against our strategy. And our parts of our business, particularly the markets business has done a really good job at delivering against the metric we put out of revenue to RWA. And we have been able to get there without damaging the franchise, which is what you see in the continued strength and performance in that business, particularly in fixed income. What's ahead of us, as you rightfully pointed out, is that we have got a number of exits that have to take place, puts and takes across many of them, but Mexico in particular, will have a temporary impact on our CET1 ratio. And so we want to be mindful of that as we manage over the next two quarters, so that we can absorb that. And we also want to make sure that we are positioned to continue to serve our clients over the next couple of quarters and always, but certainly over the next couple of quarters, while we manage the headwind, temporary headwind from that exit. So, hopefully that gives you a better sense for it, but we are actively managing this. And we have not lost focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders. Yes. You got a couple of points here. So, one is we won't see NII momentum as we have seen in 2022, just as betas start to increase on the ICG side and get to terminal levels, that's obviously going to slow or put pressure on the pricing as we go into \u201823. But some of the other important drivers of the growth will be the annualization of the rate hikes that happened late in the year. And so that will be a plus in 2023. You will also see, as I mentioned earlier, some of the rate increases that we anticipate outside of the U.S. and given our mix, that will benefit us in 2023. And then there will be a volume will contribute to that NII growth, particularly as we continue to see good momentum, which we anticipate on the card side, the offset will be that the legacy franchise, right. And so as those exits occur as the wind downs continue, as I mentioned earlier, that revenue mix does skew towards NII. And so we will have to grow over that and we will grow over that to kind of get to the target that we have set. So, those are the puts and takes."

You \u2013 also as a reminder, this call is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJen Landis: Thank you, Operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation which is available for download on our website citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Jen, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we are certainly still living through interesting times, and overall, I am pleased with how our Bank is navigating through them. As you will hear from me shortly, we continue to focus intensely on executing our strategy and our transformation as we outlined at Investor Day, whilst supporting our clients in this complex environment. So before I get into the quarter, let me highlight some observations about what we see going on around the world, given our unique vantage point. The global macro outlook that we shared with you over the last couple of quarters has been borne out. There is accumulating evidence of slowing global growth and we now expect to experience rolling country level recessions starting this quarter. The severity and timing of these recessions depend, where in the world you are, although, persistently high inflation is driving a global softening of consumer demand for goods. In the Eurozone and the U.K., the supply shocks are most severe. Growth prospects have deteriorated sharply and headline inflation is running at nearly 10%. All eyes are on this winter\u2019s weather forecast and the energy supply. The U.S. economy, however, remains relatively resilient. So while we are seeing signs of economic slowing consumers and corporates remain healthy, as our very low net credit losses demonstrate. Supply chain constraints are easing, the labor market remains strong, so it is all a question of what it takes to truly tame persistently high core inflation. Now, history would suggest that that will be quite a lot and for some time. Therefore, we could well see a mild recession in the second half of 2023. We believe the U.S. economy is well positioned to withstand it, all else being equal in the geopolitical arena that is. Finally, in Asia, we continue to be concerned with China\u2019s COVID lockdowns, which took a bigger bite out of economic activity than anticipated, exacerbated by a lack of intensified macro stimulus. It is geopolitical risks and rates that dominate discussions with our corporate clients worldwide, and I\u2019d say, we are more focused on market liquidity generally, and counterparty risk than our credit risk in the near-term. Nonetheless, we are planning conservatively and we are prepared for all environments. Against this backdrop, today, we reported net income of $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63 and an RoTCE of 8.2%. We grew revenues by 6%, including a gain on sale of our consumer business in the Philippines. While we had excellent performance in some areas, our results could have been better in a few others. Services delivered another very strong quarter. TTS saw revenues up 40% year-over-year, with growth in each business and in fees. Key drivers of our strategy such as wallet share, trade loan originations and cross border transactions are all trending strongly in the right direction and are ahead of our plan. Securities Services was up 15%, despite asset under custody being impacted by the declines in equity markets. We have onboarded over a $1 trillion in AUC and AUA since the beginning of the year and we are seeing good momentum in issuer services in particular. Market on the other hand came in lower, with revenues down 7%. In Fixed Income, we matched last year\u2019s particularly good showing through our longstanding strength in FX, offsetting a weaker quarter in spread products. In Equities, reduced activity in derivatives, which is a core part of our platform led to lower revenues, compared to last year\u2019s exceptional performance and we continued to optimize RWA end markets consistent with our strategy. Banking was the business most adversely impacted by the macro environment across the industry, with geopolitics and fears of recession significantly reducing deal flows and the appetite for M&A. We continue to invest in building out our teams for long-term growth opportunities including healthcare, technology and energy, and I am really pleased with the high-caliber bankers who are attracted to both our platform and our culture. The environment to Wealth Management continued to be less than ideal. Our revenues were down only slightly and meaningfully up outside of Asia. Our strategy to capture the synergies of our businesses such as the Wealth referral initiatives between Commercial Banking, Retail Banking and Investment Banking is progressing well. We also continued to steadily attract new clients and increase the ranks of our client advisers as you will see in our KPIs. Nonetheless, we are slowing the pace of some of the investments in this business, given the environment. U.S. Personal Banking further solidified its growth trajectory. Card sales, A&R, interest-earning balances and customer acquisition all saw a good growth and we continued to increase digital uptake. Retail Services joined Branded Cards in having double-digit revenue growth this quarter. Retail Banking also grew contributing to a 10% overall revenue increase to the business. As you can see in the presentation, our cost of credit reflects the quality of our loan portfolio in both ICG and PBWM. There were effectively no credit losses in ICG and U.S. Consumer NCLs remain well below the pre-COVID levels. Consumer loan growth, together with the worsening of our macroeconomic assumptions drove a modest ACL build this quarter. While, our expenses are elevated as we continue to invest in our businesses and in our transformation, we are managing them closely and we remain on track to meet the full year guidance. As you know, the transformation is a multiyear effort and we are committed to meeting the expectations of our regulators, given the paramount importance of safety and soundness. We continue to be in constructive dialogs with them and are updating our execution plans as appropriate. Stepping back, I am generally pleased with the advances we are making and the key drivers of the strategy we laid out for you in March and these are laid out on page three. We are seeing good momentum in realizing client synergies and in attracting talent to grow the franchise. In terms of simplification, we continue to make progress on the divestitures of our international consumer businesses and the elimination of their associated stranded costs. We closed the sale of the Philippines during the third quarter and are on track to close Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand during the fourth quarter. We also announced the wind down of our consumer franchise in the U.K. to focus fully on the Wealth franchise there. I would also note we are ahead of our plan in our Korean consumer wind down. We continue to shrink our operations in and exposure to Russia. To be clear, our intention is to wind down our presence in that country. In August, we announced the wind down of our consumer and local Commercial Banking businesses. While we have been supporting our multinational clients in Russia, we are now informing them that we will be ending nearly all of the institutional banking services we offer by the end of the first quarter of next year. At that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations. Turning to Capital, we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through common dividends during the quarter, while buybacks continue to be on hold. We will keep evaluating that decision on a quarterly basis, as due to increasing regulatory requirements we build our CET1 ratio to 13% or so by mid next year and that includes a management buffer of 100 basis points. We ended the quarter at a CET1 ratio of 12.2%, as we actively managed our RWA usage throughout our lines of business. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $80.34. So, the bottomline is that while the environment is a challenging one and we expect it will remain so, we continue to focus relentlessly on executing the strategy we presented to you at our Investor Day and on making steady progress. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted as always to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise and spend a little more time on expenses, credit and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment and end with full year 2022 guidance. On slide four, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of $3.5 billion and EPS of $1.63, with an RoTCE of 8.2% on $18.5 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $520 million, largely driven by a gain on the sale of the Philippines consumer business. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, EPS and RoTCE would have been $1.50 and 7.5%, respectively. In the quarter, total revenues increased 6% on a reported basis excluding divestiture-related impacts revenues were down 1% as growth in net interest income was more than offset by lower non-interest revenues. Net interest income grew 18% driven by the impact of higher interest rates across the firm and strong loan growth in PBWM. Non-interest revenues were down 12% on a reported basis and 28% excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely reflecting declines in Investment Banking, Markets and Investment Revenues in Wealth. Total expenses of $12.7 billion increased 8% and 7% excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely driven by transformation, inflation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.4 billion, driven by net credit losses of approximately $900 million and an ACL build of approximately $500 million, primarily driven by loan growth in PBWM. At the end of the quarter, we had $18.7 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.5%. On slide five, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the third quarter, total net interest income increased by approximately $600 million on a sequential basis and approximately $1.9 billion on a year-over-year basis across the firm, driven by higher interest rates, management of deposit re-pricing and loan growth in PBWM. Average loans were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower balances in Legacy Franchises. Excluding FX, loans were largely flat and average deposits were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by declines in Legacy Franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by the issuance of institutional CDs as we continue to diversify the funding profile of the Bank. Excluding FX deposits were up roughly 1%, and sequentially, our net interest margin increased by 7 basis points. On slide six, we show an expense walk for the third quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8% and 7% excluding the impact of divestitures, 2% of the increase was driven by transformation investments, with about two-thirds related to the risk, controls, data and finance programs, and approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. As of today, we have over 10,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments, as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers, as well as client advisers in Wealth and we continue to invest in the client experience, as well as front-office onboarding and platforms. 1% was due to higher volume-related expenses across both PBWM and ICG. And approximately 3% was driven by other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, including systems and hiring people, resulting in our technology related spend up approximately 16% for the quarter. On slide seven, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Over the last several years, we have been disciplined with our loan growth and consistent with our risk appetite framework. This framework includes credit risk limits that consider concentrations including country, industry, credit rating, and in the case of consumer, FICO scores, and importantly, these limits apply across the firm in aggregate and we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentrations under a range of stress scenarios. As a result, we feel very good about our asset quality and reserve levels. As I mentioned earlier, our reserve-to-funded loan ratio is approximately 2.5%, and within that PBWM and U.S. Cards is 3.7% and 7.5%, respectively, both right around day one CECL levels. In PBWM, the majority of our card portfolios skew towards higher FICO customers and while we have started to see signs of normalization in both portfolios, NCL rates continue to be less than half of pre-COVID levels. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% as investment grade and non-accrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 40 basis points of total loans. So, we are well reserved for a variety of scenarios and we continuously evaluate our scenarios to reflect the evolving macro environment. On slide eight, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet, of our $2.4 trillion of assets, about 23% or $557 billion are high quality liquid assets or HQLA and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $967 billion. The combination of earnings generation, capital from exits and RWA optimization drove our CET1 ratio up by about 25 basis points to approximately 12.2% on a standardized basis, which remains our binding constraint and our tangible book value per share was $80.34, up 2% from a year ago. On slide nine, we show a sequential $0.2 billion [ph] of net income to common, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 8 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 5-basis-point reduction. Fourth, changes in the DTA drove a 3-basis-point reduction. And finally, the remaining 14-basis-point increase was largely driven by net RWA optimization. In light of our increasing regulatory capital requirement, we ended the quarter with a 12.2% CET1 ratio, 25 basis points higher than last quarter. Importantly 12.2% is above our current regulatory requirement of 11.5% as of October 1st and above 12%, which will be our regulatory requirement as of January 1st of next year. As we said last quarter, we continue to gradually build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which includes the current 4% SCB and 100-basis-point management buffer. On slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues were down 5%, as strong growth in services was more than offset by lower revenues across markets and banking. Expenses increased 10%, driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity and foreign exchange translation. Foster credit was driven by a reserve build of $86 million. While deterioration in certain macro variables did lead to a build, it was mostly offset by the release of a COVID-19 related uncertainty reserve and a release related to direct exposures in Russia. This resulted in a net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 30%. Average loans were up 1% driven by 9% growth in TTS loans, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Average deposits were down 2%, also largely driven by foreign exchange translation. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 9%. On slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out in Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 40%, driven by 61% growth in net interest income, as well as 8% growth in NIR across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 10%, commercial card volumes up roughly 50% and average loans up 19%. So while the rate environment drove about 40% of the growth this quarter business actions, drove the remaining 60%. This includes continuing to manage deposit re-pricing and deepening with existing clients and significant new client wins across all client segments. Through the first half of the year, based on the industry data that we see, we estimate that we gained over 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients and client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments, including wins with financial institutions, which are up almost 50%. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client\u2019s primary operating Bank. In addition, weak products in the U.S. and Asia, which allows clients to connect their liquidity and funding to their operating flows seven days a week. In Securities Services, revenues grew 15%, as net interest income grew 73%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, partly offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. We continue to be pleased with the execution in Security Services as we onboarded approximately $1 trillion of assets under custody and administration so far this year from significant client wins and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. And we estimate that we have gained about 60 basis points of share in Security Services through the first half of this year, including in our home market. As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy and our two of our higher returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. Markets revenues were down 7%, largely driven by spread products, equities and RWA actions as we continue to focus on returns. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 1% as strength in rates and FX was largely offset by continued headwinds in spread products and through the first half of the year, we gained approximately 40 basis points of share. Equity Markets revenues were down 25%, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives relative to a very strong quarter last year. The actions we took to optimize RWA in markets are in line with the strategy we discussed at Investor Day and we are making solid progress on our revenue to RWA targets so far this year. And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down 49%, driven by Investment Banking, as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continue to impact client activity. Also embedded in the results is an impact of approximately $110 million related to marks on loan commitments and losses on loan sales. So, overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress we are making as we continue to deepen existing client relationships, as well as acquire new clients. Now turning to slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income grow was partially offset by a decline in non-interest revenue, driven by lower investment fee revenue in Wealth and higher partner payments in Retail Services. Expenses were up 13%, driven by transformation, other risk and control initiatives business led investments and volume driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $1.1 billion, which included a reserve build primarily driven by card volume growth. NCLs were 13% higher year-over-year from near historically low levels, reflecting normalization particularly in Retail Services. Overall, we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. Average loans grew 5%, driven by strong growth across branded cards, Retail Services and Retail Banking. Average deposits grew 1%, driven by growth across Retail and Wealth, partially offset by foreign exchange translation, and PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 9.7%. On slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product, as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 10%, driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 10%, card spend volumes up 14% and average loans up 12%. Retail Services revenues were up 12%, also driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher partner payments. So despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we have been making contributed to growth in interest earning balances of 9% in branded cards and 7% in Retail Services, and we expect to continue to grow these balances in the fourth quarter. Retail Banking revenues were up 2%, primarily driven by interest rates and deposit growth. Wealth revenues were down 2%, as investment fee headwinds and particularly in Asia more than offset net interest income growth. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. Client advisers were up 5% and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our Wealth business, with new clients in ultra-high net worth and wealth work of 7% and 27%, respectively, for the quarter. And we are also leveraging our Retail network, which has driven almost 50,000 Wealth referrals so far this year. While the environment continues to remain challenging, we are seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy. On slide 14, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues increased 66%, primarily driven by the Philippines gain on sale in the quarter and the absence of the Australia loss on sale in the prior year period. Excluding these items, revenues were down about 12%, largely due to the loss of revenues from the Australia and Philippines closing, as well as the impact of the Korea wind down. Expenses increased 6%, driven by divestiture impacts in Asia and Mexico. Loans and deposits decreased as a result of the reclassification of signed exits to other assets and other liabilities, the closing of the Philippine sale and the impact of the Korea wind down. On slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, partially offset by the mark-to-market on certain derivative transactions and expenses were down. On slide 16, I will briefly touch on our full year 2022 outlook. With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range, excluding divestiture related impacts. And within that, we continue to see a shift with higher net interest income offset by lower non-interest revenue. So, for the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income excluding markets to be up in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion year-over-year. Clearly, where we land within that range will be a function of a number of factors, including rates, loans and deposit volumes, deposit betas and currency impacts. Regarding full year expenses, we continue to expect expenses to grow by 7% to 8%, excluding divestiture related impacts. In terms of cost of credit, it will be a function of the evolution of the macro environment, normalization that we continue to expect in the cards businesses and loan growth. And keep in mind that loan growth tends to be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third given typical holiday spending. Before we move to Q&A, I\u2019d like to end with a few key points. We continue to execute on the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. We are seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses. And as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we are confident we can achieve our medium-term targets in a variety of scenarios. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello. Thanks very much. So definitely a good performance at TTS, rates help a ton, but I see loan growth and fees and I heard your comments about growth across all client segments. I wonder if we could pull back \u2013 Jane pull back in a drop and talk about those two in separate pieces. One is 61% year-on-year NII, how do betas factor in and go forward over the next year in terms of higher rates and how that factors through? And then two, what specifically is growing within TTS across those client segments to drive that high single-digit growth?\nMark Mason: Sure. Good morning, Glenn. Why don\u2019t I take that and kind of take it in two pieces, the two pieces that you laid out. So, as you know, Glenn, when we think about our business just in aggregate, there\u2019s obviously a split between the Institutional and the Consumer side. Our TTS business, which is on the Institutional side and these corporate clients, they tend to have higher betas in general than, obviously, the Retail Banking side. What we have seen is that the betas have been increasing. They are still running lower than what we had expected, but again, they have been increasing. And with continued expected rate increases, I would expect that those betas will continue to rise in the coming quarters. We have been actively managing beta -- deposit pricing and re-pricing with our clients on an ongoing basis. You know that this is more than just a deposit taking business. This is a business where we are looking to manage the operating accounts of our clients and bring the breadth of what we offer in our franchise to them. And so those -- that\u2019s the type of conversation we have been having with them and we will continue to do that with an eye towards growing the volume of deposits with both the existing, as well as with new clients. And so we, again, expect to see betas to rise \u2013 betas rise, but also expect to see continued contribution to the NII. The other aspect of your question is what else has been driving the activity? I mentioned a couple of those things, so it\u2019s not just deepening with existing clients, but it\u2019s also onboarding new clients. We have seen cross-border transaction value up about 10%. The commercial card spend is up meaningfully, trade originations are up 27% and so a lot of active engagement with our clients. We have been winning new mandates. We have seen an uptick in client wins up about 20% and we have been gaining share across those client segments. And so, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of example -- of examples of where the benefits or momentum is coming from on the NIR side. The NIR growth of 8% is driven really by the cards, the payments and receivables, as well as trade.\nJane Fraser: And I\u2019d just jump in and say, I think, there\u2019s a bit of a miss at the moment that the global environment is detrimental to activity. We see quite the opposite. Volatility is something in which we are very active in helping our multinational clients around the world manage, the local footprint we have and the global network we have is a tremendous asset right now. So we are seeing a lot of positive momentum, which may not always be intuitive to everyone, but I think it\u2019s what makes the network, the crown jewel of Citi.\nGlenn Schorr: No doubt. I appreciate all that. A quick one on markets, not quite as good as the years, but that comes and goes. I know that\u2019s a function of last year was really strong, it\u2019s a function of mix in any given quarter. What I really want to focus on is your comments on RWA optimization, what specifically are you doing? I know it\u2019s in the Banking book, but I did see you taking down your capital, call it, redemption facility line. But in markets, what are you pulling back on RWA, just which pieces of that business find that interesting?\nMark Mason: Sure. So, Glenn, you will remember at Investor Day, we talked not only about RWA optimization broadly, but specifically as it relates to markets. And we talked about the idea of increasing our revenue to RWA ratio for markets to about 5.5% over the course of that Investor Day period. So we have been actively working across the markets business, in equities, in fixed income and spread products, and looking for opportunities where there are low returning uses of RWA to either increase the returns on that or to actually kind of exit it. And that includes a host of different structures. It includes working with clients to post additional collateral in some instances and other types of structures like that, that improved the RWA, including hedging, and like I said, posting collateral and taking a look at margin that we have and ensuring that we are, in fact, getting the most for that use of RWA.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John McDaniel -- McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nJohn McDonald: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I wanted to just clarify what, I think the expense guide is for fourth quarter, it seems like the guidance for the full year implies a fourth quarter step-up to maybe 12.8% and change from 12, 7.5% this quarter. Is that the right read, a little bit of a step-up in the fourth quarter and is that just a pull-through of investments and what would be driving that?\nMark Mason: Yeah. So, again, the guidance on full year expenses hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s the 7% to 8% ex-fee impact of divestitures that would imply a bit of an uptick there. It is on the heels of the continued investments that we are making and that\u2019s flowing through, as well as how we -- how revenues kind of play out and the associated compensation activity that goes along with that. So, nothing extraordinary and consistent with the guidance given.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And I know it\u2019s too early to give formal guidance for next year, but if we look at the Investor Day slides, it seems to imply that expenses go up for a few years until you get to the medium-term. Is that implies at $51 million or so next year as a starting point. I mean is it fair when I read the Investor Day slides and think about your investments that directionally expenses probably do go up next year?\nMark Mason: John, I\u2019d say, as you know, right, we will give guidance for 2023 next quarter. But I think if you think back to the Investor Day and you think about some of the things that we just commented on with regard to our Services business, we would expect to see continued tailwinds as it relates to net interest income. We would expect to get to the heart of your question that we will continue to invest in the franchise that in the transformation, excuse me, that would obviously peak and then we would start to see the benefits start to play out from that in that medium-term period. And so, yes, you can probably expect some type of a tick up, but I will give you more details on that when we talk about the 2023 outlook in the next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: Yeah. Just wanted \u2013 thank you. Yeah. Just wanted to take a step back, your 11% to 12% medium-term RoTCE target had contemplated an 11.5% to 12% CET1 versus the 13% that you are targeting to by midyear next year? Also that you laid out on that same slide that you are targeting 2% fed funds over the medium-term, which seems kind of cute right now. I guess I am wondering, your confidence and like you said you are confident you could hit medium-term targets even with this creep in capital, is it really that shift in the rate environment that\u2019s helping you get there despite the higher denominator?\nMark Mason: So thank you for the question. Look, I think, there are a couple of things to kind of think back on that still hold true, which is the strategy that we have built, I think, is a resilient strategy and it really spoke to topline momentum that we expected, not just through rate increases, but also through share gains and also through the business led investments that we -- that we are making and better leveraging the synergies and linkages across the franchise. All of those things still hold true to the topline. You are right, the fed funds assumption has changed. Back in March, I think, we all were looking at a fed funds rate at the end of the year that was closer to 1.5% or so, and so now here we are with the hikes that we have seen and looking at something certainly north of 4%, 4.5%. And so that\u2019s changed meaningfully, but there are a number of other drivers that contribute to achieving that return, including, it\u2019s the medium term, so call it, three years to five years, I think, is how we characterized it and starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation investments that we are making. To your point on capital, we are building to the 13%. Remember, that is a byproduct of a 4% SCB for this particular CCAR cycle and the strategy that we described includes a mix in our shift of revenues and earnings over time, a mix towards more stable PPNR and more fee revenues that will contribute to, I think, a balance sheet and a mix that is certain -- that generates fewer losses -- stress losses than our balance sheet might today. So the contribution of those things, we think will drive that return target that we have set and we still remain confident about that. Now, with that said, there are unknowns that are out there. I just spoke to many of the nobles and so what happens with further capital requirements and the current regulatory regime and what like \u2013 and what have you, it\u2019s hard to predict, but we will manage to that as we learn and know more about it.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And my follow-up question is, given Citi\u2019s valuation on book, I think, your current and prospective shareholders are waiting for buybacks to potentially return. I guess a two-part question here. Number one, especially if you think you could stabilize your PPNR in the stress test, why 100-basis-point management buffer versus one of your peers at 50-basis-point that reported today? And secondarily, as we think about impact the timing, as I recall, there\u2019s a currency translation adjustment that could be negative upfront at announcement to CET1, but you get that all back during close. So I guess the real big question here is, how should we think about, what are the mile markers for the return of buyback activity at Citi?\nMark Mason: Okay. Thank you, Erika. There\u2019s a lot bit unpack if I forget anything just please remind me. But it started at the beginning, which is, I know where we trade in terms of book value and I\u2019d love to be in a position where we were buying back given that valuation. With that said, we are going to take it quarter-by-quarter, as I think you have heard us say and evaluate what buyback decisions and capital actions make the most sense in light of the environment that we are managing through. We are clearly managing through an uncertain environment. We do -- as I just said and as you kind of mentioned as well, we do see our business mix shifting over time on the heels of our strategy. I do think that over time, that will contribute, as I said, to the capital requirements that we have, but that\u2019s over the medium-term. And we do still see a fair amount of volatility in the stress capital buffer. And part of the reason that we have the management buffer is to deal not only with that uncertainty in the SCB, but also in interest rates and we are seeing volatility in both frankly. And so we will continue to evaluate the management buffer as well to see what makes sense as we move towards that medium-term. In terms of the Mexico transaction, you are right in terms of we have mentioned before the CTA component to that. That is a timing difference. We have factored that in to the path to our 13% by middle of next year and factor that into achieving the longer term targets that we set for ourselves.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Can you hear me?\nJane Fraser: Yes. We can, Mike.\nMike Mayo: Good morning.\nJane Fraser: Good morning.\nMike Mayo: Look, I look at the global network as a curse and a blessing. I guess the curse part is simply the complexity and the expenses, and Mark, you said expenses should go up higher next year. You are not going to tell us for a few more months, but I am just wondering when you think you can grow revenues faster than expenses. Again, it\u2019s not new news, the revenue and expenses, you guided it and you are within that range. It\u2019s just as we waited, we have to wait a year or three years or how long for that complexity to get more simplified so revenues can catch up to that expense growth? And then on the blessing side, Mark, you mentioned, you said gain share in those client segments. I thought that was a little vague. I mean, you talked about trade. You talked about other activity connecting multinational corporations in the period of volatility. So if you could put a little more meat on the bone as far as when you talk about market share and those tailwinds on the revenues, while you have the headwinds on the expenses from the global network.\nJane Fraser: Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Jane. I am jumping in, because I do want to talk a bit about your point on the global network here. I have to tell you, I am hard pressed to find a negative to the global network. We start off with the vision for the Bank that we laid out in March. It is to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross-border needs. Who are those clients? It is 5,000 multinationals on their subsidiaries, it\u2019s institutional investors and the ultra high net worth clients with a heavy tilt to family offices. And we serve them on FX, on liquidity management, on their payroll, on their supply chain, as well as strategic advice financing, et cetera. That\u2019s $4 trillion in daily volume, 80% of that credit portfolio is investment grade. So when we are looking at it, it\u2019s the multinational to take a higher risk country, it\u2019s the client base we are serving there of the global multinationals much more than the local players. And so this is not a -- this is a relatively simple high returning, very well growing as we are seeing at the moment capability that is exceedingly hard to replicate. So let me pass over to Mark in terms of what are some of the examples of different areas of the drivers of growth?\nMark Mason: Yeah.\nJane Fraser: This is -- as I said at the beginning, this is a crown jewel. It\u2019s not a source of complexity for the Bank.\nMark Mason: Yeah. So, Mike, I\u2019d say a couple of things. One, what I said was that, we continue to gain share, and I referenced specifically about 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients and we obviously or not obviously, we are also winning mandates and gaining share with other client segments as well, you know that the Commercial Banking client segment is one that we are focused on given the strength of our platform and its applicability to those sized clients as well. I mentioned that our wins are up and specifically, they are up 20%, the mandates that we are winning across all client segments and that specifically with FIs, they are up almost 50%. So hopefully, that gives you some sense of where the revenue growth is coming from. The takeaway there is it\u2019s both existing, as well as new clients as we kind of continue to build out the platform and build out our capabilities to reach them. So the second part of your question was around expenses and expenses growing and when will we have topline growth that exceeds the expense growth. And I\u2019d remind you that, the work we are doing on the transformation, as well as the business led investments are multiyear almost by definition and important in order to derive savings in our structural cost base over time. And at Investor Day, I think I pointed to, by the time we got to that medium-term period, we would see our operating efficiency go down to less than 60%. I think we have been very deliberate about trying to give you guidance and update you on guidance for the full year, and along the way and we will be consistent in that discipline and I can certainly give you more color on 2023, as I mentioned earlier to John, the next -- in the next quarter.\nMike Mayo: And just one clarification, when you say you have gained 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients, what do you mean by share, share of what?\nMark Mason: A wallet, 60 basis points, not 50 basis points, 60 basis points. So market share with them.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess, one, just Mark, I wanted to clarify your NII guide for $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion is just total NII, right? It\u2019s not ex-markets or anything?\nMark Mason: It is ex-markets.\nEbrahim Poonawala: It is ex-markets. Any perspective or view on where you see markets heading in fourth quarter, just given what\u2019s happened with the rate backdrop?\nMark Mason: I don\u2019t \u2013 I -- very intentionally don\u2019t forecast markets NII in a rising rate environment. You would normally see the markets NII come down. It tends to be liability sensitive. But we tend to focus on, as you probably heard me say a number of times, total revenues for this business. And I guess what I\u2019d highlight is that in periods of uncertainty and lots of market volatility, our businesses tend to perform well and so we will see how the fourth quarter plays out. There\u2019s obviously some seasonality to it that has taken place historically and so we have to kind of factor all those things in, but we will have to see how it further evolves.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nJane Fraser: Hey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Just two things, one, just another question on the expense side, I just wanted to follow up with regard to, Mark, I think, the stranded costs that you had talked about at the Barclays Conference and I am wondering if I got the message right there, which is when you exit the consumer businesses, there\u2019s 25% that is generally managed through a TSA. So it\u2019s a service agreement and that expense will come off over time and then there\u2019s another 25%, which is likely not to come off. Is that fair or is there a different message that I am missing on that?\nMark Mason: Yeah. That\u2019s not fair. But I appreciate the answer clarity. So I bucket into three buckets. So one is, when we do these transactions, both Jane and I have deep experience in this. We tend to see about half of the costs go away to the buyer. So when we do the transaction, when we do the sale. As you pointed out, about 25% is often in place as part of a transition service agreement and so there\u2019s revenues that we get paid to offset that expense until things have totally transitioned and then that goes away. And then the third bucket is what I call potentially stranded cost and what Jane calls not stranded call, right? And that is, I say, potentially, because their regional expenses that get allocated to countries, for example, they are global expenses that get allocated to the region and to the countries, for example, and what we have to do. And what we are doing is we are attacking what would otherwise be stranded cost and we are attacking that by telling each of the functions in the business and here\u2019s your portion of that 25% and come back and tell me how you are going to rethink your org structure, simplify your processes in order to drive that cost out of the company, right? And so that\u2019s what we have been doing, remember the expense base here is probably $7 billion. So you can break down kind of the population that we are talking about. We have already stood up a team work with each of the businesses and each of the functions around getting in front of that cost so that we can drive that down over the near-term period of time.\nJane Fraser: And as this got, I just can\u2019t help myself but jump in here. I think as Mark \u2013 so I am spotting at Mark here. Mark and I are both pretty maniacally focused around this. But I\u2019d say, at the moment, we have had a couple of the divestitures closed, we have another three next quarter and this continues on. We already started on Australia and the Philippines, and getting those expenses down, as Mark said. There is going to be and we will not be shy in capturing as an opportunity to simplify our organization further next year when we have more of the divestitures closed and streamlining more of our regional management structures, more of the expenses at the global level. So there is more to come on that and we will be looking to do that. As I indicated at Investor Day that will be an important part once more of the divestitures are closed starting in 2023 going into 2024.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. So you were, Mark\u2019s potentially stranded costs, and Jane, you are no stranded cost, the no stranded cost is in the guide medium-term?\nMark Mason: In terms of the\u2026\nJane Fraser: Yeah.\nMark Mason: \u2026 time to get it out, is that, yeah.\nJane Fraser: Yes. And I think\u2026\nOperator: Thank you.\nJane Fraser: \u2026 that\u2019s why -- as Mark talks about expenses, you have got to look at the various different dynamics that are going on. So, yes, we have got investments into the transformation at the moment. Many of those translate into better efficiency, as well as a safer, stronger firm, the divestitures translate into lower cost, but also we eliminate the stranded costs and we simplify the organization. You have got a number of different factors that we will make completely transparent to you at play in our expense base from a more structural dimension in the quarters ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatt O'Connor: Hi. Can you guys talk about the pace of addressing some of the regulatory issues out there? On the one hand, you got out of the AML consent order earlier this year, which I think was a very big positive. But on the other hand, there was an article last month, suggesting regulators want you to go faster and I think we all know regulators always want things to go faster on these issues, but I did want to ask the question? Thank you.\nJane Fraser: Yeah. We all want things to go faster, both our clients, our shareholders, the management team, regulators, the Board all. So I think we are fully aligned there. Maybe if I take a step back on this one. Transformation is our number one priority. It will be a multiyear journey and prioritizing safety and soundness is a very important global bank is a non-negotiable for all of us. Where are we? I think we were delighted to see the AML consent order get closed with the OCC. We continue to work on the regulatory orders we have. I have to say we have constant and constructive engagement with our regulators that personally, I find them to be very helpful and essential to our success. We have got a lot to get done. As you can see from the hiring numbers, we have been investing heavily in the talent and the resources that we need. As we have also said, this is not only going to benefit our safety and soundness, but also in terms of our client excellence in delivery, and ultimately, for our shareholders as well. I think the foundation that we need for this is largely in place, and so Mark and I, and frankly, the whole management team, we are very focused on continuing to execute on the various plans we submitted and the overall transformation of Citi from a strategic and another dimension. We obviously can\u2019t give more details than that, because this is confidential supervisory information, but I hope that gives you a good feel.\nMatt O'Connor: And I guess when you say the foundation is largely in place, like, what are some of the things that are missing or is it just a matter of, say, executing on\u2026\nJane Fraser: And then\u2026\nMatt O'Connor: \u2026 the divestiture.\nJane Fraser: Yeah. It\u2019s timing. So some of the areas, for example, where we are making technology investments, those ones where we have had fragmented technology platforms, we are migrating them into a single platform or into an industry standard where we have from \u2013 where we have not been on one that we -- that is what we want for the future and the scale and pace for the future. Those things take some time to put in place. But you can see from the investments we have made, both headcount and the shift from consulting to much more of our own people. You will see the technology increase in that shift as well. So some of that is just a natural progression you would expect over time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.\nJim Mitchell: Hey. Good afternoon. Maybe just on deposits and behavior, you guys clearly have a different mix by geography and by business. Deposits ex-currency were up 1%. Your peers were down close to 3%. So is -- how do we think about deposit behavior going forward given your mix of geography and business, is it just the overseas rate hikes have been behind the curve versus the U.S., but we will start to see more deposit outflows over there or do you think your deposits can hold up a little better?\nMark Mason: It\u2019s a great question and so why don\u2019t I take that? So a couple of things and you started to allude to it. The first is that when you think about our business, you have got about between ICG and our PBWM business of 65%, 35% split in terms of the deposits. You also have a U.S. dollar denominated versus non-U.S. dollar denominated split that is pretty meaningful as well. And then to your point, we have got different currencies and different rate hikes by different Central Banks around the world and that then is juxtaposed against different beta behavior from customers and so on the whole -- on the ICG side, we tend to see higher betas, and obviously, with rates increasing at a more rapid pace, we expect those to get closer to our expectations in the near-term. We are starting to see many more hikes around the globe outside of the U.S. and so, again, we expect to see betas, which move at a or operate at a much lower pace level outside of the U.S. but start to tick up. And so, over time, I think, we will see continued tailwinds from an NII as the differences between U.S. and non-U.S. activity play out and so that should play to our -- has played to our benefit, I think, and should continue to play to our benefit. If you think about what I have talked about before in terms of our IRE, our interest rate exposure and the cash flow approach that we are moving towards taking, in some ways, it captures exactly that point. And so this is, if you see 100-basis-point move in the curve cross currencies, we are looking at as much as a $2.2 billion increase. When you look at that increase, it skews more heavily towards the non-U.S. dollar than the U.S. dollar and that is in part because of the different moves in rate curves by currency, as well as the different betas by client type in U.S. versus non-U.S.\nJim Mitchell: Right. Right. Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then maybe just -- a second question just on the impact in the fourth quarter. You have your best closing on three divestitures. How do we think about the P&L and capital impact of that in the fourth quarter?\nMark Mason: I think I talked about the idea of the divestitures contributing close to $3 billion for the full year, $3.1 or so billion in terms of the capital impact for the full year 2022. The combination of Australia and the Philippines gets us to about $ 2.1 billion or so. And so the balance of the divestitures that we have scoped out for the fourth quarter should close that gap. Thailand, Malaysia, Bahrain, the signing of China, et cetera, should close that gap to getting us to that $3.1 billion. With most of that again\u2026\nOperator: Thank you. Our next\u2026\nMark Mason: \u2026 skewing towards the first three, Thailand, Malaysia, Bahrain.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hi, Mark. Hi, Jane.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nJane Fraser: Hello. Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Jane, you talked about your global footprint and the strength that gives you as an organization and so maybe this question is very appropriate for Citigroup, which is the following. You guys have a real good window into the global financial markets and there\u2019s been some disruption out there, we all know about what\u2019s going on in the U.K. Pension Funds. You had the Swiss National Bank come into the New York Fed this week for $6.3 billion of currency swaps. We know there\u2019s a large broker having challenges over there. So can you guys give us a flavor, what are you seeing from a stress standpoint. What are the liquidity metrics that you are watching to see if some other stresses pop up how the global financial markets will handle that?\nJane Fraser: Yeah. It\u2019s a very good question. It\u2019s one we spend a lot of time on and I think, as Mark alluded, we are constantly doing different stress tests on the market, on clients, on different areas. And as I said at the -- just in the opening remarks, we are more focused on the liquidity in the market at the moment and the impact on some counter parties much more than we are on our credit, which \u2013 our credit risk and that could change over time, depending particularly what happens from a tail risk on the geopolitics here. What are we seeing going on? I think a lot of the focus is in Europe. Right now which is sort of at the center of the storm and we are seeing some areas where there could be energy supply constraints are impacting some clients. So we are watching industrial production moved to the U.S., for example, which are the places where the cost of production is lower, a potential buffer for the slow -- some of the slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and the like because the demand for goods softened, for example. We are seeing areas where clients on the collateral front where there\u2019s a situation of intense volatility that hits a surprise drop as we saw in gilt is having an impact on liquidity, and therefore, margining, which is what happens and has been happening with the U.K. Pension Funds with the derivatives. So a lot of the areas we look at is, what\u2019s the collateral behind different institutions as we have done with the commodity players earlier on in the year, we have been looking at some of the LDIs at the moment and as we see different stresses, we are jumping on it. I think the Central Banks are also ready to jump in as needed and certainly attuned to the importance of agility in these situations as well. As our large global institutions like ourselves as to how do we help support the market the benefit for our Bank is because we are in a strong position on all of our capital, on liquidity, on balance sheet and the credit portfolio, as you can see, is extraordinary at the moment, zero losses in ICG this quarter. Again, we are in a position to be able to jump in and play an important role, but it\u2019s a bit of whack-a-mole, I would say.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then, Mark, just as a follow-up. You touched on your Investment Banking numbers and your markets numbers, and yes, Investment Banking for everybody has been a struggle, obviously, this year. Your advisory numbers actually were better than your peers on a year-over-year basis in terms of growth, but DCM was quite a bit weaker. Can you kind of give us a little more color there and also how do the pipelines look going into the fourth quarter?\nMark Mason: Yeah. Sure. So, look, as we have all seen, the wallets have been under meaningful pressure year-over-year down more than 50%. We did show some strong performance in parts of the business. We have been hiring, frankly, as Jane has mentioned before and filling in gaps that we have across the portfolio in healthcare, tech, energy, et cetera, and feel good about that and are seeing benefits from having made those hires. DCM is really more of a function of low deal volume pretty much across the Board and there really isn\u2019t a whole lot more to it than that. But as you know, Investment Banking is part of the strategy that we discussed at Investor Day and a key part of that and we will continue to invest in it and ensure we are getting the productivity out of it that the investment warrants, but really not a whole lot more in DCM beyond the low deal volume across the Board.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nVivek Juneja: Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Couple of questions for you. Firstly, Mark, I just want to clarify, you said, NII ex markets to be up $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion year-on-year in the fourth quarter. You were up $1.9 billion year-on-year in the third quarter. Given that there have been more rate hikes during the quarter and even later in the quarter, any color on what\u2019s driving that slightly lower NII accretion rather than actually being up at a faster pace?\nMark Mason: Yeah. Again, the important factors here include volume, what we see in both the loan volume, the deposit volume, and obviously, betas and how betas play out and we talked about the idea that with the higher frequency and level of rate increases, that\u2019s going to put pressure on the beta in terms of seeing it increase across the Board. And then the third factor is rates and what happens with the rates and the timing for which that happens, right? When that happens matters in the quarter in terms of whether you see that benefit in it or in subsequent quarters. And so those are the factors that drive that range that I have given you and it\u2019s across both the PBWM portfolio, as well as how it plays out in TTS and given the world we are managing through quantitative tightening and the like. And I think the other factor is obviously FX and how that plays out. So those are the main drivers, Vivek, and the range reflects any variety of ways that they could play out in the quarter.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. Completely different question for both of you. Security Services, you talked about $1 trillion in new business wins seems to be doing really well. Any color if you can remind us on what client segments you are seeing this in and I remember you are saying on the call that it\u2019s domestic also, but any granular \u2013 any more color into where you are growing and where you are seeing all this at least?\nJane Fraser: We are seeing this in a number of different areas that the one that is most material was the win we had with BlackRock in a particularly sizable percentage of business there here in the states and in particularly important and accurate and attractive part of the security services business as well. But we have been winning some sizable business across the Board. And part of -- a part of this, I think, comes from the fact that we are able to link the pre and post trade together to drive a lot of efficiencies for our clients and bring some insights that some of the other players are not able to do in helping them manage and get competitive advantage in their businesses. So we are an attractive one from that. Mark, anything else to add?\nMark Mason: Yeah. The one thing I will add. I mean we are very pleased with the growth here and the win mandates that we have been seeing across the Board, but particularly in the U.S., as Jane highlights. And some of it is a rate benefit, but a good portion of it is, again, those new mandates, those new additional assets that we are bringing in. The final point that I\u2019d make on it is that and I\u2019d reiterate it, I guess, is that this is not only one of our businesses that\u2019s growing quite rapidly, but it\u2019s also a high returning business for us as well. And so consistent with the strategy that we talked about at Investor Day and one that reflects linkages across the franchise and so we feel very good about that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two quick ones. Mark, you talked about the capital impact of the legacy exits, is there a way you can dimension how much in the fourth quarter from revenues and NII perspective comes out from the legacy?\nMark Mason: I do not have that in front of me, Ken. I can -- I guess if we -- I have got a page in here that reflects, the page 22 reflects some of the size of the exit markets, but I do not have that in front of me. I\u2019d have to circle back with you can.\nKen Usdin: Okay. I would assume that\u2019s been a part of the prior question about NII trajectory, right? There\u2019s a negative impact embedded in that in the fourth quarter as well, right, that\u2019s just part of the moving forward?\nMark Mason: Yeah. That is reflected in the NII guidance, but the major drivers are largely what I referenced. But, yes, it would be reflected in.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: Hi. As a follow-up, why is Citi still banking in Russia when only every other major American company or most of them are out of Russia.\nJane Fraser: Hey. And Mike, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we are now informing our multinational clients who are operating in Russia. So these are the U.S., European and Asian core multinationals or the franchise that we are ending nearly all of the institutional banking services. We offer them by the end of the first quarter of 2023. The cost of which I would add is not material. And so at that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory operations there. It\u2019s been very important for those multinationals that we helped support them as they look at exiting the country and their payroll and other elements as they do so. So they have been able to wind down or exit and a few of those who have remained, but we will be, as I said at the very beginning, our intention here is to wind down our operation in the country.\nMike Mayo: And then just if you could remind us, you mentioned more dispositions in the fourth quarter. So after 2022, what\u2019s left as far as the dispositions that you had mentioned and how are you tracking with your plan?\nMark Mason: Yeah. We are -- I mean, we are -- we feel very good about how we track with the plan. Obviously, Mexico is left. We have got Vietnam, India, Taiwan, and there\u2019s one I miss Indonesia, I think is\u2026\nJane Fraser: Yeah.\nMark Mason: \u2026 what I am missing. So those are the ones that are left and then China, right? So those are the ones that are left in the balance of 20 or beyond 2022.\nJane Fraser: And I think those ones, again, a couple of them have been rather than ones that use and you have a legal day one, legal day two on. It\u2019s all close in one go on both, which is why a couple of them are later than we had originally thought. But they are going well and the work around them and around the stranded costs that relate to them, as we talked earlier, is also going nicely. So we are pleased with the pace and we are acting on these with urgency, Mike, as you would expect.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\nJen Landis: Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to the IR team. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Citi\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we are certainly still living through interesting times, and overall, I am pleased with how our Bank is navigating through them. As you will hear from me shortly, we continue to focus intensely on executing our strategy and our transformation as we outlined at Investor Day, whilst supporting our clients in this complex environment. So before I get into the quarter, let me highlight some observations about what we see going on around the world, given our unique vantage point. The global macro outlook that we shared with you over the last couple of quarters has been borne out. There is accumulating evidence of slowing global growth and we now expect to experience rolling country level recessions starting this quarter. The severity and timing of these recessions depend, where in the world you are, although, persistently high inflation is driving a global softening of consumer demand for goods. In the Eurozone and the U.K., the supply shocks are most severe. Growth prospects have deteriorated sharply and headline inflation is running at nearly 10%. All eyes are on this winter's weather forecast and the energy supply. The U.S. economy, however, remains relatively resilient. So while we are seeing signs of economic slowing consumers and corporates remain healthy, as our very low net credit losses demonstrate. Supply chain constraints are easing, the labor market remains strong, so it is all a question of what it takes to truly tame persistently high core inflation. Now, history would suggest that that will be quite a lot and for some time. Therefore, we could well see a mild recession in the second half of 2023. We believe the U.S. economy is well positioned to withstand it, all else being equal in the geopolitical arena that is. Finally, in Asia, we continue to be concerned with China's COVID lockdowns, which took a bigger bite out of economic activity than anticipated, exacerbated by a lack of intensified macro stimulus. It is geopolitical risks and rates that dominate discussions with our corporate clients worldwide, and I'd say, we are more focused on market liquidity generally, and counterparty risk than our credit risk in the near-term. Nonetheless, we are planning conservatively and we are prepared for all environments. Against this backdrop, today, we reported net income of $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63 and an RoTCE of 8.2%. We grew revenues by 6%, including a gain on sale of our consumer business in the Philippines. While we had excellent performance in some areas, our results could have been better in a few others. Services delivered another very strong quarter. TTS saw revenues up 40% year-over-year, with growth in each business and in fees. Key drivers of our strategy such as wallet share, trade loan originations and cross border transactions are all trending strongly in the right direction and are ahead of our plan. Securities Services was up 15%, despite asset under custody being impacted by the declines in equity markets. We have onboarded over a $1 trillion in AUC and AUA since the beginning of the year and we are seeing good momentum in issuer services in particular. Market on the other hand came in lower, with revenues down 7%. In Fixed Income, we matched last year's particularly good showing through our longstanding strength in FX, offsetting a weaker quarter in spread products. In Equities, reduced activity in derivatives, which is a core part of our platform led to lower revenues, compared to last year's exceptional performance and we continued to optimize RWA end markets consistent with our strategy. Banking was the business most adversely impacted by the macro environment across the industry, with geopolitics and fears of recession significantly reducing deal flows and the appetite for M&A. We continue to invest in building out our teams for long-term growth opportunities including healthcare, technology and energy, and I am really pleased with the high-caliber bankers who are attracted to both our platform and our culture. The environment to Wealth Management continued to be less than ideal. Our revenues were down only slightly and meaningfully up outside of Asia. Our strategy to capture the synergies of our businesses such as the Wealth referral initiatives between Commercial Banking, Retail Banking and Investment Banking is progressing well. We also continued to steadily attract new clients and increase the ranks of our client advisers as you will see in our KPIs. Nonetheless, we are slowing the pace of some of the investments in this business, given the environment. U.S. Personal Banking further solidified its growth trajectory. Card sales, A&R, interest-earning balances and customer acquisition all saw a good growth and we continued to increase digital uptake. Retail Services joined Branded Cards in having double-digit revenue growth this quarter. Retail Banking also grew contributing to a 10% overall revenue increase to the business. As you can see in the presentation, our cost of credit reflects the quality of our loan portfolio in both ICG and PBWM. There were effectively no credit losses in ICG and U.S. Consumer NCLs remain well below the pre-COVID levels. Consumer loan growth, together with the worsening of our macroeconomic assumptions drove a modest ACL build this quarter. While, our expenses are elevated as we continue to invest in our businesses and in our transformation, we are managing them closely and we remain on track to meet the full year guidance. As you know, the transformation is a multiyear effort and we are committed to meeting the expectations of our regulators, given the paramount importance of safety and soundness. We continue to be in constructive dialogs with them and are updating our execution plans as appropriate. Stepping back, I am generally pleased with the advances we are making and the key drivers of the strategy we laid out for you in March and these are laid out on page three. We are seeing good momentum in realizing client synergies and in attracting talent to grow the franchise. In terms of simplification, we continue to make progress on the divestitures of our international consumer businesses and the elimination of their associated stranded costs. We closed the sale of the Philippines during the third quarter and are on track to close Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand during the fourth quarter. We also announced the wind down of our consumer franchise in the U.K. to focus fully on the Wealth franchise there. I would also note we are ahead of our plan in our Korean consumer wind down. We continue to shrink our operations in and exposure to Russia. To be clear, our intention is to wind down our presence in that country. In August, we announced the wind down of our consumer and local Commercial Banking businesses. While we have been supporting our multinational clients in Russia, we are now informing them that we will be ending nearly all of the institutional banking services we offer by the end of the first quarter of next year. At that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations. Turning to Capital, we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through common dividends during the quarter, while buybacks continue to be on hold. We will keep evaluating that decision on a quarterly basis, as due to increasing regulatory requirements we build our CET1 ratio to 13% or so by mid next year and that includes a management buffer of 100 basis points. We ended the quarter at a CET1 ratio of 12.2%, as we actively managed our RWA usage throughout our lines of business. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $80.34. So, the bottomline is that while the environment is a challenging one and we expect it will remain so, we continue to focus relentlessly on executing the strategy we presented to you at our Investor Day and on making steady progress. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted as always to take your questions. And I'd just jump in and say, I think, there's a bit of a miss at the moment that the global environment is detrimental to activity. We see quite the opposite. Volatility is something in which we are very active in helping our multinational clients around the world manage, the local footprint we have and the global network we have is a tremendous asset right now. So we are seeing a lot of positive momentum, which may not always be intuitive to everyone, but I think it's what makes the network, the crown jewel of Citi. Yes. We can, Mike. Good morning. Hey, Mike. It's Jane. I am jumping in, because I do want to talk a bit about your point on the global network here. I have to tell you, I am hard pressed to find a negative to the global network. We start off with the vision for the Bank that we laid out in March. It is to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross-border needs. Who are those clients? It is 5,000 multinationals on their subsidiaries, it's institutional investors and the ultra high net worth clients with a heavy tilt to family offices. And we serve them on FX, on liquidity management, on their payroll, on their supply chain, as well as strategic advice financing, et cetera. That's $4 trillion in daily volume, 80% of that credit portfolio is investment grade. So when we are looking at it, it's the multinational to take a higher risk country, it's the client base we are serving there of the global multinationals much more than the local players. And so this is not a -- this is a relatively simple high returning, very well growing as we are seeing at the moment capability that is exceedingly hard to replicate. So let me pass over to Mark in terms of what are some of the examples of different areas of the drivers of growth? This is -- as I said at the beginning, this is a crown jewel. It's not a source of complexity for the Bank. Hey, Betsy. And as this got, I just can't help myself but jump in here. I think as Mark \u2013 so I am spotting at Mark here. Mark and I are both pretty maniacally focused around this. But I'd say, at the moment, we have had a couple of the divestitures closed, we have another three next quarter and this continues on. We already started on Australia and the Philippines, and getting those expenses down, as Mark said. There is going to be and we will not be shy in capturing as an opportunity to simplify our organization further next year when we have more of the divestitures closed and streamlining more of our regional management structures, more of the expenses at the global level. So there is more to come on that and we will be looking to do that. As I indicated at Investor Day that will be an important part once more of the divestitures are closed starting in 2023 going into 2024. Yeah. Yes. And I think... ... that's why -- as Mark talks about expenses, you have got to look at the various different dynamics that are going on. So, yes, we have got investments into the transformation at the moment. Many of those translate into better efficiency, as well as a safer, stronger firm, the divestitures translate into lower cost, but also we eliminate the stranded costs and we simplify the organization. You have got a number of different factors that we will make completely transparent to you at play in our expense base from a more structural dimension in the quarters ahead. Yeah. We all want things to go faster, both our clients, our shareholders, the management team, regulators, the Board all. So I think we are fully aligned there. Maybe if I take a step back on this one. Transformation is our number one priority. It will be a multiyear journey and prioritizing safety and soundness is a very important global bank is a non-negotiable for all of us. Where are we? I think we were delighted to see the AML consent order get closed with the OCC. We continue to work on the regulatory orders we have. I have to say we have constant and constructive engagement with our regulators that personally, I find them to be very helpful and essential to our success. We have got a lot to get done. As you can see from the hiring numbers, we have been investing heavily in the talent and the resources that we need. As we have also said, this is not only going to benefit our safety and soundness, but also in terms of our client excellence in delivery, and ultimately, for our shareholders as well. I think the foundation that we need for this is largely in place, and so Mark and I, and frankly, the whole management team, we are very focused on continuing to execute on the various plans we submitted and the overall transformation of Citi from a strategic and another dimension. We obviously can't give more details than that, because this is confidential supervisory information, but I hope that gives you a good feel. And then... Yeah. It's timing. So some of the areas, for example, where we are making technology investments, those ones where we have had fragmented technology platforms, we are migrating them into a single platform or into an industry standard where we have from \u2013 where we have not been on one that we -- that is what we want for the future and the scale and pace for the future. Those things take some time to put in place. But you can see from the investments we have made, both headcount and the shift from consulting to much more of our own people. You will see the technology increase in that shift as well. So some of that is just a natural progression you would expect over time. Hello. Hi, Gerard. Yeah. It's a very good question. It's one we spend a lot of time on and I think, as Mark alluded, we are constantly doing different stress tests on the market, on clients, on different areas. And as I said at the -- just in the opening remarks, we are more focused on the liquidity in the market at the moment and the impact on some counter parties much more than we are on our credit, which \u2013 our credit risk and that could change over time, depending particularly what happens from a tail risk on the geopolitics here. What are we seeing going on? I think a lot of the focus is in Europe. Right now which is sort of at the center of the storm and we are seeing some areas where there could be energy supply constraints are impacting some clients. So we are watching industrial production moved to the U.S., for example, which are the places where the cost of production is lower, a potential buffer for the slow -- some of the slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and the like because the demand for goods softened, for example. We are seeing areas where clients on the collateral front where there's a situation of intense volatility that hits a surprise drop as we saw in gilt is having an impact on liquidity, and therefore, margining, which is what happens and has been happening with the U.K. Pension Funds with the derivatives. So a lot of the areas we look at is, what's the collateral behind different institutions as we have done with the commodity players earlier on in the year, we have been looking at some of the LDIs at the moment and as we see different stresses, we are jumping on it. I think the Central Banks are also ready to jump in as needed and certainly attuned to the importance of agility in these situations as well. As our large global institutions like ourselves as to how do we help support the market the benefit for our Bank is because we are in a strong position on all of our capital, on liquidity, on balance sheet and the credit portfolio, as you can see, is extraordinary at the moment, zero losses in ICG this quarter. Again, we are in a position to be able to jump in and play an important role, but it's a bit of whack-a-mole, I would say. We are seeing this in a number of different areas that the one that is most material was the win we had with BlackRock in a particularly sizable percentage of business there here in the states and in particularly important and accurate and attractive part of the security services business as well. But we have been winning some sizable business across the Board. And part of -- a part of this, I think, comes from the fact that we are able to link the pre and post trade together to drive a lot of efficiencies for our clients and bring some insights that some of the other players are not able to do in helping them manage and get competitive advantage in their businesses. So we are an attractive one from that. Mark, anything else to add? Hey. And Mike, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we are now informing our multinational clients who are operating in Russia. So these are the U.S., European and Asian core multinationals or the franchise that we are ending nearly all of the institutional banking services. We offer them by the end of the first quarter of 2023. The cost of which I would add is not material. And so at that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory operations there. It's been very important for those multinationals that we helped support them as they look at exiting the country and their payroll and other elements as they do so. So they have been able to wind down or exit and a few of those who have remained, but we will be, as I said at the very beginning, our intention here is to wind down our operation in the country. Yeah. And I think those ones, again, a couple of them have been rather than ones that use and you have a legal day one, legal day two on. It's all close in one go on both, which is why a couple of them are later than we had originally thought. But they are going well and the work around them and around the stranded costs that relate to them, as we talked earlier, is also going nicely. So we are pleased with the pace and we are acting on these with urgency, Mike, as you would expect."

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise and spend a little more time on expenses, credit and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment and end with full year 2022 guidance. On slide four, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of $3.5 billion and EPS of $1.63, with an RoTCE of 8.2% on $18.5 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $520 million, largely driven by a gain on the sale of the Philippines consumer business. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, EPS and RoTCE would have been $1.50 and 7.5%, respectively. In the quarter, total revenues increased 6% on a reported basis excluding divestiture-related impacts revenues were down 1% as growth in net interest income was more than offset by lower non-interest revenues. Net interest income grew 18% driven by the impact of higher interest rates across the firm and strong loan growth in PBWM. Non-interest revenues were down 12% on a reported basis and 28% excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely reflecting declines in Investment Banking, Markets and Investment Revenues in Wealth. Total expenses of $12.7 billion increased 8% and 7% excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely driven by transformation, inflation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.4 billion, driven by net credit losses of approximately $900 million and an ACL build of approximately $500 million, primarily driven by loan growth in PBWM. At the end of the quarter, we had $18.7 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.5%. On slide five, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the third quarter, total net interest income increased by approximately $600 million on a sequential basis and approximately $1.9 billion on a year-over-year basis across the firm, driven by higher interest rates, management of deposit re-pricing and loan growth in PBWM. Average loans were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower balances in Legacy Franchises. Excluding FX, loans were largely flat and average deposits were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by declines in Legacy Franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by the issuance of institutional CDs as we continue to diversify the funding profile of the Bank. Excluding FX deposits were up roughly 1%, and sequentially, our net interest margin increased by 7 basis points. On slide six, we show an expense walk for the third quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8% and 7% excluding the impact of divestitures, 2% of the increase was driven by transformation investments, with about two-thirds related to the risk, controls, data and finance programs, and approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. As of today, we have over 10,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments, as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers, as well as client advisers in Wealth and we continue to invest in the client experience, as well as front-office onboarding and platforms. 1% was due to higher volume-related expenses across both PBWM and ICG. And approximately 3% was driven by other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, including systems and hiring people, resulting in our technology related spend up approximately 16% for the quarter. On slide seven, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Over the last several years, we have been disciplined with our loan growth and consistent with our risk appetite framework. This framework includes credit risk limits that consider concentrations including country, industry, credit rating, and in the case of consumer, FICO scores, and importantly, these limits apply across the firm in aggregate and we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentrations under a range of stress scenarios. As a result, we feel very good about our asset quality and reserve levels. As I mentioned earlier, our reserve-to-funded loan ratio is approximately 2.5%, and within that PBWM and U.S. Cards is 3.7% and 7.5%, respectively, both right around day one CECL levels. In PBWM, the majority of our card portfolios skew towards higher FICO customers and while we have started to see signs of normalization in both portfolios, NCL rates continue to be less than half of pre-COVID levels. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% as investment grade and non-accrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 40 basis points of total loans. So, we are well reserved for a variety of scenarios and we continuously evaluate our scenarios to reflect the evolving macro environment. On slide eight, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet, of our $2.4 trillion of assets, about 23% or $557 billion are high quality liquid assets or HQLA and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $967 billion. The combination of earnings generation, capital from exits and RWA optimization drove our CET1 ratio up by about 25 basis points to approximately 12.2% on a standardized basis, which remains our binding constraint and our tangible book value per share was $80.34, up 2% from a year ago. On slide nine, we show a sequential $0.2 billion [ph] of net income to common, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 8 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 5-basis-point reduction. Fourth, changes in the DTA drove a 3-basis-point reduction. And finally, the remaining 14-basis-point increase was largely driven by net RWA optimization. In light of our increasing regulatory capital requirement, we ended the quarter with a 12.2% CET1 ratio, 25 basis points higher than last quarter. Importantly 12.2% is above our current regulatory requirement of 11.5% as of October 1st and above 12%, which will be our regulatory requirement as of January 1st of next year. As we said last quarter, we continue to gradually build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which includes the current 4% SCB and 100-basis-point management buffer. On slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues were down 5%, as strong growth in services was more than offset by lower revenues across markets and banking. Expenses increased 10%, driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity and foreign exchange translation. Foster credit was driven by a reserve build of $86 million. While deterioration in certain macro variables did lead to a build, it was mostly offset by the release of a COVID-19 related uncertainty reserve and a release related to direct exposures in Russia. This resulted in a net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 30%. Average loans were up 1% driven by 9% growth in TTS loans, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Average deposits were down 2%, also largely driven by foreign exchange translation. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 9%. On slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out in Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 40%, driven by 61% growth in net interest income, as well as 8% growth in NIR across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 10%, commercial card volumes up roughly 50% and average loans up 19%. So while the rate environment drove about 40% of the growth this quarter business actions, drove the remaining 60%. This includes continuing to manage deposit re-pricing and deepening with existing clients and significant new client wins across all client segments. Through the first half of the year, based on the industry data that we see, we estimate that we gained over 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients and client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments, including wins with financial institutions, which are up almost 50%. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating Bank. In addition, weak products in the U.S. and Asia, which allows clients to connect their liquidity and funding to their operating flows seven days a week. In Securities Services, revenues grew 15%, as net interest income grew 73%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, partly offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. We continue to be pleased with the execution in Security Services as we onboarded approximately $1 trillion of assets under custody and administration so far this year from significant client wins and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. And we estimate that we have gained about 60 basis points of share in Security Services through the first half of this year, including in our home market. As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy and our two of our higher returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. Markets revenues were down 7%, largely driven by spread products, equities and RWA actions as we continue to focus on returns. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 1% as strength in rates and FX was largely offset by continued headwinds in spread products and through the first half of the year, we gained approximately 40 basis points of share. Equity Markets revenues were down 25%, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives relative to a very strong quarter last year. The actions we took to optimize RWA in markets are in line with the strategy we discussed at Investor Day and we are making solid progress on our revenue to RWA targets so far this year. And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down 49%, driven by Investment Banking, as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continue to impact client activity. Also embedded in the results is an impact of approximately $110 million related to marks on loan commitments and losses on loan sales. So, overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress we are making as we continue to deepen existing client relationships, as well as acquire new clients. Now turning to slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income grow was partially offset by a decline in non-interest revenue, driven by lower investment fee revenue in Wealth and higher partner payments in Retail Services. Expenses were up 13%, driven by transformation, other risk and control initiatives business led investments and volume driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $1.1 billion, which included a reserve build primarily driven by card volume growth. NCLs were 13% higher year-over-year from near historically low levels, reflecting normalization particularly in Retail Services. Overall, we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. Average loans grew 5%, driven by strong growth across branded cards, Retail Services and Retail Banking. Average deposits grew 1%, driven by growth across Retail and Wealth, partially offset by foreign exchange translation, and PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 9.7%. On slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product, as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 10%, driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 10%, card spend volumes up 14% and average loans up 12%. Retail Services revenues were up 12%, also driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher partner payments. So despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we have been making contributed to growth in interest earning balances of 9% in branded cards and 7% in Retail Services, and we expect to continue to grow these balances in the fourth quarter. Retail Banking revenues were up 2%, primarily driven by interest rates and deposit growth. Wealth revenues were down 2%, as investment fee headwinds and particularly in Asia more than offset net interest income growth. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. Client advisers were up 5% and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our Wealth business, with new clients in ultra-high net worth and wealth work of 7% and 27%, respectively, for the quarter. And we are also leveraging our Retail network, which has driven almost 50,000 Wealth referrals so far this year. While the environment continues to remain challenging, we are seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy. On slide 14, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues increased 66%, primarily driven by the Philippines gain on sale in the quarter and the absence of the Australia loss on sale in the prior year period. Excluding these items, revenues were down about 12%, largely due to the loss of revenues from the Australia and Philippines closing, as well as the impact of the Korea wind down. Expenses increased 6%, driven by divestiture impacts in Asia and Mexico. Loans and deposits decreased as a result of the reclassification of signed exits to other assets and other liabilities, the closing of the Philippine sale and the impact of the Korea wind down. On slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, partially offset by the mark-to-market on certain derivative transactions and expenses were down. On slide 16, I will briefly touch on our full year 2022 outlook. With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range, excluding divestiture related impacts. And within that, we continue to see a shift with higher net interest income offset by lower non-interest revenue. So, for the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income excluding markets to be up in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion year-over-year. Clearly, where we land within that range will be a function of a number of factors, including rates, loans and deposit volumes, deposit betas and currency impacts. Regarding full year expenses, we continue to expect expenses to grow by 7% to 8%, excluding divestiture related impacts. In terms of cost of credit, it will be a function of the evolution of the macro environment, normalization that we continue to expect in the cards businesses and loan growth. And keep in mind that loan growth tends to be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third given typical holiday spending. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few key points. We continue to execute on the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. We are seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses. And as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we are confident we can achieve our medium-term targets in a variety of scenarios. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Sure. Good morning, Glenn. Why don't I take that and kind of take it in two pieces, the two pieces that you laid out. So, as you know, Glenn, when we think about our business just in aggregate, there's obviously a split between the Institutional and the Consumer side. Our TTS business, which is on the Institutional side and these corporate clients, they tend to have higher betas in general than, obviously, the Retail Banking side. What we have seen is that the betas have been increasing. They are still running lower than what we had expected, but again, they have been increasing. And with continued expected rate increases, I would expect that those betas will continue to rise in the coming quarters. We have been actively managing beta -- deposit pricing and re-pricing with our clients on an ongoing basis. You know that this is more than just a deposit taking business. This is a business where we are looking to manage the operating accounts of our clients and bring the breadth of what we offer in our franchise to them. And so those -- that's the type of conversation we have been having with them and we will continue to do that with an eye towards growing the volume of deposits with both the existing, as well as with new clients. And so we, again, expect to see betas to rise \u2013 betas rise, but also expect to see continued contribution to the NII. The other aspect of your question is what else has been driving the activity? I mentioned a couple of those things, so it's not just deepening with existing clients, but it's also onboarding new clients. We have seen cross-border transaction value up about 10%. The commercial card spend is up meaningfully, trade originations are up 27% and so a lot of active engagement with our clients. We have been winning new mandates. We have seen an uptick in client wins up about 20% and we have been gaining share across those client segments. And so, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of example -- of examples of where the benefits or momentum is coming from on the NIR side. The NIR growth of 8% is driven really by the cards, the payments and receivables, as well as trade. Sure. So, Glenn, you will remember at Investor Day, we talked not only about RWA optimization broadly, but specifically as it relates to markets. And we talked about the idea of increasing our revenue to RWA ratio for markets to about 5.5% over the course of that Investor Day period. So we have been actively working across the markets business, in equities, in fixed income and spread products, and looking for opportunities where there are low returning uses of RWA to either increase the returns on that or to actually kind of exit it. And that includes a host of different structures. It includes working with clients to post additional collateral in some instances and other types of structures like that, that improved the RWA, including hedging, and like I said, posting collateral and taking a look at margin that we have and ensuring that we are, in fact, getting the most for that use of RWA. Yeah. So, again, the guidance on full year expenses hasn't changed. It's the 7% to 8% ex-fee impact of divestitures that would imply a bit of an uptick there. It is on the heels of the continued investments that we are making and that's flowing through, as well as how we -- how revenues kind of play out and the associated compensation activity that goes along with that. So, nothing extraordinary and consistent with the guidance given. John, I'd say, as you know, right, we will give guidance for 2023 next quarter. But I think if you think back to the Investor Day and you think about some of the things that we just commented on with regard to our Services business, we would expect to see continued tailwinds as it relates to net interest income. We would expect to get to the heart of your question that we will continue to invest in the franchise that in the transformation, excuse me, that would obviously peak and then we would start to see the benefits start to play out from that in that medium-term period. And so, yes, you can probably expect some type of a tick up, but I will give you more details on that when we talk about the 2023 outlook in the next quarter. Good morning. So thank you for the question. Look, I think, there are a couple of things to kind of think back on that still hold true, which is the strategy that we have built, I think, is a resilient strategy and it really spoke to topline momentum that we expected, not just through rate increases, but also through share gains and also through the business led investments that we -- that we are making and better leveraging the synergies and linkages across the franchise. All of those things still hold true to the topline. You are right, the fed funds assumption has changed. Back in March, I think, we all were looking at a fed funds rate at the end of the year that was closer to 1.5% or so, and so now here we are with the hikes that we have seen and looking at something certainly north of 4%, 4.5%. And so that's changed meaningfully, but there are a number of other drivers that contribute to achieving that return, including, it's the medium term, so call it, three years to five years, I think, is how we characterized it and starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation investments that we are making. To your point on capital, we are building to the 13%. Remember, that is a byproduct of a 4% SCB for this particular CCAR cycle and the strategy that we described includes a mix in our shift of revenues and earnings over time, a mix towards more stable PPNR and more fee revenues that will contribute to, I think, a balance sheet and a mix that is certain -- that generates fewer losses -- stress losses than our balance sheet might today. So the contribution of those things, we think will drive that return target that we have set and we still remain confident about that. Now, with that said, there are unknowns that are out there. I just spoke to many of the nobles and so what happens with further capital requirements and the current regulatory regime and what like \u2013 and what have you, it's hard to predict, but we will manage to that as we learn and know more about it. Okay. Thank you, Erika. There's a lot bit unpack if I forget anything just please remind me. But it started at the beginning, which is, I know where we trade in terms of book value and I'd love to be in a position where we were buying back given that valuation. With that said, we are going to take it quarter-by-quarter, as I think you have heard us say and evaluate what buyback decisions and capital actions make the most sense in light of the environment that we are managing through. We are clearly managing through an uncertain environment. We do -- as I just said and as you kind of mentioned as well, we do see our business mix shifting over time on the heels of our strategy. I do think that over time, that will contribute, as I said, to the capital requirements that we have, but that's over the medium-term. And we do still see a fair amount of volatility in the stress capital buffer. And part of the reason that we have the management buffer is to deal not only with that uncertainty in the SCB, but also in interest rates and we are seeing volatility in both frankly. And so we will continue to evaluate the management buffer as well to see what makes sense as we move towards that medium-term. In terms of the Mexico transaction, you are right in terms of we have mentioned before the CTA component to that. That is a timing difference. We have factored that in to the path to our 13% by middle of next year and factor that into achieving the longer term targets that we set for ourselves. Yeah. Yeah. So, Mike, I'd say a couple of things. One, what I said was that, we continue to gain share, and I referenced specifically about 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients and we obviously or not obviously, we are also winning mandates and gaining share with other client segments as well, you know that the Commercial Banking client segment is one that we are focused on given the strength of our platform and its applicability to those sized clients as well. I mentioned that our wins are up and specifically, they are up 20%, the mandates that we are winning across all client segments and that specifically with FIs, they are up almost 50%. So hopefully, that gives you some sense of where the revenue growth is coming from. The takeaway there is it's both existing, as well as new clients as we kind of continue to build out the platform and build out our capabilities to reach them. So the second part of your question was around expenses and expenses growing and when will we have topline growth that exceeds the expense growth. And I'd remind you that, the work we are doing on the transformation, as well as the business led investments are multiyear almost by definition and important in order to derive savings in our structural cost base over time. And at Investor Day, I think I pointed to, by the time we got to that medium-term period, we would see our operating efficiency go down to less than 60%. I think we have been very deliberate about trying to give you guidance and update you on guidance for the full year, and along the way and we will be consistent in that discipline and I can certainly give you more color on 2023, as I mentioned earlier to John, the next -- in the next quarter. A wallet, 60 basis points, not 50 basis points, 60 basis points. So market share with them. It is ex-markets. I don't \u2013 I -- very intentionally don't forecast markets NII in a rising rate environment. You would normally see the markets NII come down. It tends to be liability sensitive. But we tend to focus on, as you probably heard me say a number of times, total revenues for this business. And I guess what I'd highlight is that in periods of uncertainty and lots of market volatility, our businesses tend to perform well and so we will see how the fourth quarter plays out. There's obviously some seasonality to it that has taken place historically and so we have to kind of factor all those things in, but we will have to see how it further evolves. Good morning. Yeah. That's not fair. But I appreciate the answer clarity. So I bucket into three buckets. So one is, when we do these transactions, both Jane and I have deep experience in this. We tend to see about half of the costs go away to the buyer. So when we do the transaction, when we do the sale. As you pointed out, about 25% is often in place as part of a transition service agreement and so there's revenues that we get paid to offset that expense until things have totally transitioned and then that goes away. And then the third bucket is what I call potentially stranded cost and what Jane calls not stranded call, right? And that is, I say, potentially, because their regional expenses that get allocated to countries, for example, they are global expenses that get allocated to the region and to the countries, for example, and what we have to do. And what we are doing is we are attacking what would otherwise be stranded cost and we are attacking that by telling each of the functions in the business and here's your portion of that 25% and come back and tell me how you are going to rethink your org structure, simplify your processes in order to drive that cost out of the company, right? And so that's what we have been doing, remember the expense base here is probably $7 billion. So you can break down kind of the population that we are talking about. We have already stood up a team work with each of the businesses and each of the functions around getting in front of that cost so that we can drive that down over the near-term period of time. In terms of the... ... time to get it out, is that, yeah. It's a great question and so why don't I take that? So a couple of things and you started to allude to it. The first is that when you think about our business, you have got about between ICG and our PBWM business of 65%, 35% split in terms of the deposits. You also have a U.S. dollar denominated versus non-U.S. dollar denominated split that is pretty meaningful as well. And then to your point, we have got different currencies and different rate hikes by different Central Banks around the world and that then is juxtaposed against different beta behavior from customers and so on the whole -- on the ICG side, we tend to see higher betas, and obviously, with rates increasing at a more rapid pace, we expect those to get closer to our expectations in the near-term. We are starting to see many more hikes around the globe outside of the U.S. and so, again, we expect to see betas, which move at a or operate at a much lower pace level outside of the U.S. but start to tick up. And so, over time, I think, we will see continued tailwinds from an NII as the differences between U.S. and non-U.S. activity play out and so that should play to our -- has played to our benefit, I think, and should continue to play to our benefit. If you think about what I have talked about before in terms of our IRE, our interest rate exposure and the cash flow approach that we are moving towards taking, in some ways, it captures exactly that point. And so this is, if you see 100-basis-point move in the curve cross currencies, we are looking at as much as a $2.2 billion increase. When you look at that increase, it skews more heavily towards the non-U.S. dollar than the U.S. dollar and that is in part because of the different moves in rate curves by currency, as well as the different betas by client type in U.S. versus non-U.S. I think I talked about the idea of the divestitures contributing close to $3 billion for the full year, $3.1 or so billion in terms of the capital impact for the full year 2022. The combination of Australia and the Philippines gets us to about $ 2.1 billion or so. And so the balance of the divestitures that we have scoped out for the fourth quarter should close that gap. Thailand, Malaysia, Bahrain, the signing of China, et cetera, should close that gap to getting us to that $3.1 billion. With most of that again... ... skewing towards the first three, Thailand, Malaysia, Bahrain. Good morning. Yeah. Sure. So, look, as we have all seen, the wallets have been under meaningful pressure year-over-year down more than 50%. We did show some strong performance in parts of the business. We have been hiring, frankly, as Jane has mentioned before and filling in gaps that we have across the portfolio in healthcare, tech, energy, et cetera, and feel good about that and are seeing benefits from having made those hires. DCM is really more of a function of low deal volume pretty much across the Board and there really isn't a whole lot more to it than that. But as you know, Investment Banking is part of the strategy that we discussed at Investor Day and a key part of that and we will continue to invest in it and ensure we are getting the productivity out of it that the investment warrants, but really not a whole lot more in DCM beyond the low deal volume across the Board. Yeah. Again, the important factors here include volume, what we see in both the loan volume, the deposit volume, and obviously, betas and how betas play out and we talked about the idea that with the higher frequency and level of rate increases, that's going to put pressure on the beta in terms of seeing it increase across the Board. And then the third factor is rates and what happens with the rates and the timing for which that happens, right? When that happens matters in the quarter in terms of whether you see that benefit in it or in subsequent quarters. And so those are the factors that drive that range that I have given you and it's across both the PBWM portfolio, as well as how it plays out in TTS and given the world we are managing through quantitative tightening and the like. And I think the other factor is obviously FX and how that plays out. So those are the main drivers, Vivek, and the range reflects any variety of ways that they could play out in the quarter. Yeah. The one thing I will add. I mean we are very pleased with the growth here and the win mandates that we have been seeing across the Board, but particularly in the U.S., as Jane highlights. And some of it is a rate benefit, but a good portion of it is, again, those new mandates, those new additional assets that we are bringing in. The final point that I'd make on it is that and I'd reiterate it, I guess, is that this is not only one of our businesses that's growing quite rapidly, but it's also a high returning business for us as well. And so consistent with the strategy that we talked about at Investor Day and one that reflects linkages across the franchise and so we feel very good about that. I do not have that in front of me, Ken. I can -- I guess if we -- I have got a page in here that reflects, the page 22 reflects some of the size of the exit markets, but I do not have that in front of me. I'd have to circle back with you can. Yeah. That is reflected in the NII guidance, but the major drivers are largely what I referenced. But, yes, it would be reflected in. Yeah. We are -- I mean, we are -- we feel very good about how we track with the plan. Obviously, Mexico is left. We have got Vietnam, India, Taiwan, and there's one I miss Indonesia, I think is... ... what I am missing. So those are the ones that are left and then China, right? So those are the ones that are left in the balance of 20 or beyond 2022."

        "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to Citi\u2019s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJen Landis: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Jen. And thank you everyone for joining us today. When we last spoke we said the macro and geopolitical outlook was complex and uncertain. So, in one sense, little has changed. However, the headwinds have certainly crystallized. And it's against that backdrop that I'm proud of the results our team delivered this quarter as we execute on our strategy and transformation. There are mounting costs to the series of supply shocks we've experienced. And now we need to pay attention to an additional S in ESG, and that is security. In addition to energy and cyber security, food security has also come into sharper focus, threatening to spread the humanitarian cost of the war well beyond Europe. Resiliency is the new priority for governments and corporates alike. And all of this is adding to inflationary pressures, which are in turn being met with a more hawkish response from the Fed and other central banks, all contributing to sharply lower U.S. consumer confidence. Higher rates and QT will keep volatility high. That said, wealth sentiment has shifted. Little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight. Similarly, our corporate clients see robust demand and healthy balance sheet with revenue softness attributed to supply chain constraints so far. So, while a recession could indeed take place over the next two years in the U.S., it's highly unlikely to be a sharper downturn as others in recent memory. I'm just back from Europe, where it's a different story. We expect a very difficult winter is coming, and that's due to disruptions in the energy supply. There is also increasing concern about second order effects on industrial production and how that will affect economic activity across the continent. And the mood is, of course, further darkened by the belief that the war in Ukraine will not end anytime soon. In Asia, a rebound in China also faces some constraints given the potential for future lockdowns, the amount of leverage in the Chinese economy and stress in their property sector. Given this uncertain environment, I'm quite pleased with our overall performance. We reported net income of $4.5 billion and EPS of $2.19 and an RoTCE of 11.2%. We grew revenues at 11% year-over-year whilst remaining on track to meet our expense guidance for the year. Services continued to show excellent momentum with revenues up 28% year-over-year. While some of that growth is a result of the rate environment, we had double-digit fee growth, consistent with the strategy we presented to you in March. TTS in particular fired on all cylinders as clients took advantage of our global network, leading to the best quarter this business has had in a decade. The market volatility that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second, driving corporate clients in particular to be more active in risk management, contributing to revenue growth of 25% in markets. The volatility we saw in foreign exchange rates, commodities and equity derivatives favored our mix, and we were more efficient in our capital usage. And while this level of activity is related to where we are in the current cycle rather than a new baseline in markets, I believe we are helping our clients navigate this environment quite well. And it shows how our emphasis on our corporate clients globally given their consistent trading needs is a differentiating one for us in market. On the flip side, that same environment continues to put a great deal of pressure on the Investment Banking wallet with our revenues down 46%. However, we are seeing an increase of lending as our clients have been less inclined to obtain financing through the debt markets given the recent swings. In U.S. Personal Banking, the positive drivers we saw in our two credit card businesses over the last few quarters converted into solid revenue growth this quarter, most notably, 10% growth in branded cards. And you can see how resilient the consumer is in the U.S. through the elevated payment rates and the low level of credit losses. They have, however, shifted their spend far more to travel and entertainment, which are now outpacing 2019 levels. While volatility can be an opportunity for our trading desks, lower asset prices are a headwind for wealth management. Asia again was hit harder than other regions, leading to flat year-over-year wealth management revenues overall. That said, we continue to execute our wealth strategy across a number of fronts, including building our base of client advisers, expanding our Private Bank\u2019s physical footprint to reach 20 countries with the additions of Germany and France, and increasing referrals from our branch network in the U.S. So, the underlying strategic drivers for the long-term growth of this business continue to advance. Overall, while we did have a slight build in reserves given the increasing possibility of a recession, we are operating from a position of strength. Our capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserve levels are strong, and our diversified business mix also positions us well for the choppy waters on the horizon. Well, while the world has changed since we presented our Investor Day to you in March, our strategy has not. We have continued to execute it with discipline and with urgency. The quarterly report card on Slide 3 should help you hold us accountable for our progress. We are laser-focused on the long-term goals we set out in March, and I see this quarter's performance as validating that we are indeed on the right path. Simplifying the firm is a high priority, and we made good progress executing on our divestitures, such as closing the sale of Australia during the quarter. We're well into the sales process in Mexico, working through the regulatory and legal dynamics that can be expected in a transaction of this nature. In terms of Russia, we continue to shrink the size of our business and take steps to reduce our financial exposure. Given the complex environment, we are considering the full range of possibilities to exit our Consumer & Commercial Banking businesses, including portfolio sales. As divestitures such as Australia progress, we are beginning to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our model. And this discipline is critical to ensuring we have the resources to invest in the businesses where we want to gain or maintain a competitive advantage and to ensure the success of our transformation. To that point, we were particularly pleased that our AML consent order was lifted by the OCC in April. We are committed to ensuring our technology, controls and processes are up to the standards our regulators expect of us and we expect of ourselves. Let me end on capital. We increased our CET1 ratio to 11.9% this quarter whilst returning $1.3 billion in capital, including a rather modest level of buybacks. Our tangible book value per share now exceeds $80. Despite the strength of our balance sheet and reserves, our stress capital buffer is set to increase to 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of this year's stress test scenario. So, over the near term, we plan to build to a CET1 ratio of approximately 13%, including our 100 basis-point management buffer. Over the medium term, our CET1 target remains at 11.5% to 12%. We are prioritizing our dividend and are pausing our share repurchases as we build capital. We have a management buffer, which we can use to help ensure a smooth path to our required levels, and Mark will walk you through our approach in a few minutes. We will generate significant capital given our earnings power and the completion of pending divestitures. We know how important buybacks are to shareholder value creation, in particular when we are trading at these levels, and are committed to restarting them as soon as it is prudent to do so. We will make every effort to optimize our capital, especially in businesses such as Markets. So we balance the needs of our clients, our investors and our regulators. Overall, in a challenging macro and geopolitical environment, our team delivered solid results, and the bank is in a very strong position to weather uncertain times whilst playing to our strengths. I'm confident about the path ahead, and I'm pleased with our early progress. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we'd be delighted, as always, to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; then spend a little more time on expenses, capital and Russia; and then turn to the results of each segment and end with 2022 guidance. On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the second quarter, we reported net income of $4.5 billion and EPS of $2.19 with an RoTCE of 11.2% or $19.6 billion of revenues. In the quarter, total revenues increased 11% with growth in both, net interest income as well as noninterest revenues. Net interest income grew 14% driven by higher rates as well as strong volumes across ICG and PBWM. Noninterest revenue grew 5% driven by fixed income and services, which more than offset lower noninterest revenue in Investment Banking and PBWM. Total expenses of $12.4 billion increased 8%, largely driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses. On a year-to-date basis, expenses were up 12%, but excluding divestiture-related impacts were up 9%, also driven by the factors I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $1.3 billion, driven by net credit losses of $850 million and an ACL build of approximately $400 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $18.3 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.44% and are well capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%. On slide 5, we show an expense walk for the second quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about two-thirds related to risk, controls, data and the finance programs. And approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. And as of today, we have over 9,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 2% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers in wealth. And we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front-office onboarding and platforms. 2% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses, largely in Markets and Cards. And approximately 1% was driven by compensation as well as other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 14% for the quarter. Before we move on from expenses, we wanted to provide some tangible examples of what we are working on regarding our transformation and some of the benefits we expect to see over time. The transformation is designed to improve our governance and processes, enhance our policies and leverage technology to strengthen our controls. We've been actively investing in technology to improve automation and hiring people to stand up these efforts. To this end, we are enhancing our risk management processes and capabilities across a number of areas. For example, in Banking, we've gone live with a new platform and now begun to consolidate our 37 loan processing systems to one loan servicing platform. And we have continued to build out our infrastructure to enhance our stress testing capabilities across the firm, particularly useful in this market. Given the power and importance of data, we are redesigning our data governance and data organization, which will help us improve the timeliness and quality of our data. These foundational data-related changes will allow us to simplify and improve client onboarding and deepening, product development as well as enhance our data analytics for every function. And we are streamlining our financial planning process to allow for multiple scenarios with greater frequency, including more agile capital planning. And we signed with a major software provider to begin a multiyear process of modernizing and moving our 16 ledger platforms deployed across 121 instances to one cloud-based ledger. And while we are in the early stages of these initiatives, we expect the efficiencies from these investments to be key in helping us meet our Investor Day commitments. On slide 6, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $1.1 billion on a sequential basis driven by higher rates, day count, growth in loans as well as the impact of the European dividend season on our Markets business. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $1.5 billion driven by higher interest rates as well as volumes across businesses. And we grew average loans by approximately 3% in ICG, mainly in trade finance, and 4% in PBWM. Legacy franchises loans declined, largely driven by the reclassification of loans to held for sale. And sequentially, the gross yield on our loans increased by 35 basis points, and the cost of our interest-bearing deposits increased by 20 basis points. On slide 7, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion of assets, about 22% or $531 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $964 billion. Our end-of-period deposits increased by 1%, largely driven by TTS and wealth. On a sequential basis, deposits decreased by 1%, including the impact of seasonality in wealth. From an RWA perspective, we saw both advanced and standardized RWA come down both year-over-year and sequentially as we continue to optimize RWA. We ended the quarter with a standardized CET1 ratio of approximately 11.9%, and standardized remains the binding requirement. And our tangible book value per share was $80.25, up 3%. On slide 8, we show a sequential CET1 ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our goals over the next few quarters. First, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common, which added 34 basis points. Second, we returned $1.3 billion in the form of dividends and buybacks, which drove a reduction of about 10 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 12 basis-point reduction. Fourth, the decrease in disallowed DTA drove a 5 basis-point increase. And finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of our net RWA optimization efforts as well as the 12 basis-point benefit from the closing of the Australia sale. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%, 50 basis points higher than the first quarter and well above the regulatory requirement of 10.5%. We expect our regulatory requirement to increase to 11.5% in October of 2022 to account for the increase in our stress capital buffer from 3% to 4%. In January, our regulatory requirement will increase to 12% as a result of an increase in our G-SIB surcharge. A combination of our earnings generation, closing of divestitures and continued RWA optimization efforts will be important tools as we manage towards our CET1 requirement. And our management buffer, which was designed to temporarily address volatility, will allow us to build gradually while continuing to support our clients. Given all that, we do expect to build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which accounts for the increased regulatory requirement and assumes a 100 basis-point management buffer. However, consistent with what we said at Investor Day, our medium-term target remains at 11.5% to 12%. And while we are pausing buybacks for now, as I've said before, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time. On slide 9, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. In 2Q, we reduced our exposure by $3.1 billion in local currency terms, which was more than offset by the ruble appreciation. As of today, the mix of our exposure has changed and is now reflecting a higher proportion of stronger credit names. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $1.2 billion, up from about $700 million due to the ruble appreciation. As a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios our potential capital impact is estimated to be approximately $2 billion, down from the $2.5 billion to $3 billion last quarter. On slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased by 20%, largely driven by TTS, Markets, Securities Services as well as a gain on loan hedges, partially offset by a decrease in Investment Banking revenues. Expenses increased 10% driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a benefit of $202 million with a net ACL release of $220 million and net credit losses of only $18 million. The release was largely driven by a reduction in Russia-related risk, partially offset by a build due to increased global macro uncertainty. This resulted in net income of approximately $4 billion, up 16%. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by TTS loans, which were up 17%. Average deposits grew 1% driven by the deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 16.6%. On slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 33% driven by 42% growth in net interest income as well as 17% growth in NIR as we saw a strong growth with both mid and large corporate clients. And we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 61%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and on a combined basis drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Securities Services revenues grew 16% as net interest income grew 41%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. And NIR grew 8%, largely reflecting elevated activity levels in issuer services. Overall Markets revenues were up 25%. The macro environment played to our strengths with the volatility leading to elevated corporate client activity. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 31% driven by FX, rates and commodities due to active engagement with our corporate clients as we help them manage risk associated with volatile markets. Equity markets revenues were up 8% driven by strong equity derivative performance, partially offset by less client activity in cash and a net decrease in prime balances as lower asset valuations more than offset new client balance. Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 28% driven by Investment Banking as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted client activity, partially offset by higher revenue in corporate lending. So, we feel very good about the progress we are making here as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients. Now turning to slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue, largely driven by partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 12% driven by transformation, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit of $1.4 billion was up as we added reserves given the increase in overall uncertainty in the macro environment compared to a net ACL release last year. And NCLs were down 19% as we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. Average loans grew 4% driven by strong growth in branded cards as well as growth across retail services and wealth. Average deposits grew 6% driven by growth across retail and wealth. We continue to maintain a strong reserve-to-loan ratio of 7.5% in our U.S. Cards business. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 6.8%. While a low return, this was driven by the ACL build and an increase in expenses in the quarter. On slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards revenues were up 10% driven by higher interest on higher loan balances. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts and card spend volumes both up 18% and average loans up 11%. Retail Services revenues were up 7%, also driven by higher interest on higher loan balances, partially offset by higher partner payments. So, despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we have been making have driven growth in interest-earning balances of 3% in Branded Cards and 2% in Retail Services, and we believe we will continue to grow these balances in the second half of the year. Retail Banking revenues were up 6%, primarily driven by deposit spreads and volumes. Wealth revenues were flat as investment fee headwinds offset NII growth driven by deposits and loan volumes. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. We're starting to see the leading indicators pick up with average deposits up 7% and client advisers up 8%. And we are seeing strong new client acquisitions, having added 800 Private Bank clients and over 50,000 Citigold clients since last year. On slide 14, we show results for legacy franchises. Revenues declined 15%, largely driven by the closing of the Australia consumer sale, the Korea wind-down and muted investment activity in Asia. And as we mentioned, this quarter, we closed the sale of the Australia consumer business, which was a benefit of up to $1.5 billion of capital. On slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, and expenses were down. On slide 16, we briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook. At this point, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range. Relative to Investor Day, the rate curve is certainly giving us a tailwind from an NII perspective, and Markets revenues are up for the first half of the year. However, as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing much lower levels of Investment Banking activity, and this will likely continue for the remainder of the year. In terms of expenses, we still expect to grow expenses by 7% to 8%, excluding the impact of divestitures. While we are seeing some impact from inflation, we believe the efficiencies that we're executing against and the impact of foreign exchange translation should offset these headwinds. And with that said, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald: Hi. Good morning. Mark, I was hoping that maybe you could unpack the guidance for 2022 a little bit more. It seems like you've got more good guys than bad guys maintain the guidance. But maybe within that, could you give us a little bit more color on what you're expecting on net interest income, where the trends seem strong? And then maybe what you're assuming for markets in the back half of the year? Thank you.\nMark Mason: Yes. Thank you, John. Good morning to you. As you said, we have seen the benefit certainly in the quarter here of the pickup in rates. And certainly, all indicators are that the rate increases will likely continue through the balance of the year. And as you've heard me say before, I do expect that we will see continued growth in loans, particularly on the card side. And we saw some of that start to play in sooner than expected because I had talked about it being in the back half of the year. We saw some of that even here in the second quarter. So, we do continue to think we'll get some lift there. We also expect to see continued momentum on the services side, both in TTS and life with Securities Services as well. And that growth is more than just rates, but certainly a portion of that does come from rates as well. Where the pressure is going to come is in the noninterest revenue, and we saw that certainly in the quarter here on the Investment Banking side. We saw that obviously in some of the wealth businesses, particularly in Asia. And that's where some of the offset is that we'd expect against that NII momentum. Now, the reality, I think, is that we'll have to see how this plays out as it relates to markets. All the uncertainty that's out there in the environment thus far has played to our favor given our focus on corporate clients and what have you. But I'd tell you that as I look at the full year, based on what we know now and with the uncertainty that's out there, I continue to feel comfortable with that guidance probably to the higher end of that low-single-digit growth that I've talked about.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And then, maybe as a follow-up, just remind us where you are on net interest income sensitivity. You've updated the way I think you look at it relative to peers and relative to rates. Just remind us where you are on that and what kind of deposit pricing assumptions are embedded in that.\nMark Mason: Sure. So, important to kind of just level set, John, great question. We got to think there are a couple of drivers that kind of come into play when we think about the sensitivity. So, one is obviously the mix. And so, in our case, we've got about two-thirds of our deposits are wholesale, about a third are consumer. We've got obviously 70% of ours are in U.S.-denominated and the rest are kind of non-U.S. And that mix is important when you think about betas, when you think about sensitivity and how they play out, particularly in a rising rate environment at the pace that we've seen, and that pace varies for both the U.S. versus the non-U.S. currencies. And so, that's all going to be a factor in kind of how we think about it. You're right. In our disclosure, we forecast our IRE disclosure based on a runoff balance sheet assumption. And what I've been describing the past couple of quarters an approach -- is an approach that's more consistent with peers, which assumes a static balance sheet. And under that analysis, if we were to look at an assumption for 100 basis points parallel shift in rates, cross-currencies, we think that would generate roughly a $2.5 billion increase in NII. Now, for us, that's going to skew towards non-U.S. dollars. About 80% of that would be non-U.S. dollar, about 20% U.S. dollar. And that shift is in part because we've seen already a significant increase in the U.S. We've seen some increase in non-U.S. but nowhere near the magnitude that we've seen in the U.S. So, I'll stop there. Hopefully, that addresses your question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Mark, I wonder if you could just elaborate on the headwinds in noninterest revenue within PBWM and Retail Services. It sounds to me like you extended a contract for a partner or something like that. And then, maybe bigger picture, in Cards, you just mentioned rising card loans. We all want rising loans. But in the backdrop and the economic outlook we're facing, how do you decipher what's good rise in card loans versus a little concerning rise in card loans?\nMark Mason: Sure. Let me take the first -- take them in that order. So, on the Retail Services side, it has nothing to do with kind of an extension of a contract or anything like that. What I'm describing is that it is a partner business that we have there in Retail Services. And what that means is that there's a sharing of the profits associated with the business that we generate. And so, what happens is in this rising rate environment, we've seen -- and the activity from a volume point of view, we've seen an increase in the net interest income that we've generated. And what that means is that there's more, fortunately, more profits to share with our partners. The sharing of those profits play through the noninterest revenue line. So, it comes out of -- comes out as a fee of the contra revenue as we share those with clients. So, that's the driver of the swing that you see happening there or the pressure that we have in PBWM as it relates to Retail Services. In terms of the Cards growth, the Cards growth, we feel very good about it. There certainly is an environmental dynamic that's playing out as it relates to consumers and corporates. But what I would say is that you've also heard us describing more marketing spend, more advertising spend, more acquisitions, 18% growth in acquisitions. We've been targeting growing our customer base there while staying within our risk appetite. The parameters that we've set have been very disciplined about. And that started to pay off. And that is part of what I described in terms of the loan growth that is materializing. There's nothing that we see of significance as we grow these loans that would suggest, one, that they're outside of the focus that we've had to date because they're not, nor that there's any material risk in terms of outsized losses. If you look at our loss rates, our loss rates are -- for Branded Cards, 1.5%; Retail Services, 2.6%. Those are 50% of what we would normally -- what we used to describe as a normal loss rate, NCL rate, through a cycle. And so, we feel very good about the loans that we're growing. There's obviously risk, but we also feel very good about the reserves that we have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian: My first question is actually a follow-up to John's question, Mark. I think that it's always been more challenging to forecast net interest income for Citigroup. And the net interest income and net interest margin certainly surprised to the upside. So, I guess, let me reask the question. Appreciate the $2.5 billion for each 100 basis-point in parallel shift. But as we think about the U.S. forward curve, how should we think about the trajectory of net interest income from that 10.58 from here. And clearly, as we think about a deposit base that's two-thirds wholesale, how should we think about both deposit flow, deposit growth and deposit beta as we think about the second half of the year? In other words, does the rate of change quarter-over-quarter accelerate, flatten out or decelerate?\nMark Mason: There's a lot there. But I mean, I think what I'd say is a couple of things. One is, we've obviously seen a rapid increase in rates. And that -- the speed at which rates increases matters a lot as it relates to the betas. And so -- particularly on the wholesale corporate side. And so, we have seen betas increase there. They're probably at about to slightly a little bit better than we would have expected. But we would expect that momentum to continue in the back half of the year given the forecast for continued rate increases. The other thing that I'd point out, just giving you a point around the ability to forecast from a Citi point of view, if you look at the first half of the year, we did about -- I think it was $1.8 billion or so over the prior year, ex Markets. So NII, ex Markets, 1.8 billion year-over-year first half. To give you a bit more guidance on how we're thinking about it in light of the rate curve and in light of our mix, I'd tell you that I expect about another $1.8 billion or so in the back half. So, that's probably year-over-year, 8ish percent or so on a full year basis based on, again, our mix, our assumption around betas and our current assumptions around how the curve would likely play out. Let me pause there and see if Jane wants to add anything to that.\nJane Fraser: Yes. I'd also add in our institutional deposits account for about 65% of Citi's deposit base, but 55% of them are operational deposits. And the TTS deposits have increased by $134 billion since pre-COVID, but the operational deposits increased by $141 billion and the non-operating decreased. So, with Q2 on the horizon, we\u2019d certainly expect the amounts of deposits in the system to shrink. We anticipate this would primarily impact non-operating balances. And I think we feel very good about the stickiness the deposit base has got and particularly internationally, where these are operating accounts that are extremely sticky, frankly, in all environments.\nMark Mason: Good point.\nErika Najarian: Thank you. And just my follow-up question is that was really an impressive capital build this quarter, particularly since it's been an issue with investors since -- especially since the SCB came out. I think a piece that we may be missing as we think about the continued build to 13% is sort of what the CET1 benefit is from slide 19. So similar to the sort of the -- I guess, it was 12 basis points that -- accreted from the Australia sale. Is there any way you could give us a range on -- as the deals close for the Philippines, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia in the second half of the year, how that could boost your CET1 and get you closer to that 13% bogey?\nMark Mason: Yes. I guess, let me kind of answer it in a more fulsome way, if you don't mind, and then I'll certainly make sure that I give you a sense for the contribution of what we expect from divestitures to the capital impact. So, again, there are a couple of drivers that are going to be important to us building to ultimately the 13% for as long as that is in place given the SCB. One is obviously the income generation. And we had a very strong quarter as it relates to income generation. I feel good about the back half of the year, as I've just given you some guidance on. The other is, don't forget, we've had 160 basis points on the two-year since the beginning of the year to the end of the first quarter in terms of rate increases, another 60 in the second quarter. And there's going to be -- there were AOCI impacts from that, 34 in the first quarter, and as we point out here, another 12 in the second. There's a pull to par that we expect to start to play out and continue to play out in the balance of the year. That's going to be an important factor. The third, as you've heard us mention is we've been working very hard to optimize our RWA, and we'll continue to do that. We paused the buybacks. That's a factor. And then, as you mentioned, the divestitures to close to $1.5 billion or so in Australia. I've talked about in the past about $4 billion for the year in terms of capital impact. I'm at about $3.5 billion with Australia is what I'm currently expecting. And so a little bit less than what I talked about before, in part because of some of the movement in terms of the timing of some of these closings, still feel good about it. Just it's a difficult market that we're managing through. So that $3.5 billion total should give you a sense for how that translates into a CET1 impact that we're expecting, at least through the balance of this year. And obviously, there'll be more to come as we continue to close out and -- sign and close out some of the remaining deals.\nJane Fraser: Yes. I mean, I rather suspect that at the end of all of this, we're going to have an overabundance of capital. And I really feel good that Citi is already very well positioned for any environment. And as Mark said, we have a confluence of various factors going on at the moment, some of which are temporary that are causing this rapid buildup of capital for the industry. But, I think, we're extremely well positioned for what lies ahead in terms of strong capital ratios, total liquidity resources. Portfolio credit quality is extremely high, well reserved. And so, we are very much looking forward to resuming share buybacks, as I said, once we've achieved this build, particularly given where we're trading. And I want you to hear loud and clear that commitment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: I'm trying to figure out if you're lucky or smart, and the reason I say that is at your Investor Day, I mean, right upfront you said you have 5 core interconnected businesses led by services, led by TTS. And then, a few months later, you have your best quarter in a decade. And it just seems so coincidental that you highlight that as a growth area and then just a couple of quarters later, boom, here we are. So, how much of that TTS growth is simply because of one-off factors? How much of it is due to a higher baseline because of, say, interest rates? And how much of that is due to market share gains? And just remind us what TTS and Securities Services is again, because I think you got everyone's attention with this quarter.\nJane Fraser: So, why don't I kick off and then I'll pass it to Mark. And it's a danger here of how long you have, Mike, because there's a lot to talk about. So, I would encourage you to sit at the beach this weekend and have an excellent read of the supplement because we've provided you with a lot of good facts and proof points and information, both around the services businesses and the others about the early progress on the strategy. TTS was able to fire, as I said, on all cylinders this quarter. About two-thirds of the performance was driven by business actions and one-third was by rates. And as Mark said, very active management of the deposit base, beta discipline across all the regions. And the NIR growth that you saw was driven by cards, by payments, by receivables and by trade. When you look in the strategic drivers we laid out at Investor Day this quarter, cross-border transaction value, up 17% year-over-year; clearing volume, up 2% in U.S. dollar; commercial comp spend, up 62% as that business recovered; average trade loan balances, up 14%; average deposit balances, up 2%. So, that two-thirds that was not rates-related has a very broad and substantive set of drivers behind it that, as Mark said, puts us into a very strong position for continued momentum here. This level of year-over-year growth is very pleasing, but we would expect to see it revert to the medium-term guidance we gave you at Investor Day over time. But this was across the board, all elements firing. And I will give a shout-out to Shahmir, the Head of TTS, as well as to our Securities Services team. But he has really instituted a culture of intensity, of tremendous focus, of discipline in how he is running the business as well. And I think that is also a contributing factor to the confidence that you're hearing from us about this. Mark, do you want to explain what TTS and Securities Services is?\nMark Mason: Again, as you've heard us describe, the TTS franchise is core to our business. It provides obviously a network to the large multinational clients in over 90 countries. We manage the full swath of their working capital and cash management needs. We also provide trade financing for them and the vendors and partners. And this is essentially, in many ways, what differentiates our franchise from others. And not only is it in and of itself a core growing, high-returning business but is one of the businesses that is well-connected to the rest of the franchise when you think about the Markets business that we have and the FX that we manage on behalf of clients. And so, -- and this is a particularly relevant time for us to be engaged with those partners as they manage through supply chain issues. And we're there to again help them work through those things and provide them alternatives to their production and operations and similar-type services we provide to our investor client base from a Securities Services point of view. Look, the strategy here did not start with Investor Day. That is -- we obviously spent time with you talking about that. But, this has been a part of the franchise that we've been investing in on an ongoing basis. And it's important that we continue to do that, investments in technology, investments in onboarding of new clients and the services we provide and enhanced digital capabilities and the operations. So, all of those things, and some of that what you see here is those investments starting to pay off.\nJane Fraser: And the same is exactly true in Securities Services. So, I think, the answer to your question is no, we're just being very-disciplined.\nMark Mason: Yes. Well said.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Just a follow-up on the RWA. When you talk about the premium of the $3.5 billion and -- can you help us just discern between what is a numerator impact and what's the RWA impact of the sales that have been announced? And just as a related -- just how far are you through the RWA optimization efforts [Technical Difficulty]?\nMark Mason: Thank you. The $3.5 billion I referenced is all capital. So, all numerator impact is what I'm describing. It's both, the -- any premium that we get or impact, gain from sale as well as the RWA that we have allocated as part of that business. And so, that all kind of flows through from a numerator point of view. In the case of Australia, for example, that would include both, the RWA that we had attributed to that business as well as the CTA impact coming back into capital. So remember, we took a hit when we signed the deal associated with the CTA. I kept communicating that that would neutralize at -- when the deal was closed. In fact, it did and that contributes to the roughly $1.5 billion there. In terms of RWA optimization efforts, it's a continuous effort. We are constantly working through the balance sheet to make sure that it's allocated to clients who generate the highest prospect for growth and leverage the breadth of the franchise, and we're going to continue to do that. And I think we -- the team did a very good job in ICG and particularly in Markets this quarter in making sure that we made progress against the revenue to RWA metric that they've been using, which is a proxy for returns. They worked very closely with clients to manage the recycling of trading inventory in an optimal way to optimize collateral positions that -- and postings that we have to increase initial margins on derivative trading where that makes sense. And so, they've been actively working the balance sheet, and we're going to continue to do that. We want to be there to serve our clients, but we want to make sure that we are generating an appropriate return for the use of capital.\nJane Fraser: And it's part of the shift that we've been instituting Paco and Andy in Markets and across ICG and across the firm in our commitment to our shareholders to be more returns-focused and to be managing the business differently that way. This is a very obvious example of that because it's multidimensional.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just around capital, Mark, just a two-part question. One, are we -- am I hearing you right that you're not going to leave the door open for buybacks until you get to 13%? Appreciating what Jane said about some of the transitory impact from AOCI. Why not be a bit more opportunistic? And just tied to that, what's the risk that some of these deals get pushed out? I see slide 19 where you've extended the time line for a few deals. Given just the macro backdrop, like is that a real risk, or do you feel pretty good about the updated time lines? Thank you.\nMark Mason: Yes. Sure. So look, I mean, we are obviously going to take it quarter by quarter as it relates to buybacks and from a capital point of view. Again, without going through all of the things that reflect the environment that we're in, you can see the uncertainty that's out there. Obviously, the capital requirements with this SCB for the industry are higher. That's unfortunate. We feel as though the right amount of capital was in the industry already. We've got to manage to that. It's the right requirement. We're going to do that. But we'll -- SCB gives us the opportunity to take those decisions quarter-by-quarter. We're pausing for now. And next year, there'll be another DFAST process, and there'll be an SCB that comes out of that. And frankly, we should have the strength of higher PPNR that we've been generating to help contribute to what that outcome looks like. So, we'll take that quarter-by-quarter. In terms of risk-related to divestitures, again, we did highlight we're being very, very transparent with you all and with the world. And we do see some delays that we highlighted from our original schedule that's in the back of the presentation there. But, we feel very good about getting to closure there, and it's not an if, it's a when. And we feel like we're on track with the schedule that we've highlighted for you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: One more capital question. So, on slide 8, you do give the medium-term outlook here for what you see as your long-term goals for capital, the 11.5% to 12%. And so implicit within that is an expectation that your reg mins would fall to somewhere 200 basis points or so. And I get that the exits will be part of that. Is there a sense you can tell us, as you get more simplified, what the SCB benefit would be? I thought it was something like 25 basis points, but I must be off there.\nMark Mason: Yes. Look, I mean, the 11.5 to 12 is consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day. And the medium term, as you know, Betsy, for us is three to five years. We've got a couple of things that we're working through, not the least of which are the divestitures. They will certainly contribute to that, but so will some of the other things that I've mentioned, including utilization of the DTA, the AOCI pullback and things of that sort. The divestitures certainly will help from an SCB point of view, but I think the stronger performance that we're seeing will aid in that as well. And importantly, the mix change that we expect to come from executing on our strategy, a mix towards more sustainable, predictable earnings, earnings that are coming from some of the areas of growth that we demonstrated this quarter like TTS and Securities Services, et cetera, et cetera. So there's time there. There's obviously a management buffer component of that that I think is certainly an important factor in consideration as we evolve our mix. And then, there's the G-SIB score. With not only a reduction in the divestitures that will impact peak-to-trough losses, there's also deposits that will go away with those and balance sheet evolution that will contribute to the reduction in G-SIB score as well.\nJane Fraser: Yes. Let me just underline a couple of points. When we built our strategy, it wasn't only to generate greater returns, but it was to lower our capital requirements over time, as Mark said. And you can see how we're executing that both in terms of the shift in mix and the divestitures. Obviously, we don't control the regulatory capital framework. But we're not managing for short-term shifts in SCB. As you know, the banks experienced considerable variability in the SCB each year. It's very much depending on the scenario chosen. So, that's why we continue with our commitment and confidence around the medium term.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So, I had a follow-up question for Mark on NII. As the Fed continues down the path of balance sheet normalization, I just wanted to clarify whether that $1.8 billion increase in NII you cited for the back half assumes stable deposits or some Q2-related attrition. And within ICG specifically, are there any insights you can share on what drove the increase in Markets NII and how that should traject just given the historical liability sensitivity within the Markets business?\nMark Mason: On the first point, when I think about the back half of the year in quantitative tightening, I do expect that we will see some continued deposit growth, as I mentioned earlier. The pressure from quantitative tightening, I think, will certainly play out over time. But again, our focus is on growing the operating deposits that we have with clients. And we think we've got good traction and ability to continue momentum with those operating deposits. And again, they put us in a position to really broaden the relationship with both, those multinational clients as well as with some of our commercial clients where we've been getting good growth in and momentum from. So yes, likely to be an impact across the industry, but we believe we can get some continued momentum, particularly on the operating deposits that we have with clients. In terms of Markets NII, I mean, you've got the European dividend that plays out in the second quarter. So that obviously is a factor there. And again, I'd point you to when we talk about Markets, I really like to talk about total revenues because the nature of the security and the trading and the activity that we do there can have an impact on NII and NIR. And what really matters is the total revenues that we're driving and generating out of that franchise. And as you can see, we did 25% growth in Markets revenue year-over-year. So, a very good quarter for the Markets team for sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Can you elaborate on your comment about why the Russia exposure is kind of less of a risk or it's a better mix than it was a few months ago? And then maybe related to that, quantify how much of the $8.4 billion is to subsidiaries of MNCs, which does seem like it would be much, much lower risk. Thank you.\nMark Mason: Sure. So, look, what we've been doing very actively since the beginning of the year and certainly in the quarter as well, has been working -- we've been working to bring down our exposure in Russia and specifically with the clients that we serve there. And so that direct exposure on -- in a local currency dials, we brought down by some $900 million or so in the quarter. We brought down and reduced the cash and deposits that we have by another $1.7 billion or so and then continued to bring down third-party related exposure by another $400 million. And that's been through working with clients to pay those exposures and loans down, and in some instances, giving them incentives to do so and incentives to move their deposits out as well. So, very active engagement from the team as it relates to that. What's happened with that is the mix of the exposure that we have or that remains has skewed towards the higher-quality names and towards the global subsidiaries that we have in the country. And so, with that mix shift to better quality names and the reduction in exposure, that's allowed for us to take down the reserves that we had related to the direct exposure in the quarter. And so, that has been, I think, good -- very good progress in terms of that reduction. It gets overshadowed a bit with the ruble impact, but we've made good progress and we're going to continue to actively do that. Approximately -- Jane, do you want to jump in on that?\nJane Fraser: Yes, yes -- no, I was going to jump in, in terms of just sort of overall -- let's be very clear. We are systematically crunching down the size of our franchise. And as Mark says, the severe stress loss scenario is probably the best indicator of that, which is now around about the $2 billion and materially reduced them. And we completely change the nature of our exposure. Particularly when you think about today, most of our clients are multinationals. Many of the exposures there have parent guarantees against them, which is very helpful. What are we doing with them? Many of them that -- we're helping them with their exits from the countries. And that obviously, as you can all appreciate, takes some time. So for those that are able to exit swiftly, it's -- that's another factor that can help us reduce down our exposure presence and indeed our operations. There are also others though that it is harder. I think we've all seen how difficult it is to disconnect the Russian economy from the West in a couple of key sectors, in particular food and in particular energy. And as you can imagine, given the nature of our bank, we've been in the middle of some of those flows that are essential for the West and the multinationals that are supporting it. And so, you get a -- you have a bit of a blended story here in terms of -- yes, we're helping those that can exit, but we're also still playing the role that we have to and have been asked to in maintaining some of those flows. We anticipate that they will continue to reduce over time as the energy and food security issues get addressed. But it's a complex environment. And bottom line, you can hear us, we're pleased with how this has been managed by our teams.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Mark, can you share with us -- both of you addressed in your opening remarks about the impact the market conditions had on Investment Banking, and your peers have seen it as well. If the market conditions remain this way in the second half of the year and into 2023, just for Investment Banking, not Markets, your trading business, do you guys -- when do you guys have to take a sharper pencil to the expenses in that division, or do you just let it run?\nJane Fraser: Maybe I kick off and then pass it over to Mark. Look, strategic advice is central to the vision to being the preeminent banking partner for multinational firms. We are continuing to strategically invest in talent and in the platform. You can expect us to continue doing so with a particular focus on the tech, health care and financial services sectors because those are ones where it is a decade-long shift that we're going to see in their importance. And I've -- we've brought in some very strong bankers there. It always takes a few years to build share, build out the client relationships and to see the full fruits of those investments. We're also focused on the broader opportunity by leveraging investments in Commercial Banking, I'm sure Mark will talk about that as well, and in Markets and the connectivity there. So, I think, you're going to see us take a strategic look at this and a long-term look, rather than just a shooting from the hip on the expenses side because we're building the firm for the long term here. We'll certainly be incredibly disciplined around expenses. You've seen that with us this quarter. We've talked about what we'll do on expenses across the board and the firm as we become simpler in tackling stranded costs, our organization structure, et cetera. But we're very serious about the investments that we're making into some of the core talent in these areas. And you shouldn't be expecting us to make any significant material shifts, right or left on this one. We're deadly serious. Mark?\nMark Mason: Jane, I think that's well said. The only thing I'd add is that the business is capital-light and is high-returning through the cycle, and so we see a lot of value there. We want to be prepared to ramp up when activity starts again. And as you said, it's quite strategic for us. Since you kind of wound me up on the Commercial Banking activity, I have to jump at it. We had, as you know, Jane, a very strong quarter in Commercial Banking. When I look at the revenue momentum there just kind of leveraging the breadth of the franchise, we're probably up 25% to 30% in revenues in that part of the business. And I know that's part of our -- as you know, that's part of our core growth strategy that we talked about at Investor Day. So, good momentum in that part of the franchise as well.\nJane Fraser: And obviously, having benefits for our Investment Banking colleagues as well.\nMark Mason: Those synergies, yes.\nJane Fraser: Important synergies, yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.\nVivek Juneja: Jane, a question for you on Mexico. Given the comments of the Mexican President, would that limit the price that a buyer would be willing to pay? And what's your sort of minimum price that you're willing to accept? And if -- what's plan B if the prices being bid don't meet that hurdle?\nJane Fraser: Oh, Vivek, I'm not going to answer your question. But I'll give you a few comments on Mexico nonetheless. So, we're pleased with the interest in our Mexican franchise based on the discussions with the buyers. And it's -- the franchise is performing well. It's more than maintaining its value. It's contributing nicely to our financial results. But it's still very early in this process. So, when we have news for you, we will obviously convey that to you swiftly. But, it's early days. And as you'd expect, with the transaction of this nature, we need to work through a variety of regulatory and legal proceedings. We're actively doing so. We're working hard on separating our market-leading institutional franchise, which is a key part of our global network, taking the time necessary to do that the right way. And we have a variety of different options that we can always look at. But it's far too early in the process here to speculate. But, so far, so good.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Lim with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nAndrew Lim: I guess, I'd like to have a better view from you on your outlook on recession. It is difficult to reconcile how investors feel about recession, which is obviously quite negative and seemingly a lot more negative than it was about a quarter ago. But when we look at you and some of your peers, the delta on the recession outlook seems only a little bit worse than it was one quarter ago. So, I was just wondering how you think about recession because some of the investors that we talk to, they look at the savings ratio, it's better pre-pandemic levels. They look at mortgage affordability, and it's really quite dire. And the perception that you have is obviously perhaps inconsistent with the way you were looking at recession. So perhaps you can give us a bit of color as to how you're thinking about things.\nJane Fraser: Yes. I'll kick it off, pass it to Mark. Look, as we've talked about, the current macro environment is kind of shaped by the three Rs: Russia, rates and recession. It depends where in the world you are as to which one is prevailing. In the U.S., we're more concerned about rates and imminent recession. The consumer and the corporate are healthy. The labor market is exceedingly tight. We are increasingly concerned about the possibility of a recession next year. But I think what you're hearing from us quite loud and clear is that we think the economy is quite well positioned to withstand it. Europe, different story. Fragility of their energy supply to any further shocks makes it more vulnerable, and it's kind of at the center of the storm. So, we do believe that the continent is heading into a recession under the most likely scenario and could be as early as this fall. In Asia, concerns are largely focused around China and its COVID -- Zero COVID policy. The economy is bouncing back, but you could have another wave that could be more problematic there. So, you put all these different factors. So, it's a little bit -- depends on where in the world that you are. When I think about Citi, look, we're prepared for a variety of scenarios. We are absolutely ready. We run stress tests all the time given the unique set of risks facing the global economy right now. We have a set of playbooks honed over many years that can get instituted as necessary. And what matters for a bank heading into recession? Capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserves. And we feel very good about all four of them. Very strong capital ratios, as you've seen, ending 2Q. Total liquidity resources just shy of $1 trillion. Over 80% of our corporate exposures are investment-grade. Our consumer clients are heavily prime. And let's just talk a little bit about the ICG NCL this quarter. When you look at the numbers, it was $18 million only. The health of the corporate is entering into the choppy waters is extremely strong. And we have -- we've got a very well reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.44. So, we have a lot of flexibility here. We have a severe recession. I think you'll see certain actions taken, another one is being slower. But as a bank, we're ready for a whole variety of different scenarios. Mark?\nMark Mason: Yes. Jane, just to your point on reserves, just in the quarter, you saw we took a reserve build. That reserve build was in part driven by our view on the potential for some downside in light of everything that we're seeing and the concerns around recession. So we did take a bit of a build from a CECL point of view on reserves. And as Jane mentioned, we feel very good about our reserve levels and the $18 billion that we have associated with our franchise.\nJane Fraser: Yes. I think the consumer -- it's just an unusual situation to be entering into this choppy environment when you have a consumer with strong health and such a tight labor market. And I think that's where you hear so many of us, not so much concerned about an imminent recession in the States.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Can you hear me?\nJane Fraser: Yes, we can, Mike. Hello again.\nMike Mayo: Hi, before I have my beach reading. Thank you for that. Look, to regain investor credibility, you've mentioned meeting various proof points. And can you remind us which proof points you've met, which proof points we should hold you accountable to looking ahead in the next quarter and year?\nJane Fraser: Okay. I think you hold us accountable for all the different proof points we laid out. We went through a very thoughtful process to come up with the different KPIs for the strategy. And those are transparently put into the materials. We're trying to make it as shareholder and investor-friendly as possible in that respect. And as you can see this quarter, the drivers exceeded expectations in some places. There were headwinds in others. We laid them out very clearly. You saw -- we talked about services, so I don't need to cover that one again. In Markets, we talked about optimizing RWA, driving the business for stronger capital productivity, also driving more of the Alpha trade solution business. You see that Personal Banking returning to IEB and revenue growth on customer acquisition, purchase sales being important metrics. Investment Banking, it's progress on key hires and -- that we've been making. That's obviously been a tough market to do so, but I mean, pleased with the talent that we've brought in and delighted with the talent that we have. Wealth was more challenged with lockdowns in Asia understandably slowing some progress on client acquisitions and some of the key strategy drivers there. But synergies, more disciplined, tighter processes reinforced by additional metrics on the scorecard, you'll be hearing us talking more and more about the delivery of those synergies. So, it's not really any different from exactly what we laid out on Investor Day, right? We've laid out a strategy. We have a lot of conviction around. We've laid out the different metrics to hold us accountable to, and it should provide you a sense of progress along the way. And we've also talked about what we're doing to get this cultural change of accountability, of urgency, of intensity and excellence. And we'll give you as many different indicators of where that's working well and where it's not as we go along.\nMark Mason: If I can just add one thing to that, Jane. And Mike, I think you got to keep in mind that this is a very strong quarter for us. We feel very good about it, but it's just a quarter.\nJane Fraser: Yes.\nMark Mason: Right? And we talked about at Investor Day a long-term strategy, and we gave you a sense for medium-term targets. And those things are going to be things that you hold us accountable between now and then, right? And so, this is one quarter. We feel great about it. We're certainly glad that you're recognizing it, but there's a lot more wood to chop. We're making a lot of investments in the franchise that we know are going to pay dividends in the future. And we look forward to kind of talking through continued progress in these KPIs. It won't always be a straight line, but we remain confident that we're going to get there.\nJane Fraser: Yes. And we fully recognize the magnitude of what we have to do, and we're determined to get this done.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.\nJane Fraser: Hi, Vivek.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, Jane. Don't worry. I won't trip you up on another one you can't answer, hopefully.\nJane Fraser: I didn't say, can't. I said won't. There's a big difference.\nVivek Juneja: Won't. Okay. Yes. Okay, good. Hopefully, this one you will. Mark, your 8% NII growth for full year, is there something in the second quarter that was unusually high that we should not carry forward? I'm just trying to reconcile that with the guide that you've given, because if we just take that forward, it would be above the 8%. So, trying to reconcile what's the difference.\nMark Mason: Look, I mean, each of the quarters obviously have different dynamics, different rate moves, different volume levels of volume growth and what have you. And so, there's certainly different volume levels between quarter one and quarter two. And I described kind of how rates would move between the quarters as well. And so, to simplify it and because there is appropriate interest in how we think about it on an ex Markets basis, I just gave you the annualization of the half and what it would mean for the full year. So, nothing that I would point out beyond what you would notice, which is differences in rates and volumes across the businesses.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\nJen Landis: Thank you all for joining today's call. Please, if you have any follow-up questions, reach out to IR. Have a great day. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen. And thank you everyone for joining us today. When we last spoke we said the macro and geopolitical outlook was complex and uncertain. So, in one sense, little has changed. However, the headwinds have certainly crystallized. And it's against that backdrop that I'm proud of the results our team delivered this quarter as we execute on our strategy and transformation. There are mounting costs to the series of supply shocks we've experienced. And now we need to pay attention to an additional S in ESG, and that is security. In addition to energy and cyber security, food security has also come into sharper focus, threatening to spread the humanitarian cost of the war well beyond Europe. Resiliency is the new priority for governments and corporates alike. And all of this is adding to inflationary pressures, which are in turn being met with a more hawkish response from the Fed and other central banks, all contributing to sharply lower U.S. consumer confidence. Higher rates and QT will keep volatility high. That said, wealth sentiment has shifted. Little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight. Similarly, our corporate clients see robust demand and healthy balance sheet with revenue softness attributed to supply chain constraints so far. So, while a recession could indeed take place over the next two years in the U.S., it's highly unlikely to be a sharper downturn as others in recent memory. I'm just back from Europe, where it's a different story. We expect a very difficult winter is coming, and that's due to disruptions in the energy supply. There is also increasing concern about second order effects on industrial production and how that will affect economic activity across the continent. And the mood is, of course, further darkened by the belief that the war in Ukraine will not end anytime soon. In Asia, a rebound in China also faces some constraints given the potential for future lockdowns, the amount of leverage in the Chinese economy and stress in their property sector. Given this uncertain environment, I'm quite pleased with our overall performance. We reported net income of $4.5 billion and EPS of $2.19 and an RoTCE of 11.2%. We grew revenues at 11% year-over-year whilst remaining on track to meet our expense guidance for the year. Services continued to show excellent momentum with revenues up 28% year-over-year. While some of that growth is a result of the rate environment, we had double-digit fee growth, consistent with the strategy we presented to you in March. TTS in particular fired on all cylinders as clients took advantage of our global network, leading to the best quarter this business has had in a decade. The market volatility that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second, driving corporate clients in particular to be more active in risk management, contributing to revenue growth of 25% in markets. The volatility we saw in foreign exchange rates, commodities and equity derivatives favored our mix, and we were more efficient in our capital usage. And while this level of activity is related to where we are in the current cycle rather than a new baseline in markets, I believe we are helping our clients navigate this environment quite well. And it shows how our emphasis on our corporate clients globally given their consistent trading needs is a differentiating one for us in market. On the flip side, that same environment continues to put a great deal of pressure on the Investment Banking wallet with our revenues down 46%. However, we are seeing an increase of lending as our clients have been less inclined to obtain financing through the debt markets given the recent swings. In U.S. Personal Banking, the positive drivers we saw in our two credit card businesses over the last few quarters converted into solid revenue growth this quarter, most notably, 10% growth in branded cards. And you can see how resilient the consumer is in the U.S. through the elevated payment rates and the low level of credit losses. They have, however, shifted their spend far more to travel and entertainment, which are now outpacing 2019 levels. While volatility can be an opportunity for our trading desks, lower asset prices are a headwind for wealth management. Asia again was hit harder than other regions, leading to flat year-over-year wealth management revenues overall. That said, we continue to execute our wealth strategy across a number of fronts, including building our base of client advisers, expanding our Private Bank's physical footprint to reach 20 countries with the additions of Germany and France, and increasing referrals from our branch network in the U.S. So, the underlying strategic drivers for the long-term growth of this business continue to advance. Overall, while we did have a slight build in reserves given the increasing possibility of a recession, we are operating from a position of strength. Our capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserve levels are strong, and our diversified business mix also positions us well for the choppy waters on the horizon. Well, while the world has changed since we presented our Investor Day to you in March, our strategy has not. We have continued to execute it with discipline and with urgency. The quarterly report card on Slide 3 should help you hold us accountable for our progress. We are laser-focused on the long-term goals we set out in March, and I see this quarter's performance as validating that we are indeed on the right path. Simplifying the firm is a high priority, and we made good progress executing on our divestitures, such as closing the sale of Australia during the quarter. We're well into the sales process in Mexico, working through the regulatory and legal dynamics that can be expected in a transaction of this nature. In terms of Russia, we continue to shrink the size of our business and take steps to reduce our financial exposure. Given the complex environment, we are considering the full range of possibilities to exit our Consumer & Commercial Banking businesses, including portfolio sales. As divestitures such as Australia progress, we are beginning to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our model. And this discipline is critical to ensuring we have the resources to invest in the businesses where we want to gain or maintain a competitive advantage and to ensure the success of our transformation. To that point, we were particularly pleased that our AML consent order was lifted by the OCC in April. We are committed to ensuring our technology, controls and processes are up to the standards our regulators expect of us and we expect of ourselves. Let me end on capital. We increased our CET1 ratio to 11.9% this quarter whilst returning $1.3 billion in capital, including a rather modest level of buybacks. Our tangible book value per share now exceeds $80. Despite the strength of our balance sheet and reserves, our stress capital buffer is set to increase to 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of this year's stress test scenario. So, over the near term, we plan to build to a CET1 ratio of approximately 13%, including our 100 basis-point management buffer. Over the medium term, our CET1 target remains at 11.5% to 12%. We are prioritizing our dividend and are pausing our share repurchases as we build capital. We have a management buffer, which we can use to help ensure a smooth path to our required levels, and Mark will walk you through our approach in a few minutes. We will generate significant capital given our earnings power and the completion of pending divestitures. We know how important buybacks are to shareholder value creation, in particular when we are trading at these levels, and are committed to restarting them as soon as it is prudent to do so. We will make every effort to optimize our capital, especially in businesses such as Markets. So we balance the needs of our clients, our investors and our regulators. Overall, in a challenging macro and geopolitical environment, our team delivered solid results, and the bank is in a very strong position to weather uncertain times whilst playing to our strengths. I'm confident about the path ahead, and I'm pleased with our early progress. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we'd be delighted, as always, to take your questions. Yes. I'd also add in our institutional deposits account for about 65% of Citi's deposit base, but 55% of them are operational deposits. And the TTS deposits have increased by $134 billion since pre-COVID, but the operational deposits increased by $141 billion and the non-operating decreased. So, with Q2 on the horizon, we'd certainly expect the amounts of deposits in the system to shrink. We anticipate this would primarily impact non-operating balances. And I think we feel very good about the stickiness the deposit base has got and particularly internationally, where these are operating accounts that are extremely sticky, frankly, in all environments. Yes. I mean, I rather suspect that at the end of all of this, we're going to have an overabundance of capital. And I really feel good that Citi is already very well positioned for any environment. And as Mark said, we have a confluence of various factors going on at the moment, some of which are temporary that are causing this rapid buildup of capital for the industry. But, I think, we're extremely well positioned for what lies ahead in terms of strong capital ratios, total liquidity resources. Portfolio credit quality is extremely high, well reserved. And so, we are very much looking forward to resuming share buybacks, as I said, once we've achieved this build, particularly given where we're trading. And I want you to hear loud and clear that commitment. So, why don't I kick off and then I'll pass it to Mark. And it's a danger here of how long you have, Mike, because there's a lot to talk about. So, I would encourage you to sit at the beach this weekend and have an excellent read of the supplement because we've provided you with a lot of good facts and proof points and information, both around the services businesses and the others about the early progress on the strategy. TTS was able to fire, as I said, on all cylinders this quarter. About two-thirds of the performance was driven by business actions and one-third was by rates. And as Mark said, very active management of the deposit base, beta discipline across all the regions. And the NIR growth that you saw was driven by cards, by payments, by receivables and by trade. When you look in the strategic drivers we laid out at Investor Day this quarter, cross-border transaction value, up 17% year-over-year; clearing volume, up 2% in U.S. dollar; commercial comp spend, up 62% as that business recovered; average trade loan balances, up 14%; average deposit balances, up 2%. So, that two-thirds that was not rates-related has a very broad and substantive set of drivers behind it that, as Mark said, puts us into a very strong position for continued momentum here. This level of year-over-year growth is very pleasing, but we would expect to see it revert to the medium-term guidance we gave you at Investor Day over time. But this was across the board, all elements firing. And I will give a shout-out to Shahmir, the Head of TTS, as well as to our Securities Services team. But he has really instituted a culture of intensity, of tremendous focus, of discipline in how he is running the business as well. And I think that is also a contributing factor to the confidence that you're hearing from us about this. Mark, do you want to explain what TTS and Securities Services is? And the same is exactly true in Securities Services. So, I think, the answer to your question is no, we're just being very-disciplined. And it's part of the shift that we've been instituting Paco and Andy in Markets and across ICG and across the firm in our commitment to our shareholders to be more returns-focused and to be managing the business differently that way. This is a very obvious example of that because it's multidimensional. Yes. Let me just underline a couple of points. When we built our strategy, it wasn't only to generate greater returns, but it was to lower our capital requirements over time, as Mark said. And you can see how we're executing that both in terms of the shift in mix and the divestitures. Obviously, we don't control the regulatory capital framework. But we're not managing for short-term shifts in SCB. As you know, the banks experienced considerable variability in the SCB each year. It's very much depending on the scenario chosen. So, that's why we continue with our commitment and confidence around the medium term. Yes, yes -- no, I was going to jump in, in terms of just sort of overall -- let's be very clear. We are systematically crunching down the size of our franchise. And as Mark says, the severe stress loss scenario is probably the best indicator of that, which is now around about the $2 billion and materially reduced them. And we completely change the nature of our exposure. Particularly when you think about today, most of our clients are multinationals. Many of the exposures there have parent guarantees against them, which is very helpful. What are we doing with them? Many of them that -- we're helping them with their exits from the countries. And that obviously, as you can all appreciate, takes some time. So for those that are able to exit swiftly, it's -- that's another factor that can help us reduce down our exposure presence and indeed our operations. There are also others though that it is harder. I think we've all seen how difficult it is to disconnect the Russian economy from the West in a couple of key sectors, in particular food and in particular energy. And as you can imagine, given the nature of our bank, we've been in the middle of some of those flows that are essential for the West and the multinationals that are supporting it. And so, you get a -- you have a bit of a blended story here in terms of -- yes, we're helping those that can exit, but we're also still playing the role that we have to and have been asked to in maintaining some of those flows. We anticipate that they will continue to reduce over time as the energy and food security issues get addressed. But it's a complex environment. And bottom line, you can hear us, we're pleased with how this has been managed by our teams. Maybe I kick off and then pass it over to Mark. Look, strategic advice is central to the vision to being the preeminent banking partner for multinational firms. We are continuing to strategically invest in talent and in the platform. You can expect us to continue doing so with a particular focus on the tech, health care and financial services sectors because those are ones where it is a decade-long shift that we're going to see in their importance. And I've -- we've brought in some very strong bankers there. It always takes a few years to build share, build out the client relationships and to see the full fruits of those investments. We're also focused on the broader opportunity by leveraging investments in Commercial Banking, I'm sure Mark will talk about that as well, and in Markets and the connectivity there. So, I think, you're going to see us take a strategic look at this and a long-term look, rather than just a shooting from the hip on the expenses side because we're building the firm for the long term here. We'll certainly be incredibly disciplined around expenses. You've seen that with us this quarter. We've talked about what we'll do on expenses across the board and the firm as we become simpler in tackling stranded costs, our organization structure, et cetera. But we're very serious about the investments that we're making into some of the core talent in these areas. And you shouldn't be expecting us to make any significant material shifts, right or left on this one. We're deadly serious. Mark? And obviously, having benefits for our Investment Banking colleagues as well. Important synergies, yes. Oh, Vivek, I'm not going to answer your question. But I'll give you a few comments on Mexico nonetheless. So, we're pleased with the interest in our Mexican franchise based on the discussions with the buyers. And it's -- the franchise is performing well. It's more than maintaining its value. It's contributing nicely to our financial results. But it's still very early in this process. So, when we have news for you, we will obviously convey that to you swiftly. But, it's early days. And as you'd expect, with the transaction of this nature, we need to work through a variety of regulatory and legal proceedings. We're actively doing so. We're working hard on separating our market-leading institutional franchise, which is a key part of our global network, taking the time necessary to do that the right way.

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; then spend a little more time on expenses, capital and Russia; and then turn to the results of each segment and end with 2022 guidance. On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the second quarter, we reported net income of $4.5 billion and EPS of $2.19 with an RoTCE of 11.2% or $19.6 billion of revenues. In the quarter, total revenues increased 11% with growth in both, net interest income as well as noninterest revenues. Net interest income grew 14% driven by higher rates as well as strong volumes across ICG and PBWM. Noninterest revenue grew 5% driven by fixed income and services, which more than offset lower noninterest revenue in Investment Banking and PBWM. Total expenses of $12.4 billion increased 8%, largely driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses. On a year-to-date basis, expenses were up 12%, but excluding divestiture-related impacts were up 9%, also driven by the factors I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $1.3 billion, driven by net credit losses of $850 million and an ACL build of approximately $400 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $18.3 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.44% and are well capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%. On slide 5, we show an expense walk for the second quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about two-thirds related to risk, controls, data and the finance programs. And approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. And as of today, we have over 9,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 2% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers in wealth. And we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front-office onboarding and platforms. 2% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses, largely in Markets and Cards. And approximately 1% was driven by compensation as well as other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 14% for the quarter. Before we move on from expenses, we wanted to provide some tangible examples of what we are working on regarding our transformation and some of the benefits we expect to see over time. The transformation is designed to improve our governance and processes, enhance our policies and leverage technology to strengthen our controls. We've been actively investing in technology to improve automation and hiring people to stand up these efforts. To this end, we are enhancing our risk management processes and capabilities across a number of areas. For example, in Banking, we've gone live with a new platform and now begun to consolidate our 37 loan processing systems to one loan servicing platform. And we have continued to build out our infrastructure to enhance our stress testing capabilities across the firm, particularly useful in this market. Given the power and importance of data, we are redesigning our data governance and data organization, which will help us improve the timeliness and quality of our data. These foundational data-related changes will allow us to simplify and improve client onboarding and deepening, product development as well as enhance our data analytics for every function. And we are streamlining our financial planning process to allow for multiple scenarios with greater frequency, including more agile capital planning. And we signed with a major software provider to begin a multiyear process of modernizing and moving our 16 ledger platforms deployed across 121 instances to one cloud-based ledger. And while we are in the early stages of these initiatives, we expect the efficiencies from these investments to be key in helping us meet our Investor Day commitments. On slide 6, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $1.1 billion on a sequential basis driven by higher rates, day count, growth in loans as well as the impact of the European dividend season on our Markets business. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $1.5 billion driven by higher interest rates as well as volumes across businesses. And we grew average loans by approximately 3% in ICG, mainly in trade finance, and 4% in PBWM. Legacy franchises loans declined, largely driven by the reclassification of loans to held for sale. And sequentially, the gross yield on our loans increased by 35 basis points, and the cost of our interest-bearing deposits increased by 20 basis points. On slide 7, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion of assets, about 22% or $531 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $964 billion. Our end-of-period deposits increased by 1%, largely driven by TTS and wealth. On a sequential basis, deposits decreased by 1%, including the impact of seasonality in wealth. From an RWA perspective, we saw both advanced and standardized RWA come down both year-over-year and sequentially as we continue to optimize RWA. We ended the quarter with a standardized CET1 ratio of approximately 11.9%, and standardized remains the binding requirement. And our tangible book value per share was $80.25, up 3%. On slide 8, we show a sequential CET1 ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our goals over the next few quarters. First, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common, which added 34 basis points. Second, we returned $1.3 billion in the form of dividends and buybacks, which drove a reduction of about 10 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 12 basis-point reduction. Fourth, the decrease in disallowed DTA drove a 5 basis-point increase. And finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of our net RWA optimization efforts as well as the 12 basis-point benefit from the closing of the Australia sale. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%, 50 basis points higher than the first quarter and well above the regulatory requirement of 10.5%. We expect our regulatory requirement to increase to 11.5% in October of 2022 to account for the increase in our stress capital buffer from 3% to 4%. In January, our regulatory requirement will increase to 12% as a result of an increase in our G-SIB surcharge. A combination of our earnings generation, closing of divestitures and continued RWA optimization efforts will be important tools as we manage towards our CET1 requirement. And our management buffer, which was designed to temporarily address volatility, will allow us to build gradually while continuing to support our clients. Given all that, we do expect to build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which accounts for the increased regulatory requirement and assumes a 100 basis-point management buffer. However, consistent with what we said at Investor Day, our medium-term target remains at 11.5% to 12%. And while we are pausing buybacks for now, as I've said before, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time. On slide 9, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. In 2Q, we reduced our exposure by $3.1 billion in local currency terms, which was more than offset by the ruble appreciation. As of today, the mix of our exposure has changed and is now reflecting a higher proportion of stronger credit names. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $1.2 billion, up from about $700 million due to the ruble appreciation. As a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios our potential capital impact is estimated to be approximately $2 billion, down from the $2.5 billion to $3 billion last quarter. On slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased by 20%, largely driven by TTS, Markets, Securities Services as well as a gain on loan hedges, partially offset by a decrease in Investment Banking revenues. Expenses increased 10% driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a benefit of $202 million with a net ACL release of $220 million and net credit losses of only $18 million. The release was largely driven by a reduction in Russia-related risk, partially offset by a build due to increased global macro uncertainty. This resulted in net income of approximately $4 billion, up 16%. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by TTS loans, which were up 17%. Average deposits grew 1% driven by the deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 16.6%. On slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 33% driven by 42% growth in net interest income as well as 17% growth in NIR as we saw a strong growth with both mid and large corporate clients. And we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 61%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and on a combined basis drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Securities Services revenues grew 16% as net interest income grew 41%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. And NIR grew 8%, largely reflecting elevated activity levels in issuer services. Overall Markets revenues were up 25%. The macro environment played to our strengths with the volatility leading to elevated corporate client activity. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 31% driven by FX, rates and commodities due to active engagement with our corporate clients as we help them manage risk associated with volatile markets. Equity markets revenues were up 8% driven by strong equity derivative performance, partially offset by less client activity in cash and a net decrease in prime balances as lower asset valuations more than offset new client balance. Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 28% driven by Investment Banking as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted client activity, partially offset by higher revenue in corporate lending. So, we feel very good about the progress we are making here as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients. Now turning to slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue, largely driven by partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 12% driven by transformation, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit of $1.4 billion was up as we added reserves given the increase in overall uncertainty in the macro environment compared to a net ACL release last year. And NCLs were down 19% as we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. Average loans grew 4% driven by strong growth in branded cards as well as growth across retail services and wealth. Average deposits grew 6% driven by growth across retail and wealth. We continue to maintain a strong reserve-to-loan ratio of 7.5% in our U.S. Cards business. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 6.8%. While a low return, this was driven by the ACL build and an increase in expenses in the quarter. On slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards revenues were up 10% driven by higher interest on higher loan balances. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts and card spend volumes both up 18% and average loans up 11%. Retail Services revenues were up 7%, also driven by higher interest on higher loan balances, partially offset by higher partner payments. So, despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we have been making have driven growth in interest-earning balances of 3% in Branded Cards and 2% in Retail Services, and we believe we will continue to grow these balances in the second half of the year. Retail Banking revenues were up 6%, primarily driven by deposit spreads and volumes. Wealth revenues were flat as investment fee headwinds offset NII growth driven by deposits and loan volumes. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. We're starting to see the leading indicators pick up with average deposits up 7% and client advisers up 8%. And we are seeing strong new client acquisitions, having added 800 Private Bank clients and over 50,000 Citigold clients since last year. On slide 14, we show results for legacy franchises. Revenues declined 15%, largely driven by the closing of the Australia consumer sale, the Korea wind-down and muted investment activity in Asia. And as we mentioned, this quarter, we closed the sale of the Australia consumer business, which was a benefit of up to $1.5 billion of capital. On slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, and expenses were down. On slide 16, we briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook. At this point, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range. Relative to Investor Day, the rate curve is certainly giving us a tailwind from an NII perspective, and Markets revenues are up for the first half of the year. However, as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing much lower levels of Investment Banking activity, and this will likely continue for the remainder of the year. In terms of expenses, we still expect to grow expenses by 7% to 8%, excluding the impact of divestitures. While we are seeing some impact from inflation, we believe the efficiencies that we're executing against and the impact of foreign exchange translation should offset these headwinds. And with that said, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Yes. Thank you, John. Good morning to you. As you said, we have seen the benefit certainly in the quarter here of the pickup in rates. And certainly, all indicators are that the rate increases will likely continue through the balance of the year. And as you've heard me say before, I do expect that we will see continued growth in loans, particularly on the card side. And we saw some of that start to play in sooner than expected because I had talked about it being in the back half of the year. We saw some of that even here in the second quarter. So, we do continue to think we'll get some lift there. We also expect to see continued momentum on the services side, both in TTS and life with Securities Services as well. And that growth is more than just rates, but certainly a portion of that does come from rates as well. Where the pressure is going to come is in the noninterest revenue, and we saw that certainly in the quarter here on the Investment Banking side. We saw that obviously in some of the wealth businesses, particularly in Asia. And that's where some of the offset is that we'd expect against that NII momentum. Now, the reality, I think, is that we'll have to see how this plays out as it relates to markets. All the uncertainty that's out there in the environment thus far has played to our favor given our focus on corporate clients and what have you. But I'd tell you that as I look at the full year, based on what we know now and with the uncertainty that's out there, I continue to feel comfortable with that guidance probably to the higher end of that low-single-digit growth that I've talked about. Sure. So, important to kind of just level set, John, great question. We got to think there are a couple of drivers that kind of come into play when we think about the sensitivity. So, one is obviously the mix. And so, in our case, we've got about two-thirds of our deposits are wholesale, about a third are consumer. We've got obviously 70% of ours are in U.S.-denominated and the rest are kind of non-U.S. And that mix is important when you think about betas, when you think about sensitivity and how they play out, particularly in a rising rate environment at the pace that we've seen, and that pace varies for both the U.S. versus the non-U.S. currencies. And so, that's all going to be a factor in kind of how we think about it. You're right. In our disclosure, we forecast our IRE disclosure based on a runoff balance sheet assumption. And what I've been describing the past couple of quarters an approach -- is an approach that's more consistent with peers, which assumes a static balance sheet. And under that analysis, if we were to look at an assumption for 100 basis points parallel shift in rates, cross-currencies, we think that would generate roughly a $2.5 billion increase in NII. Now, for us, that's going to skew towards non-U.S. dollars. About 80% of that would be non-U.S. dollar, about 20% U.S. dollar. And that shift is in part because we've seen already a significant increase in the U.S. We've seen some increase in non-U.S. but nowhere near the magnitude that we've seen in the U.S. So, I'll stop there. Hopefully, that addresses your question. Sure. Let me take the first -- take them in that order. So, on the Retail Services side, it has nothing to do with kind of an extension of a contract or anything like that. What I'm describing is that it is a partner business that we have there in Retail Services. And what that means is that there's a sharing of the profits associated with the business that we generate. And so, what happens is in this rising rate environment, we've seen -- and the activity from a volume point of view, we've seen an increase in the net interest income that we've generated. And what that means is that there's more, fortunately, more profits to share with our partners. The sharing of those profits play through the noninterest revenue line. So, it comes out of -- comes out as a fee of the contra revenue as we share those with clients. So, that's the driver of the swing that you see happening there or the pressure that we have in PBWM as it relates to Retail Services. In terms of the Cards growth, the Cards growth, we feel very good about it. There certainly is an environmental dynamic that's playing out as it relates to consumers and corporates. But what I would say is that you've also heard us describing more marketing spend, more advertising spend, more acquisitions, 18% growth in acquisitions. We've been targeting growing our customer base there while staying within our risk appetite. The parameters that we've set have been very disciplined about. And that started to pay off. And that is part of what I described in terms of the loan growth that is materializing. There's nothing that we see of significance as we grow these loans that would suggest, one, that they're outside of the focus that we've had to date because they're not, nor that there's any material risk in terms of outsized losses. If you look at our loss rates, our loss rates are -- for Branded Cards, 1.5%; Retail Services, 2.6%. Those are 50% of what we would normally -- what we used to describe as a normal loss rate, NCL rate, through a cycle. And so, we feel very good about the loans that we're growing. There's obviously risk, but we also feel very good about the reserves that we have. There's a lot there. But I mean, I think what I'd say is a couple of things. One is, we've obviously seen a rapid increase in rates. And that -- the speed at which rates increases matters a lot as it relates to the betas. And so -- particularly on the wholesale corporate side. And so, we have seen betas increase there. They're probably at about to slightly a little bit better than we would have expected. But we would expect that momentum to continue in the back half of the year given the forecast for continued rate increases. The other thing that I'd point out, just giving you a point around the ability to forecast from a Citi point of view, if you look at the first half of the year, we did about -- I think it was $1.8 billion or so over the prior year, ex Markets. So NII, ex Markets, 1.8 billion year-over-year first half. To give you a bit more guidance on how we're thinking about it in light of the rate curve and in light of our mix, I'd tell you that I expect about another $1.8 billion or so in the back half. So, that's probably year-over-year, 8ish percent or so on a full year basis based on, again, our mix, our assumption around betas and our current assumptions around how the curve would likely play out. Let me pause there and see if Jane wants to add anything to that. Good point. Yes. I guess, let me kind of answer it in a more fulsome way, if you don't mind, and then I'll certainly make sure that I give you a sense for the contribution of what we expect from divestitures to the capital impact. So, again, there are a couple of drivers that are going to be important to us building to ultimately the 13% for as long as that is in place given the SCB. One is obviously the income generation. And we had a very strong quarter as it relates to income generation. I feel good about the back half of the year, as I've just given you some guidance on. The other is, don't forget, we've had 160 basis points on the two-year since the beginning of the year to the end of the first quarter in terms of rate increases, another 60 in the second quarter. And there's going to be -- there were AOCI impacts from that, 34 in the first quarter, and as we point out here, another 12 in the second. There's a pull to par that we expect to start to play out and continue to play out in the balance of the year. That's going to be an important factor. The third, as you've heard us mention is we've been working very hard to optimize our RWA, and we'll continue to do that. We paused the buybacks. That's a factor. And then, as you mentioned, the divestitures to close to $1.5 billion or so in Australia. I've talked about in the past about $4 billion for the year in terms of capital impact. I'm at about $3.5 billion with Australia is what I'm currently expecting. And so a little bit less than what I talked about before, in part because of some of the movement in terms of the timing of some of these closings, still feel good about it. Just it's a difficult market that we're managing through. So that $3.5 billion total should give you a sense for how that translates into a CET1 impact that we're expecting, at least through the balance of this year. And obviously, there'll be more to come as we continue to close out and -- sign and close out some of the remaining deals. Again, as you've heard us describe, the TTS franchise is core to our business. It provides obviously a network to the large multinational clients in over 90 countries. We manage the full swath of their working capital and cash management needs. We also provide trade financing for them and the vendors and partners. And this is essentially, in many ways, what differentiates our franchise from others. And not only is it in and of itself a core growing, high-returning business but is one of the businesses that is well-connected to the rest of the franchise when you think about the Markets business that we have and the FX that we manage on behalf of clients. And so, -- and this is a particularly relevant time for us to be engaged with those partners as they manage through supply chain issues. And we're there to again help them work through those things and provide them alternatives to their production and operations and similar-type services we provide to our investor client base from a Securities Services point of view. Look, the strategy here did not start with Investor Day. That is -- we obviously spent time with you talking about that. But, this has been a part of the franchise that we've been investing in on an ongoing basis. And it's important that we continue to do that, investments in technology, investments in onboarding of new clients and the services we provide and enhanced digital capabilities and the operations. So, all of those things, and some of that what you see here is those investments starting to pay off. Yes. Well said. Thank you. The $3.5 billion I referenced is all capital. So, all numerator impact is what I'm describing. It's both, the -- any premium that we get or impact, gain from sale as well as the RWA that we have allocated as part of that business. And so, that all kind of flows through from a numerator point of view. In the case of Australia, for example, that would include both, the RWA that we had attributed to that business as well as the CTA impact coming back into capital. So remember, we took a hit when we signed the deal associated with the CTA. I kept communicating that that would neutralize at -- when the deal was closed. In fact, it did and that contributes to the roughly $1.5 billion there. In terms of RWA optimization efforts, it's a continuous effort. We are constantly working through the balance sheet to make sure that it's allocated to clients who generate the highest prospect for growth and leverage the breadth of the franchise, and we're going to continue to do that. And I think we -- the team did a very good job in ICG and particularly in Markets this quarter in making sure that we made progress against the revenue to RWA metric that they've been using, which is a proxy for returns. They worked very closely with clients to manage the recycling of trading inventory in an optimal way to optimize collateral positions that -- and postings that we have to increase initial margins on derivative trading where that makes sense. And so, they've been actively working the balance sheet, and we're going to continue to do that. We want to be there to serve our clients, but we want to make sure that we are generating an appropriate return for the use of capital. Yes. Sure. So look, I mean, we are obviously going to take it quarter by quarter as it relates to buybacks and from a capital point of view. Again, without going through all of the things that reflect the environment that we're in, you can see the uncertainty that's out there. Obviously, the capital requirements with this SCB for the industry are higher. That's unfortunate. We feel as though the right amount of capital was in the industry already. We've got to manage to that. It's the right requirement. We're going to do that. But we'll -- SCB gives us the opportunity to take those decisions quarter-by-quarter. We're pausing for now. And next year, there'll be another DFAST process, and there'll be an SCB that comes out of that. And frankly, we should have the strength of higher PPNR that we've been generating to help contribute to what that outcome looks like. So, we'll take that quarter-by-quarter. In terms of risk-related to divestitures, again, we did highlight we're being very, very transparent with you all and with the world. And we do see some delays that we highlighted from our original schedule that's in the back of the presentation there. But, we feel very good about getting to closure there, and it's not an if, it's a when. And we feel like we're on track with the schedule that we've highlighted for you. Yes. Look, I mean, the 11.5 to 12 is consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day. And the medium term, as you know, Betsy, for us is three to five years. We've got a couple of things that we're working through, not the least of which are the divestitures. They will certainly contribute to that, but so will some of the other things that I've mentioned, including utilization of the DTA, the AOCI pullback and things of that sort. The divestitures certainly will help from an SCB point of view, but I think the stronger performance that we're seeing will aid in that as well. And importantly, the mix change that we expect to come from executing on our strategy, a mix towards more sustainable, predictable earnings, earnings that are coming from some of the areas of growth that we demonstrated this quarter like TTS and Securities Services, et cetera, et cetera. So there's time there. There's obviously a management buffer component of that that I think is certainly an important factor in consideration as we evolve our mix. And then, there's the G-SIB score. With not only a reduction in the divestitures that will impact peak-to-trough losses, there's also deposits that will go away with those and balance sheet evolution that will contribute to the reduction in G-SIB score as well. On the first point, when I think about the back half of the year in quantitative tightening, I do expect that we will see some continued deposit growth, as I mentioned earlier. The pressure from quantitative tightening, I think, will certainly play out over time. But again, our focus is on growing the operating deposits that we have with clients. And we think we've got good traction and ability to continue momentum with those operating deposits. And again, they put us in a position to really broaden the relationship with both, those multinational clients as well as with some of our commercial clients where we've been getting good growth in and momentum from. So yes, likely to be an impact across the industry, but we believe we can get some continued momentum, particularly on the operating deposits that we have with clients. In terms of Markets NII, I mean, you've got the European dividend that plays out in the second quarter. So that obviously is a factor there. And again, I'd point you to when we talk about Markets, I really like to talk about total revenues because the nature of the security and the trading and the activity that we do there can have an impact on NII and NIR. And what really matters is the total revenues that we're driving and generating out of that franchise. And as you can see, we did 25% growth in Markets revenue year-over-year. So, a very good quarter for the Markets team for sure. Sure. So, look, what we've been doing very actively since the beginning of the year and certainly in the quarter as well, has been working -- we've been working to bring down our exposure in Russia and specifically with the clients that we serve there. And so that direct exposure on -- in a local currency dials, we brought down by some $900 million or so in the quarter. We brought down and reduced the cash and deposits that we have by another $1.7 billion or so and then continued to bring down third-party related exposure by another $400 million. And that's been through working with clients to pay those exposures and loans down, and in some instances, giving them incentives to do so and incentives to move their deposits out as well. So, very active engagement from the team as it relates to that. What's happened with that is the mix of the exposure that we have or that remains has skewed towards the higher-quality names and towards the global subsidiaries that we have in the country. And so, with that mix shift to better quality names and the reduction in exposure, that's allowed for us to take down the reserves that we had related to the direct exposure in the quarter. And so, that has been, I think, good -- very good progress in terms of that reduction. It gets overshadowed a bit with the ruble impact, but we've made good progress and we're going to continue to actively do that. Approximately -- Jane, do you want to jump in on that? Jane, I think that's well said. The only thing I'd add is that the business is capital-light and is high-returning through the cycle, and so we see a lot of value there. We want to be prepared to ramp up when activity starts again. And as you said, it's quite strategic for us. Since you kind of wound me up on the Commercial Banking activity, I have to jump at it. We had, as you know, Jane, a very strong quarter in Commercial Banking. When I look at the revenue momentum there just kind of leveraging the breadth of the franchise, we're probably up 25% to 30% in revenues in that part of the business. And I know that's part of our -- as you know, that's part of our core growth strategy that we talked about at Investor Day. So, good momentum in that part of the franchise as well. Those synergies, yes. Yes. Jane, just to your point on reserves, just in the quarter, you saw we took a reserve build. That reserve build was in part driven by our view on the potential for some downside in light of everything that we're seeing and the concerns around recession. So we did take a bit of a build from a CECL point of view on reserves. And as Jane mentioned, we feel very good about our reserve levels and the $18 billion that we have associated with our franchise. If I can just add one thing to that, Jane. And Mike, I think you got to keep in mind that this is a very strong quarter for us. We feel very good about it, but it's just a quarter. Right? And we talked about at Investor Day a long-term strategy, and we gave you a sense for medium-term targets. And those things are going to be things that you hold us accountable between now and then, right? And so, this is one quarter. We feel great about it. We're certainly glad that you're recognizing it, but there's a lot more wood to chop. We're making a lot of investments in the franchise that we know are going to pay dividends in the future. And we look forward to kind of talking through continued progress in these KPIs. It won't always be a straight line, but we remain confident that we're going to get there. Look, I mean, each of the quarters obviously have different dynamics, different rate moves, different volume levels of volume growth and what have you. And so, there's certainly different volume levels between quarter one and quarter two. And I described kind of how rates would move between the quarters as well. And so, to simplify it and because there is appropriate interest in how we think about it on an ex Markets basis, I just gave you the annualization of the half and what it would mean for the full year. So, nothing that I would point out beyond what you would notice, which is differences in rates and volumes across the businesses."

        "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to Citi\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJen Landis: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in SEC filings. With that, I will turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Jen. And I\u2019d like to start by reiterating my appreciation to those of you who participated in our Investor Day last month. We greatly value the opportunity to walk you through our refreshed strategy and our plans for the next few years. Given how much time we spent on our strategy that day, today, we will be focusing on the quarter. Nonetheless, as we committed, we will keep you updated on our progress and you can see the latest report card on Slide 2. Today is also the first time we are reporting quarterly results under our new segmentation, which will help you track our efforts. I have got to say it feels like an understatement to say that a lot has happened since Investor Day. So I am going to talk about the macro environment first. And then after I talk about the quarter, I will discuss how we are handling Russia and Mark is also going to go through it in more detail. We have been on the front foot since the potential for war first emerged and we intend to remain so. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions it triggered unleashed an enormous supply shock on the world, further fueling inflation and placing global growth under considerable pressure. Back recently from seeing clients in Europe and the Middle East, it is security, energy, food, defense, cyber or operational resilience that has risen to the top of their strategic dialogue. The macro outlook for the rest of the year can only be described as complex and uncertain. And while my job is to prepare for all outcomes, our view is that strong nominal income growth and continuing momentum in the labor market will help support near-term growth in the U.S. economy in the face of inflationary pressures. But we expect material regional differences in the impact with economic growth in the individual consumer and businesses in Europe hit hardest. With central banks responding to inflation, we are entering a period of higher rates and a flatter U.S. yield curve. Energy and commodities are at the center of the storm globally, but we don\u2019t believe we are at the start of a new long super cycle and we do expect prices to fall to more normal levels. So, with that as a backdrop, I think the firm performed reasonably well this quarter. Earlier today, we reported net income of $4.3 billion, EPS of $2.02, and an RoTCE of 10.5%. These numbers include impacts related to the divestitures, so the underlying business performance was stronger to the tune of about 150 basis points of RoTCE. And let\u2019s turn to the performance of our five main reporting units. Well, given our emphasis on services, I am particularly pleased with our performance in Treasury and Trade Solutions, fee growth, trade loans and cross-border transactions buoyed by higher rates led to year-over-year revenue growth of 18%. Security Services also performed well despite the impact of markets with revenues up 6%. In our Markets business, our traders navigated a volatile environment quite well, aided by our mix with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and commodities. This led to revenues almost equal to the very active first quarter of 2021. As you might expect, Investment Banking is a different story. While our performance on the advisory side was respectable, I think we can perform a bit better in equity and debt capital markets going forward, even if the wallet remains smaller. Our pipelines are healthy and loan demand is on the rise. Having said that, we don\u2019t expect robust activity in the capital markets to resume in the industry, until the geopolitical situation and client sentiment improve. In U.S. Personal Banking, we continue to see signs of how healthy and resilient the consumer is through our cost of credit and their payment rates. We see good engagement through key drivers such as card loans and spend volume growth. So, we like where this business is headed. Geopolitics dampened performance in Global Wealth Management this quarter. While revenues improved in the U.S., our clients in Asia pulled back on new investments and something we saw in our Markets franchise as well. As you know, we are hiring bankers and enhancing our client offerings such as Citi Alliance, which we launched last month as a unique platform to support independent advisers. As a result of these efforts, we continue to add clients in both the private bank and in Citi Gold. Turning to capital, we returned $4 billion to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the first quarter. We now have about 6% fewer common shares outstanding than we did a year ago. At the same time, a sharp increase in interest rates negatively impacted our capital through OCI and largely caused our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to come in at 11.4% this quarter. I want to be upfront with you about the fact that the macro and geopolitical environment, which I spoke about, combined with the impacts of our divestitures, create both headwinds and tailwinds for our capital ratios this year. Now, whilst this will impact the level of our stock buybacks this year, we have a path to our year-end target of 12% and Mark is going to walk you through these details. And let me be clear, we remain committed to continuing to return excess capital to our shareholders. As you heard at Investor Day, we are focused on our transformation and we are making the investments in our infrastructure, risk and controls and also in our talent and our culture to modernize our bank and to make Citi a winning firm. I recognize that these investments impact our expenses and our returns in the short run. But I firmly believe that success here will not only lead to satisfying our regulatory obligations, but also to improving our competitiveness and our returns in the medium term. So far this year, we have announced new agreements to sell a further 7 consumer businesses in Asia and EMEA, the most recent of which were India and Bahrain. We are beginning the sales process in Mexico and there is significant interest in this iconic franchise. As you have heard me say, this is not an uncomplicated transaction, given we will be separating our operations in order to retain our institutional presence. We will take the time necessary to do this the right way and decide which transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders. And we will keep you posted on any developments concerning the three remaining markets: China, Poland and of course, Russia. We started to carefully reduce our operations in and our exposures to Russia in January and we benefited from being on the front foot here. We have been managing down our financial exposures both in level and composition and they are at a reasonable level, especially given the additional reserves we took during the quarter. We have also increased reserves for the second and third order impact of the war beyond Russia and Ukraine. And our intention to sell significant portions of our local business in Russia remains. We are in continuous communication with the U.S. government and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime. But I have run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine. I remain incredibly proud of how our people have risen to the occasion from every corner of our firm. Our people in Ukraine have kept our bank operating in the country, where they can help NGOs deliver aid on the ground and help society function as best as possible. And many of our colleagues have opened their homes to refugees and we will continue to help in anyway we can. So with all that is going on in the world, we remain laser focused on the execution of our strategy and our transformation. I expect macro environment to remain unpredictable to say the least in the backdrop of the war, which is equally tragic and unnecessary and a persistent pandemic. And I can speak to the last one personally, having just recovered from a brief encounter with COVID, as much as I would like to, I can\u2019t blame Paco for it. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark and then we will be delighted to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thank you, Jane and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses in Russia and end with the results of each segment. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we reported net income of $4.3 billion and an EPS of $2.02, with an RoTCE of 10.5% on $19.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are Asia consumer divestiture-related impacts that are detailed in the appendix of the presentation. In the quarter, total revenues decreased 2% as strength in net interest income driven by Services and PBWM was more than offset by lower non-interest revenue across businesses. That said, we continue to see strong performance in the key business drivers we shared on Investor Day, which I will walk you through in detail shortly. Total expenses of $13.2 billion increased 15% or 10% excluding the Asia divestiture-related impacts I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $755 million as net credit losses of $872 million were partially offset by a net ACL release. Embedded in the net ACL release is a Russia-related build of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes $1 billion related to exposure to Russia and about $900 million to account for the broader impact on the macro environment. This was more than offset by a release related to a COVID-19 uncertainty reserve, primarily in U.S. Personal Banking, given the continued resilience of the underlying portfolio, specifically in the U.S. As of today, we have about $17.9 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.35%. On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, we incurred some divestiture-related costs this quarter. These costs largely related to a goodwill write-down that we incurred in legacy franchises as part of our resegmentation and divestitures. It is important to note the goodwill impact is capital neutral. Excluding the divestiture-related costs, expenses increased by approximately 10%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about two-thirds related to the risks, controls, data and finance programs and approximately 30% of that is related to technology investments. About 2% of the increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers. In addition, we are investing in technology across services, wealth and cards. 1% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses largely in markets and cards and approximately 4% and was driven by inflation and other risk and control investments partially offset by productivity savings. Across all of these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 12% for the quarter. On Slide 6, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. As Jane mentioned, as of the end of the quarter, our remaining exposure to Russia stood at about $7.8 billion, down from $9.8 billion at year end. And importantly, the mix of the remaining exposure has changed and shifted in a positive way. We have reduced our direct Russia country risk exposure from $5.4 billion to about $3.7 billion, which consist of loans, AFS, derivatives and off balance sheet exposure. The remaining exposure, which previously totaled $4.4 billion, now totals $4.1 billion and consists of deposits and cash with the Central Bank, reverse repos and cross-border exposure. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $700 million, down from about $1 billion at year end. And the currency translation adjustment or CTA related to our net investment stands at $1 billion. And as I mentioned previously, we took credit reserves of about $1.9 billion, with about $1 billion for direct exposure to Russia and another approximately $900 million for broader impacts given the macro environment. So, we feel we have reserved prudently at this point. In the normal course of our planning and risk management, we run a range of stress scenarios and we have taken the same approach with our exposure to Russia. And as a result of the actions that we have taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios, our potential risk of loss is now estimated at approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down meaningfully from what I described at our Investor Day. On Slide 7, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $50 million on a sequential basis as interest income from loans as well as higher deposit spreads were partially offset by day count. Excluding day count, net interest income increased by approximately $290 million. Sequentially, net interest margin increased by 7 basis points as lower average deposits in services and higher interest income from loans were partially offset by balance sheet growth in Markets. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $370 million, driven by cards, deposits volumes and spreads as well as income from the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower net interest income in Markets and we grew average loans by approximately 3% in both ICG and PBWM. On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about 23% or $551 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. From a capital perspective, we ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 11.4% under both standardized and advanced approaches, with standardized remaining the binding ratio, down from 12.2% at year end. During the quarter, we adopted SACR and absorbed a significant impact from the sharp move in interest rates. We will go into more detail shortly on the drivers of capital in the quarter. However, it is important to note that despite these impacts, we continue to expect to manage to a CET1 ratio of 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GCIB surcharge increase to 3.5% at the beginning of 2023. We expect the combination of net income generation, DTA utilization and capital generated by the closing of several of the consumer exits in Asia to be sufficient to reach the 12% CET1 ratio by the end of the year. As we said at Investor Day, we are committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And as we see a pull to par in the investment portfolio, reversing that $4 billion interest rate driven impact, we would expect to be able to deploy that capital over time. And as you know, under the SCB framework and given the uncertain macro environment, we assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks and we will continue to do so throughout the year. For the second quarter, we expect only a modest amount of buybacks and we will evaluate that level throughout the quarter taking into account market conditions. On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 capital ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. As I just mentioned, our CET1 capital ratio ended the year at 12.2% as we have built capital to absorb the impact of SACR on our RWA. Post SACR adoption, our ratio stood at 11.8% as of January 1, 2022. Given the sizable impact of some of the drivers, I wanted to spend a minute to walk through the puts and takes this quarter and how we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of about 11.4%. First, we generated net income, which added 35 basis points. Second, over $4 billion of dividends and buybacks drove a reduction of about 36 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 35 basis point reduction. Fourth, the increase in disallowed DTA, largely driven by the reduction in CET1 due to the interest rate impact I just mentioned, drove another 15 basis point reduction. Finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of other factors, including a reduction in RWA. With all of that said, as I just mentioned, we have a path to a 12% CET1 capital ratio by year end and remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues decreased 2%, largely driven by Investment Banking partially offset by an increase in services revenue. And Markets declined slightly against a strong quarter last year. Expenses increased 13% driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and volume-related expenses partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was nearly $1 billion largely driven by a $1.5 billion build related to our exposures in Russia as well as the broader impact on the macro environment. And outside of Russia, we continue to see strong credit performance across our portfolio as clients\u2019 balance sheets remain healthy. This resulted in net income of $2.6 billion, down approximately 51% largely driven by the higher expenses and an ACL build versus a release in the prior year. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by trade finance. Average deposits grew 2% as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions and ICG delivered an RoTCE of 11.2%. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you each quarter. In Services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and a deepening with our existing clients and we expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 18%, driven by growth in net interest income as well as strong fee growth with both commercial and large corporate clients. And we continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 54%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees, and on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Securities Services revenues grew 6% as net interest income grew 17%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, and fee revenues grew 2% due to higher assets under custody. Overall markets revenues were down 2% versus a strong quarter last year. In the quarter, activity levels benefited from client repositioning and strong risk management in light of Fed actions and overall geopolitical uncertainty. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 1%. We saw strong client engagement, particularly with our corporate clients in FX and commodities, with our rates business also benefiting from higher volatility. Spread products were negatively impacted by less client activity. Equity Markets revenues were down 4% compared to a very strong prior year period. In the quarter, we saw strong equity derivatives performance and grew prime finance balances. Banking revenues, excluding gains or losses on loan hedges, were down 32% as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted activity in debt and equity capital markets. Investment Banking revenues were down 43%, driven by the contraction in capital markets activity, partially offset by growth in M&A. Corporate Lending revenues were down 6%, largely driven by lower average loans. Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues declined 1% as net interest income was more than offset by lower non-interest revenue. Expenses were up 14%, driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $376 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. We had a net release of over $1 billion of ACL related to COVID-19 uncertainty reserves. I would note that even after this release, we maintained over $9.8 billion in credit reserves against our U.S. cards portfolios or approximately 7.6% of total loans. This resulted in a net income decline of 23% and an RoTCE of just over 23%. Adjusting for the ACL release, RoTCE would have been approximately 13%. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Credit cards revenues declined 1% on higher average payment rates and higher acquisition and rewards costs as we continue to see attractive investment opportunities and strong customer engagement. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 24%, card spend volumes also up 24% and average loans up 7%. Retail services revenues were flat as higher net interest income was offset by higher partner payments, driven by improved credit performance. And we are seeing positive underlying drivers with spend up 14% and average loans up 1%. While payment rates remain elevated, we believe we have finally begun to see some normalization. As a result, interest earning balances in branded cards were relatively flat on a sequential basis, while Retail Services grew interest-earning balances by 3% sequentially despite seasonally lower card spending volumes. Retail banking revenues declined 6%, largely driven by lower mortgage originations. Wealth revenues declined 1%, driven by less client activity and investments, partially offset by higher deposits. Investment revenues declined as geopolitical tensions impacted the capital markets, which resulted in clients pulling back their trading activity, particularly in Asia. However, underlying drivers remain strong, with average deposits up 14%, average loans up 5%, client assets up 4% and client advisers up 6%. On Slide 14, we show results for the legacy franchises. Revenues declined 14%, driven by lower revenue across the exit markets, largely driven by the Korea wind down as well as the muted investment activity in Asia. Expenses were up 31%, largely driven by the goodwill impairment I mentioned earlier, but again, this is neutral to capital. Cost of credit was $160 million in the quarter, driven by net credit losses, and as a result, net income declined significantly. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased significantly, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses are down largely on lower compensation expenses. And to briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook, at this point, we still expect to see low single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit expense growth, both excluding divestiture-related impacts this year. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, there, how are you? Okay. So when I first looked at the reserve release, even including the $1.9 million Russian reserve, we\u2019re like, wait, what economic scenario they are writing to, because everybody else added provisions. But now that you\u2019ve given us some of the color, start to understand it. So it feels to me, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, you just were slower to release the COVID reserves, and it sounds like you still have a lot in the coffers with that 7.6% that you mentioned. So I just want to see if you can give a little more color between what you took reserves score? What you released reserves for? And if you tweaked your economic scenarios at all to get to the current reserve, if that\u2019s not too much to ask?\nJane Fraser: Glenn, [why don\u2019t] [ph] I kick off and I\u2019ll pass it to Mark. So you are absolutely right. We had taken a rather conservative approach to releasing our COVID-related reserves in the U.S. Personal Banking business last year compared to some. We were comfortable that this quarter, that was the appropriate thing to do given the state of COVID and the U.S. economy. And with \u2013 as you can see from the numbers, with a 2.35% ACL coverage ratio and with the ratio that we have in cards, 7.6% in particular, I\u2019m very comfortable that we have a prudent and appropriate reserve level. But let me hand it over to Mark for the down and the dirty.\nMark Mason: Yes. Good morning, Glenn, I think you captured it right in the sense we obviously did a build, a meaningful build related to Russia, the majority of the release was, in fact, tied to the COVID-19 management adjustment that Jane referenced. As we thought about these scenarios, as you know, we run a base scenario. We did tweak that a bit in bringing the GDP assumptions down from what they would have been in the fourth quarter, and that obviously also impacted kind of the outer years in our assumption. And the other piece is, when we look at the downside scenario, so our analysis for CECL is a combination of a base scenario and a downside scenario. Under the downside scenario, we did increase the severity of the downside to account for again a bit of the current environment that we\u2019re all managing through. So those puts and takes kind of netted out to what you see that we\u2019ve reported, which is a net release, but largely driven by those two drivers.\nJane Fraser: And I\u2019d just add in, as Mark talked about in his prepared remarks, we took an additional reserve of $900 million for the second and third order impacts of the war and the impacts on supply chains and other pieces that are \u2013 as we look forward, we were concerned about for the global economy. It\u2019s a huge source of uncertainty as to what that will be.\nMark Mason: Yes. That\u2019s part of the $1.9 billion, obviously. I would point out that when you look through at the underlying performance of the portfolio, they are still holding up quite nicely when you look at the performance of our consumer customers, whether you\u2019re looking at the NCL rate and where that\u2019s trending or you look at the 90-day delinquency and where that\u2019s trending still very strong. Even when you look on the corporate side, if you adjust for the Russia-related build and those drove a bit of the NAL increase, but still very strong performance there, too.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: I just wanted to ask you a question, Jane and Mark on CET1. And wanted to make sure we get your investors get the message correctly. So from the 11.4, you said that net income capital release from divestitures and DTA utilization are going to be the drivers to build a 12% CET1 by year-end 2021. Obviously, AOCI is a wildcard, unpredictable. Perhaps give us a sense of should we then think about the buyback as just a fallout in terms of that equation, right? Is the first question. Number two, what is the desire to increase the dividend even nominally in this stress test year? And third, how does the DTA impact that was negative in the first quarter turned to a positive impact? And Mark, nice job on the RWA. I think that everybody was scared if that was going to be a big negative number this quarter.\nMark Mason: Thank you. You got a lot there, that we\u2019ve got to unpack. So I\u2019ll try to capture it all and you\u2019ll point to whatever I may miss. But let\u2019s start with the beginning of your question, just kind of the 12% and how we build back up to the 12%. So we ended the quarter at an estimated 11.4 to get to the 12%, that would be somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion of capital that will be required. Jane mentioned, I mentioned there are a number of puts and takes that play through that. You pointed out a few of them. So you all have estimates for our net income between the second and fourth quarter. So you can forecast that what that would be. There is probably another $1.6 billion or-so of a benefit from the DTA. So what I mean by that, there is the $800 million that I\u2019ve referenced in the past of utilization of the DTA. And the balance would be the elimination of the amount that we tripped above the threshold this quarter. So there are two components that carry forwards that impact the DTA. And then there is the timing difference, which has equated to about 10% of our capital. So this quarter, we actually tripped that timing difference portion of the disallowed DTA, in part because of how the OCI reduction play through. So as that bleeds back in over time, we would expect to have capital buildup, which increases that threshold and therefore, be able to back off the increase that we saw in the quarter related to the DTA. The third component would be the capital from exits. So you didn\u2019t mention that one. As you know, there are a number of exits that we\u2019re looking to close at the end of the year \u2013 by the end of the year, they\u2019ll contribute about $4 billion of capital to that equation. And then there is the bleeding back in of the OCI impact, which will give or take, give us another $1 billion. So those are the pluses. Those are the things that kind of play in on the on the capital generation side. And then on the offsets, you\u2019ve got preferred dividends, you\u2019ve got common dividends, whatever growth we play out or put to work from an RWA point of view, and that leaves the balance for share repurchases. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect in the second quarter, a modest level of buybacks in light of all of those puts and takes. The good news is that the headwinds that we\u2019ve talked about, all things being equal, so assuming no further rate changes, many of those headwinds bleed back in over time, allowing for us to do what we\u2019ve committed to, which is returning capital to shareholders over time. In terms of dividends, we always look at that as part of the CCAR submission and part of our broader capital planning, but I\u2019ll \u2013 we will see how the results come out from CCAR, but I would lean in on a point we\u2019ve had to make a number of times now, which is given where we\u2019re trading, it makes a lot of sense to be doing buybacks. And so we will likely continue to lean that way as opposed to doing a lot to change the dividend. But stay tuned as the capital planning continues to evolve.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Could you talk some about Treasury and Trade Solutions, both at the first quarter level? I guess, security services did better, what you are seeing is a combination of rates and more corporate demand and the complexity around the global situation? And then just more generally, the joint calling efforts you guys are doing with lending and payments, so specific to the general.\nJane Fraser: Well, maybe I\u2019ll kick off with a couple of pieces and then hand it over to Mark. I think what we\u2019ve seen, frankly, Mike, across the board this quarter has been the value of our global network that we talked about, be it in Markets, we had a lot of strong corporate activity and FX, that we saw tremendous activity for TTS, great with our commercial banking clients, and we saw a lot of linkages across. And obviously, it was a strong quarter for us in trade because again, with the global network, the ability to provide clients with end-to-end solutions in this interesting world that we\u2019re living in is something they really rely upon us. So you saw trade loans up 16%. You saw really many of the drivers that we laid out for you at Investor Day performing particularly strongly. But Mark, why don\u2019t I pass to you?\nMark Mason: Yes. I\u2019d make a couple of comments. So one, I\u2019d point out that, again, we had a strong quarter in TTS. The revenues were up 18% versus the prior quarter up \u2013 that was year-over-year versus the prior quarter up 8%. And yes, some of that was due to rates playing through. So, net interest income was up 18%, but would look at the non-interest revenue that was up 19%. So to your point, Jane, we\u2019re seeing good fee revenue growth play through as well. Security Services had a good quarter. It was up 66% revenue year-over-year and part of that was through fee revenue growth as well. So as you said, good, strong engagement with clients and helping them think through some of the uncertainty that\u2019s out here, particularly as it relates to supply chains, helping them work through with their partners through the trade lending growth that we\u2019re seeing and making good headway with the commercial client offering as well. So I would say a very good quarter, a very strong quarter for TTS, and we expect that momentum to continue.\nJane Fraser: And to your question about sort of joint calling effort, we\u2019re quite making sure that we\u2019re forensically managing the synergies that we talked about cross calling efforts. And I think Paco and I are both pleased with how those are going. And this quarter was an example of that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Hi. I was hoping to follow-up on the Russian slide here, update on Russian Slide 6. I guess first question, why don\u2019t you take just a bigger kind of stab at reserving for maybe the severe stress scenario? I\u2019m not really an expert on what\u2019s going on. But from what I read, it feels kind of pretty severe and it seems like broadly speaking, kind of other corporations, not necessarily banks, but just corporations are taking kind of more material losses versus a $1 billion on $10 billion? And then just a related question, if you could elaborate on what the broader impact is? I guess I\u2019m a little surprised that the reserve for that was as big as the direct Russian reserve were roughly the same?\nMark Mason: Sure. Why don\u2019t I take that? So the first thing I\u2019d say is that we\u2019re not at 10, right? So we ended the year last year, 2021 at $9.8 billion. We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure. So we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside of the last 3 months. I\u2019d also point out that a number of things were important components of that. So if you look at Slide 6, you\u2019ll see that the loans, and these are both ICG and consumer loans, largely ICG, largely corporate loans have come down by $600 million. And that\u2019s really been a reduction in our risk exposure, right? So borrowers paying down, us limiting the extension of new credit, etcetera. The AFS securities have come down $600 million. And that is really a reduction mostly driven by sales. So we\u2019ve gotten out of those securities. Yes, there are some mark-to-market losses, but they are not material. That flows through OCI, not material. You can see that the off-balance sheet unfunded commitments have trended down as well. Deposits and cash equivalents have gone up because we\u2019ve actually seen the repayment of those loans come back, and we\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019ve had to put that cash with the Central Bank just given some of the restrictions that are there. We\u2019ve been actively working down the reverse repo assets, which are really secured with sovereign bond exposure. And we\u2019ve been bringing down the third-party cross-border exposure. So a lot of hard work has gone into bringing that exposure down to 7.8%. And if you think about the $1 billion that I referenced is kind of a net of $6.8 billion, right? So the second part of your question was, how do we think about reserves and what are those different components. Well, we look at the reserves in terms of the actual name-specific loan exposure we have, how we\u2019re rating those entities in this environment. And then we actually run that through our models and we come up with an appropriate reserve tied to that rating. So that $1 billion is related to the direct exposure that we have to these Russian clients and entities, the broader impact takes into consideration the spillover effect that might impact other names or other industries outside of Russia due to things like commodity pricing and what have you. And then there is a third component that is tied to the global uncertainty that gets created from a dynamic like this. So we built the reserves considering those multiple components. The last point I\u2019d make is that, when you look at some of the names, there are a significant number of names that are large multinational names that have this exposure in the country and they provide parental support for some of the exposure that\u2019s here as well. So we really try to take a detailed comprehensive look at this and build the reserves in a way that we think are prudent recognizing that there are other scenarios that could play out that we want to be prepared for and have a view on as well.\nOperator: And our next question \u2013 thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark.\nMark Mason: Hi. Good morning.\nJane Fraser: Hi.\nGerard Cassidy: Mark, you did a good job in describing the CET1 ratio walk for us. What\u2019s new that none of us have experienced yet on an ongoing basis. Is the SACR, the 49 basis points that reduced your CET1 ratio? Can you share with us how does that work on an ongoing basis? Is that a number that\u2019s going to stay constant or does that change every quarter based upon increase or lower risk in this area?\nMark Mason: It\u2019s an increase in our risk-weighted assets that\u2019s really tied largely to the derivative exposures that we have. What I would say is, obviously, how one manages their exposures and balance sheet and engagement with clients will impact that. But importantly, it\u2019s a market dynamic that needs to play out as well. So, as more RWA and capital is required for these types of positions, there has to \u2013 it\u2019s going to impact returns, and it ultimately will impact pricing as the market starts to incorporate this now higher requirement. And so it will continue to evolve. The thing I would point you to is that as we think about managing our businesses and in particular markets. You would have heard us mention at Investor Day that we are looking \u2013 continually looking for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet, optimize RWA, right. And so we talked about targeting a revenue to RWA for our markets business, and we are actively working at that now. And that\u2019s going to be important as we continue to manage not only the balance sheet requirements that we have, but our intent to try and return more capital to shareholders and improve our returns.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning Jane and Mark.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Just sticking with capital, two-part question. One, if it continued to move higher, Mark, is there anything you can do to hedge the AOCI? And secondly, if you can walk us through around Banamex, if you do strike a deal at some point this year, what are the implications on capital at deal announcement versus deal close? I would appreciate that.\nMark Mason: Sure. So look, I mean there \u2013 what we have built in \u2013 what we have got built into the forecast and the walk back to 12% is the forward curve as of the end of the quarter. So, that\u2019s what we have built in. As we think about that, that was a pretty sudden move through the quarter of 160 basis points on the 2-year in the quarter. That\u2019s now in the expectation. We have built in an assumption around more rate moves that could happen just as a bit of cushion as I think about the outlook and as I think about the walk. We do have hedges in place as it relates to some of the positions that we have and as it relates to OCI, and we will continue to manage that to ensure we reduce the risk from rate increases, which, by the way, we have been actively doing over the past couple of years. If you look at kind of how the balance sheet has evolved, we have been moving from out of AFS and into held to maturity over the past couple of years, reducing that risk of a negative impact to OCI. And if you look at the DVO 1, we have cut that down from as high as $60 million to about $30 million or so. So, we have been actively managing with an eye towards how do we reduce that sensitivity if you will. Why don\u2019t I let Jane kind of touch on the Mexico piece.\nJane Fraser: Yes. So, as I said, it\u2019s quite a complex separation and transaction as we are going to be separating our market-leading and sizable ICG franchise in Mexico from the consumer and the small business that we will be selling. It will take a bit of time as we work through this. It\u2019s a fantastic franchise. And as we are starting some very preliminary conversations with the buyers, it\u2019s attracting a lot of attention. Because it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here, and we have a range of options, I am sure, ahead from IPO sale, etcetera. But this is going to take time. We want to do it properly. And by time, I mean a few quarters. So, I think we are not anticipating at this very early stage, whether that would be this year or early next year. But Mark, why did I pass to you in terms of how we look at the CTA impact of that one?\nMark Mason: Yes. So look, I mean as you said, Jane, what\u2019s going to be important is that we make the right decision for the people, for the business and equally important for our shareholders, and we are going to absolutely make sure we do that. In terms of the way this plays out is I think you are aware and I have mentioned before that we have got roughly $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion currency translation adjustment related to our consumer Mexico franchise. And so when we sign the deal, we will have that flow through the P&L ultimately gets offset at closing. And so again, you would have another timing difference between the accounting impact and the ultimate economic impact, but that\u2019s kind of the component that would play through it signing whenever that were to occur.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: A couple of questions. One, a little bit ticky-picky, but on your NIM sensitivity that you have given the 10-Q, 10-K, it would be helpful to understand how much of that NIM sensitivity is coming from the non-legacy businesses? How much of that NIM sensitivity is going to be retained after you sell out the businesses that you have identified?\nMark Mason: Yes. I don\u2019t have that breakout, Betsy. I mean I \u2013 we will have to kind of get back to you. I don\u2019t have that breakout.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, Mark, Jane, a quick question, probably more for Mark. The RWA increased from the higher volatility that you would have seen in your trading assets in the first quarter? What was the offset to that?\nMark Mason: So, look, in the first quarter, the major driver that we have seen is really on the credit risk side from an RWA point of view, and that was really tied to SACR. That\u2019s the biggest driver of the fourth quarter, the first quarter RWA increase that we have seen. So, the RWA from a market risk point of view was mostly flat due to reductions in trading book securitizations, that was kind of \u2013 those are the kind of the main drivers there.\nJane Fraser: And what I would say is, and you certainly heard this loud and clear from Paco at Investor Day, a lot of the strategy here is also making sure that we are optimizing our capital. We are very mindful around the returns that we are generating and how we allocate and deploy capital. And this is a quarter that Andy and Paco is running the businesses have been very mindful around that. So, that also helped.\nMark Mason: Yes. So, like I said, securitizations would be an offset as would some of the equity derivatives.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good morning. So, it was encouraging certainly to hear you guys reaffirm the \u201822 guidance for low-single digit revenue growth, mid-single digit expense growth. But just given the positive surprise on revenues in the quarter, the number of rate hikes getting baked into the forward curve has increased since your last update. I wanted to get some perspective on just why you didn\u2019t revise the revenue forecast higher? And just given the pace and timing of investments, as we look ahead to 2023 and beyond, how should we think about the timing for when you guys can get back to positive operating leverage?\nMark Mason: Yes. Look, on the \u2013 let me kind of take that. So, on the revenue side, as you would have heard us describe, there have been puts and takes that have played through the quarter, and there is still a fair amount of uncertainty that\u2019s out there. And so while there have been increases as it relates to rates, and we have seen and expect to see some benefit play through for that, there has also been an impact on banking revenues as we see the uncertainty creating a dynamic where corporate clients are pausing, particularly as it relates to equity capital markets and debt capital markets. And so as I mentioned, there are offsets that play out. And so we felt comfortable kind of maintaining the guidance on the revenue top line. In terms of the expenses, as I mentioned at Investor Day, the spend that we have going on in expenses is critically important. And we are still growing them as it relates to transformation and as it relates to business-led investments. On the business-led investment side, the good news is that we are starting to see some of the top line strength play out, not just driven by rates, but also driven by things like fees, which is what we forecasted. On the transformation side, we continue to make progress. And we have talked about how critically important that is to our operations going forward. We expect that, that will peak or arc, if you will, as we talked about at Investor Day, and that will occur in the near-term and will be an important offset, if you will, to the structural expense base that we have as the efficiencies from those spending \u2013 from that spending, excuse me, plays through.\nJane Fraser: And just to chip in as well, we are committed to the investments on our transformation and on our growth. We think they are both critically important. We are equally committed to managing our expense base prudently and forensically. And I think the piece there, if there is any comfort from our numbers is we are getting on with it. We are not hanging around here. You have seen us do that with the divestitures. We are doing the same on our transformation and on our investment side, getting very focused on making sure we deliver the results you would expect from them. You will see something similar when we start divesting and closing the different transactions, and we will talk to you about what we are doing on getting those \u2013 any stranded expenses out and getting focused on that. So, you can expect us to see us going pretty aggressively after different elements of our cost base as the timing is appropriate.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Ken Uston with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken please check your mute button. Next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nJim Mitchell: Hey. Good morning Mark and Jane. Maybe just a question on \u2013 just following up with the last question, do you have a specific update for NII growth this year, given the forward curve is substantially higher than 100 basis points? And how you are thinking about NII overall? And then as a subset of that, how do we think about your deposit base or mostly your more institutional deposit base acting in an aggressive QT environment? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Yes, sure. Look, I am not giving kind of guidance kind of broken out, if you will, for the revenues. We are standing by the full year guidance that we have talked about. Obviously, with rates moving the way that they have, we would expect that we would see some improvement on the NII line, but I haven\u2019t given specific guidance broken out for the two lines. In terms of the deposit base we have, as you know, we have got a mix of consumer and corporate client deposits. We skew a bit more heavily towards the corporate client deposit base. That comes with \u2013 generally comes with a higher beta. And so they are likely to be more reactive to and reactive sooner to the increase in interest rates. And quantitative tightening will certainly have a longer term impact on the level of deposits that\u2019s out there. But with that said, our plans both in the near-term and as we have played out the Investor Day forecast, don\u2019t hinge upon significant growth in deposits. We would expect some growth, but growth consistent with kind of pre-pandemic levels, but that\u2019s not outsized growth, and we believe our strategy, which is broader than just going after deposits, but really is around solutions for corporate clients and the full spectrum of financial services for the consumers that we focus on will allow for us to capture an appropriate level consistent with how the economy evolves.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Actually, Chubac and Jim asked my question. I think it might be helpful to consider, Mark for next quarter to break out the NII guide, given the \u2013 obviously, the uncertainty that we all have on forecasting trading and investment banking? Thanks so much.\nMark Mason: Thanks, Erika.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. I just wanted to ask about how you are thinking about the U.S. card business. This is an area where it feels like in some areas, you have been lagging a bit and in other areas accelerating. And I just wanted to get a sense as to how you are thinking about the trajectory this year in particular, since it\u2019s one of the better margin businesses that you have got, and it also obviously keys into the reserve ratio a bit? Thanks.\nJane Fraser: Yes. I am surprised you thought we were lagging because we don\u2019t \u2013 we certainly don\u2019t see that. I have been really pleased with how the cards franchise has been performing on multiple different drivers on client acquisition, on the spend, on some of the new propositions that we have been bringing in. You heard from Anand about the growth on proprietary cards. The installment lending growth, 75% up, albeit from a small base this quarter. So, there are multiple different dimensions. So, I think it\u2019s \u2013 we are very pleased to see the business actually picking up. And as I said, Betsy in my prepared remarks, I like where the business is headed. I think part of it is I am more positive around the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer than really any other geographies around the world. And that helps with so much momentum in the labor market. We are seeing still quite a bit of excess liquidity sitting there in the back pocket of our consumers and very healthy balance sheet. I think we have peaked in the payment rates. So, we are just starting to see the first signs of that coming down. And I think that\u2019s good because it\u2019s a return to be \u2013 it should be the return this year to a more healthy behavior. The spend has obviously been quite remarkable. It\u2019s up in the mid-20%. Also great to see the experience side and that services side coming back in again. And that\u2019s we have been seeing it in travel. We have been seeing it in apparel. People like getting dressed up to go to dinner again in a restaurant. Those different things, it\u2019s nice to see things coming back to normality. So, I am pretty positive both from cyclically where this is headed, the recovery from COVID, where it\u2019s headed. And I am also pretty happy with the strategy that Anand laid out and the progress we are making against it. So, I think some good things ahead here.\nMark Mason: Yes. And the only thing I would add is a couple of numbers, right. So, the sales are up 24% year-over-year, exceeding pre-pandemic levels across the categories. Acquisitions are up 23% year-over-year. Again, bringing on new card customers into our family, if you will. Revenues are down 2%, but you really have to look through the investments that we are making in acquisitions and the rewards costs associated with those that impact that revenue being down 2%. If you adjust for the acquisition costs, actually, our revenues would be up 1% year-over-year. So, I agree completely with you, Jane, which is we are very pleased with the progress here. We are seeing similar momentum start to play through on the retail services side as well. The sequential performance on average interest earning balances is a good signal for how things will play out. And we continue to feel good about the growth we forecasted towards the back half of the year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Lim with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open.\nAndrew Lim: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I get the impression that maybe keep you are surprised by your NII guidance because in the past, you have officially given it as based on a runoff balance sheet or is it appears based on a static balance sheet. And I think you mentioned a few quarters ago that if it was on the same basis, static balance sheet that your NII uplift will be about $2.5 billion to $3 billion for 100 basis point parallel shift. Is that something you are still sticking to? And then within the shape of that, how much was that is due to the short-term increasing by 100 basis points? I think you are much more sensitive to the short-term going up. Is that something that you can disclose a rough figure on?\nMark Mason: Sure. And good morning and I would like to separate kind of NII guidance from the IRE sensitivity and disclosure that we have. And so you are absolutely right, and I am not moving \u2013 we are not moving off of our IRE disclosure at all. The analysis is such that with a parallel shift in rates of about 100 basis points that we see somewhere around $2.5 billion to $3 billion of an increase kind of play through. And as you know, as I have said before, that\u2019s cross currencies, with about two-thirds of that being to non-U.S. currencies and the other third obviously being U.S. So, that is still our view from an ROE point of view. We are not \u2013 we haven\u2019t changed that view.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi, a follow-up. I guess this is not new, but the expenses are just so high, and we haven\u2019t heard the 4% inflation number from others and, maybe others are able to offset that a little bit more. And the 1% due to volume-related when Jane, you mentioned you don\u2019t expect this level of capital markets to be sustained. So, I guess I am just \u2013 I am grappling about something that\u2019s been around for a while. I get it. You have the right order, you have the transformation, you have business sales. You said you underinvested in the past and everything else. But I mean, you have 1,200 basis points between your expense and revenue growth and just seems so high. But you are also guiding for what I think is like 300 basis points of that spread for the full year. So, does that mean this is as bad as it gets, and that spread should be narrowed? And just some of those other inflation, volume expenses, expenses generally because it\u2019s frustrating for investors.\nMark Mason: Yes. So, why don\u2019t I take that and kind of try and talk through it. So, the first thing I would say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance. I just want to be clear that at Investor Day, that\u2019s what we talked about. We would love for the number to be different, but we understand and we know that this is what\u2019s required to get the franchise to where it needs to be. And so we are taking those hard decisions. We are spending the money where we need to spend it. We are being diligent about that to make sure that we are not being wasteful in that effort. But we don\u2019t want to create or go through the things that we have gone through in the past in the way of under-investing. And so we are going to avoid that. The second thing is, and you acknowledge that kind of in your reference to transformation and business-led investments. On the structural investments spend, I should say, about half of that is from inflation, so not the full 4%. A portion of it is also from non-consent order risk and control spend that we are making, things like the financial crime unit, things like cyber spend, things like the work we are doing around our wholesale credit operations, important things. And there are some productivity savings that play through that. And then the final piece on the volume related is their transactional costs that are associated with the activity that we do on the trading side, their spend that we make in order to drive that activity. And the mix matters. And so while revenues kind of play out in one way for the quarter, the mix of the market\u2019s activity impacts the level of volume-related expenses that\u2019s generated through those transactions. So, those are a couple of things. Again, we are consistent with guidance. We believe we are on track for the guidance we gave for the full year of mid-single digits. And we are looking forward to generating the efficiencies that come out of this spend and put a dent in our structural expense base over time.\nJane Fraser: Yes. And let me jump in as well, Mike, because this is something Mark and I have \u2013 we are very, very aware of. We are managing it in excruciating detail on multiple dimensions. We are taking the lessons that we have got \u2013 we have got to take some of the short-term pain here in order to get us into the position we need to be in the medium-term and the long-term. And from be it the stranded costs and the divestitures, we know we will have opportunities there. We talked about Investor Day also being in a position to simplify the management structure and take out some of the structural expenses there. So, this is going to be an area of continued focus from Mark and I, that we make sure that not only are we managing the arc and ensuring there is one, but also that we generate the benefits from our shareholders from all of this. And it\u2019s something I feel exceedingly high accountability for as does the management team. We get it.\nOperator: And there are no more further questions, I will turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\nJen Landis: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to IR. Enjoy the day. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes Citi\u2019s first quarter earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen. And I'd like to start by reiterating my appreciation to those of you who participated in our Investor Day last month. We greatly value the opportunity to walk you through our refreshed strategy and our plans for the next few years. Given how much time we spent on our strategy that day, today, we will be focusing on the quarter. Nonetheless, as we committed, we will keep you updated on our progress and you can see the latest report card on Slide 2. Today is also the first time we are reporting quarterly results under our new segmentation, which will help you track our efforts. I have got to say it feels like an understatement to say that a lot has happened since Investor Day. So I am going to talk about the macro environment first. And then after I talk about the quarter, I will discuss how we are handling Russia and Mark is also going to go through it in more detail. We have been on the front foot since the potential for war first emerged and we intend to remain so. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions it triggered unleashed an enormous supply shock on the world, further fueling inflation and placing global growth under considerable pressure. Back recently from seeing clients in Europe and the Middle East, it is security, energy, food, defense, cyber or operational resilience that has risen to the top of their strategic dialogue. The macro outlook for the rest of the year can only be described as complex and uncertain. And while my job is to prepare for all outcomes, our view is that strong nominal income growth and continuing momentum in the labor market will help support near-term growth in the U.S. economy in the face of inflationary pressures. But we expect material regional differences in the impact with economic growth in the individual consumer and businesses in Europe hit hardest. With central banks responding to inflation, we are entering a period of higher rates and a flatter U.S. yield curve. Energy and commodities are at the center of the storm globally, but we don't believe we are at the start of a new long super cycle and we do expect prices to fall to more normal levels. So, with that as a backdrop, I think the firm performed reasonably well this quarter. Earlier today, we reported net income of $4.3 billion, EPS of $2.02, and an RoTCE of 10.5%. These numbers include impacts related to the divestitures, so the underlying business performance was stronger to the tune of about 150 basis points of RoTCE. And let's turn to the performance of our five main reporting units. Well, given our emphasis on services, I am particularly pleased with our performance in Treasury and Trade Solutions, fee growth, trade loans and cross-border transactions buoyed by higher rates led to year-over-year revenue growth of 18%. Security Services also performed well despite the impact of markets with revenues up 6%. In our Markets business, our traders navigated a volatile environment quite well, aided by our mix with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and commodities. This led to revenues almost equal to the very active first quarter of 2021. As you might expect, Investment Banking is a different story. While our performance on the advisory side was respectable, I think we can perform a bit better in equity and debt capital markets going forward, even if the wallet remains smaller. Our pipelines are healthy and loan demand is on the rise. Having said that, we don't expect robust activity in the capital markets to resume in the industry, until the geopolitical situation and client sentiment improve. In U.S. Personal Banking, we continue to see signs of how healthy and resilient the consumer is through our cost of credit and their payment rates. We see good engagement through key drivers such as card loans and spend volume growth. So, we like where this business is headed. Geopolitics dampened performance in Global Wealth Management this quarter. While revenues improved in the U.S., our clients in Asia pulled back on new investments and something we saw in our Markets franchise as well. As you know, we are hiring bankers and enhancing our client offerings such as Citi Alliance, which we launched last month as a unique platform to support independent advisers. As a result of these efforts, we continue to add clients in both the private bank and in Citi Gold. Turning to capital, we returned $4 billion to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the first quarter. We now have about 6% fewer common shares outstanding than we did a year ago. At the same time, a sharp increase in interest rates negatively impacted our capital through OCI and largely caused our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to come in at 11.4% this quarter. I want to be upfront with you about the fact that the macro and geopolitical environment, which I spoke about, combined with the impacts of our divestitures, create both headwinds and tailwinds for our capital ratios this year. Now, whilst this will impact the level of our stock buybacks this year, we have a path to our year-end target of 12% and Mark is going to walk you through these details. And let me be clear, we remain committed to continuing to return excess capital to our shareholders. As you heard at Investor Day, we are focused on our transformation and we are making the investments in our infrastructure, risk and controls and also in our talent and our culture to modernize our bank and to make Citi a winning firm. I recognize that these investments impact our expenses and our returns in the short run. But I firmly believe that success here will not only lead to satisfying our regulatory obligations, but also to improving our competitiveness and our returns in the medium term. So far this year, we have announced new agreements to sell a further 7 consumer businesses in Asia and EMEA, the most recent of which were India and Bahrain. We are beginning the sales process in Mexico and there is significant interest in this iconic franchise. As you have heard me say, this is not an uncomplicated transaction, given we will be separating our operations in order to retain our institutional presence. We will take the time necessary to do this the right way and decide which transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders. And we will keep you posted on any developments concerning the three remaining markets: China, Poland and of course, Russia. We started to carefully reduce our operations in and our exposures to Russia in January and we benefited from being on the front foot here. We have been managing down our financial exposures both in level and composition and they are at a reasonable level, especially given the additional reserves we took during the quarter. We have also increased reserves for the second and third order impact of the war beyond Russia and Ukraine. And our intention to sell significant portions of our local business in Russia remains. We are in continuous communication with the U.S. government and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime. But I have run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine. I remain incredibly proud of how our people have risen to the occasion from every corner of our firm. Our people in Ukraine have kept our bank operating in the country, where they can help NGOs deliver aid on the ground and help society function as best as possible. And many of our colleagues have opened their homes to refugees and we will continue to help in anyway we can. So with all that is going on in the world, we remain laser focused on the execution of our strategy and our transformation. I expect macro environment to remain unpredictable to say the least in the backdrop of the war, which is equally tragic and unnecessary and a persistent pandemic. And I can speak to the last one personally, having just recovered from a brief encounter with COVID, as much as I would like to, I can't blame Paco for it. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark and then we will be delighted to take your questions. Glenn, [why don't] [ph] I kick off and I'll pass it to Mark. So you are absolutely right. We had taken a rather conservative approach to releasing our COVID-related reserves in the U.S. Personal Banking business last year compared to some. We were comfortable that this quarter, that was the appropriate thing to do given the state of COVID and the U.S. economy. And with \u2013 as you can see from the numbers, with a 2.35% ACL coverage ratio and with the ratio that we have in cards, 7.6% in particular, I'm very comfortable that we have a prudent and appropriate reserve level. But let me hand it over to Mark for the down and the dirty. And I'd just add in, as Mark talked about in his prepared remarks, we took an additional reserve of $900 million for the second and third order impacts of the war and the impacts on supply chains and other pieces that are \u2013 as we look forward, we were concerned about for the global economy. It's a huge source of uncertainty as to what that will be. Well, maybe I'll kick off with a couple of pieces and then hand it over to Mark. I think what we've seen, frankly, Mike, across the board this quarter has been the value of our global network that we talked about, be it in Markets, we had a lot of strong corporate activity and FX, that we saw tremendous activity for TTS, great with our commercial banking clients, and we saw a lot of linkages across. And obviously, it was a strong quarter for us in trade because again, with the global network, the ability to provide clients with end-to-end solutions in this interesting world that we're living in is something they really rely upon us. So you saw trade loans up 16%. You saw really many of the drivers that we laid out for you at Investor Day performing particularly strongly. But Mark, why don't I pass to you? And to your question about sort of joint calling effort, we're quite making sure that we're forensically managing the synergies that we talked about cross calling efforts. And I think Paco and I are both pleased with how those are going. And this quarter was an example of that. Hi. Yes. So, as I said, it's quite a complex separation and transaction as we are going to be separating our market-leading and sizable ICG franchise in Mexico from the consumer and the small business that we will be selling. It will take a bit of time as we work through this. It's a fantastic franchise. And as we are starting some very preliminary conversations with the buyers, it's attracting a lot of attention. Because it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here, and we have a range of options, I am sure, ahead from IPO sale, etcetera. But this is going to take time. We want to do it properly. And by time, I mean a few quarters. So, I think we are not anticipating at this very early stage, whether that would be this year or early next year. But Mark, why did I pass to you in terms of how we look at the CTA impact of that one? And what I would say is, and you certainly heard this loud and clear from Paco at Investor Day, a lot of the strategy here is also making sure that we are optimizing our capital. We are very mindful around the returns that we are generating and how we allocate and deploy capital. And this is a quarter that Andy and Paco is running the businesses have been very mindful around that. So, that also helped. And just to chip in as well, we are committed to the investments on our transformation and on our growth. We think they are both critically important. We are equally committed to managing our expense base prudently and forensically. And I think the piece there, if there is any comfort from our numbers is we are getting on with it. We are not hanging around here. You have seen us do that with the divestitures. We are doing the same on our transformation and on our investment side, getting very focused on making sure we deliver the results you would expect from them. You will see something similar when we start divesting and closing the different transactions, and we will talk to you about what we are doing on getting those \u2013 any stranded expenses out and getting focused on that. So, you can expect us to see us going pretty aggressively after different elements of our cost base as the timing is appropriate. Yes. I am surprised you thought we were lagging because we don't \u2013 we certainly don't see that. I have been really pleased with how the cards franchise has been performing on multiple different drivers on client acquisition, on the spend, on some of the new propositions that we have been bringing in. You heard from Anand about the growth on proprietary cards. The installment lending growth, 75% up, albeit from a small base this quarter. So, there are multiple different dimensions. So, I think it's \u2013 we are very pleased to see the business actually picking up. And as I said, Betsy in my prepared remarks, I like where the business is headed. I think part of it is I am more positive around the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer than really any other geographies around the world. And that helps with so much momentum in the labor market. We are seeing still quite a bit of excess liquidity sitting there in the back pocket of our consumers and very healthy balance sheet. I think we have peaked in the payment rates. So, we are just starting to see the first signs of that coming down. And I think that's good because it's a return to be \u2013 it should be the return this year to a more healthy behavior. The spend has obviously been quite remarkable. It's up in the mid-20%. Also great to see the experience side and that services side coming back in again. And that's we have been seeing it in travel. We have been seeing it in apparel. People like getting dressed up to go to dinner again in a restaurant. Those different things, it's nice to see things coming back to normality. So, I am pretty positive both from cyclically where this is headed, the recovery from COVID, where it's headed. And I am also pretty happy with the strategy that Anand laid out and the progress we are making against it. So, I think some good things ahead here. Yes. And let me jump in as well, Mike, because this is something Mark and I have \u2013 we are very, very aware of. We are managing it in excruciating detail on multiple dimensions. We are taking the lessons that we have got \u2013 we have got to take some of the short-term pain here in order to get us into the position we need to be in the medium-term and the long-term. And from be it the stranded costs and the divestitures, we know we will have opportunities there. We talked about Investor Day also being in a position to simplify the management structure and take out some of the structural expenses there. So, this is going to be an area of continued focus from Mark and I, that we make sure that not only are we managing the arc and ensuring there is one, but also that we generate the benefits from our shareholders from all of this. And it's something I feel exceedingly high accountability for as does the management team. We get it."

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thank you, Jane and good morning everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses in Russia and end with the results of each segment. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we reported net income of $4.3 billion and an EPS of $2.02, with an RoTCE of 10.5% on $19.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are Asia consumer divestiture-related impacts that are detailed in the appendix of the presentation. In the quarter, total revenues decreased 2% as strength in net interest income driven by Services and PBWM was more than offset by lower non-interest revenue across businesses. That said, we continue to see strong performance in the key business drivers we shared on Investor Day, which I will walk you through in detail shortly. Total expenses of $13.2 billion increased 15% or 10% excluding the Asia divestiture-related impacts I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $755 million as net credit losses of $872 million were partially offset by a net ACL release. Embedded in the net ACL release is a Russia-related build of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes $1 billion related to exposure to Russia and about $900 million to account for the broader impact on the macro environment. This was more than offset by a release related to a COVID-19 uncertainty reserve, primarily in U.S. Personal Banking, given the continued resilience of the underlying portfolio, specifically in the U.S. As of today, we have about $17.9 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.35%. On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, we incurred some divestiture-related costs this quarter. These costs largely related to a goodwill write-down that we incurred in legacy franchises as part of our resegmentation and divestitures. It is important to note the goodwill impact is capital neutral. Excluding the divestiture-related costs, expenses increased by approximately 10%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about two-thirds related to the risks, controls, data and finance programs and approximately 30% of that is related to technology investments. About 2% of the increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers. In addition, we are investing in technology across services, wealth and cards. 1% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses largely in markets and cards and approximately 4% and was driven by inflation and other risk and control investments partially offset by productivity savings. Across all of these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 12% for the quarter. On Slide 6, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. As Jane mentioned, as of the end of the quarter, our remaining exposure to Russia stood at about $7.8 billion, down from $9.8 billion at year end. And importantly, the mix of the remaining exposure has changed and shifted in a positive way. We have reduced our direct Russia country risk exposure from $5.4 billion to about $3.7 billion, which consist of loans, AFS, derivatives and off balance sheet exposure. The remaining exposure, which previously totaled $4.4 billion, now totals $4.1 billion and consists of deposits and cash with the Central Bank, reverse repos and cross-border exposure. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $700 million, down from about $1 billion at year end. And the currency translation adjustment or CTA related to our net investment stands at $1 billion. And as I mentioned previously, we took credit reserves of about $1.9 billion, with about $1 billion for direct exposure to Russia and another approximately $900 million for broader impacts given the macro environment. So, we feel we have reserved prudently at this point. In the normal course of our planning and risk management, we run a range of stress scenarios and we have taken the same approach with our exposure to Russia. And as a result of the actions that we have taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios, our potential risk of loss is now estimated at approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down meaningfully from what I described at our Investor Day. On Slide 7, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $50 million on a sequential basis as interest income from loans as well as higher deposit spreads were partially offset by day count. Excluding day count, net interest income increased by approximately $290 million. Sequentially, net interest margin increased by 7 basis points as lower average deposits in services and higher interest income from loans were partially offset by balance sheet growth in Markets. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $370 million, driven by cards, deposits volumes and spreads as well as income from the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower net interest income in Markets and we grew average loans by approximately 3% in both ICG and PBWM. On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about 23% or $551 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. From a capital perspective, we ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 11.4% under both standardized and advanced approaches, with standardized remaining the binding ratio, down from 12.2% at year end. During the quarter, we adopted SACR and absorbed a significant impact from the sharp move in interest rates. We will go into more detail shortly on the drivers of capital in the quarter. However, it is important to note that despite these impacts, we continue to expect to manage to a CET1 ratio of 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GCIB surcharge increase to 3.5% at the beginning of 2023. We expect the combination of net income generation, DTA utilization and capital generated by the closing of several of the consumer exits in Asia to be sufficient to reach the 12% CET1 ratio by the end of the year. As we said at Investor Day, we are committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And as we see a pull to par in the investment portfolio, reversing that $4 billion interest rate driven impact, we would expect to be able to deploy that capital over time. And as you know, under the SCB framework and given the uncertain macro environment, we assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks and we will continue to do so throughout the year. For the second quarter, we expect only a modest amount of buybacks and we will evaluate that level throughout the quarter taking into account market conditions. On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 capital ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. As I just mentioned, our CET1 capital ratio ended the year at 12.2% as we have built capital to absorb the impact of SACR on our RWA. Post SACR adoption, our ratio stood at 11.8% as of January 1, 2022. Given the sizable impact of some of the drivers, I wanted to spend a minute to walk through the puts and takes this quarter and how we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of about 11.4%. First, we generated net income, which added 35 basis points. Second, over $4 billion of dividends and buybacks drove a reduction of about 36 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 35 basis point reduction. Fourth, the increase in disallowed DTA, largely driven by the reduction in CET1 due to the interest rate impact I just mentioned, drove another 15 basis point reduction. Finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of other factors, including a reduction in RWA. With all of that said, as I just mentioned, we have a path to a 12% CET1 capital ratio by year end and remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues decreased 2%, largely driven by Investment Banking partially offset by an increase in services revenue. And Markets declined slightly against a strong quarter last year. Expenses increased 13% driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and volume-related expenses partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was nearly $1 billion largely driven by a $1.5 billion build related to our exposures in Russia as well as the broader impact on the macro environment. And outside of Russia, we continue to see strong credit performance across our portfolio as clients' balance sheets remain healthy. This resulted in net income of $2.6 billion, down approximately 51% largely driven by the higher expenses and an ACL build versus a release in the prior year. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by trade finance. Average deposits grew 2% as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions and ICG delivered an RoTCE of 11.2%. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you each quarter. In Services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and a deepening with our existing clients and we expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 18%, driven by growth in net interest income as well as strong fee growth with both commercial and large corporate clients. And we continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 54%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees, and on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Securities Services revenues grew 6% as net interest income grew 17%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, and fee revenues grew 2% due to higher assets under custody. Overall markets revenues were down 2% versus a strong quarter last year. In the quarter, activity levels benefited from client repositioning and strong risk management in light of Fed actions and overall geopolitical uncertainty. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 1%. We saw strong client engagement, particularly with our corporate clients in FX and commodities, with our rates business also benefiting from higher volatility. Spread products were negatively impacted by less client activity. Equity Markets revenues were down 4% compared to a very strong prior year period. In the quarter, we saw strong equity derivatives performance and grew prime finance balances. Banking revenues, excluding gains or losses on loan hedges, were down 32% as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted activity in debt and equity capital markets. Investment Banking revenues were down 43%, driven by the contraction in capital markets activity, partially offset by growth in M&A. Corporate Lending revenues were down 6%, largely driven by lower average loans. Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues declined 1% as net interest income was more than offset by lower non-interest revenue. Expenses were up 14%, driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $376 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. We had a net release of over $1 billion of ACL related to COVID-19 uncertainty reserves. I would note that even after this release, we maintained over $9.8 billion in credit reserves against our U.S. cards portfolios or approximately 7.6% of total loans. This resulted in a net income decline of 23% and an RoTCE of just over 23%. Adjusting for the ACL release, RoTCE would have been approximately 13%. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Credit cards revenues declined 1% on higher average payment rates and higher acquisition and rewards costs as we continue to see attractive investment opportunities and strong customer engagement. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 24%, card spend volumes also up 24% and average loans up 7%. Retail services revenues were flat as higher net interest income was offset by higher partner payments, driven by improved credit performance. And we are seeing positive underlying drivers with spend up 14% and average loans up 1%. While payment rates remain elevated, we believe we have finally begun to see some normalization. As a result, interest earning balances in branded cards were relatively flat on a sequential basis, while Retail Services grew interest-earning balances by 3% sequentially despite seasonally lower card spending volumes. Retail banking revenues declined 6%, largely driven by lower mortgage originations. Wealth revenues declined 1%, driven by less client activity and investments, partially offset by higher deposits. Investment revenues declined as geopolitical tensions impacted the capital markets, which resulted in clients pulling back their trading activity, particularly in Asia. However, underlying drivers remain strong, with average deposits up 14%, average loans up 5%, client assets up 4% and client advisers up 6%. On Slide 14, we show results for the legacy franchises. Revenues declined 14%, driven by lower revenue across the exit markets, largely driven by the Korea wind down as well as the muted investment activity in Asia. Expenses were up 31%, largely driven by the goodwill impairment I mentioned earlier, but again, this is neutral to capital. Cost of credit was $160 million in the quarter, driven by net credit losses, and as a result, net income declined significantly. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased significantly, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses are down largely on lower compensation expenses. And to briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook, at this point, we still expect to see low single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit expense growth, both excluding divestiture-related impacts this year. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Yes. Good morning, Glenn, I think you captured it right in the sense we obviously did a build, a meaningful build related to Russia, the majority of the release was, in fact, tied to the COVID-19 management adjustment that Jane referenced. As we thought about these scenarios, as you know, we run a base scenario. We did tweak that a bit in bringing the GDP assumptions down from what they would have been in the fourth quarter, and that obviously also impacted kind of the outer years in our assumption. And the other piece is, when we look at the downside scenario, so our analysis for CECL is a combination of a base scenario and a downside scenario. Under the downside scenario, we did increase the severity of the downside to account for again a bit of the current environment that we're all managing through. So those puts and takes kind of netted out to what you see that we've reported, which is a net release, but largely driven by those two drivers. Yes. That's part of the $1.9 billion, obviously. I would point out that when you look through at the underlying performance of the portfolio, they are still holding up quite nicely when you look at the performance of our consumer customers, whether you're looking at the NCL rate and where that's trending or you look at the 90-day delinquency and where that's trending still very strong. Even when you look on the corporate side, if you adjust for the Russia-related build and those drove a bit of the NAL increase, but still very strong performance there, too. Good morning. Thank you. You got a lot there, that we've got to unpack. So I'll try to capture it all and you'll point to whatever I may miss. But let's start with the beginning of your question, just kind of the 12% and how we build back up to the 12%. So we ended the quarter at an estimated 11.4 to get to the 12%, that would be somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion of capital that will be required. Jane mentioned, I mentioned there are a number of puts and takes that play through that. You pointed out a few of them. So you all have estimates for our net income between the second and fourth quarter. So you can forecast that what that would be. There is probably another $1.6 billion or-so of a benefit from the DTA. So what I mean by that, there is the $800 million that I've referenced in the past of utilization of the DTA. And the balance would be the elimination of the amount that we tripped above the threshold this quarter. So there are two components that carry forwards that impact the DTA. And then there is the timing difference, which has equated to about 10% of our capital. So this quarter, we actually tripped that timing difference portion of the disallowed DTA, in part because of how the OCI reduction play through. So as that bleeds back in over time, we would expect to have capital buildup, which increases that threshold and therefore, be able to back off the increase that we saw in the quarter related to the DTA. The third component would be the capital from exits. So you didn't mention that one. As you know, there are a number of exits that we're looking to close at the end of the year \u2013 by the end of the year, they'll contribute about $4 billion of capital to that equation. And then there is the bleeding back in of the OCI impact, which will give or take, give us another $1 billion. So those are the pluses. Those are the things that kind of play in on the on the capital generation side. And then on the offsets, you've got preferred dividends, you've got common dividends, whatever growth we play out or put to work from an RWA point of view, and that leaves the balance for share repurchases. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect in the second quarter, a modest level of buybacks in light of all of those puts and takes. The good news is that the headwinds that we've talked about, all things being equal, so assuming no further rate changes, many of those headwinds bleed back in over time, allowing for us to do what we've committed to, which is returning capital to shareholders over time. In terms of dividends, we always look at that as part of the CCAR submission and part of our broader capital planning, but I'll \u2013 we will see how the results come out from CCAR, but I would lean in on a point we've had to make a number of times now, which is given where we're trading, it makes a lot of sense to be doing buybacks. And so we will likely continue to lean that way as opposed to doing a lot to change the dividend. But stay tuned as the capital planning continues to evolve. Yes. I'd make a couple of comments. So one, I'd point out that, again, we had a strong quarter in TTS. The revenues were up 18% versus the prior quarter up \u2013 that was year-over-year versus the prior quarter up 8%. And yes, some of that was due to rates playing through. So, net interest income was up 18%, but would look at the non-interest revenue that was up 19%. So to your point, Jane, we're seeing good fee revenue growth play through as well. Security Services had a good quarter. It was up 66% revenue year-over-year and part of that was through fee revenue growth as well. So as you said, good, strong engagement with clients and helping them think through some of the uncertainty that's out here, particularly as it relates to supply chains, helping them work through with their partners through the trade lending growth that we're seeing and making good headway with the commercial client offering as well. So I would say a very good quarter, a very strong quarter for TTS, and we expect that momentum to continue. Sure. Why don't I take that? So the first thing I'd say is that we're not at 10, right? So we ended the year last year, 2021 at $9.8 billion. We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure. So we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside of the last 3 months. I'd also point out that a number of things were important components of that. So if you look at Slide 6, you'll see that the loans, and these are both ICG and consumer loans, largely ICG, largely corporate loans have come down by $600 million. And that's really been a reduction in our risk exposure, right? So borrowers paying down, us limiting the extension of new credit, etcetera. The AFS securities have come down $600 million. And that is really a reduction mostly driven by sales. So we've gotten out of those securities. Yes, there are some mark-to-market losses, but they are not material. That flows through OCI, not material. You can see that the off-balance sheet unfunded commitments have trended down as well. Deposits and cash equivalents have gone up because we've actually seen the repayment of those loans come back, and we've been \u2013 we've had to put that cash with the Central Bank just given some of the restrictions that are there. We've been actively working down the reverse repo assets, which are really secured with sovereign bond exposure. And we've been bringing down the third-party cross-border exposure. So a lot of hard work has gone into bringing that exposure down to 7.8%. And if you think about the $1 billion that I referenced is kind of a net of $6.8 billion, right? So the second part of your question was, how do we think about reserves and what are those different components. Well, we look at the reserves in terms of the actual name-specific loan exposure we have, how we're rating those entities in this environment. And then we actually run that through our models and we come up with an appropriate reserve tied to that rating. So that $1 billion is related to the direct exposure that we have to these Russian clients and entities, the broader impact takes into consideration the spillover effect that might impact other names or other industries outside of Russia due to things like commodity pricing and what have you. And then there is a third component that is tied to the global uncertainty that gets created from a dynamic like this. So we built the reserves considering those multiple components. The last point I'd make is that, when you look at some of the names, there are a significant number of names that are large multinational names that have this exposure in the country and they provide parental support for some of the exposure that's here as well. So we really try to take a detailed comprehensive look at this and build the reserves in a way that we think are prudent recognizing that there are other scenarios that could play out that we want to be prepared for and have a view on as well. Hi. Good morning. It's an increase in our risk-weighted assets that's really tied largely to the derivative exposures that we have. What I would say is, obviously, how one manages their exposures and balance sheet and engagement with clients will impact that. But importantly, it's a market dynamic that needs to play out as well. So, as more RWA and capital is required for these types of positions, there has to \u2013 it's going to impact returns, and it ultimately will impact pricing as the market starts to incorporate this now higher requirement. And so it will continue to evolve. The thing I would point you to is that as we think about managing our businesses and in particular markets. You would have heard us mention at Investor Day that we are looking \u2013 continually looking for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet, optimize RWA, right. And so we talked about targeting a revenue to RWA for our markets business, and we are actively working at that now. And that's going to be important as we continue to manage not only the balance sheet requirements that we have, but our intent to try and return more capital to shareholders and improve our returns. Good morning. Sure. So look, I mean there \u2013 what we have built in \u2013 what we have got built into the forecast and the walk back to 12% is the forward curve as of the end of the quarter. So, that's what we have built in. As we think about that, that was a pretty sudden move through the quarter of 160 basis points on the 2-year in the quarter. That's now in the expectation. We have built in an assumption around more rate moves that could happen just as a bit of cushion as I think about the outlook and as I think about the walk. We do have hedges in place as it relates to some of the positions that we have and as it relates to OCI, and we will continue to manage that to ensure we reduce the risk from rate increases, which, by the way, we have been actively doing over the past couple of years. If you look at kind of how the balance sheet has evolved, we have been moving from out of AFS and into held to maturity over the past couple of years, reducing that risk of a negative impact to OCI. And if you look at the DVO 1, we have cut that down from as high as $60 million to about $30 million or so. So, we have been actively managing with an eye towards how do we reduce that sensitivity if you will. Why don't I let Jane kind of touch on the Mexico piece. Yes. So look, I mean as you said, Jane, what's going to be important is that we make the right decision for the people, for the business and equally important for our shareholders, and we are going to absolutely make sure we do that. In terms of the way this plays out is I think you are aware and I have mentioned before that we have got roughly $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion currency translation adjustment related to our consumer Mexico franchise. And so when we sign the deal, we will have that flow through the P&L ultimately gets offset at closing. And so again, you would have another timing difference between the accounting impact and the ultimate economic impact, but that's kind of the component that would play through it signing whenever that were to occur. Good morning. Yes. I don't have that breakout, Betsy. I mean I \u2013 we will have to kind of get back to you. I don't have that breakout. So, look, in the first quarter, the major driver that we have seen is really on the credit risk side from an RWA point of view, and that was really tied to SACR. That's the biggest driver of the fourth quarter, the first quarter RWA increase that we have seen. So, the RWA from a market risk point of view was mostly flat due to reductions in trading book securitizations, that was kind of \u2013 those are the kind of the main drivers there. Yes. So, like I said, securitizations would be an offset as would some of the equity derivatives. Yes. Look, on the \u2013 let me kind of take that. So, on the revenue side, as you would have heard us describe, there have been puts and takes that have played through the quarter, and there is still a fair amount of uncertainty that's out there. And so while there have been increases as it relates to rates, and we have seen and expect to see some benefit play through for that, there has also been an impact on banking revenues as we see the uncertainty creating a dynamic where corporate clients are pausing, particularly as it relates to equity capital markets and debt capital markets. And so as I mentioned, there are offsets that play out. And so we felt comfortable kind of maintaining the guidance on the revenue top line. In terms of the expenses, as I mentioned at Investor Day, the spend that we have going on in expenses is critically important. And we are still growing them as it relates to transformation and as it relates to business-led investments. On the business-led investment side, the good news is that we are starting to see some of the top line strength play out, not just driven by rates, but also driven by things like fees, which is what we forecasted. On the transformation side, we continue to make progress. And we have talked about how critically important that is to our operations going forward. We expect that, that will peak or arc, if you will, as we talked about at Investor Day, and that will occur in the near-term and will be an important offset, if you will, to the structural expense base that we have as the efficiencies from those spending \u2013 from that spending, excuse me, plays through. Yes, sure. Look, I am not giving kind of guidance kind of broken out, if you will, for the revenues. We are standing by the full year guidance that we have talked about. Obviously, with rates moving the way that they have, we would expect that we would see some improvement on the NII line, but I haven't given specific guidance broken out for the two lines. In terms of the deposit base we have, as you know, we have got a mix of consumer and corporate client deposits. We skew a bit more heavily towards the corporate client deposit base. That comes with \u2013 generally comes with a higher beta. And so they are likely to be more reactive to and reactive sooner to the increase in interest rates. And quantitative tightening will certainly have a longer term impact on the level of deposits that's out there. But with that said, our plans both in the near-term and as we have played out the Investor Day forecast, don't hinge upon significant growth in deposits. We would expect some growth, but growth consistent with kind of pre-pandemic levels, but that's not outsized growth, and we believe our strategy, which is broader than just going after deposits, but really is around solutions for corporate clients and the full spectrum of financial services for the consumers that we focus on will allow for us to capture an appropriate level consistent with how the economy evolves. Thanks, Erika. Yes. And the only thing I would add is a couple of numbers, right. So, the sales are up 24% year-over-year, exceeding pre-pandemic levels across the categories. Acquisitions are up 23% year-over-year. Again, bringing on new card customers into our family, if you will. Revenues are down 2%, but you really have to look through the investments that we are making in acquisitions and the rewards costs associated with those that impact that revenue being down 2%. If you adjust for the acquisition costs, actually, our revenues would be up 1% year-over-year. So, I agree completely with you, Jane, which is we are very pleased with the progress here. We are seeing similar momentum start to play through on the retail services side as well. The sequential performance on average interest earning balances is a good signal for how things will play out. And we continue to feel good about the growth we forecasted towards the back half of the year. Sure. And good morning and I would like to separate kind of NII guidance from the IRE sensitivity and disclosure that we have. And so you are absolutely right, and I am not moving \u2013 we are not moving off of our IRE disclosure at all. The analysis is such that with a parallel shift in rates of about 100 basis points that we see somewhere around $2.5 billion to $3 billion of an increase kind of play through. And as you know, as I have said before, that's cross currencies, with about two-thirds of that being to non-U.S. currencies and the other third obviously being U.S. So, that is still our view from an ROE point of view. We are not \u2013 we haven't changed that view. Yes. So, why don't I take that and kind of try and talk through it. So, the first thing I would say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance. I just want to be clear that at Investor Day, that's what we talked about. We would love for the number to be different, but we understand and we know that this is what's required to get the franchise to where it needs to be. And so we are taking those hard decisions. We are spending the money where we need to spend it. We are being diligent about that to make sure that we are not being wasteful in that effort. But we don't want to create or go through the things that we have gone through in the past in the way of under-investing. And so we are going to avoid that. The second thing is, and you acknowledge that kind of in your reference to transformation and business-led investments. On the structural investments spend, I should say, about half of that is from inflation, so not the full 4%. A portion of it is also from non-consent order risk and control spend that we are making, things like the financial crime unit, things like cyber spend, things like the work we are doing around our wholesale credit operations, important things. And there are some productivity savings that play through that. And then the final piece on the volume related is their transactional costs that are associated with the activity that we do on the trading side, their spend that we make in order to drive that activity. And the mix matters. And so while revenues kind of play out in one way for the quarter, the mix of the market's activity impacts the level of volume-related expenses that's generated through those transactions. So, those are a couple of things. Again, we are consistent with guidance. We believe we are on track for the guidance we gave for the full year of mid-single digits. And we are looking forward to generating the efficiencies that come out of this spend and put a dent in our structural expense base over time."

        "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Today's call will be hosted by Jenn Landis, Head of Citi's Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJennifer Landis: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials, as well as in our SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Jenn, and a very Happy New Year to everyone, and I hope you all had a good break. At Citi, we're back at it. And given the notable items and our new financial reporting structure, we've got a lot to cover today, so I'm going to get right to it. 2023 was a foundational year in which we made substantial progress, simplifying Citi and executing the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. With that said, the fourth quarter was clearly very disappointing. Today, I'm going to provide a high-level view on our progress in 2023, discuss our Q4 results and finish with our priorities for '24. We know that 2024 is critical as we prepare to enter the next phase of our journey and we are completely focused on delivering our medium-term targets and our transformation. So turning to what we accomplished in terms of executing our strategy. As you can see on slide five, in 2023, we saw a record year for services where we maintained our number one ranking amongst large institutions in TTS, with client wins up 27% and a sustained win-loss rate above 80%. We've now gained over 100 basis points in share and security services since 2021. In wealth, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets during the year. In USPB, we enjoyed our sixth consecutive quarter of growth and we began to see the early fruits of our investments in key talent in banking. In September, we began the most consequential series of changes to the organization and the running of our firm since the aftermath of the financial crisis. We restructured around five core interconnected businesses to align our organization to our business strategy and to provide greater transparency into their performance. You can now see in our financials, the full year returns and P&L by business. While they are all impacted by investments and transformation expense, it is clear where we have work to do. The simplification of our organization structure will conclude at the end of the first quarter and will result in over $1 billion of run rate saves from the net elimination of approximately 5,000 roles mainly managers. As Mark will detail, this will contribute to the reduction of our expenses in '24. Over the medium term, between simplification, benefits of the transformation, stranded costs and other productivity efforts, we expect to eliminate 20,000 positions ex-Mexico, resulting in over $2 billion in run rate saves. Simplification is also enabling Citi to be more client-focused and less bureaucratic. Realizing the synergies between our five businesses is one of the key drivers to achieving our medium-term revenue target. With this new structure, I'm holding my business leaders accountable for enhancing connectivity across clients and products. In addition, having a Chief Client Officer Act to ensure we're disciplined in bringing the full power of our franchise to our clients. We have now completed the divestitures of nine of our 14 international consumer franchises and have wound down nearly 70% of our total retail loans and deposits in Russia, Korea and China. We've restarted the sales process in Poland and a well down the execution path for the Mexico IPO next year. We're exiting marginal businesses such as munis and a subset of distressed debt trading to focus on our core strengths and allocate our capital with rigor. And without doubt, all these changes are difficult, if they are necessary. At the same time, we continue to invest in our transformation, risk and control environment and data architecture. And we were pleased to have closed the FX consent order with the Federal Reserve. We're committed to fulfilling the expectations of our regulators, given the unique role we play in the global financial system. The modernization of our tech infrastructure is proceeding at pace, allowing us to deliver new capabilities to our clients. During the year, we consolidated trading and reporting platforms and retired 6% of our legacy applications for the second year in a row. These enhancements dovetail with significant investments in our businesses such as hiring commercial bankers to capture share, improving the digital payment capabilities we offer throughout our global network and automating processes for our security services clients. It was also a year where we upgraded talent with key internal promotions supplemented by selective external hires, including Andy Sieg. The simplified reporting structure has been embraced by colleagues. We're feeling empowered by the new structure to serve clients and drive value for shareholders. While Mark will go through the details, I'd like to level set on our disappointing fourth quarter before recapping the full year's results. Earlier this week, we disclosed additional external headwinds, some of which materialized in the second half of December, including a $1.3 billion reserve build related to transfer risk stemming from exposures to Argentina and Russia. We also saw a nearly $900 million negative revenue impact as a result of the larger-than-expected devaluation of the Argentine currency. These items, together with the $1.7 billion FDIC assessment, drove this quarter to a negative EPS of $1.16. And while these items are clearly very painful, they are quite idiosyncratic in nature and will not impact the course we have set. In terms of the performance of our five businesses, while services was the most impacted by the Argentine devaluation. The underlying growth remains very strong, driven by share gains and client wins. Overall, services revenues were up 16% for the full year despite the impact of the Argentine devaluation. In TTS, cross-border transactions were up 15% and AUC, AUA in Security Services were up by close to $3 trillion for the year. In markets, our fixed income results were disappointing as we saw a significant slowdown in December, particularly in rates and FX. Markets was also impacted by the Argentine devaluation. This franchise is well positioned with our corporate clients, and we continue to take actions to improve returns, whether by redeploying capital to high-returning products or exiting products, which aren't a strategic fit. We had a decent quarter in equities, particularly in derivatives and we saw growth in prime balances, an area we have been focusing on. Well activity picked up in the fourth quarter with revenues up 22%. Overall banking revenue continued to be impacted by a weak wallet globally. Investment banking was up slightly for the year and we finished 2023 as the fifth leading franchise. We certainly aspire to be better. We're seeing improved confidence among CEOs and we like our pipeline, but of course, the timing for a robust recovery is uncertain. The share gains we've made in areas such as health care put us in a good position when this business turns more decisively. While investment activity in Asia rebounded with quarterly revenues up 21% and Wealth at Work up 18% for the year. Overall, wealth revenues were down in 2023 and we fully recognized that this business isn't where it needs to be. Andy is off to a fast start. In addition to resetting the expense base and ensuring the right utilization of our balance sheet is tightening our focus to build fee-based revenue streams and investment AUM. With $100 trillion in new wells to be created by 2030 mainly in North America and Asia and with our clients holding $5.4 trillion away from us, we have an important affinity here to drive growth and return to where they should be. USPB was a bright spot with every product up double-digits in the quarter compared to last year, including retail banking, which benefited from a rebound in mortgage origination new and refreshed products have increased customer engagement as we see the benefits of the investments we've made and in Cards, IB and ANR continued their growth reflecting a more balanced lend versus spend mix and falling payment rates. As expected, loss rates are now back to pre-pandemic levels driven by customers in the lower FICO bands. In terms of the full year in 2023, we grew revenues ex-divestures by 4%, although the Argentine devaluation essentially prevented us from reaching the $78 billion revenue mark. We met our full year expense guidance and we increased our CET1 ratio to 13.3% during the year. We grew our tangible book value per share by 6% to $86.19 and we returned $6 billion in capital to our shareholders in the form of common dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to continuing to return capital to investors through both of these channels. As I reflect on the year, I also want to note that we were a source of strength for the system and for clients during a volatile period for the banking sector and geopolitically and I'm very proud of how our people around the world performed during challenging times. 2024 looks to be similar to 2023 in terms of the macro environment with moderating rates and inflation. We expect to see growth slowing globally with the US well positioned to withstand a run-of-the-mill recession should one materialize. With a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and diligent risk management we are well positioned to support our clients through whatever environment comes to path. Moreover, we think environments like these play to our strengths, given how far we are down the path of our simplification and divestitures. 2024 will be a turning point as we will be able to completely focus on the performance of our five businesses and our transformation. I recognize the importance of this year and I am highly confident that we will see the benefits of the actions we've taken through the momentum of our businesses. Backed by investments in key products we believe we can continue to grow revenues ex-divestitures by 4% to 5% over the medium term. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the evolving capital and macro environment to reach our medium-term return targets and return capital to our shareholders whilst continuing the investments needed in our information. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start with the fourth quarter and full year firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons, unless I indicate otherwise. I'll also focus on our guidance for 2024 and end with the path to our medium-term return target. The presentation of our results reflects the changes we've made in conjunction with our organizational simplification, including reporting legacy franchises and corporate other in all other. However, before I go into the results, let me walk you through some of the notable items that impacted the quarter that were included in the 8-K we recently filed. At the top right of slide seven, we show these items on a pre-tax basis. The FDIC special assessment of approximately $1.7 billion related to regional bank failures in March. This impacted expenses in all other. A restructuring charge of approximately $780 million related to actions associated with our organizational simplification, which will drive headcount reductions and future savings over the medium term, impacted expenses in all other the impact of the currency devaluation in Argentina of approximately $880 million. This was recorded in noninterest revenue across services, markets and banking and you can see the impact by business in the appendix of the presentation. While we did have an adverse impact from the Argentina devaluation this quarter, we also benefited from high interest rates, earning approximately $250 million of NII on the net investment in the quarter given the hyperinflationary environment and a reserve build of $1.3 billion related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures to Russia and Argentina as described in the 8-K. This impact is mostly included in other provisions and cost of credit and spans multiple businesses due to their globality. The combination of these items negatively impacted diluted EPS by approximately $2 and RoTCE by approximately 920 basis points. Now turning to the left side of the slide where we show our financial results for the full firm. In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $1.8 billion and a net loss per share of $1.16 on $17.4 billion of revenue. Excluding the notable items, diluted EPS would have been $0.84 with an RoTCE of 4.1% for the quarter. In the quarter, total revenues decreased by 3% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the impact of the Argentina devaluation, revenues increased 2% driven by strength across services, USPB and investment banking, partially offset by lower revenues in markets and wealth and the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind down. Turning to expenses, we reported expenses of $16 billion, which include the FDIC special assessment and modest divestiture-related costs. Excluding these items, expenses increased 10% to $14.2 billion, largely driven by the restructuring charge I just mentioned. Cost of credit was approximately $3.5 billion. Excluding the reserve bill for transfer risk, cost of credit was primarily driven by card net credit losses, which are now at pre-COVID levels as well as ACL builds for new card volume. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. And on a full year basis, we delivered $9.2 billion of net income and an RoTCE of 4.9%, adjusting for the notable items, net income was approximately $13.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.3%. On slide eight, we show full year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2023. It is important to highlight that in conjunction with the change to align with our new financial reporting structure, we moved the majority of the financing and securitization business from banking to markets. We also implemented a revenue-sharing arrangement within banking and between banking, services and markets to reflect the benefits of businesses get from our relationship-based lending. These changes are now reflected in our results and our historical financials. Now looking at the full year numbers. Services had a record year with revenues of $18.1 billion, up 16%, benefiting from both rates and business actions, new client wins and deepening with existing clients, partially offset by the Argentina devaluation. Markets revenues decreased 6% to $18.9 billion, largely driven by lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December. The markets business was also impacted by the Argentina devaluation. Banking revenues decreased 15% to $4.6 billion, primarily driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges as well as a decrease in corporate lending. Investment banking revenues were relatively flat for the year as we gained share amidst the declining wallet. Corporate Lending revenues were down 4%, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges. Wealth revenues decreased 5% to $7.1 billion, primarily due to the deposit mix shift towards higher-yielding products, which drove lower deposit spreads. USPB revenues increased 14% to $19.2 billion, primarily driven by growth in card balances as we continue to see the benefit of our investments in digital acquisition and customer engagement. Total revenues, excluding divestitures, came in at $77.1 billion, below our guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion for the year, largely due to the impact of the Argentina devaluation, softer markets performance, particularly in December and losses on loan hedges. However, NIIX ex-markets came in at $47.6 billion in line with our guidance. Despite the challenging environment and the impact of the Argentina devaluation, we grew firm-wide revenues by approximately 4% ex-divestitures in line with our Investor Day target, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model and the investments we've been making. On slide nine, we show full year expense trends from 2021 to 2023, excluding the FDIC special assessment and divestiture-related impacts, full year expenses were $54.3 billion for 2023 in line with our guidance. As I mentioned, this includes roughly $780 million of restructuring costs associated with our organizational simplification and additional severance costs of approximately $730 million, which included actions to address stranded costs and start to right-size the businesses. Relative to the prior year, expense growth continued to be driven by transformation and business-led investments, volume-related expenses and other investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset by productivity savings and a reduction in expenses and legacy franchises within all other. Over the past few years, we've been investing across these themes, which has not only impacted the performance of the firm, but also the businesses. On slide 10, we show the components of our transformation and technology spend from 2021 to 2023. Over the past three years, we have invested significantly in our infrastructure, platforms, applications, processes and data. As you can see in the bar chart at the top of the slide, roughly 30% of our transformation investments over the last three years were in technology, with the remainder related to non-tech employees and consultants. In 2023, we've seen a shift from consulting expenses to technology and compensation as we've gotten deeper into the execution of our transformation. And you should expect to see this trend continue. In total, we invested over $12 billion in technology in 2023. Beyond transformation, our technology investments are also focused on digital innovation, new product development, client experience enhancements and areas that support our infrastructure like cloud and cyber. On slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Across branded cards and retail services, approximately 80% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And across both portfolios, NCL rates have reached pre-COVID levels, but we continue to be well reserved with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 7.7%. In our corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade, which is reflected in our low level of nonaccrual loans at 63 basis points of total corporate loans. We feel good about the quality and mix of our portfolio and are well reserved for the current environment. As it relates to Argentina, we've included a slide in the appendix summarizing the value it brings to the global network and the broader institutional client relationships we hold as well as the strength of our financial profile in Argentine. As it relates to Russia, we've also included a slide in the appendix. You will see that the reserves for transfer risk that we have taken have significantly reduced our net investment and therefore our risk of loss related to Russia. On slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet, which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base, which is deployed into high-quality diversified assets. The majority of our deposits, $801 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries and are complemented by $426 billion of US personal banking and wealth deposits. We have approximately $561 billion of HQLA and approximately $690 billion of loans and we maintained total liquidity resources of $965 billion. Our LCR decreased modestly to 116% and our tangible book value per share was $86.19, up 6%. On the bottom left corner of the slide, we show a full CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers in 2023. First, we generated $8 billion of net income to common, which added 70 basis points. Second, we returned $6.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 53 basis points. Third, we benefited from the impact of lower rates on our AFS investment portfolio, which drove an increase of 20 basis points. And finally, the remaining three basis points was largely driven by higher RWA, partially offset by capital releases from the exit markets. We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 100 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. As you can see, we've grown our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points over the course of the year while returning over $6 billion to shareholders in common dividends and repurchases. Before I take you through each business, as Jane mentioned, we are not satisfied with the performance and returns of our businesses. And therefore, we are laser-focused on executing against our strategy, simplifying the organization and rightsizing the expense base. As a reminder, the investments that we've been making have impacted each of the businesses, as you will see in the next few slides. So now turning to slide 13, where we show the results for services for the fourth quarter and the full year. Revenues were up 6% this quarter, largely driven by NII across TTS and security services, partially offset by NIR, driven by the Argentina devaluation. Services noninterest revenues were up 20%, excluding the impact of the Argentina devaluation. Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in technology, product innovation and client experience. Cost of credit was $646 million, driven by a reserve build of approximately $652 million primarily associated with transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Net income decreased to $776 million as higher revenues were more than offset by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. Average loans were up 6%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS, both in North America and internationally. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisition and deepening with existing clients. However, sequentially, deposits were up 1%. Services delivered an RoTCE of 13.4% for the quarter. And for the full year, services delivered an RoTCE of 20% on $18.1 billion of revenue. On slide 14, we show the results for markets for the fourth quarter and the full year. Markets revenues were down 19% versus a strong quarter last year, driven by a decline in fixed income and the impact of the devaluation, partially offset by an increase in equities. Fixed income revenues decreased by 25% largely driven by rates and currencies on lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December as well as the impact of devaluation. However, we saw a good underlying momentum in equities with revenues up 9%, driven by gains across all products and we continue to grow prime balances while making solid progress on our revenue to RWA targets. Expenses increased 8%, driven by investments in transformation and risk and controls and volume-related costs, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $209 million, driven by a reserve build of approximately $179 million, primarily associated with the transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Markets reported a net loss of $134 million as revenues were more than offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Average loans increased 4% to $115 billion as we saw increased client demand for credit driving growth in warehouse lending. Average trading assets increased 18% to $391 billion, largely driven by treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, given the strong client activity in fixed income for much of the year. While it was a challenging quarter, markets performed relatively well for the full year with revenue of $18.9 billion and an RoTCE of 7.4% compared with very strong performance in the prior year and we are focused on improving returns over time through a combination of revenue growth, expense discipline and capital optimization. On slide 15, we show the results for banking for the fourth quarter and the full year. Banking revenues increased 22%, driven by growth in investment banking fees and lower losses on loan hedges, partially offset by lower corporate lending revenue. Investment banking revenues increased 27% year-over-year, driven by DCM and advisory due to improvements in market sentiment. In advisory, we saw signs of strength across technology, health care and energy, and we feel good about the strength of our pipeline. Corporate lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges decreased 26%, largely driven by lower revenue share from investment banking services and markets. Expenses increased 37%, primarily driven by the absence of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year. Excluding the reserve release, expenses were roughly flat. Cost of credit was $185 million, driven by a reserve build associated with the transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. The NCL rate was 32 basis points of average loans and we ended the quarter with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 1.6%. Banking reported a net loss of $322 million as higher expenses and cost of credit more than offset higher revenue. RoTCE was negative 6% for the quarter. And for the full year, banking reported an RoTCE of negative 0.2% on $4.6 billion of revenue. So clearly, we have more work to do on returns. And while it's difficult to predict when activity will normalize, we're positioning the business to capitalize on the rebound in the market wallet, and that includes continuing to invest in key growth areas, upgrading talent in traditional sectors and continuing to right-size the business. On slide 16, we show the results for wealth for the fourth quarter and the full year. Wealth revenues decreased 3%, driven by lower deposit spreads, partially offset by lower mortgage funding costs and higher investment fee revenues. We're seeing good momentum in noninterest revenue, which was up 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher investment assets, increased client activity and market performance. Expenses were up 4%, primarily driven by investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset by replacing strategic investments and tighter expense control as we begin to right-size the expense base in the business. Wealth reported a net income of $5 million as revenues were mostly offset by higher expenses. Client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher client investment assets, partially offset by lower deposit balance. Average loans were flat as we continue to optimize capital usage. Average deposits decreased 2%, reflecting the continued mix shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by new acquisitions and the benefit from higher market valuation, and we're seeing good momentum in net new assets, which more than doubled to $16 billion for the quarter. For the full year, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets. RoTCE was 0.1% for the quarter. And for the full year, RoTCE was 2.6% on $7.1 billion of revenue. Looking ahead, we're going to improve the returns in the business as we invest in talent to execute on our refocused strategy to drive investment revenue with an eye towards rightsizing the expense base. We will wind down non-core initiatives, exit less productive performers and enhance discipline across every expense line. On slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the fourth quarter and the full year. US Personal Banking revenues increased 12%. Branded cards revenues increased 10%, driven by higher net interest margin and interest-earning balances growth of 13% and we continue to see healthy growth in new account acquisition up 8% and spend volumes up 3%. Retail services revenues increased 15% also driven by higher net interest margin and interest-earning balance growth of 11% as well as lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses. Retail banking revenues increased 15%, driven by higher deposit spreads, loan growth and improved mortgage margins. Expenses decreased 1% as higher expenses to support lending programs and client engagement as well as the rollout of simplified banking were offset by lower non-volume-related expenses. Cost of credit of $2.1 billion, increased 20%, driven by higher NCLs, partially offset by a lower ACL build. Net income increased to $201 million, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Average deposits decreased 5%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. We continue to make progress against our digital strategy with digital deposits up 14% and active digital users increasing 6%. RoTCE for the quarter was 3.6%. And for the full year, US Personal Banking delivered an RoTCE of 8.3% or $19.2 billion of revenue. Here again, we are focused on improving the return profile of the business. Managing through this part of the credit cycle and continuing to make progress in retail banking will be key. On slide 18, we show results for all other on a managed basis, which includes corporate other and legacy franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 17%, driven by a decrease in NII of 29% driven by the closed exits and wind down, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue and expenses increased to $4.5 billion, driven by the FDIC special assessment and restructuring costs, partially offset by lower expenses in both wind down and exit markets. Turning to slide 20, as we kick off 2024, the environment remains somewhat uncertain and markets remain difficult to predict. But based on what we see today, we expect revenues to be approximately $80 million to $81 billion, as shown on the left side of the slide. And on the right side of the slide, we list the key drivers. In TTS, we expect revenue growth to be driven by new client wins, deepening with our existing clients and continued momentum with commercial clients as we continue to leverage our global footprint and product innovation. In Security Services, we have a very healthy pipeline, and we'll continue to on-board assets under custody from new mandates, win new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. In Investment Banking, we anticipate a rebound in activity and to maintain our position as the wallet recovers. Over time, we do expect the investments that we've made in key growth areas, such as health care and technology to allow us to gain share. And we also expect a modest rebound in wealth as we execute on our refocused strategy with an eye towards growing investment fees, particularly with our existing clients. In USPB, we expect continued growth in card balances driven by the investments we've been making as well as lower partner payments in retail services to continue to drive revenue growth. We also expect to continue to improve our retail brand performance. And as it relates to NII, excluding markets, we expect net interest income to be down modestly as the volume growth we expect from loans and deposits is more than offset by lower US rates and the reduction from the closed exits and wind down. Turning to slide 21. We expect expenses to be approximately $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, down from $54.3 billion, subject to volume-related expenses. The decrease in expenses will be driven by the benefits of our organizational simplification, a continued reduction from exit markets and wind down and productivity savings partially offset by investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses. Embedded in this guidance, includes an elevated level of severance as well as additional potential costs related to the organizational simplification totaling approximately $700 million to $1 billion. This will contribute to reducing headcount over 2024 and the medium term, which we will discuss on the next slide. On slide 22, we show the drivers of headcount and expense reduction over the medium term. As we've discussed in the past, there are three drivers that will reduce our expenses, organizational simplification, including the reduction of management layers, eliminating stranded costs as we take additional actions to reduce excess overhead in light of the exit markets and realizing productivity savings from our investments in the transformation and technology. We expect the combination of these three drivers to reduce our headcount by a net 20,000, excluding Mexico and generate a net run rate save of $2 billion to $2.5 billion over the medium term. This will underpin our path to $51 million to $53 billion of expenses, subject to volume-related expenses. Both the headcount and expense reduction will allow us to right-size the firm and businesses to improve performance and returns. On slide 23, we show our outlook for US Cards in 2024. In terms of credit performance, based on the trends that we're seeing, we expect NCL rates both in branded cards and retail services portfolios to rise above pre-COVID levels and peak in 2024. On a full year basis for 2024, we expect the branded card's NCL rates to be in the range of 3.5% to 4% and the retail services NCL rate to be in the range of 5.75% to 6.25%. From an allowance perspective, we are reserved for a weighted eight quarter average unemployment rate of almost 5%, which embeds a downside scenario of approximately 6.8%. ACL builds in 2024 will primarily be a function of the volume growth that we see as well as changes in the macro scenarios and the probabilities associated with them and we expect continued momentum in cards, albeit more in line with mid-single-digit loan growth. On slide 24, we summarize our medium-term targets. From a revenue perspective, we continue to expect 4% to 5% revenue CAGR in the medium term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exits and the wind down. From an expense perspective, we're now on the path to lowering our expenses beginning in 2024. From a credit perspective, we expect credit costs to be a function of portfolio mix, volumes and macro assumptions. And we are committed to returning capital to our shareholders and, in fact, expect to do a modest level of buybacks in the first quarter of 2024. So to wrap it up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are confident we are on the right path to deliver our 11% to 12% RoTCE in the medium term. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Okay. Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I looked in detail at the earnings presentation, especially slide four. And I think the question is on many people's minds. I count 12 restructurings at Citigroup. And I count 12 restructurings that have failed at Citigroup. You might disagree with the number 12. It could be five, it could be eight, it could be 12. It could be more, but I've not spoken to one person of any investor who would say that Citi has succeeded on its prior restructuring. So the question is, why is this time different? Number one, who is this new and improved Citigroup? Number two, why are expenses down even more, especially when few people that I talk to think you'll hit your revenue target. And three, Jane, what is your conviction level of getting to that 11% to 12% RoTCE in '25 or '26? Thank you.\nJane Fraser: Well, thank you very much indeed, Mike. I'll start with who is Citi. Citi is I'm delighted to say finally simple. At Investor Day, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients cross-border needs. That vision was based on five core interconnected businesses. We set out on a deliberate path to get there. And over the last three years, we've done so. Page four is who we are today. We are five interconnected businesses. No more, no less. We have our organization now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses, so that we can meet the medium-term RoTCE target we laid out. And the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the transformation. And I would also be I need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year, Mike. And I and the management team are accountable to deliver and that you and our investors have the transparency need to hold us accountable. So why is this time different? Look, it's not lost on me that there have been many attempts in the past to change this firm. I and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long-term and we are addressing the issues that have held us back in the past. And you've got proof points of the last three years where we've made a lot of tough decisions, and we have put through a tremendous amount of change to get to the simple Citi that we are today. We completely reset our strategy. So we now have a significantly more focused business and operating model. We've announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model. And frankly, from my perspective, more importantly, how we run the bank, since the financial crisis aimed at simplifying the bank and increasing accountability. You've seen we've moved quickly. We're on track with our execution of this effort and it will generate over $1 billion of run rate saves at the end of the first quarter, purely from the organization efforts that we put in, that we announced in September. We've done this while investing and I think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation. And while that was capitalized by our consent orders, these investments will ultimately deliver benefits from automation from well governed data from consolidated platforms. We also have made significant investments in our business to support the 4% to 5% revenue growth and to ensure client momentum. And those investments have helped us expand our product suite, invest in digital capabilities, automate our processes, capture synergies through a client organization. We've also brought in some incredible external talent in key strategic areas, including Andy to lead wealth, and we now have a good balance between experienced Citi people and external talent with fresh perspectives through multiple layers of the organization. So we are doing things the right way. We're doing it for the long-term and we're moving with urgency. We will need and are spending the money that we need to, to address our regulatory requirements, but that's already embedded in our path to the 11% to 12% RoTCE in the medium term. And this already feels like a different bank. We have more work to do. I recognize '24 is a critical year. And as I said, the decks are much clearer now so that we can focus on two imperatives, improving our business performance and executing the transformation. Neither is an entirely linear path as we've seen over the last three years. We all know that. We get, we have to build our credibility. We're committed to doing so and we are providing far more transparency around the business performance, so investors have a better sense of how we're doing, and I and my management team, to your final question, are fully accountable for getting this all done, we will. Mark, expenses?\nMark Mason: Yeah. Thanks, Jane. And why are expenses down more? I think, to your point, Jane, we've been investing in the franchise, both on the front end and importantly on the transformation and the risk and controls. What I would point out is that in 2023, we delivered expenses of $54.3 billion, ex the FDIC charge. That is the guidance that we gave. But I'd also highlight that we also included $780 million associated with the restructuring charge that is more than I had articulated in the way of guidance. So the capacity that we created through our efforts through the year, we use that in a smart way. We use that to fund the org simplification costs so that we can realize the savings down the line and we're going to continue to manage our expenses in a disciplined and smart fashion. That means spending what we need to spend on the transformation and risk and controls, but driving greater efficiencies and productivities along the way to ensure we get to that 11% to 12%. And to your point of revenues are to come down or come in lower-than-expected, we'll adjust the expenses accordingly.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. So, you're clearly making a lot of progress, and I hate to like ask this question too early, but I think it is important. Your expense guide is good, your revenue guide is good, and you have your arms around the expenses, so the question I have is, how do you think about balancing that near-term profitability improvement that we all want desperately with making sure you do make the right investments, because if you look around the world, there's a lot of places to grow, whether it'd be your branch network or wealth management aspirations that you have or the digital investments, so how do you -- how do we know that all the right future investments are being made, while you extract costs in all the good ways that you've been doing?\nMark Mason: Yeah, thanks, Glenn. I guess, I'll start and Jane, feel free to add in on it. Look, it is a balancing act, right, and we do look at each of our five core businesses. We, obviously, are clear on the strategy, but where is the growth, where the return opportunities associated with them, and how do we ensure we are deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We have to juxtapose that against the required investments to modernize our operations and we're making those trade-offs on a regular basis. But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, we're agile, we're trying to be agile about it, which means, if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting, because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to dial them back and that's what you've seen over the past year-plus, is that we've been investing in the business where we didn't see the upside that we anticipated, we dialed back that spend, right, and that's the type of iterative process, if you will, Glenn, that we're putting in place to ensure that on the other side of this we're still positioned to capture growth. Investment Banking, for example, we've invested in healthcare and technology, building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds. We feel good about that. We've done similar things in the way of our wealth business. We are investing heavily in our TTS franchise to ensure we can remain competitive there. So it's that type of discipline that's required. It is sometimes a trade-off, but it's one that we've been very focused on being smart about.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. Maybe a quickie on Services, obviously, up 16% in a record, it's great. I don't know if you've dimensionalized how much was rate versus new business, but you have good core business momentum and a pipeline of one, but not yet funded. So I guess the question is that, where can Services be over, let's say, the next two years in terms of growth, while rates come down yet your business is winning new wins?\nMark Mason: Yes, sure. Do you want me to? Sure.\nJane Fraser: Yeah. And I'll jump in. Let's maybe start with TTS. When we think about the performance of TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year, up 19%, ex-Argentina, came from a combination of both rates and the strong business actions we've taken. And you can see that in the different drivers. Cross-border was up 23%, commercial cards up 8%. And in terms of the growth prospects, we've generated 22% in average revenue growth from '21 to '23, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had a high single-digit. That was not just because of the rate cycle. It obviously helped, and we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid-single digit now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases. And that's going to come from a few different areas. One, the focus on our fee strategy, where we're capitalizing on strong client engagement, market-leading client solutions, and we're delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that we've been investing in across all our client segments. We'll continue optimizing our deposit book and bringing in high-quality deposits. And in a lower rate environment, GDP is typically higher, so you'd expect to see some higher growth in our capital-efficient payment volumes. You'll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. And I point to our confidence here 27% increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained win-loss ratio of 82% on new deals. And that was across different client segments. And revenues from these clients just continues to ramp up as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them. And you'll also continue to see us investing in the infrastructure and platforms we've been doing, launching new innovative products, and we're seeing momentum from some of the things we've recently done, Citi Token Services, Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, et cetera. So I think the main takeaway from TTS is that we'll continue to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum. We've been getting consistently good client feedback regarding our capabilities. So we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as the rate cycle comes down. And it is a crown jewel for a reason. And then just quickly on security services, I think, where we're seeing, we mentioned we've got a number of marquee wins there across all the client segments. That pipeline is both investors and issuers, and one of the core strategies that open put in place was to grow share with the US-based asset managers. We had a very low -- we were at 2.6% share in 2020. We're now at 4.3%. And a lot of the growth in the pipeline has been coming not only from our global network names but also from the marquee players in the US asset manager space. And I think that's our ability to connect our capabilities and that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients. Mark, anything I've missed there? You know I know this business.\nMark Mason: As you said, rightly, so high returning business, great growth prospects. To answer one of your questions, Glenn, about half of the NII growth we could attribute to interest rates and about half, I'd say, is business action, so us working with the clients to drive that momentum. And then if you think about the noninterest revenue for services. They're up about 20% in the quarter year-over-year, if you exclude the impact of the Argentina devaluation and up 7% on a full year basis. And so good momentum in the noninterest revenue growth as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nJohn McDonald: Hi. Good morning. Mark, I was hoping to ask you, how you're thinking about the pacing of capital build? Obviously, the Basel III proposals are out there, but they could change of course, even if they don't change, you have a couple of years to leg into those with the phase-ins and perhaps some mitigation opportunities. How should we think about you kind of building capital, given all of those variables and the ability to buy back some stock along the way as you mentioned earlier?\nMark Mason: Yeah, sure. So look, John, obviously the Basel III proposal still out there and under discussion. We've been very vocal about the potential impact of that. We've also been very disciplined about how we've been managing our capital. We've built that over 30 basis points over the course of the year. You've seen us actively manage that through the year. We're going to continue to do that. We obviously, generate earnings that contribute to that. We want to continue to drive growth across the business. We're trading at 0.5 times book, where we can we want to buy back as much as we can in shares and we tried to be disciplined about that over the past couple of quarters doing that as a modest level. You heard me saying -- you heard me say, we're going to do that again this quarter at a modest level. But we're going to be -- we have to be thoughtful about what those headwinds might look like and we're actively working what mitigation actions we have to put in place, should it turn out closer to the way the current proposal sit. So it's an ongoing active management that drives the balance servicing our client needs, with obviously, holding a responsible amount of capital in light of the uncertainty that's out there, and with an eye towards buy backs where we can do that.\nJohn McDonald: Okay. And just as an expense follow-up, I wasn't clear. Has the transformation spend peaked when you think about what you'll spend on transformation this year versus last year? And are the transformation benefits starting to kick in at this point?\nMark Mason: Yeah. So to be clear, we're going to continue to spend whatever we need to spend on the transformation and on risk and controls. And so we did see a tick up this year. We've got a plan for 2024. And if we've got to spend a bit more than what we spent this year, we're going to spend more. That's what the plan calls for. And so that's what we'll do. That's inside of the number that I've given you for guidance, right? And so that is -- that's important for us. I think it will drive, obviously, operational improvement and saves down the line. It is part of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion, but that is the early stage, if you will, of the transformation spend paying back. I think as we talked about at Investor Day, frankly, we'll continue to see expense benefits beyond the medium term from some of this transformation investment that we've been making. And so I would think of the medium term as the start of the benefits that we'll see from the investments we've been making in transformation and risk and control.\nJane Fraser: Yeah, I think, Mark, you're spot on. So we'll continue making the investments we need to in the transformation. It's a multiyear journey as we've always been clear around this, ultimately, with benefits for the shareholders and more of the expense saves that we've been talking about are separate our transformation from sort of the operating expense base of our businesses, which we want to make sure is productive and as effective as possible. And the types of benefits we're seeing, this is second year in a row that we've retired 6% of our legacy platform base. And you've heard me talking about moving 20 of our cash equity platforms onto one, six reporting ledgers on to one, 11 sanction platforms onto one. So we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in. Other things, we automated independent price verification for 90% of our prioritized fixed income and equity securities. That's reduced manual controls. That's improved valuation consistency. That's also had an impact on the efficiency of the business. We've loaded 98% of our prioritized wholesale and consumer data into two authorized repositories that will also begin to start having some benefits for us. So there is a cumulative effect. It is beginning to build now from all the work we've done, but it will take some time to really kick into the, as Mark said, when you really feel it is a few years out, but we'll keep giving you the proof points of things as we're going. So it's not just a trust us, this is coming, you'll begin to see it build.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, good afternoon. Mark, maybe just a follow-up on the expense, slide 22, where you talk about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of expense saves. I guess, I'm struggling with the numbers there. I think if you look at exit, and wind down markets you're probably close to $2 billion in numbers there and maybe the stranded costs, you can't get all that out. You're doing about, severance is $700 million to $1 billion in '24, so it doesn't seem like there's a ton of actual cost saves in that number, just maybe I'm wrong, if you could just kind of walk me through the numbers embedded in there and if there is, you've kind of alluded to more to come beyond the intermediate term.\nMark Mason: Yeah, I think the thing I'd point out to you is a couple of things. One, obviously we're forecasting revenue growth over this period of time. And so it's going to be volume-related expenses associated with that. The second thing I'd point out, as I just mentioned to the prior question, is that we're continuing to invest in risk and controls and in the transformation over this period of time. And so what you see is, there is an increase in expenses associated with at least those two things and that's offset by the savings that we're starting to generate, particularly from the org simplification that Jane has talked about, as well as from the stranded cost reduction that will continue to play out, as well as from some of the rightsizing of businesses that we've referenced in some of the prepared remarks. And so important to think about their headwinds and tailwinds that kind of net down to this $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And then the final point that I'd make is, if I look at this medium-term number of $51 billion to $53 billion that still has Mexico in it. And in one of the other pages, we point to expenses around Mexico, but because of where we are, will be in the IPO process, that's still going to be part of this expense base. And so, you can't lose sight of that.\nJim Mitchell: Well, that's an important clarification that the $2 billion to $2.5 billion includes some revenue-related volume growth. So that's helpful. And then just maybe the other, on the slides talking about revenue targets, one of the big numbers not talked about was markets. How are you thinking volatility has come in, macro picture is getting better, maybe that mutes volatility. How do you think about that business in '24 as it relates to your guidance?\nMark Mason: As you know, it's a tough business to forecast, certainly for full year and in some instances for a quarter. And so we basically kind of back that out, but we've assumed markets kind of flat to modestly down, but we've backed it out, and it's roughly flat. Not of the 81 -- not of the 80 to 81, but you see the guidance of NIR ex-markets and NII ex-market. So in the 80 to 81, we've assumed it roughly flat.\nJim Mitchell: Okay, great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good afternoon. I think, Mark, just wanted to -- good morning -- afternoon, Jane. Just wanted to follow-up on something I think Mark said at the end of his very first response around, it's very hard in my seat to figure out whether you're going to grow revenues or shrink revenues given the macro, should we take it based on what you said today, as we look into '26, getting to that 11% RoTCE, if for whatever reason revenue fall short, you feel good about the expense flex to mitigate that headwind.\nJane Fraser: Hi. It's Jane. Obviously, I want to just jump in on one bit, which is, we are committed and we're very confident around the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, and so there isn't any backing away from that number, and that's in various macro environments, et cetera. And as we look across the different businesses and the projections we have, we're confident around that. Obviously, if there is a very adverse macro environment, et cetera, we've got other levers we can take, but Mark, let me pass it to you.\nMark Mason: And I by no means was trying to suggest that we weren't confident in the forecast for the top-line. If you think about the strategy and the strength of those five core businesses, we've got a lot of conviction around that. With that said, as you pointed out, Jane, under a circumstance where that doesn't play out, obviously, volume-related incentive comp expenses and the like that would naturally come down, we'd ensure that they came down with the revenue decline or shortfall, and then we'd recalibrate other spend -- other investments spend not related to risk and control and transformation, but other investments across the platform we'd recalibrate accordingly.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Perfect. Just what I needed. And one quick question. As we think about rightsizing the Markets business, there's been headlines around the muni and the distressed business that you've gotten out, is there a risk where you the Markets business becomes too small? Any lack the scale to be sort of efficient and relevant in certain just across the breadth of, be it fixed-income or equities, just if you can talk about that? Thank you.\nJane Fraser: The short answer is no. We have -- if you think about our Markets business, we have four businesses each of which are around $4 billion or so in size. You have our Global FX network where we're typically number one in any year just given the strength and particularly the corporate client base we set off. Rates, typically top three, together these are two of the largest macro pools within fixed. In terms of the spread products, we've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our simplification fully within Markets, so that we've created a unified scaled spreads product business. And then finally, equities, where we're focused on improving our prime offering building balances. We still have a way to go obviously in that. Prime balances, we're pleased they were nicely up this year, driven by client momentum, and we are a leading equities derivatives franchise. So you do have these four core businesses and I go back to our big point of differentiation and why we still we feel we're well-positioned, we have a very differentiated corporate client base, and a very strong partnership between our core markets franchise, TTS, and banking, and that -- and security services, and that helps us in FX and commodities and in rates around the world. So, Markets is important, both in terms of its leadership but also how it fits into the strengths that we have from this simplicity of those five core interconnected businesses. We demonstrated solid returns in the past. I think a lot of the actions we've been taking will help drive returns in the future and you should be getting confidence when you see the discipline we're putting onto RWA, 5.3%, getting close that target we set at Investor Day, we're moving that up to 6%. The exits we've got of non-strategic businesses shows our focus on efficiency, and we've also been doing some good investments in our technology and it's getting us into a good place there. So I think don't be concerned about the shrinking, we're just making sure that it really plays to our strengths and we optimize the returns.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\nGerard Cassidy: Good afternoon, Mark and Jane.\nMark Mason: Good afternoon.\nJane Fraser: Hey.\nGerard Cassidy: Mark, can you share with us on your revenue guide in the net interest income, I know you mentioned this going to be lower and part of it is due to lower interest rates. Some of your peers have come out with their guides using the forward curve in their net interest income forecast, which includes the Fed in our country, six cuts. Can you give us some color what kind of rate environment. I know you said lower rates, but any insights around that guide?\nMark Mason: Yeah, I think what I pointed to is in the range of the 81 -- the 80 to 81. We are assuming three to six cuts, right? You got a range there and the reason I describe it like that, excuse me, is that if you think about our IRE, as we've shown it in the Qs before, we are positioned such that with a 100 basis point move parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple $100 million, right, and so to the negative, obviously, but it's a couple of $100 million. And so as we think about that forecast, and as I mentioned, NII being down a bit, that covers kind of three to six cuts over the course of 2024, likely back-loaded, but that's what's in there.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. I appreciate that. And then, Jane, more of a qualitative question rather than quantitative. But obviously, there's numerous moving parts of the strategies that you guys are executing on. Exiting businesses, downsizing businesses, especially on the downsizing, I think you guys mentioned the headcount of about 20,000 coming down. How do you keep the morale of the organization elevated when you have these types of tough decisions that you all have to make.\nJane Fraser: Yeah, well, we've also got areas which are growing. So that does help to see -- we have a diversified portfolio here. I think we're very mindful of that there is a human impact of the decisions that we're making. We're trying to be as transparent with our people as we are with our investors about what we need to do, why we're doing it, what to expect and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decisions and then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can. I think that's the most humane way to do this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open.\nErika Najarian: Hi. I'm sorry to prolong the call. Thank you for all your color. Just one more question. Jane, when will you feel comfortable giving us a buyback outlook that's beyond just quarter-to-quarter. I know you still have a little bit of ways to go, but you do have a 100 basis point buffer to your minimum, and I know Basel III and game is still out there. And I'm sure that reducing risk just doesn't mean expenses, but also reducing your -- or being mindful of your RWA footprint. And given where your stock is relative to book, when will we be more comfortable about giving sort of a longer-term outlook that was -- that's underpinning your RoTCE target with regards to the buyback?\nJane Fraser: Erika, it's a great question. It's one I ask myself every morning when I get up, because it -- given where we trade, the value for our shareholders of buybacks is enormous. And Mark and I are very committed to doing so. We also know that we're building our credibility. And I don't want to say things that we're not going to deliver against although we're going to have to change. I think it's one of the values that we're really trying to adhere to very strongly. And with the NPL, I think we'll get a better sense about this soon. The comment period just got extended and we want to see what that is. I think you've all heard us at the Senate banking hearings with our concerns about it. I very much hope that it is either completely revised or very materially, so it doesn't have a negative impact on the economy and the US banking system competitiveness, the move for more business, the shadow banks, which I think has got to a point, which is not healthy. So we're going to wait and see before -- where that comes out before we give it to you, but I would be asking exactly the same question in your shoes as well.\nErika Najarian: Thank you, Jane. I think that it was very helpful that you said on this public forum where you're trying to build credibility because as I think about what long-only investors have been dying to see from Citi in terms of the previous leadership was that sort of awareness. And I think just having that awareness recognition will be very important to investors. So thank you.\nJane Fraser: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatt O'Connor: Hi. I want to follow-up on the Russia exposure on page 34. Looks like you guys have taken a really good whack on the vet investment, and you also highlight how this CTA would be capital neutral you know if you're going to write that down. But what about the remaining exposure and just like how frame -- are you responsible for some of these unremidable corporate dividends. I just don't -- I think a lot of us don't understand that type of exposure? And is there a risk to you going forward? Or did you hope for clear the deck from the fund exposure going forward?\nJane Fraser: Yeah. And actually, I also want to kind of take a bigger picture answer to that before I turn it to Mark because I would have thought there's a question that is on everybody's mind, particularly given the firm's overall low level of returns and our headline numbers is this quarter about the -- what we've been doing with Russia and Argentina. So the bigger strategic question behind it, and then we'll get to you on specifics on the Russia front. If you think about Citi, we have a differentiated global business model, and that means we're committed to the countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run. So that means we hold long-term capital in those countries upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle. And if we just point to our leading services and FX businesses are the heart of that network and they're generating double-digits, as you can see. With that footprint comes a set of risks. So I think in terms of credit currency transferability of capital. And we've proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time. And with respect to the Q4 currency and transfer items, while the timing was unknown and we've highlighted those risks in our disclosures for a couple of years. I'd say Russia is rather unique. It's a wall and for us, a highly unusual liquidation. We've navigated it very well. We've executed our wind down in an orderly way with very low losses for our clients and very low losses for us. Our remaining net assets are now 100% reserved against, and I think similarly, if I just touch on Argentina for a minute because I'm sure folks have got a few questions on that. Similarly, over the last several years, we de-risked our business model there. We don't have a consumer bank, so we've really reduced our emerging market exposures to just our institutional presence focused on the multinational clients. You've heard us talk about that and select high-grade local clients. Look at Argentina, it's a very good business for us over the cycle. And even after the impact of Q4, we had less than $5 million in credit losses in Argentina over a 10-year period. That's remarkable, $5 million over 10 years. In terms of the currency risk, we all have to book revenues the official rate versus the parallel market rate. We were able to partially, but not fully hedge the exposure, but we will certainly always take economic decisions on the business we do and did mindful of likely devaluations and capital controls. And the reserve is a reserve, it centers on the ability to convert and transfer capital as per US banking rules. So I just want to put part of the things of this quarter into that context, we have a global business model. It's heavily focused on high-grade multinational clients. Our track record for managing the various risks associated with our global network has been very strong. And I think you're seeing us with a very conservative and a reserve profile. Mark, what would you add?\nMark Mason: Yeah, very quickly on the Russia point, as you know and as the slide points out, we continue to bring our exposure down there. It's down to $6.5 billion, it's down 13% from the previous year. And a third from 2021, we brought down the consumer loans, the consumer deposits in a significant way there. And essentially, what's left in -- is that we have a custody business and we are holding corporate dividends that are our clients' proceeds. We're unable to pay those out by law by regulation. And so we have to hold those and that's what's being referenced in the slide where we say unremitdable Russia corporate dividends. And so that is not a risk that -- of loss for us, but we're unable to kind of clear those because of the state of play in Russia at this stage.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. That was clear. And then just separately, in credit card, you and a lot of your peers expect losses to go up from here, but most seem to be things that repeat this year, including you. And just what gives you confidence that the card losses will peak this year as you just getting back to that a little bit above normalized level, is it some tightening that you've done? What's driving that confidence looking out this year because there's obviously a step-up coming still, right?\nMark Mason: Sure. There's a step-up coming. We give a forecast when '23 as you point out to what the full year estimate for NCLs will be for both branded and for retail services. What I'd point out is you can see actually on the slide how there was a dip in loss rates during the COVID period. And so to some extent, what we're seeing is kind of a catch-up of those as those portfolios go through a longer maturation than what you'd normally see in our cards portfolio. On top of that, we've been originating new card, you've noticed our acquisitions have grown, so we obviously have new card loans and those are going through a much more normal maturation period. And so as we look at kind of the early buckets and the delinquencies that are playing out, we've got a pretty good sense for when we would expect those to peak and at what level. And we think they'll peak inside of '24, so that's captured in that average forecast that we've given. We haven't made material changes to our underwriting. However, there is mix evolution that happens. Transactors, we have a number of transactors that have kind of come on to our portfolio and are in the mix of our branded portfolio as well. And so anyway, those are the drivers that give us confidence and inform the trajectory that we -- that we're talking about here.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRyan Kenny: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I have a question on quantitative tightening. Wondering if you have any early thoughts on how Citi is positioned if the Fed ends Q2 early. Is that a material catalyst for you? And would that help you hit your revenue targets even sooner?\nMark Mason: Yeah. Again, I mean, when I think about our interest rate exposure and for US dollar, in particular, we showed it in our last Q, we'll show it in this Q for a 100 basis point move in a parallel shift, we're looking at probably a negative $1.6 billion or so. But important to point out that the US dollar component of that is only a couple of hundred million dollars. Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive of 100, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure. So our US dollar exposure is relatively neutral again, assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in the curve. And so we're kind of neutral relative to rates moving in either direction and therefore the impact there.\nRyan Kenny: And there's a lot of optimism and debate around capital markets rebound. Are you seeing that? And can you help us update us on investment banking pipeline across M&A, ECM, DCM?\nJane Fraser: Yes. We certainly had a much more constructive market environment at the end of '23 interest rate spreads and volatility at most of the year, equity prices are high. And I think we view this as a helpful foundation for activity to accelerate in '24, assuming the tailwinds persist. And speaking of our own pipeline, the breadth, the depth, the quality of it is very sound. It's higher than it was pre-COVID. So when markets are constructive, we expect to move these opportunities forward, and we're hearing a lot more confidence from the CEOs, CFOs around this. And when we're looking at our own side, as you know, we've been investing in some higher growth areas. So we get a good balance between our traditionally strong sectors as well as high-growth areas. And we've been seeing some very good momentum in health care and technology as well as areas of traditional strength, which is energy and industrial. And I think we feel very confident in the recovery in DCM, the beginnings of one in 11. And so cautiously optimistic here. I'm not -- so I wouldn't say that it's going to accelerate enormously and with incredible speed, but I think we're feeling much better about the foundation. Mark, anything you'd add?\nMark Mason: I completely agree.\nJane Fraser: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nScott Siefers: Afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Have you all assumed any revenue attrition just related to the reduction in force? And I guess, just broadly, how might that be embedded in the '24 revenue guidance. And I guess just at a top level, maybe just a thought or two on.\nJane Fraser: Scott, Sorry, I didn't hear what it was. I think the phone line cut out. The revenue in attrition?\nScott Siefers: I'm sorry. Yeah. Just curious if you have assumed any revenue attrition related to the reduction enforce over the coming year or two?\nJane Fraser: Okay. No, we haven't. I think a lot of the moves that we've made from the organization simplification. So the 5,000-or-so roles we talked about, they're mainly managerial roles. And they've mainly impacted the functions and the geographies, not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators. And the other piece is with the client organization, we're actually putting much more time into the hands of our people to drive revenue forward. So I think what we're looking at here is it getting a bit of areas of bureaucracy and where we've been too complicated, where we can drive efficiency whilst preserving our frontline and encouraging them to be as revenue-productive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client. So I'd like to see the opposite actually.\nScott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, Mark, could you discuss for a second, maybe just broadly the flow of expenses through the year? I know that they should begin to decline toward the end. But what happened between now and then? Do they hold kind of flattish with a core rate, or would there be any normal course of business growth?\nMark Mason: I think what I'd say is that you should expect that in the first quarter, we'd likely see an uptick in our total expenses relative to the fourth, in part because, as Jane has mentioned, we anticipate that there'll be more to the org simplification and, therefore, dollars associated with that in Q1. And then from there, I would expect that you'd see a downward trend through the fourth quarter.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. All right. Thank you.\nMark Mason: Yeah.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark.\nJane Fraser: Hi, Vivek.\nVivek Juneja: A couple of quick clarifications. On your NII guide, you talked about you're assuming three to six cuts. That's US, I presume. So are you assuming flat unchanged rates outside the US since you're more sensitivity outside?\nMark Mason: Modest declines outside, but yes, declines outside as well, but not nearly of the magnitude of what we're talking about in the US.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. And then, Jane, to your point about the 20,000 headcount cuts, and I heard you just mentioned 5,000 from managerial positions. Where are the rest 15,000 coming from?\nJane Fraser: Let me just -- so let me just be clear about where the ones that we've just done and that we're working on through the organization simplification. So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of the first quarter, as we said, we're expecting to get about $1 billion of run rate saves from the org simplification work alone. That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase III, which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed. That's been a net reduction of about 1,500 managers out of a total of 12,000 roles. So it was about 13%. And these are mainly manager roles, as I talked about earlier. Then when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this, as Mark was talking about earlier, I mean, the stranded costs will be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestures, we'll be continuing, and you've seen it been doing that, exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and the like and being very disciplined about that. We've got some businesses where we feel we need to right-size the core expense base. Andy Sieg is going to be kicking off that in Wealth, and you will begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter. He's off to a strong start. And then we've got other areas where we'll be creating more utilities. We've got -- still got different fragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification as highlighted we'll be aggregating those, creating utilities or consolidating some of those different functions. And that is before we get to beginning to get benefits from the transformation where there will be efficiencies that come through. We'll still have areas that we're investing. These are going to be, as we talked about, core business investments, it's going to be expense growth still in the top -- from volume growth that we've got, and we will be investing in our transformation. And all of this is happening over the medium term to get us to the 11% to 12% RoTCE target we talked about. So that 20,000 is -- it's the number that we estimate at the headcount. I don't love thinking headcount and I'm thinking about expenses. I think it's a more meaningful number. So as Mark laid out in his presentation, we've got a net expense saves that we're expecting to achieve in the medium term, and these are the raft of different areas that we will be contributing to it, and we're working hard at it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Really some ticky-tack modeling questions on the revenue side. Does the revenue guidance for the full year include any reduction in credit card late fees? And how large of a contributor is that to revenues overall at Citigroup?\nMark Mason: So let's see. So obviously, the proposals out there, and we've factored in what's knowable as it relates to that. We haven't given guidance externally on what that impact is, but we do believe there offsets and mitigants that over time, we'll be able to kind of bring into play. And so long-winded way of saying our revenue forecast does assume some basic level of late-fee adjustment.\nSteven Chubak: Got it. And just on the earlier comments you made, Mark, around services NII. I am struggling to reconcile the 50-50 NII contribution from rate and volume components just given average loan and deposits were essentially flat year-on-year. NII grew $3 billion it does imply a much larger contribution from rates. I know there's deposit fund transfer pricing and other noise. So I was hoping you can maybe unpack that a little bit further.\nMark Mason: I mean there are a lot of factors in there. There's obviously as well the mix as it relates to what we have in the US versus outside of the US. So it's -- there are a number of factors there and probably too much to kind of take you through on the call here, but we're happy to kind of follow-up with you off-line and take you through it.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: Yeah. Just a clarification, when you said medium term in this call as it relates to employee reductions, expense savings, revenue targets and 11% to 12% lastly, does medium term mean by 2026, or does it mean something different?\nMark Mason: Yes, it's --\nJane Fraser: 2026.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Thank you. Got it.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.\nJennifer Landis: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact IR. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the Citi Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenn, and a very Happy New Year to everyone, and I hope you all had a good break. At Citi, we're back at it. And given the notable items and our new financial reporting structure, we've got a lot to cover today, so I'm going to get right to it. 2023 was a foundational year in which we made substantial progress, simplifying Citi and executing the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. With that said, the fourth quarter was clearly very disappointing. Today, I'm going to provide a high-level view on our progress in 2023, discuss our Q4 results and finish with our priorities for '24. We know that 2024 is critical as we prepare to enter the next phase of our journey and we are completely focused on delivering our medium-term targets and our transformation. So turning to what we accomplished in terms of executing our strategy. As you can see on slide five, in 2023, we saw a record year for services where we maintained our number one ranking amongst large institutions in TTS, with client wins up 27% and a sustained win-loss rate above 80%. We've now gained over 100 basis points in share and security services since 2021. In wealth, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets during the year. In USPB, we enjoyed our sixth consecutive quarter of growth and we began to see the early fruits of our investments in key talent in banking. In September, we began the most consequential series of changes to the organization and the running of our firm since the aftermath of the financial crisis. We restructured around five core interconnected businesses to align our organization to our business strategy and to provide greater transparency into their performance. You can now see in our financials, the full year returns and P&L by business. While they are all impacted by investments and transformation expense, it is clear where we have work to do. The simplification of our organization structure will conclude at the end of the first quarter and will result in over $1 billion of run rate saves from the net elimination of approximately 5,000 roles mainly managers. As Mark will detail, this will contribute to the reduction of our expenses in '24. Over the medium term, between simplification, benefits of the transformation, stranded costs and other productivity efforts, we expect to eliminate 20,000 positions ex-Mexico, resulting in over $2 billion in run rate saves. Simplification is also enabling Citi to be more client-focused and less bureaucratic. Realizing the synergies between our five businesses is one of the key drivers to achieving our medium-term revenue target. With this new structure, I'm holding my business leaders accountable for enhancing connectivity across clients and products. In addition, having a Chief Client Officer Act to ensure we're disciplined in bringing the full power of our franchise to our clients. We have now completed the divestitures of nine of our 14 international consumer franchises and have wound down nearly 70% of our total retail loans and deposits in Russia, Korea and China. We've restarted the sales process in Poland and a well down the execution path for the Mexico IPO next year. We're exiting marginal businesses such as munis and a subset of distressed debt trading to focus on our core strengths and allocate our capital with rigor. And without doubt, all these changes are difficult, if they are necessary. At the same time, we continue to invest in our transformation, risk and control environment and data architecture. And we were pleased to have closed the FX consent order with the Federal Reserve. We're committed to fulfilling the expectations of our regulators, given the unique role we play in the global financial system. The modernization of our tech infrastructure is proceeding at pace, allowing us to deliver new capabilities to our clients. During the year, we consolidated trading and reporting platforms and retired 6% of our legacy applications for the second year in a row. These enhancements dovetail with significant investments in our businesses such as hiring commercial bankers to capture share, improving the digital payment capabilities we offer throughout our global network and automating processes for our security services clients. It was also a year where we upgraded talent with key internal promotions supplemented by selective external hires, including Andy Sieg. The simplified reporting structure has been embraced by colleagues. We're feeling empowered by the new structure to serve clients and drive value for shareholders. While Mark will go through the details, I'd like to level set on our disappointing fourth quarter before recapping the full year's results. Earlier this week, we disclosed additional external headwinds, some of which materialized in the second half of December, including a $1.3 billion reserve build related to transfer risk stemming from exposures to Argentina and Russia. We also saw a nearly $900 million negative revenue impact as a result of the larger-than-expected devaluation of the Argentine currency. These items, together with the $1.7 billion FDIC assessment, drove this quarter to a negative EPS of $1.16. And while these items are clearly very painful, they are quite idiosyncratic in nature and will not impact the course we have set. In terms of the performance of our five businesses, while services was the most impacted by the Argentine devaluation. The underlying growth remains very strong, driven by share gains and client wins. Overall, services revenues were up 16% for the full year despite the impact of the Argentine devaluation. In TTS, cross-border transactions were up 15% and AUC, AUA in Security Services were up by close to $3 trillion for the year. In markets, our fixed income results were disappointing as we saw a significant slowdown in December, particularly in rates and FX. Markets was also impacted by the Argentine devaluation. This franchise is well positioned with our corporate clients, and we continue to take actions to improve returns, whether by redeploying capital to high-returning products or exiting products, which aren't a strategic fit. We had a decent quarter in equities, particularly in derivatives and we saw growth in prime balances, an area we have been focusing on. Well activity picked up in the fourth quarter with revenues up 22%. Overall banking revenue continued to be impacted by a weak wallet globally. Investment banking was up slightly for the year and we finished 2023 as the fifth leading franchise. We certainly aspire to be better. We're seeing improved confidence among CEOs and we like our pipeline, but of course, the timing for a robust recovery is uncertain. The share gains we've made in areas such as health care put us in a good position when this business turns more decisively. While investment activity in Asia rebounded with quarterly revenues up 21% and Wealth at Work up 18% for the year. Overall, wealth revenues were down in 2023 and we fully recognized that this business isn't where it needs to be. Andy is off to a fast start. In addition to resetting the expense base and ensuring the right utilization of our balance sheet is tightening our focus to build fee-based revenue streams and investment AUM. With $100 trillion in new wells to be created by 2030 mainly in North America and Asia and with our clients holding $5.4 trillion away from us, we have an important affinity here to drive growth and return to where they should be. USPB was a bright spot with every product up double-digits in the quarter compared to last year, including retail banking, which benefited from a rebound in mortgage origination new and refreshed products have increased customer engagement as we see the benefits of the investments we've made and in Cards, IB and ANR continued their growth reflecting a more balanced lend versus spend mix and falling payment rates. As expected, loss rates are now back to pre-pandemic levels driven by customers in the lower FICO bands. In terms of the full year in 2023, we grew revenues ex-divestures by 4%, although the Argentine devaluation essentially prevented us from reaching the $78 billion revenue mark. We met our full year expense guidance and we increased our CET1 ratio to 13.3% during the year. We grew our tangible book value per share by 6% to $86.19 and we returned $6 billion in capital to our shareholders in the form of common dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to continuing to return capital to investors through both of these channels. As I reflect on the year, I also want to note that we were a source of strength for the system and for clients during a volatile period for the banking sector and geopolitically and I'm very proud of how our people around the world performed during challenging times. 2024 looks to be similar to 2023 in terms of the macro environment with moderating rates and inflation. We expect to see growth slowing globally with the US well positioned to withstand a run-of-the-mill recession should one materialize. With a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and diligent risk management we are well positioned to support our clients through whatever environment comes to path. Moreover, we think environments like these play to our strengths, given how far we are down the path of our simplification and divestitures. 2024 will be a turning point as we will be able to completely focus on the performance of our five businesses and our transformation. I recognize the importance of this year and I am highly confident that we will see the benefits of the actions we've taken through the momentum of our businesses. Backed by investments in key products we believe we can continue to grow revenues ex-divestitures by 4% to 5% over the medium term. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the evolving capital and macro environment to reach our medium-term return targets and return capital to our shareholders whilst continuing the investments needed in our information. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions. Well, thank you very much indeed, Mike. I'll start with who is Citi. Citi is I'm delighted to say finally simple. At Investor Day, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients cross-border needs. That vision was based on five core interconnected businesses. We set out on a deliberate path to get there. And over the last three years, we've done so. Page four is who we are today. We are five interconnected businesses. No more, no less. We have our organization now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses, so that we can meet the medium-term RoTCE target we laid out. And the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the transformation. And I would also be I need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year, Mike. And I and the management team are accountable to deliver and that you and our investors have the transparency need to hold us accountable. So why is this time different? Look, it's not lost on me that there have been many attempts in the past to change this firm. I and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long-term and we are addressing the issues that have held us back in the past. And you've got proof points of the last three years where we've made a lot of tough decisions, and we have put through a tremendous amount of change to get to the simple Citi that we are today. We completely reset our strategy. So we now have a significantly more focused business and operating model. We've announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model. And frankly, from my perspective, more importantly, how we run the bank, since the financial crisis aimed at simplifying the bank and increasing accountability. You've seen we've moved quickly. We're on track with our execution of this effort and it will generate over $1 billion of run rate saves at the end of the first quarter, purely from the organization efforts that we put in, that we announced in September. We've done this while investing and I think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation. And while that was capitalized by our consent orders, these investments will ultimately deliver benefits from automation from well governed data from consolidated platforms. We also have made significant investments in our business to support the 4% to 5% revenue growth and to ensure client momentum. And those investments have helped us expand our product suite, invest in digital capabilities, automate our processes, capture synergies through a client organization. We've also brought in some incredible external talent in key strategic areas, including Andy to lead wealth, and we now have a good balance between experienced Citi people and external talent with fresh perspectives through multiple layers of the organization. So we are doing things the right way. We're doing it for the long-term and we're moving with urgency. We will need and are spending the money that we need to, to address our regulatory requirements, but that's already embedded in our path to the 11% to 12% RoTCE in the medium term. And this already feels like a different bank. We have more work to do. I recognize '24 is a critical year. And as I said, the decks are much clearer now so that we can focus on two imperatives, improving our business performance and executing the transformation. Neither is an entirely linear path as we've seen over the last three years. We all know that. We get, we have to build our credibility. We're committed to doing so and we are providing far more transparency around the business performance, so investors have a better sense of how we're doing, and I and my management team, to your final question, are fully accountable for getting this all done, we will. Mark, expenses? Yeah. And I'll jump in. Let's maybe start with TTS. When we think about the performance of TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year, up 19%, ex-Argentina, came from a combination of both rates and the strong business actions we've taken. And you can see that in the different drivers. Cross-border was up 23%, commercial cards up 8%. And in terms of the growth prospects, we've generated 22% in average revenue growth from '21 to '23, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had a high single-digit. That was not just because of the rate cycle. It obviously helped, and we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid-single digit now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases. And that's going to come from a few different areas. One, the focus on our fee strategy, where we're capitalizing on strong client engagement, market-leading client solutions, and we're delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that we've been investing in across all our client segments. We'll continue optimizing our deposit book and bringing in high-quality deposits. And in a lower rate environment, GDP is typically higher, so you'd expect to see some higher growth in our capital-efficient payment volumes. You'll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. And I point to our confidence here 27% increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained win-loss ratio of 82% on new deals. And that was across different client segments. And revenues from these clients just continues to ramp up as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them. And you'll also continue to see us investing in the infrastructure and platforms we've been doing, launching new innovative products, and we're seeing momentum from some of the things we've recently done, Citi Token Services, Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, et cetera. So I think the main takeaway from TTS is that we'll continue to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum. We've been getting consistently good client feedback regarding our capabilities. So we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as the rate cycle comes down. And it is a crown jewel for a reason. And then just quickly on security services, I think, where we're seeing, we mentioned we've got a number of marquee wins there across all the client segments. That pipeline is both investors and issuers, and one of the core strategies that open put in place was to grow share with the US-based asset managers. We had a very low -- we were at 2.6% share in 2020. We're now at 4.3%. And a lot of the growth in the pipeline has been coming not only from our global network names but also from the marquee players in the US asset manager space. And I think that's our ability to connect our capabilities and that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients. Mark, anything I've missed there? You know I know this business. Yeah, I think, Mark, you're spot on. So we'll continue making the investments we need to in the transformation. It's a multiyear journey as we've always been clear around this, ultimately, with benefits for the shareholders and more of the expense saves that we've been talking about are separate our transformation from sort of the operating expense base of our businesses, which we want to make sure is productive and as effective as possible. And the types of benefits we're seeing, this is second year in a row that we've retired 6% of our legacy platform base. And you've heard me talking about moving 20 of our cash equity platforms onto one, six reporting ledgers on to one, 11 sanction platforms onto one. So we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in. Other things, we automated independent price verification for 90% of our prioritized fixed income and equity securities. That's reduced manual controls. That's improved valuation consistency. That's also had an impact on the efficiency of the business. We've loaded 98% of our prioritized wholesale and consumer data into two authorized repositories that will also begin to start having some benefits for us. So there is a cumulative effect. It is beginning to build now from all the work we've done, but it will take some time to really kick into the, as Mark said, when you really feel it is a few years out, but we'll keep giving you the proof points of things as we're going. So it's not just a trust us, this is coming, you'll begin to see it build. Hi. It's Jane. Obviously, I want to just jump in on one bit, which is, we are committed and we're very confident around the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, and so there isn't any backing away from that number, and that's in various macro environments, et cetera. And as we look across the different businesses and the projections we have, we're confident around that. Obviously, if there is a very adverse macro environment, et cetera, we've got other levers we can take, but Mark, let me pass it to you. The short answer is no. We have -- if you think about our Markets business, we have four businesses each of which are around $4 billion or so in size. You have our Global FX network where we're typically number one in any year just given the strength and particularly the corporate client base we set off. Rates, typically top three, together these are two of the largest macro pools within fixed. In terms of the spread products, we've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our simplification fully within Markets, so that we've created a unified scaled spreads product business. And then finally, equities, where we're focused on improving our prime offering building balances. We still have a way to go obviously in that. Prime balances, we're pleased they were nicely up this year, driven by client momentum, and we are a leading equities derivatives franchise. So you do have these four core businesses and I go back to our big point of differentiation and why we still we feel we're well-positioned, we have a very differentiated corporate client base, and a very strong partnership between our core markets franchise, TTS, and banking, and that -- and security services, and that helps us in FX and commodities and in rates around the world. So, Markets is important, both in terms of its leadership but also how it fits into the strengths that we have from this simplicity of those five core interconnected businesses. We demonstrated solid returns in the past. I think a lot of the actions we've been taking will help drive returns in the future and you should be getting confidence when you see the discipline we're putting onto RWA, 5.3%, getting close that target we set at Investor Day, we're moving that up to 6%. The exits we've got of non-strategic businesses shows our focus on efficiency, and we've also been doing some good investments in our technology and it's getting us into a good place there. So I think don't be concerned about the shrinking, we're just making sure that it really plays to our strengths and we optimize the returns. Hey. Yeah, well, we've also got areas which are growing. So that does help to see -- we have a diversified portfolio here. I think we're very mindful of that there is a human impact of the decisions that we're making. We're trying to be as transparent with our people as we are with our investors about what we need to do, why we're doing it, what to expect and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decisions and then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can. I think that's the most humane way to do this. Erika, it's a great question. It's one I ask myself every morning when I get up, because it -- given where we trade, the value for our shareholders of buybacks is enormous. And Mark and I are very committed to doing so. We also know that we're building our credibility. And I don't want to say things that we're not going to deliver against although we're going to have to change. I think it's one of the values that we're really trying to adhere to very strongly. And with the NPL, I think we'll get a better sense about this soon. The comment period just got extended and we want to see what that is. I think you've all heard us at the Senate banking hearings with our concerns about it. I very much hope that it is either completely revised or very materially, so it doesn't have a negative impact on the economy and the US banking system competitiveness, the move for more business, the shadow banks, which I think has got to a point, which is not healthy. So we're going to wait and see before -- where that comes out before we give it to you, but I would be asking exactly the same question in your shoes as well. Thank you. Yeah. And actually, I also want to kind of take a bigger picture answer to that before I turn it to Mark because I would have thought there's a question that is on everybody's mind, particularly given the firm's overall low level of returns and our headline numbers is this quarter about the -- what we've been doing with Russia and Argentina. So the bigger strategic question behind it, and then we'll get to you on specifics on the Russia front. If you think about Citi, we have a differentiated global business model, and that means we're committed to the countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run. So that means we hold long-term capital in those countries upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle. And if we just point to our leading services and FX businesses are the heart of that network and they're generating double-digits, as you can see. With that footprint comes a set of risks. So I think in terms of credit currency transferability of capital. And we've proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time. And with respect to the Q4 currency and transfer items, while the timing was unknown and we've highlighted those risks in our disclosures for a couple of years. I'd say Russia is rather unique. It's a wall and for us, a highly unusual liquidation. We've navigated it very well. We've executed our wind down in an orderly way with very low losses for our clients and very low losses for us. Our remaining net assets are now 100% reserved against, and I think similarly, if I just touch on Argentina for a minute because I'm sure folks have got a few questions on that. Similarly, over the last several years, we de-risked our business model there. We don't have a consumer bank, so we've really reduced our emerging market exposures to just our institutional presence focused on the multinational clients. You've heard us talk about that and select high-grade local clients. Look at Argentina, it's a very good business for us over the cycle. And even after the impact of Q4, we had less than $5 million in credit losses in Argentina over a 10-year period. That's remarkable, $5 million over 10 years. In terms of the currency risk, we all have to book revenues the official rate versus the parallel market rate. We were able to partially, but not fully hedge the exposure, but we will certainly always take economic decisions on the business we do and did mindful of likely devaluations and capital controls. And the reserve is a reserve, it centers on the ability to convert and transfer capital as per US banking rules. So I just want to put part of the things of this quarter into that context, we have a global business model. It's heavily focused on high-grade multinational clients. Our track record for managing the various risks associated with our global network has been very strong. And I think you're seeing us with a very conservative and a reserve profile. Mark, what would you add? Yes. We certainly had a much more constructive market environment at the end of '23 interest rate spreads and volatility at most of the year, equity prices are high. And I think we view this as a helpful foundation for activity to accelerate in '24, assuming the tailwinds persist. And speaking of our own pipeline, the breadth, the depth, the quality of it is very sound. It's higher than it was pre-COVID. So when markets are constructive, we expect to move these opportunities forward, and we're hearing a lot more confidence from the CEOs, CFOs around this. And when we're looking at our own side, as you know, we've been investing in some higher growth areas. So we get a good balance between our traditionally strong sectors as well as high-growth areas. And we've been seeing some very good momentum in health care and technology as well as areas of traditional strength, which is energy and industrial. And I think we feel very confident in the recovery in DCM, the beginnings of one in 11. And so cautiously optimistic here. I'm not -- so I wouldn't say that it's going to accelerate enormously and with incredible speed, but I think we're feeling much better about the foundation. Mark, anything you'd add? Yeah. Scott, Sorry, I didn't hear what it was. I think the phone line cut out. The revenue in attrition? Okay. No, we haven't. I think a lot of the moves that we've made from the organization simplification. So the 5,000-or-so roles we talked about, they're mainly managerial roles. And they've mainly impacted the functions and the geographies, not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators. And the other piece is with the client organization, we're actually putting much more time into the hands of our people to drive revenue forward. So I think what we're looking at here is it getting a bit of areas of bureaucracy and where we've been too complicated, where we can drive efficiency whilst preserving our frontline and encouraging them to be as revenue-productive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client. So I'd like to see the opposite actually. Hi, Vivek. Let me just -- so let me just be clear about where the ones that we've just done and that we're working on through the organization simplification. So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of the first quarter, as we said, we're expecting to get about $1 billion of run rate saves from the org simplification work alone. That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase III, which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed. That's been a net reduction of about 1,500 managers out of a total of 12,000 roles. So it was about 13%. And these are mainly manager roles, as I talked about earlier. Then when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this, as Mark was talking about earlier, I mean, the stranded costs will be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestures, we'll be continuing, and you've seen it been doing that, exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and the like and being very disciplined about that. We've got some businesses where we feel we need to right-size the core expense base. Andy Sieg is going to be kicking off that in Wealth, and you will begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter. He's off to a strong start. And then we've got other areas where we'll be creating more utilities. We've got -- still got different fragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification as highlighted we'll be aggregating those, creating utilities or consolidating some of those different functions. And that is before we get to beginning to get benefits from the transformation where there will be efficiencies that come through. We'll still have areas that we're investing. These are going to be, as we talked about, core business investments, it's going to be expense growth still in the top -- from volume growth that we've got, and we will be investing in our transformation. And all of this is happening over the medium term to get us to the 11% to 12% RoTCE target we talked about. So that 20,000 is -- it's the number that we estimate at the headcount. I don't love thinking headcount and I'm thinking about expenses. I think it's a more meaningful number. So as Mark laid out in his presentation, we've got a net expense saves that we're expecting to achieve in the medium term, and these are the raft of different areas that we will be contributing to it, and we're working hard at it. 2026. Thank you, Mike."

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start with the fourth quarter and full year firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons, unless I indicate otherwise. I'll also focus on our guidance for 2024 and end with the path to our medium-term return target. The presentation of our results reflects the changes we've made in conjunction with our organizational simplification, including reporting legacy franchises and corporate other in all other. However, before I go into the results, let me walk you through some of the notable items that impacted the quarter that were included in the 8-K we recently filed. At the top right of slide seven, we show these items on a pre-tax basis. The FDIC special assessment of approximately $1.7 billion related to regional bank failures in March. This impacted expenses in all other. A restructuring charge of approximately $780 million related to actions associated with our organizational simplification, which will drive headcount reductions and future savings over the medium term, impacted expenses in all other the impact of the currency devaluation in Argentina of approximately $880 million. This was recorded in noninterest revenue across services, markets and banking and you can see the impact by business in the appendix of the presentation. While we did have an adverse impact from the Argentina devaluation this quarter, we also benefited from high interest rates, earning approximately $250 million of NII on the net investment in the quarter given the hyperinflationary environment and a reserve build of $1.3 billion related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures to Russia and Argentina as described in the 8-K. This impact is mostly included in other provisions and cost of credit and spans multiple businesses due to their globality. The combination of these items negatively impacted diluted EPS by approximately $2 and RoTCE by approximately 920 basis points. Now turning to the left side of the slide where we show our financial results for the full firm. In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $1.8 billion and a net loss per share of $1.16 on $17.4 billion of revenue. Excluding the notable items, diluted EPS would have been $0.84 with an RoTCE of 4.1% for the quarter. In the quarter, total revenues decreased by 3% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the impact of the Argentina devaluation, revenues increased 2% driven by strength across services, USPB and investment banking, partially offset by lower revenues in markets and wealth and the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind down. Turning to expenses, we reported expenses of $16 billion, which include the FDIC special assessment and modest divestiture-related costs. Excluding these items, expenses increased 10% to $14.2 billion, largely driven by the restructuring charge I just mentioned. Cost of credit was approximately $3.5 billion. Excluding the reserve bill for transfer risk, cost of credit was primarily driven by card net credit losses, which are now at pre-COVID levels as well as ACL builds for new card volume. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. And on a full year basis, we delivered $9.2 billion of net income and an RoTCE of 4.9%, adjusting for the notable items, net income was approximately $13.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.3%. On slide eight, we show full year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2023. It is important to highlight that in conjunction with the change to align with our new financial reporting structure, we moved the majority of the financing and securitization business from banking to markets. We also implemented a revenue-sharing arrangement within banking and between banking, services and markets to reflect the benefits of businesses get from our relationship-based lending. These changes are now reflected in our results and our historical financials. Now looking at the full year numbers. Services had a record year with revenues of $18.1 billion, up 16%, benefiting from both rates and business actions, new client wins and deepening with existing clients, partially offset by the Argentina devaluation. Markets revenues decreased 6% to $18.9 billion, largely driven by lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December. The markets business was also impacted by the Argentina devaluation. Banking revenues decreased 15% to $4.6 billion, primarily driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges as well as a decrease in corporate lending. Investment banking revenues were relatively flat for the year as we gained share amidst the declining wallet. Corporate Lending revenues were down 4%, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges. Wealth revenues decreased 5% to $7.1 billion, primarily due to the deposit mix shift towards higher-yielding products, which drove lower deposit spreads. USPB revenues increased 14% to $19.2 billion, primarily driven by growth in card balances as we continue to see the benefit of our investments in digital acquisition and customer engagement. Total revenues, excluding divestitures, came in at $77.1 billion, below our guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion for the year, largely due to the impact of the Argentina devaluation, softer markets performance, particularly in December and losses on loan hedges. However, NIIX ex-markets came in at $47.6 billion in line with our guidance. Despite the challenging environment and the impact of the Argentina devaluation, we grew firm-wide revenues by approximately 4% ex-divestitures in line with our Investor Day target, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model and the investments we've been making. On slide nine, we show full year expense trends from 2021 to 2023, excluding the FDIC special assessment and divestiture-related impacts, full year expenses were $54.3 billion for 2023 in line with our guidance. As I mentioned, this includes roughly $780 million of restructuring costs associated with our organizational simplification and additional severance costs of approximately $730 million, which included actions to address stranded costs and start to right-size the businesses. Relative to the prior year, expense growth continued to be driven by transformation and business-led investments, volume-related expenses and other investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset by productivity savings and a reduction in expenses and legacy franchises within all other. Over the past few years, we've been investing across these themes, which has not only impacted the performance of the firm, but also the businesses. On slide 10, we show the components of our transformation and technology spend from 2021 to 2023. Over the past three years, we have invested significantly in our infrastructure, platforms, applications, processes and data. As you can see in the bar chart at the top of the slide, roughly 30% of our transformation investments over the last three years were in technology, with the remainder related to non-tech employees and consultants. In 2023, we've seen a shift from consulting expenses to technology and compensation as we've gotten deeper into the execution of our transformation. And you should expect to see this trend continue. In total, we invested over $12 billion in technology in 2023. Beyond transformation, our technology investments are also focused on digital innovation, new product development, client experience enhancements and areas that support our infrastructure like cloud and cyber. On slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Across branded cards and retail services, approximately 80% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And across both portfolios, NCL rates have reached pre-COVID levels, but we continue to be well reserved with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 7.7%. In our corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade, which is reflected in our low level of nonaccrual loans at 63 basis points of total corporate loans. We feel good about the quality and mix of our portfolio and are well reserved for the current environment. As it relates to Argentina, we've included a slide in the appendix summarizing the value it brings to the global network and the broader institutional client relationships we hold as well as the strength of our financial profile in Argentine. As it relates to Russia, we've also included a slide in the appendix. You will see that the reserves for transfer risk that we have taken have significantly reduced our net investment and therefore our risk of loss related to Russia. On slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet, which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base, which is deployed into high-quality diversified assets. The majority of our deposits, $801 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries and are complemented by $426 billion of US personal banking and wealth deposits. We have approximately $561 billion of HQLA and approximately $690 billion of loans and we maintained total liquidity resources of $965 billion. Our LCR decreased modestly to 116% and our tangible book value per share was $86.19, up 6%. On the bottom left corner of the slide, we show a full CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers in 2023. First, we generated $8 billion of net income to common, which added 70 basis points. Second, we returned $6.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 53 basis points. Third, we benefited from the impact of lower rates on our AFS investment portfolio, which drove an increase of 20 basis points. And finally, the remaining three basis points was largely driven by higher RWA, partially offset by capital releases from the exit markets. We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 100 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. As you can see, we've grown our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points over the course of the year while returning over $6 billion to shareholders in common dividends and repurchases. Before I take you through each business, as Jane mentioned, we are not satisfied with the performance and returns of our businesses. And therefore, we are laser-focused on executing against our strategy, simplifying the organization and rightsizing the expense base. As a reminder, the investments that we've been making have impacted each of the businesses, as you will see in the next few slides. So now turning to slide 13, where we show the results for services for the fourth quarter and the full year. Revenues were up 6% this quarter, largely driven by NII across TTS and security services, partially offset by NIR, driven by the Argentina devaluation. Services noninterest revenues were up 20%, excluding the impact of the Argentina devaluation. Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in technology, product innovation and client experience. Cost of credit was $646 million, driven by a reserve build of approximately $652 million primarily associated with transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Net income decreased to $776 million as higher revenues were more than offset by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. Average loans were up 6%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS, both in North America and internationally. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisition and deepening with existing clients. However, sequentially, deposits were up 1%. Services delivered an RoTCE of 13.4% for the quarter. And for the full year, services delivered an RoTCE of 20% on $18.1 billion of revenue. On slide 14, we show the results for markets for the fourth quarter and the full year. Markets revenues were down 19% versus a strong quarter last year, driven by a decline in fixed income and the impact of the devaluation, partially offset by an increase in equities. Fixed income revenues decreased by 25% largely driven by rates and currencies on lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December as well as the impact of devaluation. However, we saw a good underlying momentum in equities with revenues up 9%, driven by gains across all products and we continue to grow prime balances while making solid progress on our revenue to RWA targets. Expenses increased 8%, driven by investments in transformation and risk and controls and volume-related costs, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $209 million, driven by a reserve build of approximately $179 million, primarily associated with the transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Markets reported a net loss of $134 million as revenues were more than offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Average loans increased 4% to $115 billion as we saw increased client demand for credit driving growth in warehouse lending. Average trading assets increased 18% to $391 billion, largely driven by treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, given the strong client activity in fixed income for much of the year. While it was a challenging quarter, markets performed relatively well for the full year with revenue of $18.9 billion and an RoTCE of 7.4% compared with very strong performance in the prior year and we are focused on improving returns over time through a combination of revenue growth, expense discipline and capital optimization. On slide 15, we show the results for banking for the fourth quarter and the full year. Banking revenues increased 22%, driven by growth in investment banking fees and lower losses on loan hedges, partially offset by lower corporate lending revenue. Investment banking revenues increased 27% year-over-year, driven by DCM and advisory due to improvements in market sentiment. In advisory, we saw signs of strength across technology, health care and energy, and we feel good about the strength of our pipeline. Corporate lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges decreased 26%, largely driven by lower revenue share from investment banking services and markets. Expenses increased 37%, primarily driven by the absence of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year. Excluding the reserve release, expenses were roughly flat. Cost of credit was $185 million, driven by a reserve build associated with the transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. The NCL rate was 32 basis points of average loans and we ended the quarter with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 1.6%. Banking reported a net loss of $322 million as higher expenses and cost of credit more than offset higher revenue. RoTCE was negative 6% for the quarter. And for the full year, banking reported an RoTCE of negative 0.2% on $4.6 billion of revenue. So clearly, we have more work to do on returns. And while it's difficult to predict when activity will normalize, we're positioning the business to capitalize on the rebound in the market wallet, and that includes continuing to invest in key growth areas, upgrading talent in traditional sectors and continuing to right-size the business. On slide 16, we show the results for wealth for the fourth quarter and the full year. Wealth revenues decreased 3%, driven by lower deposit spreads, partially offset by lower mortgage funding costs and higher investment fee revenues. We're seeing good momentum in noninterest revenue, which was up 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher investment assets, increased client activity and market performance. Expenses were up 4%, primarily driven by investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset by replacing strategic investments and tighter expense control as we begin to right-size the expense base in the business. Wealth reported a net income of $5 million as revenues were mostly offset by higher expenses. Client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher client investment assets, partially offset by lower deposit balance. Average loans were flat as we continue to optimize capital usage. Average deposits decreased 2%, reflecting the continued mix shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by new acquisitions and the benefit from higher market valuation, and we're seeing good momentum in net new assets, which more than doubled to $16 billion for the quarter. For the full year, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets. RoTCE was 0.1% for the quarter. And for the full year, RoTCE was 2.6% on $7.1 billion of revenue. Looking ahead, we're going to improve the returns in the business as we invest in talent to execute on our refocused strategy to drive investment revenue with an eye towards rightsizing the expense base. We will wind down non-core initiatives, exit less productive performers and enhance discipline across every expense line. On slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the fourth quarter and the full year. US Personal Banking revenues increased 12%. Branded cards revenues increased 10%, driven by higher net interest margin and interest-earning balances growth of 13% and we continue to see healthy growth in new account acquisition up 8% and spend volumes up 3%. Retail services revenues increased 15% also driven by higher net interest margin and interest-earning balance growth of 11% as well as lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses. Retail banking revenues increased 15%, driven by higher deposit spreads, loan growth and improved mortgage margins. Expenses decreased 1% as higher expenses to support lending programs and client engagement as well as the rollout of simplified banking were offset by lower non-volume-related expenses. Cost of credit of $2.1 billion, increased 20%, driven by higher NCLs, partially offset by a lower ACL build. Net income increased to $201 million, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Average deposits decreased 5%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. We continue to make progress against our digital strategy with digital deposits up 14% and active digital users increasing 6%. RoTCE for the quarter was 3.6%. And for the full year, US Personal Banking delivered an RoTCE of 8.3% or $19.2 billion of revenue. Here again, we are focused on improving the return profile of the business. Managing through this part of the credit cycle and continuing to make progress in retail banking will be key. On slide 18, we show results for all other on a managed basis, which includes corporate other and legacy franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 17%, driven by a decrease in NII of 29% driven by the closed exits and wind down, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue and expenses increased to $4.5 billion, driven by the FDIC special assessment and restructuring costs, partially offset by lower expenses in both wind down and exit markets. Turning to slide 20, as we kick off 2024, the environment remains somewhat uncertain and markets remain difficult to predict. But based on what we see today, we expect revenues to be approximately $80 million to $81 billion, as shown on the left side of the slide. And on the right side of the slide, we list the key drivers. In TTS, we expect revenue growth to be driven by new client wins, deepening with our existing clients and continued momentum with commercial clients as we continue to leverage our global footprint and product innovation. In Security Services, we have a very healthy pipeline, and we'll continue to on-board assets under custody from new mandates, win new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. In Investment Banking, we anticipate a rebound in activity and to maintain our position as the wallet recovers. Over time, we do expect the investments that we've made in key growth areas, such as health care and technology to allow us to gain share. And we also expect a modest rebound in wealth as we execute on our refocused strategy with an eye towards growing investment fees, particularly with our existing clients. In USPB, we expect continued growth in card balances driven by the investments we've been making as well as lower partner payments in retail services to continue to drive revenue growth. We also expect to continue to improve our retail brand performance. And as it relates to NII, excluding markets, we expect net interest income to be down modestly as the volume growth we expect from loans and deposits is more than offset by lower US rates and the reduction from the closed exits and wind down. Turning to slide 21. We expect expenses to be approximately $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, down from $54.3 billion, subject to volume-related expenses. The decrease in expenses will be driven by the benefits of our organizational simplification, a continued reduction from exit markets and wind down and productivity savings partially offset by investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses. Embedded in this guidance, includes an elevated level of severance as well as additional potential costs related to the organizational simplification totaling approximately $700 million to $1 billion. This will contribute to reducing headcount over 2024 and the medium term, which we will discuss on the next slide. On slide 22, we show the drivers of headcount and expense reduction over the medium term. As we've discussed in the past, there are three drivers that will reduce our expenses, organizational simplification, including the reduction of management layers, eliminating stranded costs as we take additional actions to reduce excess overhead in light of the exit markets and realizing productivity savings from our investments in the transformation and technology. We expect the combination of these three drivers to reduce our headcount by a net 20,000, excluding Mexico and generate a net run rate save of $2 billion to $2.5 billion over the medium term. This will underpin our path to $51 million to $53 billion of expenses, subject to volume-related expenses. Both the headcount and expense reduction will allow us to right-size the firm and businesses to improve performance and returns. On slide 23, we show our outlook for US Cards in 2024. In terms of credit performance, based on the trends that we're seeing, we expect NCL rates both in branded cards and retail services portfolios to rise above pre-COVID levels and peak in 2024. On a full year basis for 2024, we expect the branded card's NCL rates to be in the range of 3.5% to 4% and the retail services NCL rate to be in the range of 5.75% to 6.25%. From an allowance perspective, we are reserved for a weighted eight quarter average unemployment rate of almost 5%, which embeds a downside scenario of approximately 6.8%. ACL builds in 2024 will primarily be a function of the volume growth that we see as well as changes in the macro scenarios and the probabilities associated with them and we expect continued momentum in cards, albeit more in line with mid-single-digit loan growth. On slide 24, we summarize our medium-term targets. From a revenue perspective, we continue to expect 4% to 5% revenue CAGR in the medium term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exits and the wind down. From an expense perspective, we're now on the path to lowering our expenses beginning in 2024. From a credit perspective, we expect credit costs to be a function of portfolio mix, volumes and macro assumptions. And we are committed to returning capital to our shareholders and, in fact, expect to do a modest level of buybacks in the first quarter of 2024. So to wrap it up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are confident we are on the right path to deliver our 11% to 12% RoTCE in the medium term. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. Yeah. Thanks, Jane. And why are expenses down more? I think, to your point, Jane, we've been investing in the franchise, both on the front end and importantly on the transformation and the risk and controls. What I would point out is that in 2023, we delivered expenses of $54.3 billion, ex the FDIC charge. That is the guidance that we gave. But I'd also highlight that we also included $780 million associated with the restructuring charge that is more than I had articulated in the way of guidance. So the capacity that we created through our efforts through the year, we use that in a smart way. We use that to fund the org simplification costs so that we can realize the savings down the line and we're going to continue to manage our expenses in a disciplined and smart fashion. That means spending what we need to spend on the transformation and risk and controls, but driving greater efficiencies and productivities along the way to ensure we get to that 11% to 12%. And to your point of revenues are to come down or come in lower-than-expected, we'll adjust the expenses accordingly. Yeah, thanks, Glenn. I guess, I'll start and Jane, feel free to add in on it. Look, it is a balancing act, right, and we do look at each of our five core businesses. We, obviously, are clear on the strategy, but where is the growth, where the return opportunities associated with them, and how do we ensure we are deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We have to juxtapose that against the required investments to modernize our operations and we're making those trade-offs on a regular basis. But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, we're agile, we're trying to be agile about it, which means, if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting, because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to dial them back and that's what you've seen over the past year-plus, is that we've been investing in the business where we didn't see the upside that we anticipated, we dialed back that spend, right, and that's the type of iterative process, if you will, Glenn, that we're putting in place to ensure that on the other side of this we're still positioned to capture growth. Investment Banking, for example, we've invested in healthcare and technology, building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds. We feel good about that. We've done similar things in the way of our wealth business. We are investing heavily in our TTS franchise to ensure we can remain competitive there. So it's that type of discipline that's required. It is sometimes a trade-off, but it's one that we've been very focused on being smart about. Yes, sure. Do you want me to? Sure. As you said, rightly, so high returning business, great growth prospects. To answer one of your questions, Glenn, about half of the NII growth we could attribute to interest rates and about half, I'd say, is business action, so us working with the clients to drive that momentum. And then if you think about the noninterest revenue for services. They're up about 20% in the quarter year-over-year, if you exclude the impact of the Argentina devaluation and up 7% on a full year basis. And so good momentum in the noninterest revenue growth as well. Yeah, sure. So look, John, obviously the Basel III proposal still out there and under discussion. We've been very vocal about the potential impact of that. We've also been very disciplined about how we've been managing our capital. We've built that over 30 basis points over the course of the year. You've seen us actively manage that through the year. We're going to continue to do that. We obviously, generate earnings that contribute to that. We want to continue to drive growth across the business. We're trading at 0.5 times book, where we can we want to buy back as much as we can in shares and we tried to be disciplined about that over the past couple of quarters doing that as a modest level. You heard me saying -- you heard me say, we're going to do that again this quarter at a modest level. But we're going to be -- we have to be thoughtful about what those headwinds might look like and we're actively working what mitigation actions we have to put in place, should it turn out closer to the way the current proposal sit. So it's an ongoing active management that drives the balance servicing our client needs, with obviously, holding a responsible amount of capital in light of the uncertainty that's out there, and with an eye towards buy backs where we can do that. Yeah. So to be clear, we're going to continue to spend whatever we need to spend on the transformation and on risk and controls. And so we did see a tick up this year. We've got a plan for 2024. And if we've got to spend a bit more than what we spent this year, we're going to spend more. That's what the plan calls for. And so that's what we'll do. That's inside of the number that I've given you for guidance, right? And so that is -- that's important for us. I think it will drive, obviously, operational improvement and saves down the line. It is part of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion, but that is the early stage, if you will, of the transformation spend paying back. I think as we talked about at Investor Day, frankly, we'll continue to see expense benefits beyond the medium term from some of this transformation investment that we've been making. And so I would think of the medium term as the start of the benefits that we'll see from the investments we've been making in transformation and risk and control. Yeah, I think the thing I'd point out to you is a couple of things. One, obviously we're forecasting revenue growth over this period of time. And so it's going to be volume-related expenses associated with that. The second thing I'd point out, as I just mentioned to the prior question, is that we're continuing to invest in risk and controls and in the transformation over this period of time. And so what you see is, there is an increase in expenses associated with at least those two things and that's offset by the savings that we're starting to generate, particularly from the org simplification that Jane has talked about, as well as from the stranded cost reduction that will continue to play out, as well as from some of the rightsizing of businesses that we've referenced in some of the prepared remarks. And so important to think about their headwinds and tailwinds that kind of net down to this $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And then the final point that I'd make is, if I look at this medium-term number of $51 billion to $53 billion that still has Mexico in it. And in one of the other pages, we point to expenses around Mexico, but because of where we are, will be in the IPO process, that's still going to be part of this expense base. And so, you can't lose sight of that. As you know, it's a tough business to forecast, certainly for full year and in some instances for a quarter. And so we basically kind of back that out, but we've assumed markets kind of flat to modestly down, but we've backed it out, and it's roughly flat. Not of the 81 -- not of the 80 to 81, but you see the guidance of NIR ex-markets and NII ex-market. So in the 80 to 81, we've assumed it roughly flat. And I by no means was trying to suggest that we weren't confident in the forecast for the top-line. If you think about the strategy and the strength of those five core businesses, we've got a lot of conviction around that. With that said, as you pointed out, Jane, under a circumstance where that doesn't play out, obviously, volume-related incentive comp expenses and the like that would naturally come down, we'd ensure that they came down with the revenue decline or shortfall, and then we'd recalibrate other spend -- other investments spend not related to risk and control and transformation, but other investments across the platform we'd recalibrate accordingly. Good afternoon. Yeah, I think what I pointed to is in the range of the 81 -- the 80 to 81. We are assuming three to six cuts, right? You got a range there and the reason I describe it like that, excuse me, is that if you think about our IRE, as we've shown it in the Qs before, we are positioned such that with a 100 basis point move parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple $100 million, right, and so to the negative, obviously, but it's a couple of $100 million. And so as we think about that forecast, and as I mentioned, NII being down a bit, that covers kind of three to six cuts over the course of 2024, likely back-loaded, but that's what's in there. Yeah, very quickly on the Russia point, as you know and as the slide points out, we continue to bring our exposure down there. It's down to $6.5 billion, it's down 13% from the previous year. And a third from 2021, we brought down the consumer loans, the consumer deposits in a significant way there. And essentially, what's left in -- is that we have a custody business and we are holding corporate dividends that are our clients' proceeds. We're unable to pay those out by law by regulation. And so we have to hold those and that's what's being referenced in the slide where we say unremitdable Russia corporate dividends. And so that is not a risk that -- of loss for us, but we're unable to kind of clear those because of the state of play in Russia at this stage. Sure. There's a step-up coming. We give a forecast when '23 as you point out to what the full year estimate for NCLs will be for both branded and for retail services. What I'd point out is you can see actually on the slide how there was a dip in loss rates during the COVID period. And so to some extent, what we're seeing is kind of a catch-up of those as those portfolios go through a longer maturation than what you'd normally see in our cards portfolio. On top of that, we've been originating new card, you've noticed our acquisitions have grown, so we obviously have new card loans and those are going through a much more normal maturation period. And so as we look at kind of the early buckets and the delinquencies that are playing out, we've got a pretty good sense for when we would expect those to peak and at what level. And we think they'll peak inside of '24, so that's captured in that average forecast that we've given. We haven't made material changes to our underwriting. However, there is mix evolution that happens. Transactors, we have a number of transactors that have kind of come on to our portfolio and are in the mix of our branded portfolio as well. And so anyway, those are the drivers that give us confidence and inform the trajectory that we -- that we're talking about here. Yeah. Again, I mean, when I think about our interest rate exposure and for US dollar, in particular, we showed it in our last Q, we'll show it in this Q for a 100 basis point move in a parallel shift, we're looking at probably a negative $1.6 billion or so. But important to point out that the US dollar component of that is only a couple of hundred million dollars. Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive of 100, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure. So our US dollar exposure is relatively neutral again, assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in the curve. And so we're kind of neutral relative to rates moving in either direction and therefore the impact there. I completely agree. I think what I'd say is that you should expect that in the first quarter, we'd likely see an uptick in our total expenses relative to the fourth, in part because, as Jane has mentioned, we anticipate that there'll be more to the org simplification and, therefore, dollars associated with that in Q1. And then from there, I would expect that you'd see a downward trend through the fourth quarter. Yeah. Modest declines outside, but yes, declines outside as well, but not nearly of the magnitude of what we're talking about in the US. So let's see. So obviously, the proposals out there, and we've factored in what's knowable as it relates to that. We haven't given guidance externally on what that impact is, but we do believe there offsets and mitigants that over time, we'll be able to kind of bring into play. And so long-winded way of saying our revenue forecast does assume some basic level of late-fee adjustment. I mean there are a lot of factors in there. There's obviously as well the mix as it relates to what we have in the US versus outside of the US. So it's -- there are a number of factors there and probably too much to kind of take you through on the call here, but we're happy to kind of follow-up with you off-line and take you through it. Yes, it's --"

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJen Landis: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings. And I'm joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Now let me pass it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Jen, and good morning to everyone. I should touch briefly on the macro environment before reviewing the quarter and last month's organizational announcement. The global macro backdrop remains the story of desynchronization. In the U.S., recent data implies a soft landing, but history would suggest otherwise, and we are seeing some cracks in the lower FICO consumers. In the euro area and the U.K., the picture has turned distinctly more negative. The summer weakness in industrial economies is spreading fast and the weight of structurally higher labor and energy costs, suggest a more enduring competitiveness challenge for that region. China's economy may have reached a cyclical bottom supported by the government's modest stimulus efforts, but it still has to work through weak sentiment, youth unemployment, and the pain in its property market. All of these macro dynamics have clearly impacted client sentiment. September is always a busy month seeing clients, and I'm struck how consistently CEOs are less optimistic about 2024 in a few months ago. The shift in the rates question from how high to how long has catalyzed more client activity. However, corporates have stopped waiting for rates to come down and are beginning to access the debt capital markets around the globe. Our multinational clients are adapting their operations to the evolving geopolitical landscape and are building redundancy and resiliency. And this plays to our strengths and strategy, in particular our invaluable global network. And between our high quality asset portfolio, our strong reserve levels, our ample liquidity, and our diversified earnings base, we are proving to our clients that we are truly a bank for all seasons. Turning to the quarter. Today, we reported net income of $3.5 billion, an EPS of $1.63, and an RoTCE of 7.7%. Our revenues were up 10%, ex-divestitures and each of our five core interconnected businesses posted revenue growth. We remain on-track to meet the revenue and expense guidance we set for the year. Let's start with our fastest-growing business, services. TTS was up 12% from a year-ago. That's the highest revenue quarter in over a decade and it continues to outpace the target we set at Investor Day. Half of that growth was business drivers, and the other half rates. And even with the impact of the long-expected Argentine devaluation, we again drove fee growth, which is the best sign of the potential of our globally leading franchise. We keep relentlessly innovating for our clients. Amongst other launches this quarter, we announced the creation of Citi Token Services, which will use distributed ledger and smart contract technologies to deliver a digital asset solution for our TTS clients. And this is the first for the industry as it allows us to seamlessly integrate a permission tokenized bank deposit network with traditional cash services such as 24/7 dollar clearing. Security Services had revenue growth of 16% with some good underlying fee growth. We took share again, and we have grown our AUC and AUA by over $2 trillion in the last year. This business has considerable momentum and a strong pipeline of clients who are benefiting from the cloud and data investments we're making. Markets was up 10% year-over-year, on the back of rates and currencies, having the best quarter in 10 years, and commodities, which also grew nicely. This was partially offset by equities, which was down slightly. Despite this, we continued to see good momentum in cash and we have grown our prime balances year-to-date. Banking had a good quarter with revenues up 17%, with activity playing to our mix. Now while corporate lending was essentially flat as we remain very disciplined about how we use our balance sheet, DCM was healthier. And the IPO market also showed some signs of life. This helped drive investment banking revenue up 34%, albeit off a low base and a small wallet. Sitting here today, it remains hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound, still I am proud of our role advising on some of the biggest deals globally so far this year. As you know, we are committed to growing our banking franchise. We brought together the management of the investment, corporate and commercial banks under one umbrella, and this structure will help us better drive important synergies between all three. We've been bringing in new talent in key sectors. And we've begun to provide more leverage finance for key clients in the right situation. U.S. Personal Banking was also up double digits at 13%. Cards revenues were strong in both our branded and retail services portfolios. The growth in spending is decelerating. And the consumer is more mindful what they spend on. Indeed, the affluent, who still have excess savings at their disposal, drove the growth in spending with a continued tilt to travel and entertainment. During the quarter, we introduced Simplified Banking, to improve the client experience for our retail banking clients. We believe that by peering offerings and simplifying our fee structure, we're going to incentivize our clients to deepen their relationships with us. And the early reaction from clients along those lines has been very positive. Wealth revenues have stabilized and were up slightly. Most notably investment revenues picked up across all geographies and the drivers of the franchise, such as referrals, client acquisition and net new inflows were all quite strong around the world. And we won important new mandates for Wealth at Work, an offering we had highlighted at Investor Day. Andy Sieg has now officially joined our firm. This is the time of massive global wealth creation and our franchise is uniquely positioned for it. Andy will ensure we are at the forefront of what's happening around the world. In terms of our balance sheet, our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base over the past five years. We grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains extremely strong, aided by our disciplined client selection. Our CET1 ratio grew to 13.5%, which is $14 billion above our regulatory minimum and still includes a 100 bps internal management buffer. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and stock buybacks. We continue to evaluate buybacks quarter-by-quarter. And I expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board. And while the ultimate impact of potentially high capital requirements won't be known until the Basel III end game is finalized, we have been actively working through, mitigating actions. As you can see on Slide 3, we are relentless in executing our strategy. This quarter, we closed on the sale of our Taiwan consumer business, and that's the second largest of the Asia consumer divestitures. And earlier this week, we announced that we will sell our consumer wealth portfolio in China to HSBC. And this includes approximately $2.6 billion in assets under management and $1 billion of deposits. In the fourth quarter, we expect to close down the sale of our Indonesia consumer business. In terms of the International consumer businesses, we are exiting. In addition to the three wind-down market, we have restarted the sales process in Poland and we remain on-track to separate Mexico next year, followed by an IPO in 2025. Transformation remains our number one priority. We're deep into the large body of work of automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms, and upgrading our data architecture. We're committed to doing this the right way, knowing it will take time to meet our regulators' expectations and to deliver a modern, more efficient infrastructure. Last month, we announced consequential changes that align our organizational structure with our strategy and changes how we run the bank. I said at the Investor Day, the organizational simplification would follow the divestitures. The changes will eliminate layers, duplication and complexity, allowing us to operate the bank more agilely and freeing our people up to focus on clients and execution. Elevating the five core businesses to my leadership team will enable me to drive greater accountability and sustainable results, so to bring it to life. The actions we've taken in the last few weeks will eliminate over 15% of the regional and functional roles at the top two layers of the company. It also take out 60 committees, which frees up over tens of thousands of people hours annually. We've identified approximately a 1,000 or 50% of our internal financial management reports that we won't need any longer. And we have taken out co-heads and dual reporting lines to enable faster decision-making. We're cascading these changes through the organization at pace. We announced the first two layers in September, and the next set of changes will be implemented by mid-November and we aim to bring the entire process to a close by early next year. When we speak in January, Mark and I will be in a position to update you on the financial and other metrics, sharing the impact of the simplification amongst other details. Now, while expenses is not the primary driver of the organizational changes, they will help us start bending expense curve in the fourth quarter of next year. And at the end of the work, we will have a simpler firm that can operate faster, better serve our clients, and unlock value for our shareholders. We've made tough decisions here, and I want to note how pleased I've been with how the leaders of the firm, especially the next generation have embraced these changes and are stepping up to implement them. They fully understand that we need to change how we run, Citi, in order to truly transform it once and for all. Before I close, I'd like to address our people in Israel. We are a significant bank in the country. And many of our people have lost friends and loved ones. Others are being called up to serve. Despite all they are dealing with, they are keeping our bank running in the country. And I'm frankly in all of their commitment to our clients and each other. More broadly, the price innocent civilians are paying as this crisis unfolds is absolutely devastating to witness. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mark. And then we will be delighted as always to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63, and an RoTCE of 7.7% on $20.1 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are divestiture-related impacts of approximately $214 million after tax, primarily driven by the Taiwan consumer business sale. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.52, with an RoTCE of 7.2%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 9% on a reported basis and 10% excluding divestiture-related impacts, driven by strength across services, cards and markets as well as modest growth in banking, partially offset by the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs. Our results include expenses of $13.5 billion, up 6% on a reported basis and $13.4 billion excluding divestiture-related costs, also up 6%. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, up 35%, primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses and volume growth. At the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. And year-to-date, we reported an RoTCE of 8.3%. On Slide 5, we show expense drivers for the third quarter as well as our key investment themes. Expenses were up 6% and our level of expenses continue to be driven by a number of factors, including investments in transformation, as well as risk and controls, business-led and enterprise-led investments, macro factors including inflation and FX, severance, which was approximately $190 million in the quarter, and roughly $640 million on a year-to-date basis. This included actions across banking, markets, wealth and the functions. And all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the closed exits and wind-downs. And our technology spend across the firm was $3 billion in the quarter, up 8%, largely driven by investments in product development, platform enhancements, and improving the client experience. Also driving the increase is continued investment in technology for the transformation as we address the consent orders and modernize the firm. As we said last quarter, our transformation and technology investments span the following themes: platform and process simplification, security and infrastructure modernization, client experience enhancements, and data improvements. And we remain in line with our full year guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessment. On Slide 6, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans, where I will speak to sequential variances. In the third quarter, net interest income decreased by $72 million. Excluding markets, net interest income increased $332 million, primarily driven by growth in PBWM as we continue to see loan growth and higher loan spreads, a pickup in services driven by higher deposit spreads as a result of higher interest rates and active beta management, partially offset by reductions from closed exits and wind-downs. Average loans were up 1%, largely driven by growth in U.S. Personal Banking across Cards and retail banking as well as TTS. Average deposits were down 2%, largely driven by Services, as we saw non-operational deposit outflows as expected in light of quantitative tightening. And our net interest margin increased 1 basis point. On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment, with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio was nearly 2.7%, and within that U.S. cards is 7.8%. In PBWM, 45% of our loans are in U.S. cards, and of that exposure, 80% is to customers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And both Branded Cards and Retail Services NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels, but are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 55% of our PBWM loans are largely in wealth, predominantly in mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. Corporate non-accrual loans increased by $490 million, but remain low at 68 basis points of total corporate loans. And we ended the quarter with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 1%. As you can see on the page, we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totals approximately $65 billion, of which 86% is investment grade, with a total reserve to funded loan ratio of 1.4%. To give you a sense of the macro scenario that underpin our over $20 billion of reserves, our current scenario weighted average unemployment rate is approximately 5%, which includes a downside scenario, with an average unemployment rate of roughly 7%. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels, and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high-quality diversified assets. Our balance sheet reflects our strategy and well-diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global needs. The majority of our deposits, $782 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries. These institutional deposits are complemented by $416 billion of U.S. Personal Banking and global wealth deposits. We have approximately $569 billion of HQLA and approximately $666 billion of loans and we maintained total liquidity resources of $937 billion. Our LCR was 117%. We ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 ratio based on standardized RWA, which is our binding constraint. Although not binding, our advanced RWA did increase this quarter, largely driven by business activity. And our tangible book value per share was $86.90, up 8% from a year ago. On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more details on the drivers this quarter. Starting from the end of the second quarter, first, we generated $3.2 billion of net income to common, which added 28 basis points; second, we returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 13 basis points; and finally, the remaining 2 basis points increase was primarily driven by lower DTA deductions and a net reduction in RWA. We ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately a 120 basis points or $14 billion above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3% as of October 1st. Before we move on, I'd like to spend a minute on capital. We continue to optimize our RWA and capital, which we expect to be a tailwind over-time. Contributing to this is the execution of our strategy, such as further diversifying our business mix and simplifying our business model, including exiting our 14 international consumer markets. Our investments in the transformation will continue to enhance our data analytics and stress testing capabilities, enabling continued capital optimization. And of course, in light of the evolving regulatory environment, we're also looking at other mitigating actions. But those will largely depend on how the final capital rules play-out. These actions could include exiting or restructuring certain products, divesting certain equity investments, and re-evaluating both how we deploy capital and our management buffer. We've consistently demonstrated our ability to manage our RWA and capital levels through various macro environment and the evolving regulatory landscape, and we'll continue to do so. On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the third quarter. Revenues were up 12% this quarter, driven by double-digit growth across services, markets and banking. In the quarter, normal course foreign currency translation impacts drove a net revenue headwind in ICG. On an ex-FX basis, ICG revenues would have been up 15%. Additionally, there was an approximately $180 million negative impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina on our net investment in the country, mainly across TTS, markets and security services. Expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $196 million, including $51 million of net credit loss. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.4 billion, up 12% driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Average loans were down 4% as we were very deliberate about how we deployed resources across the businesses, including the reduction in subscription credit facilities. Average deposits were flat as new client acquisition and deepening of relationships with existing clients were offset by non-operational deposit outflows. ICG delivered an RoTCE of 10% for the quarter and 11% year-to-date. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, we recorded our highest revenue quarter in the last decade. Revenues were up 12%, driven by 17% growth in net interest income. Non-interest revenues were up 1%, and on an ex-FX basis, non-interest revenues would have been up 8%. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with cross-border flows up 16%, outpacing global GDP growth and year-to-date, cross-border flows were up 12%. U.S. dollar clearing volumes are up 6% both year-over-year in the quarter and year-to-date. And commercial card volumes were up 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in business-to-business payments and travel and entertainment spends. And year-to-date, commercial card volumes were up 20%. In fact, similar to the last few quarters, client wins are up approximately 40% across all client segments. These include marquee mandates, where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. We continue to make good progress on our commercial client strategy, as year-to-date wins more than doubled, driven by expansion into new markets and growth in multiproduct mandates from clients with cross-border needs. In Securities Services, revenues were up 16%, driven by higher net interest income across currencies. Non-interest revenues were up 3%. We're very pleased with the progress we're seeing in Security Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration which are up approximately 10% or $2.1 trillion. Markets revenues were up 10%, driven by fixed income. Fixed income revenues were up 14%, largely driven by strength in our rates and currency franchise. While volatility remains subdued versus a year ago, we did see overall volatility tick higher relative to the beginning of the quarter. Equities revenues were down 3%, driven by a decline in equity derivatives, partially offset by growth in cash and prime. And we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA target. And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were up 17%, driven by investment banking, which increased 34% on a reported basis and 12% excluding marks. Here too, we saw a pickup in activity in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, particularly in DCM, but also in M&A as we closed a few deals earlier than expected. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, and there's more work to be done, we're making solid progress against our strategy in these businesses. Now turning to Slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 10%, driven by net interest income growth of 9% and a 20% increase in non-interest revenue, primarily due to lower partner payments in retail services and higher investment product revenues in wealth. Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by risk and control investments and severance, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $1.5 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 2%, largely reflecting our clients putting cash to work in investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 8.8% and 6.6% on a year-to-date basis. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. This quarter was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Personal Banking, driven by cards. Branded cards revenues were up 12%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 5%, card spend volumes up 4%, and average loans up 12%. Retail services revenues were up 21%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments on the heels of higher net credit losses. In the card portfolios, we continue to see the investments we've been making as well as lower payment rates contribute to growth in interest-earning balances of 15% in Branded Cards and 12% in retail services. Retail banking revenues decreased 3%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business, partially offset by higher deposit spreads. Wealth revenues were up 2%, driven by higher investment fees across all regions and segments. The benefit from relationships transferred from retail banking and higher lending revenue. We also saw strong net new inflows across all regions. And year-to-date, new client acquisitions were up almost 30% in the private bank and over 60% in wealth at work. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making across these businesses. On Slide 14, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues were down 13%, largely driven by the difference in one-time gain on sale impacts in the Asia consumer businesses as well as the reductions from closed consumer exits and wind-downs, partially offset by higher revenue in Mexico. It's worth noting that Mexico's revenues were up 32%, primarily driven by Mexican peso appreciation, higher interest rates, and volume growth. Ex-FX, Mexico revenues were up 16%. Expenses decreased 3%, primarily driven by closed consumer exits and wind-downs, partially offset by separation costs in Mexico and Mexican peso appreciation. And expenses in Mexico were up 27% and but ex-FX expenses were up 11%. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by the absence of mark-to-market impacts on certain derivative transactions in the prior year. And expenses decreased, largely driven by lower consulting fees. On Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our full year 2023 outlook. With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts. Having said that, based on what we've seen play out year-to-date in terms of U.S. and non-U.S. rates and lagging non-U.S. betas, we now expect net interest income to be slightly above $47.5 billion for the full year, excluding markets. And we are maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impact and the FDIC special assessment. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize with both portfolios reaching pre-COVID levels by year-end. And as it relates to buybacks, we expect to do a modest level of buybacks in the fourth quarter. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few points. We're executing on our strategy and delivering topline revenue growth of 5% year-to-date. We continue to invest for the long-term with discipline while remaining on track to deliver our expense guidance. We're focused on simplifying our organizational and management structure, which will further support our speed of execution. We're managing our capital in a disciplined way in light of regulatory headwinds, while continuing to optimize and return capital to shareholders. And we remain confident in our ability to achieve our RoTCE target of 11% to 12% in the medium term. And again, we look forward to hosting a more expansive fourth quarter earnings call, where we plan to share additional details related to the organizational simplification, including expected related severance and expense saves as well as our outlook for 2024. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Jane, you spoke more about the restructuring that you commented on recently. The real question is, why is this restructuring different than the other five or 10 or 15 restructurings you've heard about since Citi's creation in its current form 25 years ago, I think, just like a week ago. So, I'd say, why is this different? We hear the talk about cascading downward and the simplification, reducing dual heads and the committees, but we've heard this so much that -- why is this time different?\nJane Fraser: Yes. It's a very important question. Mike, thank you for asking it. As I've said, we view these as the most consequential changes we've made, not just to our organization model, but how we run the bank in almost two decades. And the first piece is simple, which is our org model was set up for a financial supermarket. That is simply not the bank we are today. So we're aligning the organizational model with that simpler business mix and strategy. But what's truly different is we're changing how we run the bank. And these are permanent changes that will be driven all the way down through the organization. So let me give you some examples to bring it to life. We talked about delayering the first two layers, three layers of the bank. That will continue through the organization through the spans and layers, particularly getting rid of aggregator roles. And let me give you an example. HR, we had HR in a region. You had the region head, you have the institutional client group head, you had the banking head. In addition, you had a North Asia head and a South Asia head. We're just going to have the North Asia head and the South Asia head. And all of those roles collapsed into those two. We're eliminating activities in the geographies that we just don't need anymore because we are no longer running local consumer franchises in them. So let's take the financial reporting -- sorry, the management reporting that Mark and I referred to in the opening remarks. We can reduce our management reports by about 50%. That's a 1,000 reports. What does that mean? Shadow P&Ls by country, quarterly outlooks, monthly performance updates, all the associated tracking and reconciliations that are there that are effectively for a shadow P&L rather than the one that matters to our shareholders. And so, that greatly declutters. It also means we can eliminate processes for our transformation, where we're looking at how do we automate those processes, automate those controls. If they're a duplicative process, we're getting rid of them, so you don't need to do that anymore, and it will accelerate the work on transformation. We're taking activities out of some of the businesses and centralizing them. A lot of the client activities that will go embedded into a business and we moved that up to centralized utilities that the whole firm can benefit from and that will get scaled economies. These strategy teams, marketing teams, many of the little cottage industries that build up over time, we can speed up decision-making with fewer committee layers. We'll take down the number of layers and drive that from places 13, we're looking to getting to eight and as many places as we possibly can. We're giving clarity of decision rights and changing decision rights from two or more people to just one, so much more single points of accountability. Again, more aligned with our shareholder interest because those points of accountability are more sitting in the products. And the types of metrics we're looking at to help us measure this, spans, layers, revenues, producers or non-producer, grade mixes, synergies that we're realizing voice of the client. But I'd say that our expectations and our execution of the business strategy is also at the heart of what we're trying to drive here. Our strength is our global network. I don't want our geographies focused on the full monty of management processes that are a duplication of what's happening in the product organization. I want them focused on delivering to our clients, engaging with our clients, and also managing their responsibilities of the legal entities. The same way for our banking organization, putting the investment bank, the corporate bank, and commercial bank together will really make it easier for us to realize the synergies across them. So the cross-sell or the movement of a commercial mid-market company up to a corporate lending company and a corporate banking company, much easier when they're all in the same organization or selling our banking product suite into that commercial bank customer and other examples. So it's really changing decision-making, freeing up people to focus on clients and transformation, much greater transparency, changing decision-making and rights, driving synergies. We put a huge amount of work all the way through the summer in design as to how do we want the organization to work. That is now getting driven down into the designing in detail and in depth all of these types of activities through being second layers and third layers at the moment into the fourth and then until we finish at the end of the first quarter. So it's very different. You'll get more flavor of it in the fourth quarter earnings call, but I hope that gives you a sense of why this is really different. This is how we're running the place. It's not just an org restructuring, both are necessary.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: So I'm curious, you mentioned that you're still marching towards the 11, 12, which is good because everyone was going to ask that. My question is a little bit different of -- with the denominator going up 25%, where is your -- in other words, a lot of things are working towards the transformation, but they threw a curveball in there with upping the denominator by 25%. So you seem to be a beneficiary of higher for longer for sure. And you also mentioned you're working on mitigation as we speak. So maybe you could talk about what are the offsets that we don't see that give you confidence still working towards that, because the topline stuff is working?\nMark Mason: Yes. So let me -- good morning, Glenn. It's good to hear from you. Let me make a couple of comments on that, and then Jane, feel free to chime in if you'd like. The first thing is that when I talked about this at the last conference we attended, I mentioned that analysts were somewhere in the 16% and 19% range in terms of a capital increase, and we're likely to be inside of that range, assuming the Basel III proposal as it's structured as it's written. And obviously, that's not the final. There's a period of review that's going on now. What I'd say is a couple of things, Glenn. One, we haven't fully executed against the strategy that Jane has just described. And obviously, continuing to simplify the business, managing through the transformation, changing that business mix that we have to something that's more consistent and predictable and repeatable as it relates to PPNR. Those things matter and impact the SCB. We talked about the exiting of our business, the international consumer businesses. That will be a factor in what our balance sheet looks like and what stress losses might look like, as well as lowering the expense base, which we know is an important factor in that PPNR math as well. And so those things help, I think, to reduce the amount of capital that might be required as we get into that medium-term period. Importantly, as you point out, there are other elements of the proposal that are going to require that we take a hard look at as well and identify mitigating actions to the extent that they make it into the final. So think about the increase in operational risk and the fact that some of that's already included in SCB is something of a point of advocacy, but that's obviously a big headwind that we'll have to kind of work through; the FRTB and the enhancement of models. Now there's a global market shock as well, but again, another point of advocacy that we need to work through, the equity investments, and now that they go from 100% risk weighting to 400% risk weighting. I think we're going to take a hard look at whether those are worth keeping in light of the higher capital associated with them, that's going to challenge the returns, that's going to force us to look at those through a different strategic lens, and we're going to do that. And then that's not to even mention the credit component that impacts both corporates and consumers as it relates to unfunded commitments, for example. And so as we've done with CCAR and other types of reg changes, we're going to have to look at what it means for our product mix, the returns associated with those, whether there are opportunities to pull levers like pricing or whether we have to take other decisions around those. And so that's what I mean by the mitigating actions that we're dimensioning and putting on paper and working through. But again, we want to be thoughtful because the rule is not final yet, and there are more discussions to be had around those important elements that I mentioned already.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian: Good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: You've talked a lot about defense, as I like to call it, in terms of the transformation that Jane had outlined and bending the expense curve. What I'm wondering for Jane and Mark, if you could sort of address what I think is probably the most debated part of your target, which is that revenue CAGR of 5%. You put up a very nice quarter in terms of revenues, both in net interest income and fees. And maybe help us sort of look underneath the surface in terms of that momentum, and maybe break it down in terms of what's really going well? I think TTS continues to surprise to the upside. It's going to take -- are we going to be two years from now, and we were like, oh, well, TTS is continuing to doing well. So what are the businesses that really sort of strong secular momentum that you feel is being under recognized versus how you could position cyclically and hire for longer? And what is still to come as we think about that path to at least the numerator of that RoTCE target?\nJane Fraser: I love this question, Erika, because I am really -- I have to say, I'm really excited about our strategy and the potential it has. And it is -- as you say, this is about the revenue potential of the firm and really how do we continue to unlock it. So there's a couple of unstoppable trends that we're going to be riding in the next -- I think it's decade long. The corporate client of today and indeed consumer has the build resiliency. The multinational client is on a long-term trend of building resiliency, be it because of green, be it because of geopolitics, be it because of regulatory, whatever the different reasons may be and there are multiple, they are having to build resiliency into supply chains, into their own operations, as they operate around the world, where the bank is absolutely there for them. And I think you've seen that in TTS, where we've had such strong drivers of growth in the last few years at the beginning of this trend. So that is an important one. Wherever the clients want to go, we are there. We have been there for decades. We understand the risk. We understand the client base. We understand the opportunities there at that -- that micro level and local levels that someone who's flying in with a suitcase can't possibly deliver. And it's connected globally. So this thing is just a thing of beauty. Linked into it is what I think of as a hidden gem amongst our crown jewels is Security Services. It equally in custody has this extraordinary global network, the connectivity everywhere. We have been investing behind this business. We've been growing our market share in North America in asset managers where we've been underweight with a number of material marquee wins. You can see the share gain that we're getting in this business, the pipeline of deals that we've already won as well as the new pipelines going forward. Very high return. We're investing both in terms of our cloud, our data, our client experience. And this is in a way, let's say, I do view this as a hidden gem with extremely attractive return profile, fee profile and other dimensions to it. We've quite a long way to run here. So a similar story to TTS, slightly different client base, competitively advantaged because you've got both the -- you've got the pre-trade and the post-trade, we connect the two huge efficiencies for clients that's going to matter. Next trend that's unstoppable, global wealth creation. And there is going to be massive global wealth creation. I can't tell you how excited Andy Sieg is now that he's in the building and knows the way to his desk. And all the floors as people are on, he's about to hit the road globally. We are so well positioned to deliver against that. And as you can see, we've not been happy with our performance the last couple of years, but this is going to be a very important driver for us. We'll see the recovery in banking wallet eventually, none of us are calling when, that will sustainably happen. That will be another driver. And I'd say cards continuing to go from strength to strength, particularly, I think, as we look forward, playing to our lending-led model there. And finally, the other one I do love, which is our commercial bank. We serve these entrepreneurs all over the world who are going to be the drivers of many industries going forward. And we're serving them, helping them to go international for the first step, tap them into global supply chains and the like. It's almost by definition the fastest growing of the mid-market companies are the ones that tap into what we can offer them. We built great relationships with them. And then our private bankers call on them. And then our investment bankers called on them. We have our capital market teams calling on them. And we help them grow and succeed. And that is going to be a big engine in the medium term of new client acquisition feeding us. So deeper client relationships, more growth in terms of new clients that fit with our proposition fairly uniquely and some great megatrends that we are going to be riding and pretty uniquely positioned on. And we'll keep investing to make sure that we're -- where areas we're behind, we get into the full front of and the areas we are crushing it in like our win rate is 82% in TTS, and we're going to make sure that we continue to do so and innovate that way. So, sorry to be so excited about this, but this is -- the 4% to 5% just feels very, very doable to Mark and I.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJim Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Mark, maybe on the revenue discussion there, let's talk about NII a little bit. You guys have a very unique deposit base, a lot smaller footprint in low-cost consumer. Betas have been already been high. So it doesn't seem like there's as much beta catch-up risk for you. It's 50% non-U.S. roughly. How do you think about the trajectory of NII as we -- do you think it stabilizes next year before rate cuts? How do we think about the puts and takes on your NII into next year?\nMark Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, I'm not going to give guidance for 2024. We'll do that obviously at the fourth quarter '23 earnings. But I think it's reasonable to expect that some of the trends that we've seen so far, we'll continue. So if you think about what's underneath this, we'll continue to benefit from higher rates across currencies. I think we'll continue to see benefits from card interest-earning balance growth. Recall that when you look at our U.S. dollar IRE position, it's relatively neutral at this point. And interest-earning balance growth is expected to be driven by continued card spend and lower payment rates. And so I think what's important to remember as it relates to our business is that it's global that we've got, while you're right in that on the U.S. dollar side, we've seen betas kind of reach -- particularly for our corporate clients reach terminal levels at the end of last year. On the non-U.S. dollar side, betas run lower, they lag and there's still upside there because it's a different rate curve and a different pace of increases. And so those will be some of the puts and takes to think about volumes, the rates, the speed of the curve moves and then how betas evolve, that will kind of factor in. And then the final thing to remember is that in our NII, we show it both with and without markets. On the ex-markets, we'll have the impact of the drag from the exits of the countries that kind of play out. So we just exited Taiwan, that's going to impact, obviously, the next quarter's NII. So just a couple of factors to think about. And obviously, I'll give you more detail on 2024 and at the fourth quarter earnings call.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley.\nRyan Kenny: Hi, good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nRyan Kenny: On the capital markets side, I heard the comments around it being hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound. Can you just give us an update or more color on how CEOs are thinking about bringing deals live across M&A, ECM and DCM? And does the market and rate volatility over the last few weeks have any significant impact on bringing deals to completion or on the pipeline?\nJane Fraser: Well, I think a couple of pieces. I actually start with Q3 is the seventh quarter of the current IB downturn. So since 2000, downturns have tended not to last longer than seven quarters because that's often how long it takes for pricing expectations to fully adjust to new realities. And we're starting to see that, particularly in the debt capital markets, investment grade market, where the expectation of no longer how high, but how long for rates. We've seen clients get off the sidelines and just bite the bullet and get into the debt capital markets in a more meaningful way and no longer waiting on that. We still think that how a recovery and return to normal wallet plays out when you talk to CEOs is largely dependent on the macro environment. That's the main piece for them. ECM, we're seeing increased interest and activity on ECM. You obviously had several IPOs coming to market in September, big ones -- three big ones that we're involved in. But the market still was somewhat fragile. We're watching it closely. And quite a few questions in Q4, things may move to Q1. We just have to see how that unfolds. But there's a good pipeline. I mean there's a lot of pent-up demand here. In debt, we had a big pickup in DCM, we feel confident that the gradual recovery in DCM and the beginnings of that LevFin will continue. You're certainly going to see us more active in the LevFin space in the right situations for our key clients. And then in M&A, a healthy M&A sell-side pipeline. A lot of companies with their industries is transforming are really wanting to think big. I think we'll see that unlocking when sentiment improves further. Companies do accept the new pricing reality, which will be helped by a rebound in equity markets. That obviously from our end takes quite a few quarters to materialize into revenue just given the nature of the product. So, it's there, but I think just given where everything is geopolitically and particularly from the macro, no one is going to make that call as to when we're going to see that sustainable term in banking at this point.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: So, Mark, I recognize, and Jane, I do recognize you'll provide a more fulsome update on expense actions next quarter. But one of the things I was hoping was that you could frame the expense opportunity in the context of your headcount trends. And prior to COVID as well as the consent order, mind you, Citi was running with 200,000 direct staff. That number is closer to 240,000 today. It's an increase of 20% even with multiple divestitures that you've consummated. So how should we think about an appropriate target or an optimal level of headcount for Citi versus that pre-COVID baseline of 200,000? And whether the consent order would impact the timing or magnitude of such headcount actions?\nMark Mason: Yes. So, look, I'm not going to give you headcount guidance. But what I will say is, Jane has talked before about the heads associated with the divestitures that are underway. And obviously, as we continue to progress in those divestitures have weighed a lot of progress already. We'll see those heads come down. It's also important to point out that as part of our effort, there's been in-sourcing. And so we've captured the extended workforce in the headcount that we have here. And then I think the final point is that as we continue to execute against the transformation work and as we implement the org simplification that we've just announced, undoubtedly, the technology investment, the automation that we're putting in place, the straight-through processing that occurs, the fewer reconciliations that are required, the streamlining from all of those layers that Jane mentioned will be eliminating. All of those things will also work to reduce headcount as well. And so while we're investing and hiring on the front end to capture the upside as markets turn, but also as we position ourselves to grow with clients, we're also going to realize efficiencies that come out of headcount reduction. One additional point is that you've heard me mention before that we've taken probably about $600 million or so, year-to-date, in repositioning charges. And with that will come roughly 7,000 or so headcount coming down associated with those repositioning charges. And so -- and we'll continue to do that, by the way. We haven't even begun to take repositioning charges associated with the org simplification that's underway. That will come in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year. And so we will see heads continue to evolve through this process. But keep in mind that there are puts and takes associated with that as we look at where we need to in-source versus use external parties.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. Just maybe, Mark, following up on that. As we think about bending the curve through the end of next year, maybe if you can talk to around - as you think about the puts and takes between investments and expense saves. How much of that cost save or bending the curve is going to happen in legacy versus PBWM and ICG? Like just how do you break - how should we think about that as we think about bending the curve and where the savings are coming from?\nMark Mason: Well, look, next year, we talked about expenses coming down from third quarter to fourth quarter. And as we think about that, you'll have some of the benefits of the costs going away from the exits that we would have announced. You'll have some of the benefit from further reduction in stranded costs, which we've been keenly focused on as we've exited each of these. And then I think as we get to the medium term, you will start to see some of the benefits from the transformation spend and investments that we would have made start to play out as well as efficiencies that we start to get in a lower structural cost base. But again, that's in that medium-term period. So all of those things will be drivers to getting to bending of the curve. I'm not - I haven't broken down. I'm not going to break down here on this call how much comes from each of the pieces but all are important factors to achieving that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Hi. There were some quotes, I think in the media, Jane from you talking about some signs of pressure among the lower end of the consumer. And I appreciate the pie chart that you have in the deck so it's not a huge percent of the card portfolio. But could you elaborate on that? And then also just address the - you mentioned directionally how the payment rates recovery coming down. But if we look at the growth in spend versus the growth in loans, it is kind of a little disproportionate, I think spends up a couple of percent year-over-year and the loans are [lower FICO]. So as we think about being kind of later cycle, is that something that you're paying attention to as a potential sign of further weakness in the credit? Thank you.\nJane Fraser: Yes. Look, I think most of the pressure in the lower FICO, we do have a lot of customers in lower FICO. So we're seeing it out in the market. We've got - we obviously have some in the retail services business. We also have to say have the benefit of that loss sharing agreement that really makes a difference there because we're having to reserve fully for that, but we get it back on the revenue line, as you know. But as we look at the off-us book, as we look at some of the pressures in the market as we look at spending, we can certainly see some of that pressure for the lower FICO, whereas when I think about the cards business, it's very much driven by the affluent customer. So the affluent is accounting for almost all the spending growth that we're seeing. And that's similar to the numbers that we saw from coming out of the Fed from the deposit side, the excess savings are sitting there, now primarily with households with over $150,000 of income. And it's down in the rest. So these are things we're keeping an eye on. I want to be very clear. I'm not that worried about it for Citi, given the prime nature of our card portfolio. And then the rest of our PBWM exposure is obviously is very affluent. But when I look out at the market, I talked to our corporate clients, that's where we tend to see them be more nervous about the softness in the consumer. And just I call it, they're much more mindful about where they're spending, right? So you're seeing them moving down within a category. They're certainly looking more on the bargain front. We've been hearing that from our retail partners. We've been hearing that across the board. And so growth of card loans is good. Our spend is up but less than loans, I think it's softening, but it's not worrying.\nMark Mason: Yes. I think that's spot on. The only thing I'd add is that when you look at the payment rate, payment rates and branded cards, while they've started to come down, they're still above the pre-COVID level. And we obviously have invested in this business. So the other thing that's driving this is the new account acquisitions are obviously important drivers of that spend volume and ultimately, that loan growth. But again, there's nothing that we see outside of what we were expecting in terms of how this portfolio is normalizing.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Jane. Good morning, Mark.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nJane Fraser: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Jane, as you pointed out, you're very excited about the opportunities in TTS. You're winning some new mandates in the custody business. Can you feel on this, is it because the competition is struggling with other issues, what gives you - because it has always been well regarded in this area. So what gives you that added excitement that this is even getting better?\nJane Fraser: Look, I think the added excitement is a lot of it is coming from the investments that we've been making, so that we're - if you look at it in terms of Payment Express, which is live in the U.S., it's - Thailand is on track for three more markets. That is really a very differentiating capability. The momentum we have in 24/7 clearing, that's been put in place. We had over $1 billion processed year-to-date, putting our commercial bank clients onto CitiDirect so they have seamless access to our whole PTS network globally had us talking about Citi token services, you can see us innovating with the Fed in new capabilities. So really across the board, it's that innovation in cutting-edge first in the market type of capabilities. But you're putting that on top of a network that's just unprecedented in terms of its presence, its local capabilities, it's payroll, cash management, liquidity management, it's collections, its receivables all sitting on one platform connected globally. And what that gives a client in terms of efficiency saves, insights on data what they can do in terms of risk management and how to really optimize their treasury capabilities. I mean, this thing is a thing of beauty, and it's very, very hard. It's very sticky to extract from this because it's embedded into how our clients do business. It's that critical and into their technology systems. So when you look at where the world is headed and what's going on in the world, volatility, these other elements, it's hard not to see opportunities. And its opportunities as well with our markets business linked in and one of our really differentiating factors that Andy Morten talks about all the time is his partnership with TTS. In fact, one of our major client bases are corporates, and they have a different profile, let's say, to an asset manager or a hedge fund, and we uniquely can serve them. So that's the piece. It's that combination and trends we see.\nMark Mason: The only thing - I think that's spot on. The only thing I'd add is that the middle market commercial space is a huge opportunity for us, as you said earlier, leveraging that TTS platform. And then on the security services side, the reality is that we're finally seeing real traction in North America. Right? We've always had kind of strength in many of the other regions, but we're really winning some major mandates here in North America, which I think is enough to get really excited about.\nJane Fraser: And I think that, to me, is what then drives a lot of the strategy and what we're trying to do in terms of get to that high quality of earnings, better earnings mix and other pieces that will help us get to that medium-term return target that we are so focused on.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark.\nJane Fraser: Hi, Vivek.\nVivek Juneja: I wanted to just clarify the reorganization a little bit. So Jane, I heard you say, to keeping North Asia, North Asia and South Asia heads. So did you just get rid of the Asia head and get rid of the product heads where product heads in each country, we're reporting to a regional product head. So - is that dotted line is no longer there? What's going on there? And when you get rid of all the monthly management reporting, what are you planning to replace that with from your management? Your MIS perspective?\nJane Fraser: So let me take the second one first. I'm not planning on replacing it with anything. We don't need them. We're no longer running consumer franchises in the countries. Instead, we've got global businesses that are operating very consistently in the individual geographies. So we just don't need replace them. And it enables us just to have the legal entity financial management that we need. And then our internal reports get greatly simplified same as they get greatly simplified by taking out ICG and PBWM is another - eliminating that layer also eliminates a lot of different reports. So the wonderful answer is nothing, a simplicity. The first question was about, okay, help you understand what we've done. So on the geography front, we have done two main things already. One is we put - we've eliminated the regions and I've just put a single international head reporting to me. So that makes it much simpler for me. I have one international head, and then he will help us manage the geographies collectively. The second piece is we've really narrowed the mandate of geography to delivering to our clients and covering our clients in their countries and secondly, the legal entity management. And otherwise before, we had a huge amount of management on shadow P&Ls and different - a lot of very heavy committee structure. That was necessary because the business was still very local as a retail bank, a local credit card business, a local onshore wealth business. They've gone. It's just serving multinational, the subsidiaries are multinationals and in some markets, the investors and the wealth clients in some markets. And that's a much simpler business to manage. So we could get rid of the regional there, and we just jumped straight down to the clusters that we have today, but they too have less of a mandate than they had before, a much more focused one. And the bit that I'm excited about it is not just, yes, this makes it much simpler to manage but it also helps us really focus on the global network. Now our geographies and our banking organizations sitting together on the same management structure, collectively accountable for serving and delivering against our core client base. And they're in one team to do it, it just makes it much easier. Does that give you a feel what else, Mark?\nMark Mason: The other thing, Vivek, that I think is important here is we really want to spend a little bit more investment and time on the client lens in terms of the financial reporting, right? Because as Jane talked about, we talked about the synergies across the franchise that we can capture the ability to leverage the offering we have for those different client segments. So looking at that P&L, looking at those returns, looking at that growth opportunity, through that client lens will be something where we want to enhance the metrics that we have already around that so that we can capture that upside.\nJane Fraser: And around the other piece that I think is also just an important point. Globalization is changing it. We're seeing these lanes all changing, food, trade, financial flows, et cetera. By actually having a single international organization and then the different clusters, North and South Asia, Europe, U.K., LATAM, Middle East, Africa. The connection points between them are really changing at the moment. And so this makes us much more agile in our delivery of the global network because I think it's much more in line with how the world is operating today.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC.\nSaul Martinez: Hi, there. So I wanted to continue on the threat of normalization of credit losses? And you guys have - I guess your guidance is implying that branded cards and retail services get back to more normalized levels by year-end, which is a decent sized uptick over the levels you had in the third quarter. So I kind of want to know what's driving that view? But more importantly, I guess what does that imply going forward? And does it imply that we get to more - something more like above-trend losses? Because I would think we still have some seasoning to go in the late 2021 and 2022 vintages. And not only that, we're talking about this in an environment where we still have pretty extraordinary labor market. So if you could just give us a little bit more color on just your expectations on credit losses and whether there's maybe a little bit more risk than we're thinking in terms of losses trending to something that is a bit higher than what we normally - what are more normalized levels?\nMark Mason: Yes. So let me start and that and Jane, if you want to chime in, that's fine. I think what I'd point you to is Page 24 in the deck that we have because it gives you a nice snapshot of how both the loss rates have been trending, but also how the delinquencies have been trending. And you can see that the delinquencies have been trending up, and that kind of gives us a good indication of where loss rates are likely to trend in the next quarter or so. And so at 2.72 unbranded cards and 4.53 on retail services, we can see that we're likely to end up at about that normalized rate by the end of the year, getting up to the 3% to 3.25%, 5% to 5.5% pre-COVID normalized NCL rates. Our expectation is that as we go into '24, to the point that you've made, depending on the macro environment, we're likely to see this tick up above those pre-COVID normalized rates. As we see a slowdown in the economy, again, subject to what the macro looks like before then kind of settling down at some point down the path. And so yes, we do see that tick up. This is, again, as advertised, so to speak, as we would have expected. And we have reserves, significant reserves for both of these portfolios to account for those loss expectations. So in branded cards, we sit with an ACL to loan reserve of 6.3% in retail services we have 11% and Jane mentioned earlier that the losses in retail services ultimately get shared with partners. And so while we would expect this to normalize and mature, so to speak, we feel very well reserved for what that might look like.\nJane Fraser: And our portfolio [technical difficulty] old Citi. It's very different in terms of our consumer credit exposure. And I think what you're hearing from us is, this is - this should all be very manageable. We're not there's no alarm bells going off at Citi around this. We're being prudent. We're being conservative around pieces and responsible on it. But there's no alarm bell ringing. And I think there may be a bit of a disconnect from some of the questions out there versus how we're feeling. We're just not seeing the data that is overly concerning. It's manageable. This is all very manageable, and we're being prudent about it as you'd expect us to be.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. From your initial answer, Jane, I hear you with the restructuring, deconstructing city to global lines, delayering of management and decluttering reporting, and when you add it all together, we'll get some numbers in January. But as it relates to your return targets and efficiency targets for 2025 and 2026, consensus is about one-third below what you target. And frankly, I have not spoken to one investor who thinks you're going to get those targets and maybe you would want to revise those lower in some way or maybe to be determined? Or what's your degree of conviction of getting to those targets or at least getting above your cost of capital? Thank you.\nJane Fraser: Yes. Look, we remain confident around our ability to hit these targets. We've got - you heard me talk earlier around the revenue growth and what are some of the tailwinds that we've got behind us as well as the core strategy and the drivers that we're in control of and that we've been investing behind to achieve. So our strategy is unchanged. We're confident it will drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5%. It's not the primary purpose, but the org simplification is the third driver of the expense reductions that we've talked about. And I would also say that, when you look at revenue expenses and the targets we've laid out at Investor Day, we've certainly had plenty of headwinds in macro regulatory geopolitics in the last couple of years, we have delivered. And we - on what we said we would do in the revenue and the expense guidance on the strategy. We've made adoptions along the way as we've needed to. But I think that's the piece that we're also really trying to drive into the firm as a culture. We will do what we say we will do, and we'll adapt accordingly to different areas. Mark talked about adapting to the capital requirements, depending what they are. We have other levers that we can pull, capital allocation, management buffer DTA. But my message to our investors is we're just building a proof point. This is a relentless execution. Look at that strategy scorecard page at the beginning of the deck there. We've achieved a lot and there is a lot going on, and we're getting a lot done. We don't pretend we're at the end of the road there with yet. But we're getting done what we said we do and building up those proof points so that you can see us achieve those return targets. Anything to add Mark?\nMark Mason: As you said, building credibility and being transparent, right?\nJane Fraser: Yes.\nMark Mason: So we're going to keep delivering on the proof points, and we're going to be transparent about how and when and how we're going to achieve it so.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Mark, you mentioned in the credit section that the delinquencies are rising and as a percentage of loans, they're still very low. I was just curious on the corporate loans in North America, there was an uptick. Again, I know relative to the portfolio, it's not that big. But anything in particular you can share with us in that area?\nMark Mason: On the corporate loans, we saw loss. I think losses were $51 million in the quarter. So a small amount. We did see an uptick, as you point out in the reserves. That was really driven by some country rating adjustments that were made. And then we did see an increase in the NALs, the nonaccrual loans. That was really one or two names and one in North America, one in EMEA. Both of them are current, but they drove the uptick that we saw in the quarter there.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in the queue. I will turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\nJen Landis: Thank you all for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact IR. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the Citi third quarter 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good morning to everyone. I should touch briefly on the macro environment before reviewing the quarter and last month's organizational announcement. The global macro backdrop remains the story of desynchronization. In the U.S., recent data implies a soft landing, but history would suggest otherwise, and we are seeing some cracks in the lower FICO consumers. In the euro area and the U.K., the picture has turned distinctly more negative. The summer weakness in industrial economies is spreading fast and the weight of structurally higher labor and energy costs, suggest a more enduring competitiveness challenge for that region. China's economy may have reached a cyclical bottom supported by the government's modest stimulus efforts, but it still has to work through weak sentiment, youth unemployment, and the pain in its property market. All of these macro dynamics have clearly impacted client sentiment. September is always a busy month seeing clients, and I'm struck how consistently CEOs are less optimistic about 2024 in a few months ago. The shift in the rates question from how high to how long has catalyzed more client activity. However, corporates have stopped waiting for rates to come down and are beginning to access the debt capital markets around the globe. Our multinational clients are adapting their operations to the evolving geopolitical landscape and are building redundancy and resiliency. And this plays to our strengths and strategy, in particular our invaluable global network. And between our high quality asset portfolio, our strong reserve levels, our ample liquidity, and our diversified earnings base, we are proving to our clients that we are truly a bank for all seasons. Turning to the quarter. Today, we reported net income of $3.5 billion, an EPS of $1.63, and an RoTCE of 7.7%. Our revenues were up 10%, ex-divestitures and each of our five core interconnected businesses posted revenue growth. We remain on-track to meet the revenue and expense guidance we set for the year. Let's start with our fastest-growing business, services. TTS was up 12% from a year-ago. That's the highest revenue quarter in over a decade and it continues to outpace the target we set at Investor Day. Half of that growth was business drivers, and the other half rates. And even with the impact of the long-expected Argentine devaluation, we again drove fee growth, which is the best sign of the potential of our globally leading franchise. We keep relentlessly innovating for our clients. Amongst other launches this quarter, we announced the creation of Citi Token Services, which will use distributed ledger and smart contract technologies to deliver a digital asset solution for our TTS clients. And this is the first for the industry as it allows us to seamlessly integrate a permission tokenized bank deposit network with traditional cash services such as 24/7 dollar clearing. Security Services had revenue growth of 16% with some good underlying fee growth. We took share again, and we have grown our AUC and AUA by over $2 trillion in the last year. This business has considerable momentum and a strong pipeline of clients who are benefiting from the cloud and data investments we're making. Markets was up 10% year-over-year, on the back of rates and currencies, having the best quarter in 10 years, and commodities, which also grew nicely. This was partially offset by equities, which was down slightly. Despite this, we continued to see good momentum in cash and we have grown our prime balances year-to-date. Banking had a good quarter with revenues up 17%, with activity playing to our mix. Now while corporate lending was essentially flat as we remain very disciplined about how we use our balance sheet, DCM was healthier. And the IPO market also showed some signs of life. This helped drive investment banking revenue up 34%, albeit off a low base and a small wallet. Sitting here today, it remains hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound, still I am proud of our role advising on some of the biggest deals globally so far this year. As you know, we are committed to growing our banking franchise. We brought together the management of the investment, corporate and commercial banks under one umbrella, and this structure will help us better drive important synergies between all three. We've been bringing in new talent in key sectors. And we've begun to provide more leverage finance for key clients in the right situation. U.S. Personal Banking was also up double digits at 13%. Cards revenues were strong in both our branded and retail services portfolios. The growth in spending is decelerating. And the consumer is more mindful what they spend on. Indeed, the affluent, who still have excess savings at their disposal, drove the growth in spending with a continued tilt to travel and entertainment. During the quarter, we introduced Simplified Banking, to improve the client experience for our retail banking clients. We believe that by peering offerings and simplifying our fee structure, we're going to incentivize our clients to deepen their relationships with us. And the early reaction from clients along those lines has been very positive. Wealth revenues have stabilized and were up slightly. Most notably investment revenues picked up across all geographies and the drivers of the franchise, such as referrals, client acquisition and net new inflows were all quite strong around the world. And we won important new mandates for Wealth at Work, an offering we had highlighted at Investor Day. Andy Sieg has now officially joined our firm. This is the time of massive global wealth creation and our franchise is uniquely positioned for it. Andy will ensure we are at the forefront of what's happening around the world. In terms of our balance sheet, our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base over the past five years. We grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains extremely strong, aided by our disciplined client selection. Our CET1 ratio grew to 13.5%, which is $14 billion above our regulatory minimum and still includes a 100 bps internal management buffer. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and stock buybacks. We continue to evaluate buybacks quarter-by-quarter. And I expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board. And while the ultimate impact of potentially high capital requirements won't be known until the Basel III end game is finalized, we have been actively working through, mitigating actions. As you can see on Slide 3, we are relentless in executing our strategy. This quarter, we closed on the sale of our Taiwan consumer business, and that's the second largest of the Asia consumer divestitures. And earlier this week, we announced that we will sell our consumer wealth portfolio in China to HSBC. And this includes approximately $2.6 billion in assets under management and $1 billion of deposits. In the fourth quarter, we expect to close down the sale of our Indonesia consumer business. In terms of the International consumer businesses, we are exiting. In addition to the three wind-down market, we have restarted the sales process in Poland and we remain on-track to separate Mexico next year, followed by an IPO in 2025. Transformation remains our number one priority. We're deep into the large body of work of automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms, and upgrading our data architecture. We're committed to doing this the right way, knowing it will take time to meet our regulators' expectations and to deliver a modern, more efficient infrastructure. Last month, we announced consequential changes that align our organizational structure with our strategy and changes how we run the bank. I said at the Investor Day, the organizational simplification would follow the divestitures. The changes will eliminate layers, duplication and complexity, allowing us to operate the bank more agilely and freeing our people up to focus on clients and execution. Elevating the five core businesses to my leadership team will enable me to drive greater accountability and sustainable results, so to bring it to life. The actions we've taken in the last few weeks will eliminate over 15% of the regional and functional roles at the top two layers of the company. It also take out 60 committees, which frees up over tens of thousands of people hours annually. We've identified approximately a 1,000 or 50% of our internal financial management reports that we won't need any longer. And we have taken out co-heads and dual reporting lines to enable faster decision-making. We're cascading these changes through the organization at pace. We announced the first two layers in September, and the next set of changes will be implemented by mid-November and we aim to bring the entire process to a close by early next year. When we speak in January, Mark and I will be in a position to update you on the financial and other metrics, sharing the impact of the simplification amongst other details. Now, while expenses is not the primary driver of the organizational changes, they will help us start bending expense curve in the fourth quarter of next year. And at the end of the work, we will have a simpler firm that can operate faster, better serve our clients, and unlock value for our shareholders. We've made tough decisions here, and I want to note how pleased I've been with how the leaders of the firm, especially the next generation have embraced these changes and are stepping up to implement them. They fully understand that we need to change how we run, Citi, in order to truly transform it once and for all. Before I close, I'd like to address our people in Israel. We are a significant bank in the country. And many of our people have lost friends and loved ones. Others are being called up to serve. Despite all they are dealing with, they are keeping our bank running in the country. And I'm frankly in all of their commitment to our clients and each other. More broadly, the price innocent civilians are paying as this crisis unfolds is absolutely devastating to witness. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mark. And then we will be delighted as always to take your questions. Yes. It's a very important question. Mike, thank you for asking it. As I've said, we view these as the most consequential changes we've made, not just to our organization model, but how we run the bank in almost two decades. And the first piece is simple, which is our org model was set up for a financial supermarket. That is simply not the bank we are today. So we're aligning the organizational model with that simpler business mix and strategy. But what's truly different is we're changing how we run the bank. And these are permanent changes that will be driven all the way down through the organization. So let me give you some examples to bring it to life. We talked about delayering the first two layers, three layers of the bank. That will continue through the organization through the spans and layers, particularly getting rid of aggregator roles. And let me give you an example. HR, we had HR in a region. You had the region head, you have the institutional client group head, you had the banking head. In addition, you had a North Asia head and a South Asia head. We're just going to have the North Asia head and the South Asia head. And all of those roles collapsed into those two. We're eliminating activities in the geographies that we just don't need anymore because we are no longer running local consumer franchises in them. So let's take the financial reporting -- sorry, the management reporting that Mark and I referred to in the opening remarks. We can reduce our management reports by about 50%. That's a 1,000 reports. What does that mean? Shadow P&Ls by country, quarterly outlooks, monthly performance updates, all the associated tracking and reconciliations that are there that are effectively for a shadow P&L rather than the one that matters to our shareholders. And so, that greatly declutters. It also means we can eliminate processes for our transformation, where we're looking at how do we automate those processes, automate those controls. If they're a duplicative process, we're getting rid of them, so you don't need to do that anymore, and it will accelerate the work on transformation. We're taking activities out of some of the businesses and centralizing them. A lot of the client activities that will go embedded into a business and we moved that up to centralized utilities that the whole firm can benefit from and that will get scaled economies. These strategy teams, marketing teams, many of the little cottage industries that build up over time, we can speed up decision-making with fewer committee layers. We'll take down the number of layers and drive that from places 13, we're looking to getting to eight and as many places as we possibly can. We're giving clarity of decision rights and changing decision rights from two or more people to just one, so much more single points of accountability. Again, more aligned with our shareholder interest because those points of accountability are more sitting in the products. And the types of metrics we're looking at to help us measure this, spans, layers, revenues, producers or non-producer, grade mixes, synergies that we're realizing voice of the client. But I'd say that our expectations and our execution of the business strategy is also at the heart of what we're trying to drive here. Our strength is our global network. I don't want our geographies focused on the full monty of management processes that are a duplication of what's happening in the product organization. I want them focused on delivering to our clients, engaging with our clients, and also managing their responsibilities of the legal entities. The same way for our banking organization, putting the investment bank, the corporate bank, and commercial bank together will really make it easier for us to realize the synergies across them. So the cross-sell or the movement of a commercial mid-market company up to a corporate lending company and a corporate banking company, much easier when they're all in the same organization or selling our banking product suite into that commercial bank customer and other examples. So it's really changing decision-making, freeing up people to focus on clients and transformation, much greater transparency, changing decision-making and rights, driving synergies. We put a huge amount of work all the way through the summer in design as to how do we want the organization to work. That is now getting driven down into the designing in detail and in depth all of these types of activities through being second layers and third layers at the moment into the fourth and then until we finish at the end of the first quarter. So it's very different. You'll get more flavor of it in the fourth quarter earnings call, but I hope that gives you a sense of why this is really different. This is how we're running the place. It's not just an org restructuring, both are necessary. I love this question, Erika, because I am really -- I have to say, I'm really excited about our strategy and the potential it has. And it is -- as you say, this is about the revenue potential of the firm and really how do we continue to unlock it. So there's a couple of unstoppable trends that we're going to be riding in the next -- I think it's decade long. The corporate client of today and indeed consumer has the build resiliency. The multinational client is on a long-term trend of building resiliency, be it because of green, be it because of geopolitics, be it because of regulatory, whatever the different reasons may be and there are multiple, they are having to build resiliency into supply chains, into their own operations, as they operate around the world, where the bank is absolutely there for them. And I think you've seen that in TTS, where we've had such strong drivers of growth in the last few years at the beginning of this trend. So that is an important one. Wherever the clients want to go, we are there. We have been there for decades. We understand the risk. We understand the client base. We understand the opportunities there at that -- that micro level and local levels that someone who's flying in with a suitcase can't possibly deliver. And it's connected globally. So this thing is just a thing of beauty. Linked into it is what I think of as a hidden gem amongst our crown jewels is Security Services. It equally in custody has this extraordinary global network, the connectivity everywhere. We have been investing behind this business. We've been growing our market share in North America in asset managers where we've been underweight with a number of material marquee wins. You can see the share gain that we're getting in this business, the pipeline of deals that we've already won as well as the new pipelines going forward. Very high return. We're investing both in terms of our cloud, our data, our client experience. And this is in a way, let's say, I do view this as a hidden gem with extremely attractive return profile, fee profile and other dimensions to it. We've quite a long way to run here. So a similar story to TTS, slightly different client base, competitively advantaged because you've got both the -- you've got the pre-trade and the post-trade, we connect the two huge efficiencies for clients that's going to matter. Next trend that's unstoppable, global wealth creation. And there is going to be massive global wealth creation. I can't tell you how excited Andy Sieg is now that he's in the building and knows the way to his desk. And all the floors as people are on, he's about to hit the road globally. We are so well positioned to deliver against that. And as you can see, we've not been happy with our performance the last couple of years, but this is going to be a very important driver for us. We'll see the recovery in banking wallet eventually, none of us are calling when, that will sustainably happen. That will be another driver. And I'd say cards continuing to go from strength to strength, particularly, I think, as we look forward, playing to our lending-led model there. And finally, the other one I do love, which is our commercial bank. We serve these entrepreneurs all over the world who are going to be the drivers of many industries going forward. And we're serving them, helping them to go international for the first step, tap them into global supply chains and the like. It's almost by definition the fastest growing of the mid-market companies are the ones that tap into what we can offer them. We built great relationships with them. And then our private bankers call on them. And then our investment bankers called on them. We have our capital market teams calling on them. And we help them grow and succeed. And that is going to be a big engine in the medium term of new client acquisition feeding us. So deeper client relationships, more growth in terms of new clients that fit with our proposition fairly uniquely and some great megatrends that we are going to be riding and pretty uniquely positioned on. And we'll keep investing to make sure that we're -- where areas we're behind, we get into the full front of and the areas we are crushing it in like our win rate is 82% in TTS, and we're going to make sure that we continue to do so and innovate that way. So, sorry to be so excited about this, but this is -- the 4% to 5% just feels very, very doable to Mark and I. Well, I think a couple of pieces. I actually start with Q3 is the seventh quarter of the current IB downturn. So since 2000, downturns have tended not to last longer than seven quarters because that's often how long it takes for pricing expectations to fully adjust to new realities. And we're starting to see that, particularly in the debt capital markets, investment grade market, where the expectation of no longer how high, but how long for rates. We've seen clients get off the sidelines and just bite the bullet and get into the debt capital markets in a more meaningful way and no longer waiting on that. We still think that how a recovery and return to normal wallet plays out when you talk to CEOs is largely dependent on the macro environment. That's the main piece for them. ECM, we're seeing increased interest and activity on ECM. You obviously had several IPOs coming to market in September, big ones -- three big ones that we're involved in. But the market still was somewhat fragile. We're watching it closely. And quite a few questions in Q4, things may move to Q1. We just have to see how that unfolds. But there's a good pipeline. I mean there's a lot of pent-up demand here. In debt, we had a big pickup in DCM, we feel confident that the gradual recovery in DCM and the beginnings of that LevFin will continue. You're certainly going to see us more active in the LevFin space in the right situations for our key clients. And then in M&A, a healthy M&A sell-side pipeline. A lot of companies with their industries is transforming are really wanting to think big. I think we'll see that unlocking when sentiment improves further. Companies do accept the new pricing reality, which will be helped by a rebound in equity markets. That obviously from our end takes quite a few quarters to materialize into revenue just given the nature of the product. So, it's there, but I think just given where everything is geopolitically and particularly from the macro, no one is going to make that call as to when we're going to see that sustainable term in banking at this point. Yes. Look, I think most of the pressure in the lower FICO, we do have a lot of customers in lower FICO. So we're seeing it out in the market. We've got - we obviously have some in the retail services business. We also have to say have the benefit of that loss sharing agreement that really makes a difference there because we're having to reserve fully for that, but we get it back on the revenue line, as you know. But as we look at the off-us book, as we look at some of the pressures in the market as we look at spending, we can certainly see some of that pressure for the lower FICO, whereas when I think about the cards business, it's very much driven by the affluent customer. So the affluent is accounting for almost all the spending growth that we're seeing. And that's similar to the numbers that we saw from coming out of the Fed from the deposit side, the excess savings are sitting there, now primarily with households with over $150,000 of income. And it's down in the rest. So these are things we're keeping an eye on. I want to be very clear. I'm not that worried about it for Citi, given the prime nature of our card portfolio. And then the rest of our PBWM exposure is obviously is very affluent. But when I look out at the market, I talked to our corporate clients, that's where we tend to see them be more nervous about the softness in the consumer. And just I call it, they're much more mindful about where they're spending, right? So you're seeing them moving down within a category. They're certainly looking more on the bargain front. We've been hearing that from our retail partners. We've been hearing that across the board. And so growth of card loans is good. Our spend is up but less than loans, I think it's softening, but it's not worrying. Hi, Gerard. Look, I think the added excitement is a lot of it is coming from the investments that we've been making, so that we're - if you look at it in terms of Payment Express, which is live in the U.S., it's - Thailand is on track for three more markets. That is really a very differentiating capability. The momentum we have in 24/7 clearing, that's been put in place. We had over $1 billion processed year-to-date, putting our commercial bank clients onto CitiDirect so they have seamless access to our whole PTS network globally had us talking about Citi token services, you can see us innovating with the Fed in new capabilities. So really across the board, it's that innovation in cutting-edge first in the market type of capabilities. But you're putting that on top of a network that's just unprecedented in terms of its presence, its local capabilities, it's payroll, cash management, liquidity management, it's collections, its receivables all sitting on one platform connected globally. And what that gives a client in terms of efficiency saves, insights on data what they can do in terms of risk management and how to really optimize their treasury capabilities. I mean, this thing is a thing of beauty, and it's very, very hard. It's very sticky to extract from this because it's embedded into how our clients do business. It's that critical and into their technology systems. So when you look at where the world is headed and what's going on in the world, volatility, these other elements, it's hard not to see opportunities. And its opportunities as well with our markets business linked in and one of our really differentiating factors that Andy Morten talks about all the time is his partnership with TTS. In fact, one of our major client bases are corporates, and they have a different profile, let's say, to an asset manager or a hedge fund, and we uniquely can serve them. So that's the piece. It's that combination and trends we see. And I think that, to me, is what then drives a lot of the strategy and what we're trying to do in terms of get to that high quality of earnings, better earnings mix and other pieces that will help us get to that medium-term return target that we are so focused on. Hi, Vivek. So let me take the second one first. I'm not planning on replacing it with anything. We don't need them. We're no longer running consumer franchises in the countries. Instead, we've got global businesses that are operating very consistently in the individual geographies. So we just don't need replace them. And it enables us just to have the legal entity financial management that we need. And then our internal reports get greatly simplified same as they get greatly simplified by taking out ICG and PBWM is another - eliminating that layer also eliminates a lot of different reports. So the wonderful answer is nothing, a simplicity. The first question was about, okay, help you understand what we've done. So on the geography front, we have done two main things already. One is we put - we've eliminated the regions and I've just put a single international head reporting to me. So that makes it much simpler for me. I have one international head, and then he will help us manage the geographies collectively. The second piece is we've really narrowed the mandate of geography to delivering to our clients and covering our clients in their countries and secondly, the legal entity management. And otherwise before, we had a huge amount of management on shadow P&Ls and different - a lot of very heavy committee structure. That was necessary because the business was still very local as a retail bank, a local credit card business, a local onshore wealth business. They've gone. It's just serving multinational, the subsidiaries are multinationals and in some markets, the investors and the wealth clients in some markets. And that's a much simpler business to manage. So we could get rid of the regional there, and we just jumped straight down to the clusters that we have today, but they too have less of a mandate than they had before, a much more focused one. And the bit that I'm excited about it is not just, yes, this makes it much simpler to manage but it also helps us really focus on the global network. Now our geographies and our banking organizations sitting together on the same management structure, collectively accountable for serving and delivering against our core client base. And they're in one team to do it, it just makes it much easier. Does that give you a feel what else, Mark? And around the other piece that I think is also just an important point. Globalization is changing it. We're seeing these lanes all changing, food, trade, financial flows, et cetera. By actually having a single international organization and then the different clusters, North and South Asia, Europe, U.K., LATAM, Middle East, Africa. The connection points between them are really changing at the moment. And so this makes us much more agile in our delivery of the global network because I think it's much more in line with how the world is operating today. And our portfolio [technical difficulty] old Citi. It's very different in terms of our consumer credit exposure. And I think what you're hearing from us is, this is - this should all be very manageable. We're not there's no alarm bells going off at Citi around this. We're being prudent. We're being conservative around pieces and responsible on it. But there's no alarm bell ringing. And I think there may be a bit of a disconnect from some of the questions out there versus how we're feeling. We're just not seeing the data that is overly concerning. It's manageable. This is all very manageable, and we're being prudent about it as you'd expect us to be. Yes. Look, we remain confident around our ability to hit these targets. We've got - you heard me talk earlier around the revenue growth and what are some of the tailwinds that we've got behind us as well as the core strategy and the drivers that we're in control of and that we've been investing behind to achieve. So our strategy is unchanged. We're confident it will drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5%. It's not the primary purpose, but the org simplification is the third driver of the expense reductions that we've talked about. And I would also say that, when you look at revenue expenses and the targets we've laid out at Investor Day, we've certainly had plenty of headwinds in macro regulatory geopolitics in the last couple of years, we have delivered. And we - on what we said we would do in the revenue and the expense guidance on the strategy. We've made adoptions along the way as we've needed to. But I think that's the piece that we're also really trying to drive into the firm as a culture. We will do what we say we will do, and we'll adapt accordingly to different areas. Mark talked about adapting to the capital requirements, depending what they are. We have other levers that we can pull, capital allocation, management buffer DTA. But my message to our investors is we're just building a proof point. This is a relentless execution. Look at that strategy scorecard page at the beginning of the deck there. We've achieved a lot and there is a lot going on, and we're getting a lot done. We don't pretend we're at the end of the road there with yet. But we're getting done what we said we do and building up those proof points so that you can see us achieve those return targets. Anything to add Mark? Yes."

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63, and an RoTCE of 7.7% on $20.1 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are divestiture-related impacts of approximately $214 million after tax, primarily driven by the Taiwan consumer business sale. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.52, with an RoTCE of 7.2%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 9% on a reported basis and 10% excluding divestiture-related impacts, driven by strength across services, cards and markets as well as modest growth in banking, partially offset by the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs. Our results include expenses of $13.5 billion, up 6% on a reported basis and $13.4 billion excluding divestiture-related costs, also up 6%. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, up 35%, primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses and volume growth. At the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. And year-to-date, we reported an RoTCE of 8.3%. On Slide 5, we show expense drivers for the third quarter as well as our key investment themes. Expenses were up 6% and our level of expenses continue to be driven by a number of factors, including investments in transformation, as well as risk and controls, business-led and enterprise-led investments, macro factors including inflation and FX, severance, which was approximately $190 million in the quarter, and roughly $640 million on a year-to-date basis. This included actions across banking, markets, wealth and the functions. And all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the closed exits and wind-downs. And our technology spend across the firm was $3 billion in the quarter, up 8%, largely driven by investments in product development, platform enhancements, and improving the client experience. Also driving the increase is continued investment in technology for the transformation as we address the consent orders and modernize the firm. As we said last quarter, our transformation and technology investments span the following themes: platform and process simplification, security and infrastructure modernization, client experience enhancements, and data improvements. And we remain in line with our full year guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessment. On Slide 6, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans, where I will speak to sequential variances. In the third quarter, net interest income decreased by $72 million. Excluding markets, net interest income increased $332 million, primarily driven by growth in PBWM as we continue to see loan growth and higher loan spreads, a pickup in services driven by higher deposit spreads as a result of higher interest rates and active beta management, partially offset by reductions from closed exits and wind-downs. Average loans were up 1%, largely driven by growth in U.S. Personal Banking across Cards and retail banking as well as TTS. Average deposits were down 2%, largely driven by Services, as we saw non-operational deposit outflows as expected in light of quantitative tightening. And our net interest margin increased 1 basis point. On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment, with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio was nearly 2.7%, and within that U.S. cards is 7.8%. In PBWM, 45% of our loans are in U.S. cards, and of that exposure, 80% is to customers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And both Branded Cards and Retail Services NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels, but are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 55% of our PBWM loans are largely in wealth, predominantly in mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. Corporate non-accrual loans increased by $490 million, but remain low at 68 basis points of total corporate loans. And we ended the quarter with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 1%. As you can see on the page, we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totals approximately $65 billion, of which 86% is investment grade, with a total reserve to funded loan ratio of 1.4%. To give you a sense of the macro scenario that underpin our over $20 billion of reserves, our current scenario weighted average unemployment rate is approximately 5%, which includes a downside scenario, with an average unemployment rate of roughly 7%. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels, and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high-quality diversified assets. Our balance sheet reflects our strategy and well-diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global needs. The majority of our deposits, $782 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries. These institutional deposits are complemented by $416 billion of U.S. Personal Banking and global wealth deposits. We have approximately $569 billion of HQLA and approximately $666 billion of loans and we maintained total liquidity resources of $937 billion. Our LCR was 117%. We ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 ratio based on standardized RWA, which is our binding constraint. Although not binding, our advanced RWA did increase this quarter, largely driven by business activity. And our tangible book value per share was $86.90, up 8% from a year ago. On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more details on the drivers this quarter. Starting from the end of the second quarter, first, we generated $3.2 billion of net income to common, which added 28 basis points; second, we returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 13 basis points; and finally, the remaining 2 basis points increase was primarily driven by lower DTA deductions and a net reduction in RWA. We ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately a 120 basis points or $14 billion above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3% as of October 1st. Before we move on, I'd like to spend a minute on capital. We continue to optimize our RWA and capital, which we expect to be a tailwind over-time. Contributing to this is the execution of our strategy, such as further diversifying our business mix and simplifying our business model, including exiting our 14 international consumer markets. Our investments in the transformation will continue to enhance our data analytics and stress testing capabilities, enabling continued capital optimization. And of course, in light of the evolving regulatory environment, we're also looking at other mitigating actions. But those will largely depend on how the final capital rules play-out. These actions could include exiting or restructuring certain products, divesting certain equity investments, and re-evaluating both how we deploy capital and our management buffer. We've consistently demonstrated our ability to manage our RWA and capital levels through various macro environment and the evolving regulatory landscape, and we'll continue to do so. On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the third quarter. Revenues were up 12% this quarter, driven by double-digit growth across services, markets and banking. In the quarter, normal course foreign currency translation impacts drove a net revenue headwind in ICG. On an ex-FX basis, ICG revenues would have been up 15%. Additionally, there was an approximately $180 million negative impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina on our net investment in the country, mainly across TTS, markets and security services. Expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $196 million, including $51 million of net credit loss. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.4 billion, up 12% driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Average loans were down 4% as we were very deliberate about how we deployed resources across the businesses, including the reduction in subscription credit facilities. Average deposits were flat as new client acquisition and deepening of relationships with existing clients were offset by non-operational deposit outflows. ICG delivered an RoTCE of 10% for the quarter and 11% year-to-date. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, we recorded our highest revenue quarter in the last decade. Revenues were up 12%, driven by 17% growth in net interest income. Non-interest revenues were up 1%, and on an ex-FX basis, non-interest revenues would have been up 8%. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with cross-border flows up 16%, outpacing global GDP growth and year-to-date, cross-border flows were up 12%. U.S. dollar clearing volumes are up 6% both year-over-year in the quarter and year-to-date. And commercial card volumes were up 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in business-to-business payments and travel and entertainment spends. And year-to-date, commercial card volumes were up 20%. In fact, similar to the last few quarters, client wins are up approximately 40% across all client segments. These include marquee mandates, where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. We continue to make good progress on our commercial client strategy, as year-to-date wins more than doubled, driven by expansion into new markets and growth in multiproduct mandates from clients with cross-border needs. In Securities Services, revenues were up 16%, driven by higher net interest income across currencies. Non-interest revenues were up 3%. We're very pleased with the progress we're seeing in Security Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration which are up approximately 10% or $2.1 trillion. Markets revenues were up 10%, driven by fixed income. Fixed income revenues were up 14%, largely driven by strength in our rates and currency franchise. While volatility remains subdued versus a year ago, we did see overall volatility tick higher relative to the beginning of the quarter. Equities revenues were down 3%, driven by a decline in equity derivatives, partially offset by growth in cash and prime. And we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA target. And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were up 17%, driven by investment banking, which increased 34% on a reported basis and 12% excluding marks. Here too, we saw a pickup in activity in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, particularly in DCM, but also in M&A as we closed a few deals earlier than expected. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, and there's more work to be done, we're making solid progress against our strategy in these businesses. Now turning to Slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 10%, driven by net interest income growth of 9% and a 20% increase in non-interest revenue, primarily due to lower partner payments in retail services and higher investment product revenues in wealth. Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by risk and control investments and severance, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $1.5 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 2%, largely reflecting our clients putting cash to work in investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 8.8% and 6.6% on a year-to-date basis. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. This quarter was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Personal Banking, driven by cards. Branded cards revenues were up 12%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 5%, card spend volumes up 4%, and average loans up 12%. Retail services revenues were up 21%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments on the heels of higher net credit losses. In the card portfolios, we continue to see the investments we've been making as well as lower payment rates contribute to growth in interest-earning balances of 15% in Branded Cards and 12% in retail services. Retail banking revenues decreased 3%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business, partially offset by higher deposit spreads. Wealth revenues were up 2%, driven by higher investment fees across all regions and segments. The benefit from relationships transferred from retail banking and higher lending revenue. We also saw strong net new inflows across all regions. And year-to-date, new client acquisitions were up almost 30% in the private bank and over 60% in wealth at work. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making across these businesses. On Slide 14, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues were down 13%, largely driven by the difference in one-time gain on sale impacts in the Asia consumer businesses as well as the reductions from closed consumer exits and wind-downs, partially offset by higher revenue in Mexico. It's worth noting that Mexico's revenues were up 32%, primarily driven by Mexican peso appreciation, higher interest rates, and volume growth. Ex-FX, Mexico revenues were up 16%. Expenses decreased 3%, primarily driven by closed consumer exits and wind-downs, partially offset by separation costs in Mexico and Mexican peso appreciation. And expenses in Mexico were up 27% and but ex-FX expenses were up 11%. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by the absence of mark-to-market impacts on certain derivative transactions in the prior year. And expenses decreased, largely driven by lower consulting fees. On Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our full year 2023 outlook. With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts. Having said that, based on what we've seen play out year-to-date in terms of U.S. and non-U.S. rates and lagging non-U.S. betas, we now expect net interest income to be slightly above $47.5 billion for the full year, excluding markets. And we are maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impact and the FDIC special assessment. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize with both portfolios reaching pre-COVID levels by year-end. And as it relates to buybacks, we expect to do a modest level of buybacks in the fourth quarter. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few points. We're executing on our strategy and delivering topline revenue growth of 5% year-to-date. We continue to invest for the long-term with discipline while remaining on track to deliver our expense guidance. We're focused on simplifying our organizational and management structure, which will further support our speed of execution. We're managing our capital in a disciplined way in light of regulatory headwinds, while continuing to optimize and return capital to shareholders. And we remain confident in our ability to achieve our RoTCE target of 11% to 12% in the medium term. And again, we look forward to hosting a more expansive fourth quarter earnings call, where we plan to share additional details related to the organizational simplification, including expected related severance and expense saves as well as our outlook for 2024. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Yes. So let me -- good morning, Glenn. It's good to hear from you. Let me make a couple of comments on that, and then Jane, feel free to chime in if you'd like. The first thing is that when I talked about this at the last conference we attended, I mentioned that analysts were somewhere in the 16% and 19% range in terms of a capital increase, and we're likely to be inside of that range, assuming the Basel III proposal as it's structured as it's written. And obviously, that's not the final. There's a period of review that's going on now. What I'd say is a couple of things, Glenn. One, we haven't fully executed against the strategy that Jane has just described. And obviously, continuing to simplify the business, managing through the transformation, changing that business mix that we have to something that's more consistent and predictable and repeatable as it relates to PPNR. Those things matter and impact the SCB. We talked about the exiting of our business, the international consumer businesses. That will be a factor in what our balance sheet looks like and what stress losses might look like, as well as lowering the expense base, which we know is an important factor in that PPNR math as well. And so those things help, I think, to reduce the amount of capital that might be required as we get into that medium-term period. Importantly, as you point out, there are other elements of the proposal that are going to require that we take a hard look at as well and identify mitigating actions to the extent that they make it into the final. So think about the increase in operational risk and the fact that some of that's already included in SCB is something of a point of advocacy, but that's obviously a big headwind that we'll have to kind of work through; the FRTB and the enhancement of models. Now there's a global market shock as well, but again, another point of advocacy that we need to work through, the equity investments, and now that they go from 100% risk weighting to 400% risk weighting. I think we're going to take a hard look at whether those are worth keeping in light of the higher capital associated with them, that's going to challenge the returns, that's going to force us to look at those through a different strategic lens, and we're going to do that. And then that's not to even mention the credit component that impacts both corporates and consumers as it relates to unfunded commitments, for example. And so as we've done with CCAR and other types of reg changes, we're going to have to look at what it means for our product mix, the returns associated with those, whether there are opportunities to pull levers like pricing or whether we have to take other decisions around those. And so that's what I mean by the mitigating actions that we're dimensioning and putting on paper and working through. But again, we want to be thoughtful because the rule is not final yet, and there are more discussions to be had around those important elements that I mentioned already. Good morning. Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, I'm not going to give guidance for 2024. We'll do that obviously at the fourth quarter '23 earnings. But I think it's reasonable to expect that some of the trends that we've seen so far, we'll continue. So if you think about what's underneath this, we'll continue to benefit from higher rates across currencies. I think we'll continue to see benefits from card interest-earning balance growth. Recall that when you look at our U.S. dollar IRE position, it's relatively neutral at this point. And interest-earning balance growth is expected to be driven by continued card spend and lower payment rates. And so I think what's important to remember as it relates to our business is that it's global that we've got, while you're right in that on the U.S. dollar side, we've seen betas kind of reach -- particularly for our corporate clients reach terminal levels at the end of last year. On the non-U.S. dollar side, betas run lower, they lag and there's still upside there because it's a different rate curve and a different pace of increases. And so those will be some of the puts and takes to think about volumes, the rates, the speed of the curve moves and then how betas evolve, that will kind of factor in. And then the final thing to remember is that in our NII, we show it both with and without markets. On the ex-markets, we'll have the impact of the drag from the exits of the countries that kind of play out. So we just exited Taiwan, that's going to impact, obviously, the next quarter's NII. So just a couple of factors to think about. And obviously, I'll give you more detail on 2024 and at the fourth quarter earnings call. Good morning. Good morning. Yes. So, look, I'm not going to give you headcount guidance. But what I will say is, Jane has talked before about the heads associated with the divestitures that are underway. And obviously, as we continue to progress in those divestitures have weighed a lot of progress already. We'll see those heads come down. It's also important to point out that as part of our effort, there's been in-sourcing. And so we've captured the extended workforce in the headcount that we have here. And then I think the final point is that as we continue to execute against the transformation work and as we implement the org simplification that we've just announced, undoubtedly, the technology investment, the automation that we're putting in place, the straight-through processing that occurs, the fewer reconciliations that are required, the streamlining from all of those layers that Jane mentioned will be eliminating. All of those things will also work to reduce headcount as well. And so while we're investing and hiring on the front end to capture the upside as markets turn, but also as we position ourselves to grow with clients, we're also going to realize efficiencies that come out of headcount reduction. One additional point is that you've heard me mention before that we've taken probably about $600 million or so, year-to-date, in repositioning charges. And with that will come roughly 7,000 or so headcount coming down associated with those repositioning charges. And so -- and we'll continue to do that, by the way. We haven't even begun to take repositioning charges associated with the org simplification that's underway. That will come in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year. And so we will see heads continue to evolve through this process. But keep in mind that there are puts and takes associated with that as we look at where we need to in-source versus use external parties. Well, look, next year, we talked about expenses coming down from third quarter to fourth quarter. And as we think about that, you'll have some of the benefits of the costs going away from the exits that we would have announced. You'll have some of the benefit from further reduction in stranded costs, which we've been keenly focused on as we've exited each of these. And then I think as we get to the medium term, you will start to see some of the benefits from the transformation spend and investments that we would have made start to play out as well as efficiencies that we start to get in a lower structural cost base. But again, that's in that medium-term period. So all of those things will be drivers to getting to bending of the curve. I'm not - I haven't broken down. I'm not going to break down here on this call how much comes from each of the pieces but all are important factors to achieving that. Yes. I think that's spot on. The only thing I'd add is that when you look at the payment rate, payment rates and branded cards, while they've started to come down, they're still above the pre-COVID level. And we obviously have invested in this business. So the other thing that's driving this is the new account acquisitions are obviously important drivers of that spend volume and ultimately, that loan growth. But again, there's nothing that we see outside of what we were expecting in terms of how this portfolio is normalizing. Good morning. The only thing - I think that's spot on. The only thing I'd add is that the middle market commercial space is a huge opportunity for us, as you said earlier, leveraging that TTS platform. And then on the security services side, the reality is that we're finally seeing real traction in North America. Right? We've always had kind of strength in many of the other regions, but we're really winning some major mandates here in North America, which I think is enough to get really excited about. The other thing, Vivek, that I think is important here is we really want to spend a little bit more investment and time on the client lens in terms of the financial reporting, right? Because as Jane talked about, we talked about the synergies across the franchise that we can capture the ability to leverage the offering we have for those different client segments. So looking at that P&L, looking at those returns, looking at that growth opportunity, through that client lens will be something where we want to enhance the metrics that we have already around that so that we can capture that upside. Yes. So let me start and that and Jane, if you want to chime in, that's fine. I think what I'd point you to is Page 24 in the deck that we have because it gives you a nice snapshot of how both the loss rates have been trending, but also how the delinquencies have been trending. And you can see that the delinquencies have been trending up, and that kind of gives us a good indication of where loss rates are likely to trend in the next quarter or so. And so at 2.72 unbranded cards and 4.53 on retail services, we can see that we're likely to end up at about that normalized rate by the end of the year, getting up to the 3% to 3.25%, 5% to 5.5% pre-COVID normalized NCL rates. Our expectation is that as we go into '24, to the point that you've made, depending on the macro environment, we're likely to see this tick up above those pre-COVID normalized rates. As we see a slowdown in the economy, again, subject to what the macro looks like before then kind of settling down at some point down the path. And so yes, we do see that tick up. This is, again, as advertised, so to speak, as we would have expected. And we have reserves, significant reserves for both of these portfolios to account for those loss expectations. So in branded cards, we sit with an ACL to loan reserve of 6.3% in retail services we have 11% and Jane mentioned earlier that the losses in retail services ultimately get shared with partners. And so while we would expect this to normalize and mature, so to speak, we feel very well reserved for what that might look like. As you said, building credibility and being transparent, right? So we're going to keep delivering on the proof points, and we're going to be transparent about how and when and how we're going to achieve it so. On the corporate loans, we saw loss. I think losses were $51 million in the quarter. So a small amount. We did see an uptick, as you point out in the reserves. That was really driven by some country rating adjustments that were made. And then we did see an increase in the NALs, the nonaccrual loans. That was really one or two names and one in North America, one in EMEA. Both of them are current, but they drove the uptick that we saw in the quarter there."

        "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJen Landis: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings. And with that, I will turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Jen. And good morning to everyone. While this quarter wasn't as eventful as the first quarter, it was not without its moments. The global economy continues to be remarkably resilient, although the macro backdrop differs across key markets. And while the bulk of the tightening is behind us, central banks are responding vigorously to inflation and have made it clear the cycle of hikes isn't over. In the US the tight labor market keeps pushing the timing of this elusive recession later into this year or 2024 with the robust demand for services providing a backstop for the economy. The Eurozone has also exceeded expectations. However, most countries there are facing pressure from labor and energy costs, challenging the region's longer-term competitiveness. China is the biggest disappointment as growth decelerated after an initial post reopening pop. I was there last month and let's just say few on the ground expect China to be as strong a driver of global growth this year as some had hoped. So bottom line, globally we continue to see the same quite challenging macroeconomic conditions that we [Technical Difficulty] benefits of our diversified business model and strong balance sheet. We remain laser focused on executing our strategy and simplifying and modernizing our bank. Despite the turbulence and macro backdrop of the first half, we're on track with the plan we laid out at Investor Day and we remain committed to our strategy and our medium-term ROTCE target. Today we reported net income of $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33. Our revenues ex divestitures are relatively flat to last year and we remain on track to meet our revenue guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion for the year. We're also on track to meet the expense guidance for the year. And consistent with the plan we shared with you at our Investor Day, we are pursuing cost saving opportunities to help offset the significant investments in our transformation. In services, TTS continues to deliver with revenues up a healthy 15%. This was driven by both net interest income and noninterest revenue as we win fee generating mandates with new clients and deepen our relationships with existing large corporate and commercial clients. We're proud of our number one ranking for large institutional clients, and this week we announced our latest innovation CitiDirect Commercial Banking, a digital platform to help our growing commercial clients tap into our global network. Security services revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. We're really pleased with execution in this business as we continue to bring in new assets under custody and administration, which are up by approximately $2.4 trillion in the last year. We've gained 100 basis points in share year-over-year as a result of the investments we've been making. Markets revenues were down 13% compared to an exceptionally strong second quarter last year. From early April, clients stood on the sidelines as the debt ceiling played out and we continued to experience very low levels of volatility throughout the quarter. Despite this, our corporate client flows remained strong and we\u2019ve achieved our medium-term revenue to RWA target again this quarter. In banking, the momentum in investment grade debt has spread into other DCM products, but the long-awaited rebound in investment banking has yet to materialize and it was a disappointing quarter in terms of both the wallet and our own performance with investment banking revenues down 24%. We continue to right size the business to the environment whilst making investments in selected areas, such as technology and healthcare. In the US, taken together, our cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth, aided by customer engagement and the continued normalization in payment rates. In branded cards, spend is still strong in travel and entertainment, and acquisitions remain pretty healthy. This is a great franchise and we have launched a raft of new innovations from transforming our [thank you] (ph) rewards platform to our enhanced value proposition for the premium card with our long-term partner American Airlines. Credit normalization is happening faster in retail services given the profile of the portfolio. And overall, I'd say we're seeing a more cautious consumer, but not necessarily a recessionary one. Wealth revenues were down 5% as the business continues to be negatively impacted by the deposit mix shift, particularly in the private bank and by lower investment revenues. However, we have seen activity pick up a bit in Asia for two quarters with growing net new assets. Referrals from the US retail banks are increasing and globally, new client acquisition in the private bank and wealth at work has grown significantly on the back of our investments in our network of client advisors and bankers. Turning to expenses. They were elevated this quarter as we expected. This includes the additional repositioning actions we took to right size certain businesses and functions in light of the current environment. Year-to-date, severance is about $450 million, including $200 million in the quarter. Separate to repositioning, we remain committed to bending our expense curve by the end of 2024 through three significant efforts; first, we continue to make investments in our transformation and other risk and control initiatives, which are necessary to modernize our infrastructure, automate our controls, as well as to improve the client experience. As we said before, we will start to see the momentarily benefits of these investments over the medium term. Second, as part of our simplification efforts, we expect to close the sales of our remaining two Asia consumer franchises by year-end, and we plan to restart the exit process in Poland. As you can see on the slide, we made excellent progress this quarter and the consumer businesses were winding down, aided by material asset sales, and we are now attacking stranded costs and closing out the TSAs in the markets that we have already exited. You saw our determination to execute when we decided to IPO Banamex after exploring a sale. We should complete the process of separating the two businesses fully next year in preparation for the IPO. And I'm pleased with the progress on the ground. We are about to begin acceptance testing on the new systems for the retained businesses. All this means that by year-end, considering how far the divestitures and wind-downs have progressed, legacy franchises will have materially reduced its exposures and primarily be down to Mexico, Poland, Korea and the elimination of the remaining stranded costs. As such, as we move through the second half of the year, we will be in a position to focus on the third leg of bringing down our expense base through a leaner organizational model. Together, these three efforts are why we have confidence in saying that we will start to bend the curve on an absolute basis by the end of 2024 and continue to bring down expenses over the medium term. Let me end with capital. Well, you won't be shocked to hear that we were disappointed with the increase to our stress capital buffer. We have engaged in active dialogue with the Fed to better understand the differences between our model and theirs in terms of noninterest revenue. And the industry awaits further clarity on capital requirements and importantly, their implementation timing from the holistic review the regulators have undertaken and the expected Basel III Endgame NPR. There is still uncertainty as to what the final rules will be, and we, like the rest of the industry, will need to work through the implications. The exit of 14 international consumer markets, coupled with the results of our transformation investments and change in business mix will help reduce our capital ratios. In addition, we have other levers to pull over time, such as capital allocation, DTA utilization, our G-SIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders as you saw with our decisions to repurchase $1 billion in common stock and increase the dividend. We ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.3%. That's 100 basis points above our upcoming requirement after returning a total of $2 billion in capital. And we grew our tangible book value per share to $85.34. Given the environment, we will continue to look at our level of capital return on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made, but there remains a lot to do. We will continue to update you on the progress we are making every quarter. And with that I'd like to turn it over to Mark and then we would both be [Technical Difficulty]\nMark Mason: Thanks, Jane. And good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I indicate otherwise and spend a little more time on expenses and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the second quarter we reported net income of approximately $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33 and an ROTCE of 6.4% on $19.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are after tax divestiture related impacts of approximately $92 million. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.37 with an ROTCE of 6.6%. In the quarter, total revenues decreased by 1%, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture related impacts as strength across services, US Personal Banking and revenue from the investment portfolio was more than offset by declines in markets, investment banking and wealth, as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind downs. Our results include expenses of $13.6 billion, up 9%, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture related costs. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in cards net credit losses and ACL builds, largely related to growth in card balances. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 27%, primarily driven by the geographic mix of our pretax earnings in the quarter. Excluding current quarter divestiture related impacts our effective tax rate was 26%. At the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7% and through the first half of 2023 we reported an ROTCE of 8.7%. On Slide 5, we show the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year expense variance for the second quarter. Expenses were up 9%, driven by a number of factors, including investment in risk and controls, business-led and enterprise-led investments, volume growth and macro factors, including inflation, as well as severance. And all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exits and wind downs. Severance in the quarter was approximately $200 million and $450 million year-to-date, as we took further actions across investment banking, markets and the functions. We're investing in the execution of our transformation and continue to see a shift in our investments from third-party consulting to technology and full-time employees. And as we said last quarter, our transformation and technology investments span across the following themes: platform and process simplification; security and infrastructure modernization; client experience enhancements; and data improvements. And across these themes, technology spend was $3 billion in the quarter, up 13%, primarily driven by change the bank spend. Despite the higher expense base sequentially, we remain in line with our full-year guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding divestiture related impacts and the FDIC special assessment. On Slide 6, we show net interest income, deposits and loans where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $550 million, largely driven by dividends. The increase in net interest income ex markets was largely driven by higher rates and cards growth, partially offset by the mix shift that we've seen to higher rate deposit products within PBWM. Average loans were flat as growth in PBWM was offset by the wind-down markets and a decline in ICG as we continue to optimize the loan portfolio, including a further reduction in subscription credit facilities. Average deposits were down 2%, largely driven by TTS, as we saw some non-operational outflow, as expected in light of quantitative tightening. However, underlying this we did see strong growth in operating accounts as we continue to win new clients and deepen with existing ones, and our net interest margin increased 7 basis points. On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves to funded loans ratio is approximately 2.7%, and within that US cards is 7.9%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in US cards, and of that exposure 80% is to customers with FICOs of 680 or higher. And NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in wealth, predominantly in mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remained low at about 44 basis points of total loans. As you can see on the page, we breakout our commercial real-estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totaled $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So, while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in-part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high quality diversified assets. Our balance sheet reflects our strategy and well diversified business model, we leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors and individuals with global needs. The majority of our deposits, $818 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries. These institutional deposits are complemented by $427 billion of US retail consumer and global wealth deposits as you can see on the bottom-right side of the page. We have approximately $584 billion of HQLA and approximately $661 billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of just under $1 trillion. Our LCR was relatively stable at 119%. And our net stable funding ratio was greater than 100%. We ended the quarter with the 13.3% CET1 ratio and our tangible book value per share was $85.34, up 6% from a year ago . On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more details on the drivers this quarter. Starting from the end of the first-quarter. First, we generated $2.6 billion of net income to common, which added 22 basis-points. Second, we returned $2 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 18 basis-points. And finally, the remaining 14 basis-point decrease was primarily driven by RWA growth as we continue to grow card balances partially offset by optimizing RWA in markets and corporate lending. We ended the quarter with the 13.3% CET1 capital ratio, which includes a 100 basis point internal management buffer. We expect our regulatory capital requirement to be 12.3% in October of 2023, which incorporates the increase in our stress capital buffer from 4% to the preliminary SCB of 4.3% we announced a couple of weeks ago. And we will continue our dialog with the Fed to better understand the differences between modeled results and ours, specifically in non-interest revenue. That said, our strategy is designed to further diversify our business mix to have a more consistent, predictable, and repeatable revenue stream as well as reduce risk and simplify our firm by exiting 14 international consumer markets. The strategy and the simplification, coupled with the benefits of our transformation investments will allow us to improve RWA and capital over time. The continued optimization of our balance sheet should not only help FCB but reduce RWA. This will offset some of the anticipated headwinds and capital requirements and RWA. And we will continue to reassess how and where we deploy capital and we will continue to reassess the appropriate level of our management buffer overtime. On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the second quarter. Revenues were down 9% this quarter, as growth in services was more than offset by markets and banking. Expenses increased 13%, primarily driven by continued investment in TTS and Risk and Controls, as well as approximately $120 million of severance in investment banking and markets, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $58 million as net credit losses were partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 45%, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher expenses. ICG delivered an ROTCE of 9.2% for the quarter and 11.4% through the first half of 2023. Average loans were down 6%, reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up 1% as we continue to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were up 15%, driven by 18% growth in net interest income and 8% in noninterest revenue. It's also worth noting that TTS revenues were up 20% on an XFX basis. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with US dollar clearing volumes up 6%, both in the quarter and through the first half, cross-border flows up 11%, outpacing global GDP growth, again, both in the quarter and through the first half and commercial card volume up roughly 15% led by spend in travel. In fact, similar to the last few quarters client wins are up approximately 41% across all client segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. In Security Services, revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher net interest income across currency. We are pleased with the progress in security services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration which are up approximately 11% or $2.4 trillion, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals in security services. As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy in our two of our higher returning businesses with strong synergies across the firm. Markets revenues were down 13%, driven by both fixed income and equities relative to an exceptional quarter last year coupled with low volatility this quarter. Fixed income revenues were down 13% as strength in our rates franchise was more than offset by a decline in currencies and commodities. Equities revenues were down 10%, primarily reflecting a decline in equity derivatives. But consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow prime balances driven by client wins. Corporate client flows remain strong and stable, and we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA part. And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down 22%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty continue to impact client activity, as well as lower revenues in corporate lending. While we continue to have a strong pipeline and are seeing green shoots of activity, we recognize there's more work to do in ECM and M&A. That said, we believe the investments that we've made in health care and technology coverage will benefit us over time. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging and there is more work to be done, we're making progress against our strategy in ICG. Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6%, driven by net interest income growth of 7%, partially offset by a 6% decline in noninterest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in wealth. Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by risk and control investments. Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately $335 million, primarily driven by card balance growth. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting our wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 5.5%, both for this quarter and through the first half of 2023, largely reflecting the challenging environment for wealth and higher credit costs. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 8%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 6%, card spend volumes up 4% and average loans up 14%. Retail services revenues were up 27%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments. For both card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline and that combined with the investments that we've been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 17% in branded cards and 12% in Retail Services. Retail banking revenues decreased 9%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. In fact, consistent with our strategy, we continue to leverage our retail network to drive 25,000 wealth referrals year-to-date through May, up 18% year-over-year. Wealth revenues were down 5%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs, particularly in the private bank. However, Wealth at Work revenues were up over 30%, driven by strong lending results primarily in mortgages. Client advisers were down 1%, reflecting the repacing of strategic hiring. And new client acquisitions were up nearly 40% in the Private Bank and approximately 60% in Wealth at Work in the second quarter. While there's clearly more work to do in wealth, we are seeing good momentum in the underlying drivers. On Slide 14, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues were down 1% as the benefit of higher rates and volumes in Mexico was more than offset by the reductions from closed consumer exit and wind downs. It's worth noting that Mexico's revenues were up 22% and 10% ex-FX. Expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by closed consumer exits and wind downs. Excluding divestiture related impacts, expenses decreased 8%. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate Other for the second quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses also increased driven by inflation and severance. On Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our third quarter and full year 2023 outlook. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture related impacts, although the mix has shifted somewhat. We are increasing our net interest income guidance from $45 billion to slightly above $46 billion for the full year, excluding markets, offset by lower noninterest revenue, largely driven by investment banking and wealth. We're also maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessments. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize in the remainder of the year with both portfolios reaching normalized levels by year-end. And we now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture related impacts. As it relates to the third quarter, we expect continued momentum with clients, including fees and benefits from US and non-US rates on NII. We also anticipate a sequential increase in expenses, driven by continued investments in transformation and risk and controls. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize in line with expectations. And our effective tax rate for the quarter should be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture-related impacts. And as it relates to buybacks, we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few points. We continue to execute on the strategy to simplify our firm, improve our revenue mix and bring both expenses and capital down over time. We're seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our business. And as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we remain focused on achieving our medium term ROTCE target. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. So I'm very curious on the whole revenue to RWA topic, especially with some of the changes coming in. So maybe you could give a little more color on -- let's say for instance, the further reduction in the subscription credit facility. I think I read somewhere that was like an $80 billion book down to $20 billion. You can correct that if that's wrong. But just usually those things are big important clients that have relationship lending things attached to them. So I'm curious on how you balance the capital benefit -- the clear capital benefit versus the client impact and how you think about that? Are there other blocks of business that are in motion right now? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Thanks, Glenn, and good morning. Thanks for the question. Look, a couple of points on that. One is, we've been very focused on the revenue to RWA metric in our markets business in the ICG more broadly as well. And we've made considerable progress on that. And that's important because how we use the balance sheet and ensuring that we're optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we improve returns over time. You're right to point out the subscription facility, credit facility lending that we do. We brought that down pretty significantly. The numbers you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio. But what's important here is that, as we look at that, we look at a couple of things. So one, the nature of the relationship and whether clients are taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to offer; two, the profitability and returns associated with the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship, and where that -- those returns are low, subpar and the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless, we take it down. And that's what we've done with a large part of that book just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities to use balance sheet where clients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore are generating higher returns. And we're going to continue to do that. We've done that to drive the revenue to RWA metric. We've done it selectively on pieces of the portfolio like SCF. We've also looked at our broader corporate lending portfolio and where those promises for higher relationship returns aren't manifesting themselves. We've not renewed those loans. And as we think about pending regulatory changes proactively making these efforts becomes critically important. When I look back on the activity that we've done over the past couple of years, we've reduced RWA by approximately $120 billion over the last two years. And about 75% of that is predominantly driven by balance sheet optimization and looking at client activity that has low margin business. And so, this is important for us to do what we keep doing.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that, Mark. Maybe just a quick follow-up. On NII, I had asked this last quarter too. And your first half annualized ex market is running about $1.5 billion ahead of the guide. Is that just unpredictable nature of all the moving parts trying to be conservative or anything else in the back half that you're thinking about?\nMark Mason: Thanks, Glenn. We did take guidance up to above -- slightly above $46 billion from the $45 billion. I guess there are a couple of things in FX markets, of course. There are a couple of things to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that play through there. One is, you've heard me mention before that we've reached terminal betas in the US; two, deposit volumes and the ship mix as we see consumers kind of move into [Technical Difficulty] products; and three, really the wind downs and the exits and the reduction that they will [Technical Difficulty] kind of three headwinds as we think about the forecast and the balance of the year. There are obviously some potential tailwinds that play to the other side, including rate movements from in non-US dollar, as well as card volume growth. And as we look at those headwinds and tailwinds, our current read is to take it up, but $46 billion or slightly above that feels like the right level in the context of total revenues at $78 million to $79 billion.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.\nJim Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just getting on the expense side. You're keeping Mexico till 2025 now at the earliest. So that will be on the books longer. How do we think about that bend the curve discussion? And maybe specifically, you can help us think about bending the curve for the non-legacy businesses? Do we start to see -- is the fourth quarter just a slowing or quarterly decline? Is it a year-over-year kind of a discussion? I just want to make sure I understand the whole bend the curve notion and how to think about that.\nMark Mason: Thank you. Let me take that. I'd say a couple of things. So one, I'd reiterate the expense guidance that we've given for the full year. So that's the roughly $54 billion ex divestitures or the impact of divestitures, ex any impact from FDIC special assessment. Two, as we think about bending the curve, I look into 2024 and we're looking to bring the absolute expense dollars down from Q3 to Q4. So that bending of the curve will occur. It will occur despite having Mexico still part of the franchise. And we obviously still having Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but it will bend Q3 to Q4. And then beyond that and through the medium term, we will see the curve continue to bend. Again, Mexico impacts the magnitude of the band, but we're very, very focused on bringing our costs down and bending that curve. And you've heard us reference the aspects or the elements of our business that help contribute to that, not the least of which are the exits, one of which is Mexico, and you referenced the timing there, but also the benefits from the investments that we've been making in transformation and risk and controls and shifting from manual processes to technology enabled ones. And then the final one is around simplifying our organization. And you heard in Jane's prepared remarks, as we continue to make progress on these exits it opens up the opportunity for us to lean more heavily into that simplification. So we are focused on not only the guidance, but the bending of the curve as you point out, and looking forward to delivering that and taking actions to ensure we do.\nJim Mitchell: So just as a follow-up, is the way to think about sort of 2025 and beyond as you get through a lot of the automation on the sort of the non-legacy businesses and start to get much more efficient there. Can we -- is there an absolute expense decline story in the core business? Or is that more of a -- you need the top line growth to get the improved returns?\nMark Mason: Again, it's going to be a combination of continuing to bend the curve and bring our expenses down. Obviously, we've given you guidance on operating efficiency of less than 60%, which will be some of that top line growth, but it's the combination of the two.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nJane Fraser: Hi, Betsy\nBetsy Graseck: I just wanted to confirm on the CET1. You have 100 basis point buffer on top of regulatory minimums. So that would suggest that the 13.3% that you got this quarter is in line with where you're planning on holding it going forward. Is that fair?\nMark Mason: Yes. So you're right, we hit 13.3% this quarter, down a tad bit from the 13.4% last quarter. Effective October 1, the 4.3% SCB comes into play. And so, that would equate to assuming the 100 basis point management buffer at 12.3% regulatory requirement and a 13.3% kind of target that we would manage to. I'd highlight a couple of things that I'm sure are obvious to you, Betsy. One is, this is the stress capital buffer for the 12 month period starting October 1. And two is, the strategy that we've described and talked about and have started to execute against is intentionally designed to help morph the business towards a more steady, predictable, consistent stream of revenues, fee revenue growth, as well as bring our expenses down over time, and exit these markets, and those things should contribute to reducing our stress capital buffer over time and improving our returns. But the answer to your question very directly is, yes, the 13.3% would reflect where we'd be targeting as of October 1 for now.\nBetsy Graseck: And since you mentioned you're evaluating buybacks quarter-by-quarter. I guess the question here is, how should I think about that relative to we get Basel endgame coming out soon because clearly, when you're at 13.3% against the new rate cap SEB, you it signals a bigger opportunity for buybacks over the coming quarters. So how should I think about that?\nJane Fraser: I think consistent with what we've been talking about. There's a lot of uncertainty out there about the new capital requirements, both in terms of the nature of them and the timing of implementation. I think the industry is expecting to get more clarity about that with the comment period that will be coming up. Plus it's a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment at the moment. So both Mark and I feel it's prudent to continue making that assessment until some of this uncertainty is clarified as to what precisely will do. You should take confidence that we're at the levels, including the management buffer that we expect to be for the rest of the year. We've proven a good case of being able to build capital. That's for sure over the last two years. And you take comfort as well. We increased the dividend. We had $2 billion of capital returned last quarter. So our intentions are clear to return capital where we can, but also to be prudent in how we do so, given environment and current regulatory uncertainty.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. One negative question, one positive question. So on the negative side, you talked about bending the cost curve, but I think second quarter year-over-year it's bending the wrong way. And six quarters from now, you're saying it should bend the other way. So what are we not seeing in the financials that gives you such confidence? Because it seems based on this quarter's results, a little bit more of a trustee story. And on the positive side, TPS continued double digit growth, you continue to invest more in that business. How are you monetizing greater money motion among your multinational and other clients? Thanks.\nJane Fraser: Thanks, Mike. I'll kick it off and then send it back to Mark. In terms of the expense side, I think we've been very transparent about the arc of our investment spend related to both the transformation and beyond. We'll continue to give you that transparency Mike. Now last year, we hit our expense guidance. This year, we're on track for the guidance of roughly the $54 billion ex FDIC and divestitures and looking forward, we continue to guide what are the three levers that will drive the reduction in the expense curve starting at the end of 2024. It's from the exits and I think you've got a clear sense around the progress that we have been making on the divestitures. And therefore, we're pivoting, as we talked about, to focus now on really tackling the stranded expenses as we close off the final couple of sales there in Asia in the next few months. We'll realize the benefits [indiscernible] investments in transformation and controls over the medium term. We'll also have the benefit of the remediation work getting done and expenses going away from that. And then the third one will be simplifying the organization, as we talked about. So we'll continue to walk you step-by-step. What are the different actions we're taking, what are we doing? And hopefully, we are building up that track record of doing what we will say we are going to do every quarter. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Mason: The only thing I\u2019ll add on the expense side, and then you may want to touch on the TTS. But the only add on the expense side is the -- we are taking repositioning charges, Mike. I mean, we're not sitting still as we go through this uncertain period of time where wallets across certain parts of the industry are under significant pressure. And in taking those repositioning charges, there are going to be expense reductions that ultimately play out over the next 12-month period. So that's the other factor in addition to what Jane mentioned in the way of exits and benefits from the transformation that will play into the cost base over the next 12 months.\nJane Fraser: And then on TTS, I think we all share your enthusiasm for this business in terms of the growth potential that we've been realizing and expect to continue, albeit converging now to the medium-term guidance over the next few quarters where we see it's a high to medium single-digit growth going forward. It's a very high-returning business and some of the indicators of how we're monetizing those relationships. We're seeing it both in terms of new client wins, they were up 41% this quarter. We have a sustained win loss ratio of 80% on the new deals across different client segments. We're also seeing growth that's starting to really kick in from our commercial bank and the expansion of clients in the middle market around the world as we grow out that franchise. And we've got some very good fee growth, which as Mark points out, and I point out all the time, we're very focused around the cross-border, up 11% US dollar clearing up 6%, commercial cards up 15%, et cetera. And we continue to invest in the business as well, so to make sure that, that 80% win ratio continues. So first bank to launch 24/7 $365 clearing -- US dollar clearing. We've got the instant payments platform we just launched for e-commerce clients. We have payments express that is now live in the US, on track for five markets by the year-end. So it's a story of innovation. It's a story of investment. It's got great returns. It's a good growth story. And it just -- it keeps ongoing. And I don't want to diminish security services in there either. It's another business that's similarly continuing to see significant client wins up 65% versus last year as well. And a lot of our strategy there has been focused on gaining share with the asset managers in North America. Couple of years ago, we're down at 2.6% share. We're up about 4.3%. Our target is about 5.5% there in 2025 in that key growth area. I know there's a lot to like here too.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UPS -- UBS.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning or good afternoon. So I apologize having to ask the expense question again, but I think it's just very important because there's really potential long-only investment thesis on Citi, right? One is the buyback given your tangible book values at $85 and the stock at $46 and the other is the bending the curve on expenses. So let me just ask Jim's question another way. In looking back to 2017, and I'm just looking at 2017 because I can break out legacy and core that way. And fast forward to 2022, you produced revenues ex legacy franchises about $61 billion in 2017 and about $67 billion in 2022. The associated expenses, again, without legacy franchises was about $34.5 billion in 2017 versus $43.5 billion in 2022, so you're surpassing the revenue uplift during that period by $3 billion. I guess the question is, you have so much certainty about the timing of this expense and I'm wondering how much of this $9 billion can go away? We understand that there's a lot of opportunity for reinvestment in the core business. But I think all of us are struggling to really understand that magnitude. And I think that the investor base in the market fully understands the legacy franchise story and how the exits will take time. But I think they're most interested in the core business and how much of that can come out.\nMark Mason: Yes, sure. Look, no need to apologize for asking the question again. It's an important -- it's an important topic. I'd say a couple of things. So one is that, we can certainly look back in time, but I would highlight that we're here because we needed to have invested more in our franchise. And so undoubtedly there's going to be an increase in our expense base that reflects the underinvestment from the past and ensuring up safety and soundness and actually moving towards a more automated operational -- more modernized operations and infrastructure. So there's certainly going to be that. With that said, with those investments come efficiencies. So with the move from manual to automation over time, those types of investments will yield benefits in our cost structure. And that's part of what is going to bend the curve over that medium-term period. The other thing that I'd highlight is, obviously, with the legacy franchises, there's $7 billion of expense associated with those, and that will come down. But that -- but because of the Mexico transaction, we're going to be stuck with that a little bit longer given the IPO process. It doesn't put a big dent in our ability to bring stranded cost down and by the way, it does come with top line revenues and historically has been accretive to our profitability and returns. And so I highlight -- I'm not going to give you kind of new guidance on where our expenses will end up. But what I will point you to is not only the $54 billion this year, roughly $54 billion this year, not only the bending of the curve in the third and fourth quarter or the third to the fourth quarter next year. But we've given guidance on top line growth revenue of 5%, call it, CAGR through that medium-term period, and we've given you kind of operating efficiency targets that we've said as well, and we intend to deliver on those things that reflect the bending of that curve through all of those drivers that we've mentioned. So I hope that helps, Erika. I appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses. We are equally focused on it and know just how important it is to achieving those targets. We're not only kind of doing the things that we've highlighted in that strategy articulation, but we're also being responsive to the current environment that we're in. We think that aids in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve, and we know there's an additional opportunity that Jane has referenced to the simplification of the organization as we make -- what I would argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year. And all of those things will be important to ensuring we get to that lower cost base, which we will do.\nJane Fraser: And it's a laser micro focus from us to make sure that we have the plans in place and the execution to be able to achieve it. This is something that's -- we're extremely hands-on around and making sure that, that is going to get done on each of the different drivers that Mark talked about.\nOperator: And our next question -- go ahead.\nErika Najarian: All right. And just a follow-up on that. I guess, you guys have been pretty clear on the timing, and you guys have been pretty clear on why the curve will bend. I guess I'm wondering -- is it just a timing issue that you're not giving us the sort of the dollar numbers that could go away from the transformation? Is it just a timing issue? Or are you still at a point where you don't know how much of that you would need to reinvest to arrive at that 5% revenue CAGR?\nMark Mason: Sorry, your question was around expenses or the revenue?\nErika Najarian: Expenses. So we get loud and clear why the curve will bend. We get loud and clear when the curve will bend, right?\nMark Mason: Yes.\nErika Najarian: And there's clearly just expenses there that are catch-up expenses that are transformational expenses to everything that Jane talked about. And that message has been loud and clear. And I'm wondering if you haven't told us what could come out of those expenses because it's just a timing issue. It's July 14 versus 4Q 2024? Or have you not yet made decisions in terms of how you may allocate those expenses in terms of do you need some of those expenses that could come out to grow your revenue base to that 5% CAGR versus having it fall to the bottom line? Sorry, that's the question.\nMark Mason: Got it. Jane, do you want to start or?\nJane Fraser: Go ahead.\nMark Mason: Yes. So I'd say a couple of things. So one, Erika, is obviously, with that revenue CAGR will be volume-related expenses that play out. But we're also focused, obviously, on the non-volume related expenses and not giving you a precise number because the magnitude of that band, right, is a factor, right? So obviously, Mexico, for example, as I mentioned earlier, impacts the magnitude of the bend, right? And we're going to and have, in fact, when you look at our expense base even for the quarter, we've spent money in Mexico to drive that top line 22% revenue growth, 10% ex-FX. And so, there are going to be nuances in the running of the business in a way that ensures we're maximizing shareholder value that impacts the magnitude of the bending of that expense curve. Investments that I got to continue to make in TTS in order to maintain that number one position in that competitive advantage that we have. And so, those things will impact that magnitude of the bend. We've been, I think, very transparent as we get into each year, giving you concrete numbers. What I'm telling you is the curve will bend. And as we get closer to 2024, we'll give you more direction on the magnitude for that year and beyond.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question on capital. Just given the recent increase in your SCB, I was hoping to better understand why the 11.5% to 12% remains the appropriate long-term objective in your mind? And as we prepare for Basel III end game, think through the capital benefit from future asset sales, can you speak to whether that will translate into operational risk capital relief specifically as it's less clear whether those benefits will accrete even as those asset sales are consummated?\nJane Fraser: I'll kick it off, Mark, and then pass it to you. So when we look -- we're confident we're going to meet 11% to 12% ROTC target over the medium term. The core drivers of how we get there remains unchanged. One, it's the revenues that we expect to grow by 4% to 5% CAGR as we continue to execute on the strategy. On expenses, it's the clear path to bend the curve by the end 2024, bringing those expenses down over the medium term. And third and importantly, it's continuing to optimize our balance sheet including improving RWA and capital efficiency. And as we referenced earlier in the prepared remarks, different drivers in that, that are helpful exiting 14 international consumer markets, changing our business mix. And I'd also note that the transformation has benefits not only for our efficiency, but it will also support RWA and capital optimization. That said, there's uncertainty around the future capital requirements in the industry and importantly, the timing of their implementation. We like everyone again to have to work through those implications once we know what they are. But as we said, keep in mind, we've got some other levers to pull over time, capital allocation, DTA allocation and utilization, our G-SIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points. So that's where you hear the confidence for us -- from us around the path to executing and that remaining consistent. But Mark, why don't I hand over to you just around consumer market sales and operational RWA relief.\nMark Mason: Sure. And again, I think that if you look at the transactions that we've closed to date, they've generated or freed up about $4.6 billion of capital the two that remain to be closed and the balance of the year will generate another $1.2 billion or so. That will be important to our capital base. I think that we obviously have to see the proposal as it comes out and the NPR. And we have to -- we'll have a window to respond to that. We're hopeful that the regulators hear our response and views on it as it comes out. There's clear -- there's clearly going to be a reference to increases in RWA and operational risk implications potentially as part of that. I do think that exiting without having seen the proposal, and without obviously knowing how those rules might evolve. I do believe that the exiting of these 14 markets does play towards not only reducing our SCB in stress scenarios or as it comes out of stress analysis and tests, but also should play through helping to reduce risk-weighted assets and potentially operational risk as well. But we have to see what the proposal looks like and go through that. And I think what's important here is that, whenever it comes out, whatever it looks like, as we dissect it and go through it, we'll figure out how to manage through it, right, whether that be through exiting certain products, seeking price adjustments as it relates to customers, clients and the markets or continuing to optimize RWAs as we have been doing very proactively, we'll figure out how to manage.\nJane Fraser: And I feel [indiscernible] to jump in here as well because as the spring and the recent test results showed the large US banks are not only in a strong capital position, but we've been able to play an important stabilizing role for the system as a whole. It's a role that we take very seriously. And we certainly hope that as the details of the capital frameworks get unveiled, this is fully taken into consideration, including the impact on US competitiveness. And we need a level playing field with Europe, not a gold-plated one. And we share the concern that higher capital levels will undoubtedly increase the cost of capital for medium and smaller sized enterprises and consumers in particular, and will drive more activity to non-regulated and lesser capitalized players that isn't in the system's interest. And we hope that, that's fully taken into consideration here because we will take actions on businesses, and we will take pricing actions as well the entire industry.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that perspective, Jane, very well said. Just one quick follow-up for me. PBWM fee income trends, given the lower partner payments, I mean, clearly, the wealth fee trends were -- would suggest that they were quite subdued in the quarter. And I just wanted to understand your outlook over the near to medium term, what drove some of the weakness this quarter? Is it something that you expect will likely persist, especially given some of the market tailwinds that we've been seeing would have expected to see a little bit more resiliency in wealth fee income in particular?\nMark Mason: Yes. Look, I think as we mentioned, wealth was down about 5%. It's really hard to talk about the rebound in wealth in the midst of such an uncertain environment and the one that we're in. It's hard to disconnect those macro factors like rates, inflation, the prospect of a recession from what we're seeing in wealth. And I think there are two dynamics that have played out. One has been the shift from our customers -- from customers more broadly into higher-yielding products from out of deposits. And the other has been the fee revenue from an investment management fee point of view, and as you might think about it, it is a higher rate environment. There are opportunities for clients to earn more. And not until there's greater certainty in the broader macro factors, well, I think we start to see some real momentum tick up there. Now with that said, a couple of things worth reiterating, which is, we're seeing very strong referral momentum from the retail banking business up through the wealth continuum, if you will. So we've had about 25,000 referrals May year-to-date from our retail branches into our broader wealth business, that's a good thing. We've seen the number of clients that we've on-boarded tick up pretty meaningfully, both in the private bank and more broadly across wealth. That's a good thing. Those are things that position us well for when greater certainty does play out and these clients start to put monies back to work in the broader investment platform and offering that we have.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hi, good afternoon. Just one quick question, Mark, for you. On the consumer cards book, you gave some metrics. One, remind us what you reserved for in terms of unemployment rate, macro? And if we do -- and whether if we do [indiscernible] market does that necessarily in that we'll see big lacing up of credit reserves where you already are? Just some color around that would be helpful.\nMark Mason: Sorry, just the last part of your question, I'm sorry, if we do see what?\nEbrahim Poonawala: Yes. So one, like where are you in terms of your unemployment rate assumption? And if the unemployment outlook worsens, let's say, over the next six to 12 months, does that mean that you are already reserved? Or will we see another big pickup in provisioning as a result of that?\nMark Mason: Got it. Thank you. Look, our current reserves, as you know, as we think about CESL, we've got three different scenarios. We've got a base case in upside, a downside. Our current reserves are based on the mix of those three macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects about a 5.1% unemployment rate on a weighted basis over the eight quarters, and it's roughly flat to what it was last quarter. What that means is, obviously, our downside scenario has unemployment that's much higher than that, closer to 7% or call it 6.8% or so. But that's kind of how we've thought about unemployment. As we think about the reserves each quarter, obviously, we take a look at the macroeconomic factors and how they're evolving. Our base case today assumes a mild recession and reserves in the future will consider how are weighting towards downside, upside and baseline may more subject to our outlook and volumes. Those are the two factors that influence whether we're increasing reserves or not. I would point out though that in addition to unemployment and because unemployment has been as stubborn as it has been, if you will, we also look at debt service coverage ratio as an important factor as we think about our consumers, as we think about their balance sheet, as we think about the risk that they may or may not be facing. So unemployment is an important factor. But we've flexed our thinking in light of the environment and in light of how behaviors have been shifting, and that's an important factor in how we think about our reserves as well. I feel very good about the level of our reserves. You heard us mention earlier, we've got $20 billion of reserves, we're well reserved across the portfolio, but those are all important elements to it.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. And just one very simplistic question. When you talk to some of your largest shareholders, those who are optimistic think you can hit your ROTCE target medium term by 2025. Is that a realistic expectation given, I appreciate Basel changes, you answered like 10 questions on expenses. But should we expect the groundwork through 2024 that we hit that medium-term target in 2025 or just your degree of confidence.\nMark Mason: Yes. Again, the thing I'd point out and Jane, feel free to chime in here, is that what we talked about was getting to our medium-term returns, 11% to 12% and the medium term is 25% to 26%, right? So it's not just 25%, just to be clear. And we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that. You heard us mention the levers that we think will contribute to that. Obviously, capital is important and how that evolves and we continue to kind of work to optimize the balance sheet while serving our clients effectively and importantly, growing the strong businesses that we have that are high returning as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Hi. [Technical Difficulty] credit card in the back half of the year. And just wondering, you've got the normalized loss rates on Slide 22. Are you still thinking you'll hit those, I think, exiting this year or early next year. And then, I think at one point you said they might go a little bit above that before they kind of come back to a normal level? And is that still the case?\nMark Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question. The answer is, yes. We still expect for both portfolios to hit those normal levels sometime at the end of the year, the normal level, as you pointed out, on the page for both branded as well as for retail services. We would expect, again, subject to how and when this mild recession kind of plays out, we would expect that they would tick higher than that before getting back inside of that range. But again, all of this is tied into how we've calculated our reserves, the delinquencies that we're seeing, the mix of the portfolio, which again skews towards your higher FICO scores and the customer behaviors that we're seeing, which play through not only that cost of credit line, but also plays through the growth that we referenced earlier in the top line. But the short answer is yes, that's still our thinking.\nJane Fraser: And as Mark said, I think we feel good about our positioning as a prime, but also a strong credit proposition that we have. We're seeing stronger demand for the credit-led products such as value cards, bulk on installment loans, as well as the service-led engagement for the more prime customers. And so, that's also going to be a valuable factor driving growth and profitability as well.\nMatt O'Connor: And then the follow-up, and this is not really Citi-specific, but for the card industry, a lot of the banks that are in card. Everyone is talking about kind of getting to normalized levels, just call it in the near term here next couple of quarters. And I guess, just thoughts on getting this normalized level of losses when unemployment is all-time low, wages are growing. Obviously, there's inflationary pressures, but it's just a little surprising, again, not to say specific, but it's a little surprising that we're getting to this normalized state when things seem like they're pretty good.\nJane Fraser: Yes, I think well, also the normalized state back in 2019 is also pretty good. So you're not hearing any alarm bells ringing from Mark or myself at all here on the US consumer. I think we see the US consumer as resilient. We've talked about them being cautious but they're not recessionary. And we are seeing more pressure on the lower FICOs. We don't have a large number of that in our portfolio, but that is where we're seeing more of the normalization happening on the payment rates, for example, on other behaviors in there. So it's quite localized, but I don't think we should be overly concerned here about the health of the US consumer. And as Mark said, we're in a very unusual environment, higher inflation, these rate levels and a strong labor market. And under those conditions, it's the debt service ratio, as he said, that is, we think, is a more useful leading indicator that we keep a close eye on.\nMark Mason: Just remember, it's a return to normal.\nJane Fraser: Yes.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark.\nJane Fraser: Hi.\nGerard Cassidy: Mark, can you share this in your financial supplement, obviously, you give us good details on your credit picture and we're talking about credit right now. The nonaccrual loans have been flat as a pancake for the last 12 months for you folks and the industry as well. And this is in light of the Fed funds rates, as we all know, have been up over 500 basis points. Can you guys share with us what's -- why we haven't seen more -- this is mostly corporate, of course, but everybody has been hanging in there very well in view of the fact that rates have gone up so much. What are your customers telling you or are you seeing that has enabled them to remain very healthy in light of a 500 basis point increase in interest rates?\nMark Mason: Yes. I think I'd point to a couple of things. One is, remember, we focus on the large multinational largely investment grade quality names. And so, that's one important factor when you think about our ICG and corporate exposure there. The second thing I'd point out is, we have to remember that many of these companies had and still have very strong balance sheets and that they've managed that through the COVID and pandemic situation and that has positioned them well. I think the third thing is that and you've heard us mention how we're proactively managing the prospect of a recession. And I think when I talk to other CFOs, I know that when Jane talks to other CEOs, they too are looking at their expense line. They too are looking at the efficiency of their organizations and opportunity to increase that efficiency in light of a potential slowdown or recessionary environment. And then the final point is, I think a lot of firms have been that were proactive in the low rate environment, ensuring up that balance sheet strength. Now with that said, you've heard us also mention the prospect of a rebound in capital market activities, and that has to happen at some point. But sticking to your point around credit, I really think it's those factors that you see play through in not only our very low NAL, but also our very low credit losses, credit cost that you've seen in our business.\nGerard Cassidy: And then as a follow-up, when you think about what we've seen with the Fed's tightening over the last 12 months, banks like your own have positioned the balance sheet accordingly and I know the Bank Analysts Association of Boston, Michael did a good job explaining how you guys manage the balance sheet. And how -- when you look at it going forward, do you think changes are coming because the Fed if they end -- the Fed funds rate increase as we get to a terminal rate, how are you guys positioned the balance sheet, do you think going forward?\nMark Mason: Look, we're constantly actively managing the balance sheet in light of not only our client needs, but also how we see the broader macro environment evolving and changing. And as you know, and I know you've seen and we've talked about before, we share in our Qs, our view on our estimate for interest rate exposure and what happens with 100 basis points swing in rates in one direction or another across the curve across currencies. You've seen that shift over the last number of quarters to the last quarter where that estimate for IRE was about $1.7 billion or so, but heavily skewed towards non-US dollar rates and currencies. And I think as we think about the view on how rates will evolve, you'll see a continued shift there. I think that when we look to print this quarter, that number will probably come down a bit in terms of interest rate exposure and skew even more towards non-US dollar currencies in light of where rates are in those markets and the US dollar will likely be somewhat neutral in light of that curve currently looks like. But again, something we actively manage, first with an eye towards what client demand and needs are likely to be for use of our liquidity but also with a view for how the macro environment might evolve and what we're hearing from central banks around the world.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. I'm sorry, we have Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I meant to follow up earlier on the bending of the cost curve, but if you were to put different initiatives in terms of how far along you are maybe like your exits might be in the eighth inning and your transformation might be in the sixth inning and you remediate fifth inning and the simplification in the first inning or second inning. Are those numbers correct? How would you put those numbers? And in terms of bending the cost curve, where are you further along and where are you just getting started?\nMark Mason: Well, Mike, I love you, but I'm not going to play that game. What I will say is that, we clearly have work that we're doing as it relates to the exits, but we're making very good progress on that, not just on the closing of the exits but also on putting a dent in the stranded costs associated with those exits that we have closed. And so, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, by the time we get to the end of the year, ex Mexico, we would have made a considerable amount of progress on there, and that creates an opportunity to do more around the simplification of the organization. And so that simplification is obviously in an earlier inning, call it, the exits in a later inning. I think that the transformation spend investments and those things. Look, we are squarely into execution, as you've heard us mention before. And as I've mentioned, the expense base around that is going to continue to morph from spend that we've made around third-party consultants and that helped in the crafting of the plan towards technology, towards people that are critically involved in the execution of it and then a downward trajectory towards the benefits we get from that technology and reduced operational expense. And so it's a multiyear journey. We've talked about that. We've got a number of years to continue to execute against it. But what's important is we know what we have to do, both in how we're investing that money and as it relates to being disciplined about our cost structure and bending the curve. And again, that's what we're going to do.\nMike Mayo: And one more attempt, can you remind us how many people are working on the transformation remediation and how much that's costing you?\nMark Mason: Yes. I mean, again, we've got -- I think the number I shared was somewhere around 13,000 people or so that are broadly working on the efforts here. We haven't gotten into specific costs. You know it's in the total number. But what I would say again is that, we're clear on what we've got to deliver and execute against and we're managing that cost very tightly. We're constantly looking at opportunities to deliver on those transformation deliverables, more efficiently, leveraging more technology, leveraging AI in some instances. And so, we're not just taking those execution plans as they were crafted and delivering against them. But we're looking for efficiencies and even the execution plans as they're constructed today. And that's important for us to keep doing.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kenneth Usdin with Jefferies.\nKenneth Usdin: Hi. I know this is going along here. Just a quick one, just, Mark, on the -- just wanted to get your sense on the sentiment around client activity in both the markets group and what the pipelines are looking like in investment banking and the feel for that? Thanks.\nJane Fraser: Look, I'll jump in here. Corporates are pretty cautious. They've got another Fed hike in the offing, tensions, China and the West, OPEC and all general sense of more limited growth. But I think clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while. I think they now seem to accept the current environment is the new normal and are beginning to position themselves globally. So globally, we're seeing less anxiety around funding as most large corps are biting the bullet and paying higher rates to take advantage of [indiscernible] balance sheet is getting reinforced. We certainly don't see a large cap credit prices on the horizon. And on the IB side, it remains -- the pipeline is robust. There's a lot of pent-up demand for M&A, but it's hard to predict when that pipeline will unlock. ECM had tangible momentum over Q1, and we're also seeing sponsor fringing signs of improvement, but both of those are from a very, very low base. And on the investor side, most of the investors stayed on the sidelines in Q2. The debt ceiling was a bigger topic than economic news was, and then it was a very low volume environment. We saw a bit of a pickup at the beginning of -- with the light bump in volatility in the last few days, but I wouldn't call that a trend yet.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Charles Peabody with [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Participant: Yes. Good afternoon. A question about your markets related net interest income. And before I ask the question, I do appreciate that you run those businesses on a holistic basis and that NII is probably more of a residual outcome. But a couple of questions related to market-related NII. First is, you had a pretty nice jump up in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And I just wanted to understand, is that largely related to seasonal dividend issues? And then secondly, you have a positive NII outcome, where a lot of your money center in Brethren will have a negative NII outcome for markets and I was just wondering what the difference is? Is it the outsized [FIC] (ph) business relative to equities? Or is it the international? Or is it how you hedge? What's the difference on that? So those are the two questions.\nMark Mason: Thanks for the question, and thanks for the acknowledgment that we do manage our markets revenues in total. So I appreciate that. What I would say in terms of the markets NII is, you've captured it right, which is, the dynamic that's playing out between first quarter and second quarter is in fact a dividend season. And again, given the globality of our franchise, the dividend is not just a dividend in any one region, but dividend in multiple regions playing out over the course of the first and second quarter. I can't speak to the peers at this particular stage. But what I would say is that, you know that our book SKUs more so than peers to corporates, and that's important. And we obviously have a very, very strong FIC business more broadly as well. So dividend season, major driver here in that increase.\nUnidentified Participant: Okay. And just as a follow-up, is there any sort of directional guidance you can give on markets related to NII? I mean does it mean to the extent second quarter was bolstered by dividend, it comes down in the third quarter, but then does it go back up in the fourth quarter? So would the second half be kind of equivalent to the first half?\nMark Mason: Charles, I really appreciate the attempt there. But I'm not going to give any further guidance on the breakout of the NII. I will reiterate the ex-markets NII increase, by the way, to plus 46% but thanks for the question. I appreciate that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nJane Fraser: Hi, Vivek.\nVivek Juneja: Hi. Thanks. Couple of questions. Number one, so capital, Jane and Mark, going back to that, should we expect that given what you've mentioned, given everything going on in the regulatory environment, ratio you're at currently, it should grow in anticipation of what may come or likely to come with all the regulatory stuff? Or are you going to try and keep that closer to the 13.3%?\nJane Fraser: I think we're going to see exactly what the framework is that comes out and then the implementation time frame for it and then look at making adjustments to plan, also hoping that the comment period is taken seriously and the different considerations I talked about earlier are taken into effect. Then we'll work through water adjustments we make, pricing capital reallocation, et cetera, the playbook that you would expect the same one that we've done with [indiscernible] and we've done with a number of other pieces. And we would also hope to see our SCB in a different place for the same reasons we talked about earlier Vivek because there's a lot of volatility in that SCB dependent on the scenario that comes out every year. And I would say, given the shifts we're making in the business model, we'd expect to see that one come down.\nMark Mason: The only thing I'd add is the -- again, the CET1 ratio of the 13.3% as of October 1 would be a 12.3% required level and 100 basis points of the management buffer. So that would be what we'd be held to as of October 1. As Jane mentioned, the NPR as it comes out, we'll take a look at that and see if there are implications on the CET1 stack, but more likely implications on the risk-weighted assets, right? And what's really important there aside from the very important points Jane made in terms of considering broader factors is the timing of the implementation of whatever that final rule includes and obviously, the more timing for implementation, the more of an ability it gets for the industry to think about how to absorb the implications there.\nVivek Juneja: But I'm presuming you want to go sooner rather than later because the market is going to expect that rather than take a full three years or whatever the Fed might give you.\nMark Mason: You know what, I'm really interested at this point in seeing the proposal, and then we'll have a chance to kind of to really react as an industry and as a firm.\nVivek Juneja: Completely unrelated, if I may. Noninterest-bearing deposits, what are you seeing given you're very heavily corporate driven. When I look at your point-to-point because you don't give a full average balance sheet, it's only interest-bearing related. But the noninterest-bearing is only available on a peer end. If I look at that, there was a big drop in the US this quarter. Anything unusual? Is that accelerating? What are you seeing amongst your clients, people still waking up? And what have you factored into your NII guidance for that?\nMark Mason: Well, again, I think the point I'd make here is that, we continue to see clients shift from kind of noninterest-bearing deposits and into both interest-bearing and CDs and other higher-yielding products in light of the rate environment that we're in. And I would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts subject to how rates continue to evolve. And again, on the corporate side, we've seen in the US clients have reached kind of those terminal -- that terminal level, terminal betas, I should say, outside of the US rate hikes, I think, are still in the future, as Jane alluded to, and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached. But in terms of the noninterest bearing, we are seeing that dynamic play out.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude Citi's second quarter 2023 earnings review call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen. And good morning to everyone. While this quarter wasn't as eventful as the first quarter, it was not without its moments. The global economy continues to be remarkably resilient, although the macro backdrop differs across key markets. And while the bulk of the tightening is behind us, central banks are responding vigorously to inflation and have made it clear the cycle of hikes isn't over. In the US the tight labor market keeps pushing the timing of this elusive recession later into this year or 2024 with the robust demand for services providing a backstop for the economy. The Eurozone has also exceeded expectations. However, most countries there are facing pressure from labor and energy costs, challenging the region's longer-term competitiveness. China is the biggest disappointment as growth decelerated after an initial post reopening pop. I was there last month and let's just say few on the ground expect China to be as strong a driver of global growth this year as some had hoped. So bottom line, globally we continue to see the same quite challenging macroeconomic conditions that we [Technical Difficulty] benefits of our diversified business model and strong balance sheet. We remain laser focused on executing our strategy and simplifying and modernizing our bank. Despite the turbulence and macro backdrop of the first half, we're on track with the plan we laid out at Investor Day and we remain committed to our strategy and our medium-term ROTCE target. Today we reported net income of $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33. Our revenues ex divestitures are relatively flat to last year and we remain on track to meet our revenue guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion for the year. We're also on track to meet the expense guidance for the year. And consistent with the plan we shared with you at our Investor Day, we are pursuing cost saving opportunities to help offset the significant investments in our transformation. In services, TTS continues to deliver with revenues up a healthy 15%. This was driven by both net interest income and noninterest revenue as we win fee generating mandates with new clients and deepen our relationships with existing large corporate and commercial clients. We're proud of our number one ranking for large institutional clients, and this week we announced our latest innovation CitiDirect Commercial Banking, a digital platform to help our growing commercial clients tap into our global network. Security services revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. We're really pleased with execution in this business as we continue to bring in new assets under custody and administration, which are up by approximately $2.4 trillion in the last year. We've gained 100 basis points in share year-over-year as a result of the investments we've been making. Markets revenues were down 13% compared to an exceptionally strong second quarter last year. From early April, clients stood on the sidelines as the debt ceiling played out and we continued to experience very low levels of volatility throughout the quarter. Despite this, our corporate client flows remained strong and we've achieved our medium-term revenue to RWA target again this quarter. In banking, the momentum in investment grade debt has spread into other DCM products, but the long-awaited rebound in investment banking has yet to materialize and it was a disappointing quarter in terms of both the wallet and our own performance with investment banking revenues down 24%. We continue to right size the business to the environment whilst making investments in selected areas, such as technology and healthcare. In the US, taken together, our cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth, aided by customer engagement and the continued normalization in payment rates. In branded cards, spend is still strong in travel and entertainment, and acquisitions remain pretty healthy. This is a great franchise and we have launched a raft of new innovations from transforming our [thank you] (ph) rewards platform to our enhanced value proposition for the premium card with our long-term partner American Airlines. Credit normalization is happening faster in retail services given the profile of the portfolio. And overall, I'd say we're seeing a more cautious consumer, but not necessarily a recessionary one. Wealth revenues were down 5% as the business continues to be negatively impacted by the deposit mix shift, particularly in the private bank and by lower investment revenues. However, we have seen activity pick up a bit in Asia for two quarters with growing net new assets. Referrals from the US retail banks are increasing and globally, new client acquisition in the private bank and wealth at work has grown significantly on the back of our investments in our network of client advisors and bankers. Turning to expenses. They were elevated this quarter as we expected. This includes the additional repositioning actions we took to right size certain businesses and functions in light of the current environment. Year-to-date, severance is about $450 million, including $200 million in the quarter. Separate to repositioning, we remain committed to bending our expense curve by the end of 2024 through three significant efforts; first, we continue to make investments in our transformation and other risk and control initiatives, which are necessary to modernize our infrastructure, automate our controls, as well as to improve the client experience. As we said before, we will start to see the momentarily benefits of these investments over the medium term. Second, as part of our simplification efforts, we expect to close the sales of our remaining two Asia consumer franchises by year-end, and we plan to restart the exit process in Poland. As you can see on the slide, we made excellent progress this quarter and the consumer businesses were winding down, aided by material asset sales, and we are now attacking stranded costs and closing out the TSAs in the markets that we have already exited. You saw our determination to execute when we decided to IPO Banamex after exploring a sale. We should complete the process of separating the two businesses fully next year in preparation for the IPO. And I'm pleased with the progress on the ground. We are about to begin acceptance testing on the new systems for the retained businesses. All this means that by year-end, considering how far the divestitures and wind-downs have progressed, legacy franchises will have materially reduced its exposures and primarily be down to Mexico, Poland, Korea and the elimination of the remaining stranded costs. As such, as we move through the second half of the year, we will be in a position to focus on the third leg of bringing down our expense base through a leaner organizational model. Together, these three efforts are why we have confidence in saying that we will start to bend the curve on an absolute basis by the end of 2024 and continue to bring down expenses over the medium term. Let me end with capital. Well, you won't be shocked to hear that we were disappointed with the increase to our stress capital buffer. We have engaged in active dialogue with the Fed to better understand the differences between our model and theirs in terms of noninterest revenue. And the industry awaits further clarity on capital requirements and importantly, their implementation timing from the holistic review the regulators have undertaken and the expected Basel III Endgame NPR. There is still uncertainty as to what the final rules will be, and we, like the rest of the industry, will need to work through the implications. The exit of 14 international consumer markets, coupled with the results of our transformation investments and change in business mix will help reduce our capital ratios. In addition, we have other levers to pull over time, such as capital allocation, DTA utilization, our G-SIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders as you saw with our decisions to repurchase $1 billion in common stock and increase the dividend. We ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.3%. That's 100 basis points above our upcoming requirement after returning a total of $2 billion in capital. And we grew our tangible book value per share to $85.34. Given the environment, we will continue to look at our level of capital return on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made, but there remains a lot to do. We will continue to update you on the progress we are making every quarter. And with that I'd like to turn it over to Mark and then we would both be [Technical Difficulty] Hi, Betsy I think consistent with what we've been talking about. There's a lot of uncertainty out there about the new capital requirements, both in terms of the nature of them and the timing of implementation. I think the industry is expecting to get more clarity about that with the comment period that will be coming up. Plus it's a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment at the moment. So both Mark and I feel it's prudent to continue making that assessment until some of this uncertainty is clarified as to what precisely will do. You should take confidence that we're at the levels, including the management buffer that we expect to be for the rest of the year. We've proven a good case of being able to build capital. That's for sure over the last two years. And you take comfort as well. We increased the dividend. We had $2 billion of capital returned last quarter. So our intentions are clear to return capital where we can, but also to be prudent in how we do so, given environment and current regulatory uncertainty. Thanks, Mike. I'll kick it off and then send it back to Mark. In terms of the expense side, I think we've been very transparent about the arc of our investment spend related to both the transformation and beyond. We'll continue to give you that transparency Mike. Now last year, we hit our expense guidance. This year, we're on track for the guidance of roughly the $54 billion ex FDIC and divestitures and looking forward, we continue to guide what are the three levers that will drive the reduction in the expense curve starting at the end of 2024. It's from the exits and I think you've got a clear sense around the progress that we have been making on the divestitures. And therefore, we're pivoting, as we talked about, to focus now on really tackling the stranded expenses as we close off the final couple of sales there in Asia in the next few months. We'll realize the benefits [indiscernible] investments in transformation and controls over the medium term. We'll also have the benefit of the remediation work getting done and expenses going away from that. And then the third one will be simplifying the organization, as we talked about. So we'll continue to walk you step-by-step. What are the different actions we're taking, what are we doing? And hopefully, we are building up that track record of doing what we will say we are going to do every quarter. Mark, anything to add? And then on TTS, I think we all share your enthusiasm for this business in terms of the growth potential that we've been realizing and expect to continue, albeit converging now to the medium-term guidance over the next few quarters where we see it's a high to medium single-digit growth going forward. It's a very high-returning business and some of the indicators of how we're monetizing those relationships. We're seeing it both in terms of new client wins, they were up 41% this quarter. We have a sustained win loss ratio of 80% on the new deals across different client segments. We're also seeing growth that's starting to really kick in from our commercial bank and the expansion of clients in the middle market around the world as we grow out that franchise. And we've got some very good fee growth, which as Mark points out, and I point out all the time, we're very focused around the cross-border, up 11% US dollar clearing up 6%, commercial cards up 15%, et cetera. And we continue to invest in the business as well, so to make sure that, that 80% win ratio continues. So first bank to launch 24/7 $365 clearing -- US dollar clearing. We've got the instant payments platform we just launched for e-commerce clients. We have payments express that is now live in the US, on track for five markets by the year-end. So it's a story of innovation. It's a story of investment. It's got great returns. It's a good growth story. And it just -- it keeps ongoing. And I don't want to diminish security services in there either. It's another business that's similarly continuing to see significant client wins up 65% versus last year as well. And a lot of our strategy there has been focused on gaining share with the asset managers in North America. Couple of years ago, we're down at 2.6% share. We're up about 4.3%. Our target is about 5.5% there in 2025 in that key growth area. I know there's a lot to like here too. And it's a laser micro focus from us to make sure that we have the plans in place and the execution to be able to achieve it. This is something that's -- we're extremely hands-on around and making sure that, that is going to get done on each of the different drivers that Mark talked about. Go ahead. I'll kick it off, Mark, and then pass it to you. So when we look -- we're confident we're going to meet 11% to 12% ROTC target over the medium term. The core drivers of how we get there remains unchanged. One, it's the revenues that we expect to grow by 4% to 5% CAGR as we continue to execute on the strategy. On expenses, it's the clear path to bend the curve by the end 2024, bringing those expenses down over the medium term. And third and importantly, it's continuing to optimize our balance sheet including improving RWA and capital efficiency. And as we referenced earlier in the prepared remarks, different drivers in that, that are helpful exiting 14 international consumer markets, changing our business mix. And I'd also note that the transformation has benefits not only for our efficiency, but it will also support RWA and capital optimization. That said, there's uncertainty around the future capital requirements in the industry and importantly, the timing of their implementation. We like everyone again to have to work through those implications once we know what they are. But as we said, keep in mind, we've got some other levers to pull over time, capital allocation, DTA allocation and utilization, our G-SIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points. So that's where you hear the confidence for us -- from us around the path to executing and that remaining consistent. But Mark, why don't I hand over to you just around consumer market sales and operational RWA relief. And I feel [indiscernible] to jump in here as well because as the spring and the recent test results showed the large US banks are not only in a strong capital position, but we've been able to play an important stabilizing role for the system as a whole. It's a role that we take very seriously. And we certainly hope that as the details of the capital frameworks get unveiled, this is fully taken into consideration, including the impact on US competitiveness. And we need a level playing field with Europe, not a gold-plated one. And we share the concern that higher capital levels will undoubtedly increase the cost of capital for medium and smaller sized enterprises and consumers in particular, and will drive more activity to non-regulated and lesser capitalized players that isn't in the system's interest. And we hope that, that's fully taken into consideration here because we will take actions on businesses, and we will take pricing actions as well the entire industry. And as Mark said, I think we feel good about our positioning as a prime, but also a strong credit proposition that we have. We're seeing stronger demand for the credit-led products such as value cards, bulk on installment loans, as well as the service-led engagement for the more prime customers. And so, that's also going to be a valuable factor driving growth and profitability as well. Yes, I think well, also the normalized state back in 2019 is also pretty good. So you're not hearing any alarm bells ringing from Mark or myself at all here on the US consumer. I think we see the US consumer as resilient. We've talked about them being cautious but they're not recessionary. And we are seeing more pressure on the lower FICOs. We don't have a large number of that in our portfolio, but that is where we're seeing more of the normalization happening on the payment rates, for example, on other behaviors in there. So it's quite localized, but I don't think we should be overly concerned here about the health of the US consumer. And as Mark said, we're in a very unusual environment, higher inflation, these rate levels and a strong labor market. And under those conditions, it's the debt service ratio, as he said, that is, we think, is a more useful leading indicator that we keep a close eye on. Yes. Hi. Look, I'll jump in here. Corporates are pretty cautious. They've got another Fed hike in the offing, tensions, China and the West, OPEC and all general sense of more limited growth. But I think clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while. I think they now seem to accept the current environment is the new normal and are beginning to position themselves globally. So globally, we're seeing less anxiety around funding as most large corps are biting the bullet and paying higher rates to take advantage of [indiscernible] balance sheet is getting reinforced. We certainly don't see a large cap credit prices on the horizon. And on the IB side, it remains -- the pipeline is robust. There's a lot of pent-up demand for M&A, but it's hard to predict when that pipeline will unlock. ECM had tangible momentum over Q1, and we're also seeing sponsor fringing signs of improvement, but both of those are from a very, very low base. And on the investor side, most of the investors stayed on the sidelines in Q2. The debt ceiling was a bigger topic than economic news was, and then it was a very low volume environment. We saw a bit of a pickup at the beginning of -- with the light bump in volatility in the last few days, but I wouldn't call that a trend yet. Hi, Vivek. I think we're going to see exactly what the framework is that comes out and then the implementation time frame for it and then look at making adjustments to plan, also hoping that the comment period is taken seriously and the different considerations I talked about earlier are taken into effect. Then we'll work through water adjustments we make, pricing capital reallocation, et cetera, the playbook that you would expect the same one that we've done with [indiscernible] and we've done with a number of other pieces. And we would also hope to see our SCB in a different place for the same reasons we talked about earlier Vivek because there's a lot of volatility in that SCB dependent on the scenario that comes out every year. And I would say, given the shifts we're making in the business model, we'd expect to see that one come down."

I'm going to start with the firm wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I indicate otherwise and spend a little more time on expenses and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the second quarter we reported net income of approximately $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33 and an ROTCE of 6.4% on $19.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are after tax divestiture related impacts of approximately $92 million. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.37 with an ROTCE of 6.6%. In the quarter, total revenues decreased by 1%, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture related impacts as strength across services, US Personal Banking and revenue from the investment portfolio was more than offset by declines in markets, investment banking and wealth, as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind downs. Our results include expenses of $13.6 billion, up 9%, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture related costs. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in cards net credit losses and ACL builds, largely related to growth in card balances. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 27%, primarily driven by the geographic mix of our pretax earnings in the quarter. Excluding current quarter divestiture related impacts our effective tax rate was 26%. At the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7% and through the first half of 2023 we reported an ROTCE of 8.7%. On Slide 5, we show the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year expense variance for the second quarter. Expenses were up 9%, driven by a number of factors, including investment in risk and controls, business-led and enterprise-led investments, volume growth and macro factors, including inflation, as well as severance. And all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exits and wind downs. Severance in the quarter was approximately $200 million and $450 million year-to-date, as we took further actions across investment banking, markets and the functions. We're investing in the execution of our transformation and continue to see a shift in our investments from third-party consulting to technology and full-time employees. And as we said last quarter, our transformation and technology investments span across the following themes: platform and process simplification; security and infrastructure modernization; client experience enhancements; and data improvements. And across these themes, technology spend was $3 billion in the quarter, up 13%, primarily driven by change the bank spend. Despite the higher expense base sequentially, we remain in line with our full-year guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding divestiture related impacts and the FDIC special assessment. On Slide 6, we show net interest income, deposits and loans where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $550 million, largely driven by dividends. The increase in net interest income ex markets was largely driven by higher rates and cards growth, partially offset by the mix shift that we've seen to higher rate deposit products within PBWM. Average loans were flat as growth in PBWM was offset by the wind-down markets and a decline in ICG as we continue to optimize the loan portfolio, including a further reduction in subscription credit facilities. Average deposits were down 2%, largely driven by TTS, as we saw some non-operational outflow, as expected in light of quantitative tightening. However, underlying this we did see strong growth in operating accounts as we continue to win new clients and deepen with existing ones, and our net interest margin increased 7 basis points. On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves to funded loans ratio is approximately 2.7%, and within that US cards is 7.9%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in US cards, and of that exposure 80% is to customers with FICOs of 680 or higher. And NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in wealth, predominantly in mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remained low at about 44 basis points of total loans. As you can see on the page, we breakout our commercial real-estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totaled $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So, while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in-part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high quality diversified assets. Our balance sheet reflects our strategy and well diversified business model, we leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors and individuals with global needs. The majority of our deposits, $818 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries. These institutional deposits are complemented by $427 billion of US retail consumer and global wealth deposits as you can see on the bottom-right side of the page. We have approximately $584 billion of HQLA and approximately $661 billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of just under $1 trillion. Our LCR was relatively stable at 119%. And our net stable funding ratio was greater than 100%. We ended the quarter with the 13.3% CET1 ratio and our tangible book value per share was $85.34, up 6% from a year ago . On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more details on the drivers this quarter. Starting from the end of the first-quarter. First, we generated $2.6 billion of net income to common, which added 22 basis-points. Second, we returned $2 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 18 basis-points. And finally, the remaining 14 basis-point decrease was primarily driven by RWA growth as we continue to grow card balances partially offset by optimizing RWA in markets and corporate lending. We ended the quarter with the 13.3% CET1 capital ratio, which includes a 100 basis point internal management buffer. We expect our regulatory capital requirement to be 12.3% in October of 2023, which incorporates the increase in our stress capital buffer from 4% to the preliminary SCB of 4.3% we announced a couple of weeks ago. And we will continue our dialog with the Fed to better understand the differences between modeled results and ours, specifically in non-interest revenue. That said, our strategy is designed to further diversify our business mix to have a more consistent, predictable, and repeatable revenue stream as well as reduce risk and simplify our firm by exiting 14 international consumer markets. The strategy and the simplification, coupled with the benefits of our transformation investments will allow us to improve RWA and capital over time. The continued optimization of our balance sheet should not only help FCB but reduce RWA. This will offset some of the anticipated headwinds and capital requirements and RWA. And we will continue to reassess how and where we deploy capital and we will continue to reassess the appropriate level of our management buffer overtime. On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the second quarter. Revenues were down 9% this quarter, as growth in services was more than offset by markets and banking. Expenses increased 13%, primarily driven by continued investment in TTS and Risk and Controls, as well as approximately $120 million of severance in investment banking and markets, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $58 million as net credit losses were partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 45%, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher expenses. ICG delivered an ROTCE of 9.2% for the quarter and 11.4% through the first half of 2023. Average loans were down 6%, reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up 1% as we continue to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were up 15%, driven by 18% growth in net interest income and 8% in noninterest revenue. It's also worth noting that TTS revenues were up 20% on an XFX basis. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with US dollar clearing volumes up 6%, both in the quarter and through the first half, cross-border flows up 11%, outpacing global GDP growth, again, both in the quarter and through the first half and commercial card volume up roughly 15% led by spend in travel. In fact, similar to the last few quarters client wins are up approximately 41% across all client segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. In Security Services, revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher net interest income across currency. We are pleased with the progress in security services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration which are up approximately 11% or $2.4 trillion, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals in security services. As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy in our two of our higher returning businesses with strong synergies across the firm. Markets revenues were down 13%, driven by both fixed income and equities relative to an exceptional quarter last year coupled with low volatility this quarter. Fixed income revenues were down 13% as strength in our rates franchise was more than offset by a decline in currencies and commodities. Equities revenues were down 10%, primarily reflecting a decline in equity derivatives. But consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow prime balances driven by client wins. Corporate client flows remain strong and stable, and we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA part. And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down 22%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty continue to impact client activity, as well as lower revenues in corporate lending. While we continue to have a strong pipeline and are seeing green shoots of activity, we recognize there's more work to do in ECM and M&A. That said, we believe the investments that we've made in health care and technology coverage will benefit us over time. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging and there is more work to be done, we're making progress against our strategy in ICG. Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6%, driven by net interest income growth of 7%, partially offset by a 6% decline in noninterest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in wealth. Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by risk and control investments. Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately $335 million, primarily driven by card balance growth. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting our wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 5.5%, both for this quarter and through the first half of 2023, largely reflecting the challenging environment for wealth and higher credit costs. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 8%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 6%, card spend volumes up 4% and average loans up 14%. Retail services revenues were up 27%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments. For both card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline and that combined with the investments that we've been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 17% in branded cards and 12% in Retail Services. Retail banking revenues decreased 9%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. In fact, consistent with our strategy, we continue to leverage our retail network to drive 25,000 wealth referrals year-to-date through May, up 18% year-over-year. Wealth revenues were down 5%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs, particularly in the private bank. However, Wealth at Work revenues were up over 30%, driven by strong lending results primarily in mortgages. Client advisers were down 1%, reflecting the repacing of strategic hiring. And new client acquisitions were up nearly 40% in the Private Bank and approximately 60% in Wealth at Work in the second quarter. While there's clearly more work to do in wealth, we are seeing good momentum in the underlying drivers. On Slide 14, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues were down 1% as the benefit of higher rates and volumes in Mexico was more than offset by the reductions from closed consumer exit and wind downs. It's worth noting that Mexico's revenues were up 22% and 10% ex-FX. Expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by closed consumer exits and wind downs. Excluding divestiture related impacts, expenses decreased 8%. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate Other for the second quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses also increased driven by inflation and severance. On Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our third quarter and full year 2023 outlook. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture related impacts, although the mix has shifted somewhat. We are increasing our net interest income guidance from $45 billion to slightly above $46 billion for the full year, excluding markets, offset by lower noninterest revenue, largely driven by investment banking and wealth. We're also maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessments. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize in the remainder of the year with both portfolios reaching normalized levels by year-end. And we now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture related impacts. As it relates to the third quarter, we expect continued momentum with clients, including fees and benefits from US and non-US rates on NII. We also anticipate a sequential increase in expenses, driven by continued investments in transformation and risk and controls. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize in line with expectations. And our effective tax rate for the quarter should be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture-related impacts. And as it relates to buybacks, we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few points. We continue to execute on the strategy to simplify our firm, improve our revenue mix and bring both expenses and capital down over time. We're seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our business. And as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we remain focused on achieving our medium term ROTCE target. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Thanks, Glenn, and good morning. Thanks for the question. Look, a couple of points on that. One is, we've been very focused on the revenue to RWA metric in our markets business in the ICG more broadly as well. And we've made considerable progress on that. And that's important because how we use the balance sheet and ensuring that we're optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we improve returns over time. You're right to point out the subscription facility, credit facility lending that we do. We brought that down pretty significantly. The numbers you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio. But what's important here is that, as we look at that, we look at a couple of things. So one, the nature of the relationship and whether clients are taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to offer; two, the profitability and returns associated with the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship, and where that -- those returns are low, subpar and the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless, we take it down. And that's what we've done with a large part of that book just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities to use balance sheet where clients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore are generating higher returns. And we're going to continue to do that. We've done that to drive the revenue to RWA metric. We've done it selectively on pieces of the portfolio like SCF. We've also looked at our broader corporate lending portfolio and where those promises for higher relationship returns aren't manifesting themselves. We've not renewed those loans. And as we think about pending regulatory changes proactively making these efforts becomes critically important. When I look back on the activity that we've done over the past couple of years, we've reduced RWA by approximately $120 billion over the last two years. And about 75% of that is predominantly driven by balance sheet optimization and looking at client activity that has low margin business. And so, this is important for us to do what we keep doing. Thanks, Glenn. We did take guidance up to above -- slightly above $46 billion from the $45 billion. I guess there are a couple of things in FX markets, of course. There are a couple of things to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that play through there. One is, you've heard me mention before that we've reached terminal betas in the US; two, deposit volumes and the ship mix as we see consumers kind of move into [Technical Difficulty] products; and three, really the wind downs and the exits and the reduction that they will [Technical Difficulty] kind of three headwinds as we think about the forecast and the balance of the year. There are obviously some potential tailwinds that play to the other side, including rate movements from in non-US dollar, as well as card volume growth. And as we look at those headwinds and tailwinds, our current read is to take it up, but $46 billion or slightly above that feels like the right level in the context of total revenues at $78 million to $79 billion. Thank you. Let me take that. I'd say a couple of things. So one, I'd reiterate the expense guidance that we've given for the full year. So that's the roughly $54 billion ex divestitures or the impact of divestitures, ex any impact from FDIC special assessment. Two, as we think about bending the curve, I look into 2024 and we're looking to bring the absolute expense dollars down from Q3 to Q4. So that bending of the curve will occur. It will occur despite having Mexico still part of the franchise. And we obviously still having Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but it will bend Q3 to Q4. And then beyond that and through the medium term, we will see the curve continue to bend. Again, Mexico impacts the magnitude of the band, but we're very, very focused on bringing our costs down and bending that curve. And you've heard us reference the aspects or the elements of our business that help contribute to that, not the least of which are the exits, one of which is Mexico, and you referenced the timing there, but also the benefits from the investments that we've been making in transformation and risk and controls and shifting from manual processes to technology enabled ones. And then the final one is around simplifying our organization. And you heard in Jane's prepared remarks, as we continue to make progress on these exits it opens up the opportunity for us to lean more heavily into that simplification. So we are focused on not only the guidance, but the bending of the curve as you point out, and looking forward to delivering that and taking actions to ensure we do. Again, it's going to be a combination of continuing to bend the curve and bring our expenses down. Obviously, we've given you guidance on operating efficiency of less than 60%, which will be some of that top line growth, but it's the combination of the two. Good morning. Yes. So you're right, we hit 13.3% this quarter, down a tad bit from the 13.4% last quarter. Effective October 1, the 4.3% SCB comes into play. And so, that would equate to assuming the 100 basis point management buffer at 12.3% regulatory requirement and a 13.3% kind of target that we would manage to. I'd highlight a couple of things that I'm sure are obvious to you, Betsy. One is, this is the stress capital buffer for the 12 month period starting October 1. And two is, the strategy that we've described and talked about and have started to execute against is intentionally designed to help morph the business towards a more steady, predictable, consistent stream of revenues, fee revenue growth, as well as bring our expenses down over time, and exit these markets, and those things should contribute to reducing our stress capital buffer over time and improving our returns. But the answer to your question very directly is, yes, the 13.3% would reflect where we'd be targeting as of October 1 for now. The only thing I'll add on the expense side, and then you may want to touch on the TTS. But the only add on the expense side is the -- we are taking repositioning charges, Mike. I mean, we're not sitting still as we go through this uncertain period of time where wallets across certain parts of the industry are under significant pressure. And in taking those repositioning charges, there are going to be expense reductions that ultimately play out over the next 12-month period. So that's the other factor in addition to what Jane mentioned in the way of exits and benefits from the transformation that will play into the cost base over the next 12 months. Yes, sure. Look, no need to apologize for asking the question again. It's an important -- it's an important topic. I'd say a couple of things. So one is that, we can certainly look back in time, but I would highlight that we're here because we needed to have invested more in our franchise. And so undoubtedly there's going to be an increase in our expense base that reflects the underinvestment from the past and ensuring up safety and soundness and actually moving towards a more automated operational -- more modernized operations and infrastructure. So there's certainly going to be that. With that said, with those investments come efficiencies. So with the move from manual to automation over time, those types of investments will yield benefits in our cost structure. And that's part of what is going to bend the curve over that medium-term period. The other thing that I'd highlight is, obviously, with the legacy franchises, there's $7 billion of expense associated with those, and that will come down. But that -- but because of the Mexico transaction, we're going to be stuck with that a little bit longer given the IPO process. It doesn't put a big dent in our ability to bring stranded cost down and by the way, it does come with top line revenues and historically has been accretive to our profitability and returns. And so I highlight -- I'm not going to give you kind of new guidance on where our expenses will end up. But what I will point you to is not only the $54 billion this year, roughly $54 billion this year, not only the bending of the curve in the third and fourth quarter or the third to the fourth quarter next year. But we've given guidance on top line growth revenue of 5%, call it, CAGR through that medium-term period, and we've given you kind of operating efficiency targets that we've said as well, and we intend to deliver on those things that reflect the bending of that curve through all of those drivers that we've mentioned. So I hope that helps, Erika. I appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses. We are equally focused on it and know just how important it is to achieving those targets. We're not only kind of doing the things that we've highlighted in that strategy articulation, but we're also being responsive to the current environment that we're in. We think that aids in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve, and we know there's an additional opportunity that Jane has referenced to the simplification of the organization as we make -- what I would argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year. And all of those things will be important to ensuring we get to that lower cost base, which we will do. Sorry, your question was around expenses or the revenue? Yes. Got it. Jane, do you want to start or? Yes. So I'd say a couple of things. So one, Erika, is obviously, with that revenue CAGR will be volume-related expenses that play out. But we're also focused, obviously, on the non-volume related expenses and not giving you a precise number because the magnitude of that band, right, is a factor, right? So obviously, Mexico, for example, as I mentioned earlier, impacts the magnitude of the bend, right? And we're going to and have, in fact, when you look at our expense base even for the quarter, we've spent money in Mexico to drive that top line 22% revenue growth, 10% ex-FX. And so, there are going to be nuances in the running of the business in a way that ensures we're maximizing shareholder value that impacts the magnitude of the bending of that expense curve. Investments that I got to continue to make in TTS in order to maintain that number one position in that competitive advantage that we have. And so, those things will impact that magnitude of the bend. We've been, I think, very transparent as we get into each year, giving you concrete numbers. What I'm telling you is the curve will bend. And as we get closer to 2024, we'll give you more direction on the magnitude for that year and beyond. Sure. And again, I think that if you look at the transactions that we've closed to date, they've generated or freed up about $4.6 billion of capital the two that remain to be closed and the balance of the year will generate another $1.2 billion or so. That will be important to our capital base. I think that we obviously have to see the proposal as it comes out and the NPR. And we have to -- we'll have a window to respond to that. We're hopeful that the regulators hear our response and views on it as it comes out. There's clear -- there's clearly going to be a reference to increases in RWA and operational risk implications potentially as part of that. I do think that exiting without having seen the proposal, and without obviously knowing how those rules might evolve. I do believe that the exiting of these 14 markets does play towards not only reducing our SCB in stress scenarios or as it comes out of stress analysis and tests, but also should play through helping to reduce risk-weighted assets and potentially operational risk as well. But we have to see what the proposal looks like and go through that. And I think what's important here is that, whenever it comes out, whatever it looks like, as we dissect it and go through it, we'll figure out how to manage through it, right, whether that be through exiting certain products, seeking price adjustments as it relates to customers, clients and the markets or continuing to optimize RWAs as we have been doing very proactively, we'll figure out how to manage. Yes. Look, I think as we mentioned, wealth was down about 5%. It's really hard to talk about the rebound in wealth in the midst of such an uncertain environment and the one that we're in. It's hard to disconnect those macro factors like rates, inflation, the prospect of a recession from what we're seeing in wealth. And I think there are two dynamics that have played out. One has been the shift from our customers -- from customers more broadly into higher-yielding products from out of deposits. And the other has been the fee revenue from an investment management fee point of view, and as you might think about it, it is a higher rate environment. There are opportunities for clients to earn more. And not until there's greater certainty in the broader macro factors, well, I think we start to see some real momentum tick up there. Now with that said, a couple of things worth reiterating, which is, we're seeing very strong referral momentum from the retail banking business up through the wealth continuum, if you will. So we've had about 25,000 referrals May year-to-date from our retail branches into our broader wealth business, that's a good thing. We've seen the number of clients that we've on-boarded tick up pretty meaningfully, both in the private bank and more broadly across wealth. That's a good thing. Those are things that position us well for when greater certainty does play out and these clients start to put monies back to work in the broader investment platform and offering that we have. Sorry, just the last part of your question, I'm sorry, if we do see what? Got it. Thank you. Look, our current reserves, as you know, as we think about CESL, we've got three different scenarios. We've got a base case in upside, a downside. Our current reserves are based on the mix of those three macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects about a 5.1% unemployment rate on a weighted basis over the eight quarters, and it's roughly flat to what it was last quarter. What that means is, obviously, our downside scenario has unemployment that's much higher than that, closer to 7% or call it 6.8% or so. But that's kind of how we've thought about unemployment. As we think about the reserves each quarter, obviously, we take a look at the macroeconomic factors and how they're evolving. Our base case today assumes a mild recession and reserves in the future will consider how are weighting towards downside, upside and baseline may more subject to our outlook and volumes. Those are the two factors that influence whether we're increasing reserves or not. I would point out though that in addition to unemployment and because unemployment has been as stubborn as it has been, if you will, we also look at debt service coverage ratio as an important factor as we think about our consumers, as we think about their balance sheet, as we think about the risk that they may or may not be facing. So unemployment is an important factor. But we've flexed our thinking in light of the environment and in light of how behaviors have been shifting, and that's an important factor in how we think about our reserves as well. I feel very good about the level of our reserves. You heard us mention earlier, we've got $20 billion of reserves, we're well reserved across the portfolio, but those are all important elements to it. Yes. Again, the thing I'd point out and Jane, feel free to chime in here, is that what we talked about was getting to our medium-term returns, 11% to 12% and the medium term is 25% to 26%, right? So it's not just 25%, just to be clear. And we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that. You heard us mention the levers that we think will contribute to that. Obviously, capital is important and how that evolves and we continue to kind of work to optimize the balance sheet while serving our clients effectively and importantly, growing the strong businesses that we have that are high returning as well. Yes. Thanks for the question. The answer is, yes. We still expect for both portfolios to hit those normal levels sometime at the end of the year, the normal level, as you pointed out, on the page for both branded as well as for retail services. We would expect, again, subject to how and when this mild recession kind of plays out, we would expect that they would tick higher than that before getting back inside of that range. But again, all of this is tied into how we've calculated our reserves, the delinquencies that we're seeing, the mix of the portfolio, which again skews towards your higher FICO scores and the customer behaviors that we're seeing, which play through not only that cost of credit line, but also plays through the growth that we referenced earlier in the top line. But the short answer is yes, that's still our thinking. Just remember, it's a return to normal. Yes. I think I'd point to a couple of things. One is, remember, we focus on the large multinational largely investment grade quality names. And so, that's one important factor when you think about our ICG and corporate exposure there. The second thing I'd point out is, we have to remember that many of these companies had and still have very strong balance sheets and that they've managed that through the COVID and pandemic situation and that has positioned them well. I think the third thing is that and you've heard us mention how we're proactively managing the prospect of a recession. And I think when I talk to other CFOs, I know that when Jane talks to other CEOs, they too are looking at their expense line. They too are looking at the efficiency of their organizations and opportunity to increase that efficiency in light of a potential slowdown or recessionary environment. And then the final point is, I think a lot of firms have been that were proactive in the low rate environment, ensuring up that balance sheet strength. Now with that said, you've heard us also mention the prospect of a rebound in capital market activities, and that has to happen at some point. But sticking to your point around credit, I really think it's those factors that you see play through in not only our very low NAL, but also our very low credit losses, credit cost that you've seen in our business. Look, we're constantly actively managing the balance sheet in light of not only our client needs, but also how we see the broader macro environment evolving and changing. And as you know, and I know you've seen and we've talked about before, we share in our Qs, our view on our estimate for interest rate exposure and what happens with 100 basis points swing in rates in one direction or another across the curve across currencies. You've seen that shift over the last number of quarters to the last quarter where that estimate for IRE was about $1.7 billion or so, but heavily skewed towards non-US dollar rates and currencies. And I think as we think about the view on how rates will evolve, you'll see a continued shift there. I think that when we look to print this quarter, that number will probably come down a bit in terms of interest rate exposure and skew even more towards non-US dollar currencies in light of where rates are in those markets and the US dollar will likely be somewhat neutral in light of that curve currently looks like. But again, something we actively manage, first with an eye towards what client demand and needs are likely to be for use of our liquidity but also with a view for how the macro environment might evolve and what we're hearing from central banks around the world. Well, Mike, I love you, but I'm not going to play that game. What I will say is that, we clearly have work that we're doing as it relates to the exits, but we're making very good progress on that, not just on the closing of the exits but also on putting a dent in the stranded costs associated with those exits that we have closed. And so, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, by the time we get to the end of the year, ex Mexico, we would have made a considerable amount of progress on there, and that creates an opportunity to do more around the simplification of the organization. And so that simplification is obviously in an earlier inning, call it, the exits in a later inning. I think that the transformation spend investments and those things. Look, we are squarely into execution, as you've heard us mention before. And as I've mentioned, the expense base around that is going to continue to morph from spend that we've made around third-party consultants and that helped in the crafting of the plan towards technology, towards people that are critically involved in the execution of it and then a downward trajectory towards the benefits we get from that technology and reduced operational expense. And so it's a multiyear journey. We've talked about that. We've got a number of years to continue to execute against it. But what's important is we know what we have to do, both in how we're investing that money and as it relates to being disciplined about our cost structure and bending the curve. And again, that's what we're going to do. Yes. I mean, again, we've got -- I think the number I shared was somewhere around 13,000 people or so that are broadly working on the efforts here. We haven't gotten into specific costs. You know it's in the total number. But what I would say again is that, we're clear on what we've got to deliver and execute against and we're managing that cost very tightly. We're constantly looking at opportunities to deliver on those transformation deliverables, more efficiently, leveraging more technology, leveraging AI in some instances. And so, we're not just taking those execution plans as they were crafted and delivering against them. But we're looking for efficiencies and even the execution plans as they're constructed today. And that's important for us to keep doing. Thanks for the question, and thanks for the acknowledgment that we do manage our markets revenues in total. So I appreciate that. What I would say in terms of the markets NII is, you've captured it right, which is, the dynamic that's playing out between first quarter and second quarter is in fact a dividend season. And again, given the globality of our franchise, the dividend is not just a dividend in any one region, but dividend in multiple regions playing out over the course of the first and second quarter. I can't speak to the peers at this particular stage. But what I would say is that, you know that our book SKUs more so than peers to corporates, and that's important. And we obviously have a very, very strong FIC business more broadly as well. So dividend season, major driver here in that increase. Charles, I really appreciate the attempt there. But I'm not going to give any further guidance on the breakout of the NII. I will reiterate the ex-markets NII increase, by the way, to plus 46% but thanks for the question. I appreciate that. The only thing I'd add is the -- again, the CET1 ratio of the 13.3% as of October 1 would be a 12.3% required level and 100 basis points of the management buffer. So that would be what we'd be held to as of October 1. As Jane mentioned, the NPR as it comes out, we'll take a look at that and see if there are implications on the CET1 stack, but more likely implications on the risk-weighted assets, right? And what's really important there aside from the very important points Jane made in terms of considering broader factors is the timing of the implementation of whatever that final rule includes and obviously, the more timing for implementation, the more of an ability it gets for the industry to think about how to absorb the implications there. You know what, I'm really interested at this point in seeing the proposal, and then we'll have a chance to kind of to really react as an industry and as a firm. Well, again, I think the point I'd make here is that, we continue to see clients shift from kind of noninterest-bearing deposits and into both interest-bearing and CDs and other higher-yielding products in light of the rate environment that we're in. And I would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts subject to how rates continue to evolve. And again, on the corporate side, we've seen in the US clients have reached kind of those terminal -- that terminal level, terminal betas, I should say, outside of the US rate hikes, I think, are still in the future, as Jane alluded to, and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached. But in terms of the noninterest bearing, we are seeing that dynamic play out."

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJen Landis: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Jen, and hello to everyone joining us today. Well, 2023 is shaping up to be another interesting year. Given the tumultuous events of the last few weeks, I am going to share some observations and then we will turn to what was a good quarter. First, our banking system as a whole is very strong. While a small handful of institutions still have challenges to overcome, the U.S. financial system remains unmatched globally. And I feel confident saying that as someone who has worked in many different systems around the world. The U.S. system comprises a healthy mix of community banks, regional banks and larger global banks, including Citi. We all have important but different roles to play, serving different clients with different needs and on different scale. I would also point to the rapid response by state, federal and international regulators that help reinforce confidence in the system at a very critical juncture. I am pleased that Citi has been a source of stability for the financial system and a source of strength for our clients. That\u2019s not an accident. We are in a position to play this role, because our strategy is delivering a simpler, more focused bank. We benefit from a diversified earnings base and resilient business model. This is reinforced by our robust balance sheet management, liquidity position and strong risk management frameworks. We are disciplined in how we run the firm from client selection to capital planning. And it\u2019s also thanks to our people. And I want to express my pride in our colleagues around the world who worked tirelessly last month to serve clients as they turn to Citi as a port in the storm. Recent events have shown that prudent asset and liability management is absolutely paramount. While Mark is going to walk you through our approach and our focus on interest rate risk, liquidity and capital, I do want to mention a few things myself. In terms of assets, our loans are high quality and short duration. We have highly liquid investment securities and a significant amount of cash. We have over $1 trillion worth of available liquidity resources, including $584 billion of HQLA and an LCR of 120%. And we maintain a diverse set of funding sources, including over $1.3 trillion of deposits across corporates, consumers, industries and regions, many of which are operational in nature. Indeed, the cornerstone is our institutional deposit base, which comprises about 60% of our deposits. Most of these deposits are particularly sticky because they sit in operating accounts that are fully integrated into how our multinational clients run their businesses around the world from their payrolls, their supply chains, their cash and liquidity management. 80% of these deposits are with clients who use all three of our integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. The data that we aggregate from these deposits and their related flows is fundamental to how our clients manage their efficiency, risk and compliance. And this greatly increases our deposit stickiness. It\u2019s also why nearly 80% of these deposits are from client relationships that are 15 years old or more. Finally, we operate a strong risk framework that looks at both assets and liability concentrations across client segments, industry and region. And we are confident in the size and nature of our exposures, given our very rigorous stress testing. We also diligently manage counterparty risk, which is critical given the interconnectedness of financial institutions. We are in a strong position to navigate whatever environment we face, which is particularly relevant given the degree of uncertainty today. The Fed continues to use rate policy to battle inflation, which has been more than stubborn in services even as we see signs of cooling in labor and manufacturing. We expect the recent event to be disinflationary and credit to contract. We believe it\u2019s now more likely that the U.S. will enter into a shallow recession later this year. That could be exacerbated in depth and duration in a more severe credit crunch. But right now, the biggest unknown is the impact on terminal short-term U.S. interest rates and of course, how the debt ceiling plays out. In Europe, the ECB is on a similar but more difficult quest to payment inflation. They have asked some help from lower-than-expected energy prices and the outlook continues to be a bit brighter. However, the war in Ukraine sadly shows no sign of ending, and Europe places more structural challenges, such as the need for increased defense spending, higher energy costs and fiscal burdens that will make efforts to dampen inflation and stimulate growth more difficult. In Asia, the reopening of China is adding to the momentum in the region, although the Chinese consumer has been slower to rebound than expected. I saw many green shoots firsthand talking to our clients and our bankers in my various trips to India, Japan and Hong Kong this year. We have to keep a close eye on geopolitics as the U.S.-China relationship becomes increasingly strained and is fragmenting economic blocks. And we see this translate into a shift in flows and heightened cross-border volume across TTS and our global network. Now turning to how we performed this quarter. We reported net income of $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19. We had good revenue growth of 6% ex divestitures, and both revenue and expenses were in line with our guidance. Our ROTCE of nearly 11% benefited from the closing of the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam and would have been over 9% without those gains. Let me highlight our operating performance in each of our 5 core businesses. In Services, TTS has continued to go from strength to strength with revenues up 31%. Non-interest revenue was up 11% quarter-on-quarter on the back of increased cross-border activity and good performance in commercial cards due to the rebound of corporate travel. Securities Services wasn\u2019t too shabby either, up 23% as we executed on new mandates, onboarded new AUC and benefited from higher rates. Within market, our fixed income revenues were up 4% from a year ago. We benefited from excellent performance in rates and continued engagement from our corporate clients. The first quarter of 2022 was no slouch, as you may recall, but this quarter was our third best in a decade. Equities was much weaker, however, down markedly in both derivatives and cash, although it still had revenues north of $1 billion. Banking was down again, but there were signs of the beginning of a pickup, including increased activity in the investment-grade market. In U.S. Personal Banking, our cards businesses gained momentum as all drivers continued to normalize to pre-COVID levels and beyond. Branded Cards and Retail Services saw revenues up 18% and 24%. Retail Banking saw some growth as we continue to see good momentum in mortgages and installment lending and also experienced a significant increase in digital deposits. We did see a notable softening in consumer spending growth over the course of the quarter. Travel and entertainment continued to grow in March, but essentials were flat, and almost all other spend categories were down. Savings rates are below historic averages. And while the upper quintile of household income, still have roughly $1 trillion in excess savings, the savings of the lower quintiles have been significantly drawn down. So we\u2019re keeping a diligent eye on the lower FICO bands as economic growth and services spend slow. Finally, while revenues were down again, we remain confident about the prospects of our Wealth business. Despite the challenging headwinds, growth in Citigold accounts, client acquisition and client advisers were all solid, and we expect these drivers to flow through to revenues later this year and beyond. We also saw the early signs of a long-awaited Asian recovery. We built credit reserves this quarter on the back of growth in revolving balances in cards and poorer macro outlook. NCLs continued to normalize in consumer while the health of our corporate base was evident in another quarter of very low NPLs. Finally, we continue to generate capital through our earnings. With our CET1 ratio now at 13.4%, we have room to absorb the temporary upfront impact should we sign a deal for Mexico. As you know, we continue to pursue a dual-pass year and we are committed to increasing the amount of capital we return to our shareholders over time. As you can see from Slide 3, in addition to good operating performance from our businesses and despite everything else going on in the industry, we got a lot done this quarter as we implement the strategy we shared with you at Investor Day. We closed the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam. Indonesia and Taiwan are next on the list to close later in the year. Our Asian consumer sales will then be complete, and we are intensifying our efforts to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our organizational structure. We made some significant leadership announcements. I\u2019m delighted that Andy Sieg will join City at my table as the new Head of Wealth Management. Andy is a widely respected leader in this space and comes to us after running an $18 billion business with $2.8 trillion in client balances. He is the latest and the most visible example of the excellent talent we have attracted over the last couple of years. With Karen Peetz retiring, we named Anand Selva as our Chief Operating Officer and asked him to take on running our enterprise-wide Transformation program, in addition to his current responsibilities. Anand has been at Citi for over 3 decades and has a strong track record of delivering results. In terms of our Transformation, we are completely focused on executing our plans to address the consent orders and improve our risk and control environment. Mark will walk you through specific examples of how we\u2019re modernizing our infrastructure, simplifying processes and improving data quality. Importantly, these efforts are improving the client experience and helping us deliver Citi\u2019s core capabilities to them. To wrap up, it\u2019s 1 year after our Investor Day, and I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve made and our relentless focus on delivering. Our strategy is clear. Our business model is resilient and diversified. Our balance sheet is strong. We\u2019re making good progress on execution. Amidst considerable turmoil, we are delivering on our guidance and our commitments. Our team is determined to continue delivering with excellence. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thanks, Jane and good morning everyone. I am going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; and spend a little more time on expenses, our balance sheet and capital; then I will turn to the results of each segment. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19 and an ROTCE of nearly 11% on $21.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $950 million, largely driven by the gain on sale of the India Consumer business. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.86, with an ROTCE of over 9%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and increased 6%, excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across Services, Fixed Income and U.S. Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Wealth as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exit and wind down. Our results include expenses of $13.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year. Excluding divestiture-related costs in the prior year, expenses increased 5%, largely driven by the transformation, other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reductions from the exit and wind downs. Cost of credit was approximately $2 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in car net credit losses and ACL and other provision build of approximately $700 million, largely related to a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in card revolving balance. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. Transformation investments drove 1% of the growth, largely in the data, finance and risk and control programs. And 4% of the increase is driven by structural, largely in the form of compensation and benefits, including the full year impact of the people we hired last year as well as those we hired in the first quarter. Embedded in the structural bucket are a few key items. First, other risk and control investments that are enterprise-wide and in the businesses, which make up about 2% of the total expense increase. Second, the impact of additional front and back-office hires. Third, inflation and severance costs. All of this was partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exits. And across the firm, technology-related expenses grew 12%. We recognize these investments have driven a significant increase in expenses, but they are crucial to modernize the firm, address the consent orders and position Citi for success in the years to come. Now turning to Slide 6, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes giving you some tangible examples of what we\u2019re investing in and the benefits we\u2019ll see over time. In many cases, these investments will simplify our processes and platforms. For example, we are retiring and consolidating 20 cash equities platforms to 1 single modern platform, eliminating costs over time. And we have consolidated 11 platforms to 1 global sanction-screening platform, reducing false alerts, improving the client experience and eliminating costs. We\u2019re also modernizing our infrastructure and the security of our data and information by enhancing cybersecurity through the use of AI and improving the security of our infrastructure and devices, leading to fewer operating losses. And we are leveraging industry-leading cloud-based solutions to modernize and streamline the connectivity between our front-office systems and the general ledger, eliminating manual processes and operating costs over time. We\u2019re driving the strategy by investing in the client experience, both in terms of our technology interface and innovative new products. We launched our cloud-based instant payments platform for e-commerce clients in TTS. We\u2019re also deploying CitiDirect Commercial Banking, our mobile and digital interface for commercial clients, so they too can open accounts and access all products and services across ICG in the same way our large corporate clients do. And finally, we\u2019re investing in data to create advanced decision-making, client-targeting and risk management capabilities, which has allowed us to enhance our returns through greater RWA efficiency. And we expect many of these investments to generate efficiencies that will allow us to self-fund future investments over time. On Slide 7, we show net interest income, deposits and loans, where I\u2019ll speak to sequential variant. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $80 million, largely driven by interest-earning balances in cards. Average loans were up slightly as growth in PBWM was largely offset by a decline in ICG. Average deposits were also up slightly, driven by growth in both PBWM and ICG, and our net interest margin increased 2 basis points. On Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We\u2019re well reserved for the current environment with nearly $20 billion of reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio, was approximately 2.7%. And within that U.S. cards is 8.1%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in U.S. cards. And of that exposure, nearly 80% is to customers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And NCL rates, while reflecting some typical seasonality this quarter, are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in wealth and predominantly mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiary. And corporate non-accrual loans remain low at about 40 basis points of total loans. As you can see on the page, we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totaled $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels, and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. On Slide 9, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We\u2019ve added a few additional metrics to the page to provide additional transparency into how we manage the balance sheet. We maintain a very strong $2.5 trillion balance sheet, which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high-quality diversified assets. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our strategy and well-diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors and individuals with global needs. First, the majority of our deposits, $819 billion are institutional and span 90 countries. And the majority of these institutional deposits tend to be interest rate sensitive. So when rates go up, we reprice the deposits accordingly, but that reprice takes into account the overall client relationship as well as the level of rates. But despite this interest rate sensitivity, these deposits tend to be stable as they are tied to the operational services that we provide. And these institutional deposits are complemented by $437 billion of U.S. retail consumer and global wealth deposits, as you can see on the bottom right side of the page. These deposits are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work as well as across regions and products, with 75% of U.S. Citigold clients and approximately 50% of ultra-high net worth clients having been with Citi for more than 10 years. Our wealth deposits tend to also be interest rate sensitive, but this usually results in our customers moving to higher-yielding deposits and investment products. Now turning to the asset side. At a high level, you can think of our deposits being largely deployed in 3 asset buckets: loans, investment securities and cash, which complement the interest rate sensitivity and liquidity value of our liability. And this deployment is also linked to our strategy. We use our resources to lend and transact with our clients in ways that deepen the relationship and drive returns for our shareholders while maintaining strong liquidity and capital. Our $652 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans, and the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.3 years as the majority of these loans are variable rate. About 35% of our balance sheet is in cash and investment securities, which contribute to our $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. And at the end of the quarter, we had an LCR of 120%, which means we have roughly $100 billion of HQLA in excess of the amount required by the rule to cover stressed outflows. And you can see the details of this on Page 27 in the appendix. But just as important as the quantum of liquidity is the composition and duration of that liquidity and our $513 billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, agency and other sovereign bonds and is split evenly between available for sale and held to maturity, where we\u2019ve maintained a short duration of less than 3 years, so we could benefit from higher interest rates. And we actively and prudently manage our assets and liabilities by considering a range of possible stress scenarios and how they might impact interest rate risks, liquidity and capital. So in summary, our assets and liabilities are aligned across interest rate sensitivity, liquidity value and duration and reflect a diversified business model and execution of our strategy. On Slide 10, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Walking from the end of the fourth quarter, first, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common, which added 38 basis points; second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points; third, impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 7 basis point increase; and finally, the remaining 4 basis point increase was largely driven by the RWA benefit from closing our consumer exits. We ended the quarter with a 13.4% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 40 basis points higher than last quarter, and this includes a 100 basis point internal management book. And as it relates to buybacks, we did not buy back any stock this quarter, and we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. On Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the first quarter. Revenues were up 1% this quarter, largely driven by Services and Fixed Income, mostly offset by Investment Banking and Equities. Expenses increased 4%, driven by transformation, other risk and control investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $72 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. This resulted in net income of approximately $3.3 billion, up 23% driven by the lower cost of credit and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. ICG delivered a 13.8% ROTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down 2%, reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up 3% as we continue to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. And sequentially, average deposits were up 1%. And on an end-of-period basis, ICG deposits were down 3% sequentially, driven by seasonality as our clients tend to make tax payments in the first quarter. On Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 31%, driven by 41% growth in net interest income and 13% in NIR with growth across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 6%, reflecting continued Swift share gains; cross-border flows up 10%, outpacing global GDP growth; and commercial card volumes up roughly 40%, led by spend in travel. So while the rate environment drove about 60% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the remaining 40% as we continue to deepen relationships with existing clients and win new clients. In fact, client wins are up approximately 50% across all segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client\u2019s primary operating bank. In Securities Services, revenues grew 23% as net interest income grew 94%, driven by higher interest rates across currency, partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. We are pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration from significant client wins, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher-returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. Markets revenues were down 4% as growth in fixed Income was more than offset by Equities. Fixed Income revenues were up 4% relative to a very strong quarter last year as strength in our rates franchise was partially offset by a decline in FX and commodities. Equities revenues were down 25%, also relative to a strong quarter last year, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in cash and equity derivatives. Corporate client flows remain strong and stable, and we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA target. And finally, Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 21%, driven by Investment Banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. Having said that, we do see revenue growth sequentially, largely driven by the investment-grade market opening up. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress that we\u2019re making in ICG. Now turning to Slide 13, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 9%, driven by net interest income growth of 10%, partially offset by a 1% decline in non-interest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in Wealth. Expenses were also up 9%, predominantly driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately $500 million, largely driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumption and growth in card revolving balance. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 3%, largely reflecting our wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, largely driven by higher credit costs. On Slide 14, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 18%, driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 17%; card spend volumes, up 9%; and average loans, up 15%. Retail services revenues were up 24%, also driven by higher net interest income. For both card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline. And that, combined with the investments that we\u2019ve been making, contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 18% in branded cards and 11% in Retail Services. Retail Banking revenues were up 3%, primarily driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in personal installment lending, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. In fact, consistent with the strategy, we continue to leverage our retail network to drive over 13,000 Wealth referrals in the first quarter. Wealth revenues were down 9%, driven by continued investment fee headwind and higher deposit costs, particularly in the Private Bank. However, we did see notable improvement in revenues in Asia, which were up approximately 20% on a sequential basis. Client Advisers were up 3%, and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our Wealth business with new clients in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work up 62% and 81%, respectively. While the environment continues to remain challenging for Wealth, we\u2019re seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy. On Slide 15, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues grew 48%, driven by a gain on sale of our Consumer business in India, partially offset by the wind downs and closed consumer exit. Expenses decreased 24%, largely driven by the absence of a goodwill impairment we had in the prior year as well as the impact of the wind-downs and closed consumer exits. On Slide 16, we show results for Corporate/Other for the first quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses increased, driven by transformation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees. Before we move to Q&A, I\u2019d like to end with a few key points. Despite recent events and the economic uncertainty that remains, our full year outlook for revenue and expenses remains unchanged. We have a very strong balance sheet with a diversified set of assets and funding sources and ample capital and liquidity. This positions us well to serve clients and navigate any number of scenarios. We\u2019re seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses and continue to execute on our strategy. The financial path will not be linear, but we are confident that we can achieve our medium-term targets. And finally, I\u2019m incredibly proud of how our firm and our employees have continued to help our clients navigate the recent environment and support the health of the overall banking system. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thank you. Simple one. I appreciate the many, many moving parts, but your first quarter NII and revenue production was great. And if you just annualize it, you\u2019re handily ahead of your full year guide. So I\u2019m just curious on how you\u2019re thinking about maintaining the guide but running ahead of schedule.\nMark Mason: Yes. Thanks, Glenn. Good morning. I appreciate the question. Look, we did have a very solid first quarter. But as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, there are a number of things that are still out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear, including, frankly, as we contemplate the direction of rates and what\u2019s required to tame inflation, let alone the uncertainty that we\u2019ve seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter. And so when I think about that and I think about, frankly, how betas have evolved and the likelihood of a recession in the back half of the year, which we had built into our outlook, I remain comfortable with the guidance that we\u2019ve set here. And as \u2013 and when you think about where that comes from, the strength in TTS, the strength in Securities Services, both benefiting from the rate hikes we saw last year, but also deepening relationships with new and existing clients, the card momentum, which is really about seeing more revolving activity as payment rates start to slow and the recovery in Investment Banking and Wealth is not as swift as we would like. And so we have to see how that plays out, too. So when I put those things together, there are certainly some puts and takes that speaks to the diversification of our business model, but it leaves me in a place where I\u2019m comfortable with the guidance that we\u2019ve set. And if that changes, we will certainly update you, but that\u2019s where we are.\nGlenn Schorr: Well, I appreciate that. Maybe if I could follow-up on your comments and the previous ones on TTS and Securities Services. I tried to learn from all my mistakes, I make a lot of them. But in \u201808, we thought housing prices couldn\u2019t go down much, and then they went down a lot, and we all adapt. The same thing in March, thought deposits couldn\u2019t leave a bank so quickly, but they did. So Mark Slide 25 and 26 people should look at because they are great, and they show the stability of your deposit franchise. But I\u2019m curious if history can change at all, meaning right now, those are cash and operating deposits that clients keep with you and they need you, and you\u2019re fully integrated. But do you have client concentrations we should know about? Or how \u2013 are you thinking about any big changes that can happen in terms of client behavior relative to the past in terms of what they keep at any given bank? I know that\u2019s a tough one.\nJane Fraser: Yes. Glenn, I\u2019ll kick it off and pass it over to Mark. I feel very comfortable about how very well diversified our deposit bases across different countries, industries, clients and currencies. And it\u2019s extremely strong in that respect. And as you say, the majority of the institutional deposits are integrated into the operating accounts all around the world to enable the clients to run their day-to-day operations, the payroll, the working capital, the supplier financing, etcetera. And I think what\u2019s changed in the more digital world is, frankly, these have become even stickier because the amount of data, the extent of integration into the technology platforms and systems of the clients and the value that we extract and present back to the clients from the combination of our FX, trade, cash, etcetera, flows is incredibly important for their \u2013 and driving their efficiency, their risk management and their financial performance as well. So both the extent of that diversification and the increasing stickiness versus history is something that we\u2019re certainly not complacent about, but I think is why you see some of the pages we put into the deck as well, including in the back, on just the consistency of this space. Mark, what would you add?\nMark Mason: I think that\u2019s exactly right, Jane. And Glenn, I\u2019m glad you pointed out, Pages 25 and 26, which clearly lay out that diversification, but also the scale and stability of those deposits over an extended period of time. The only thing I\u2019d add additional to that would be, obviously, we\u2019re in an environment where there is quantitative tightening that\u2019s occurring. That\u2019s going to have a broad industry impact as we\u2019ve started to see already. But we\u2019re also in an environment where rates are increasing. We will see how that plays out through the balance of the year. That has an impact on betas, but we shouldn\u2019t mistake price sensitivity or interest rate sensitivity with the stickiness of the deposits. And so we\u2019ve obviously talked about betas increasing, particularly in our TTS portfolio, more so in the U.S. It obviously will continue to increase outside of the U.S., but we will work the relationship that we have with those clients and the breadth of services that we bring to influence and impact pricing. And more importantly, because of the operating nature of them, we do see them as very stable.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMike Mayo: Hi, Jane, I challenged you a couple of earnings calls ago about the complexity created by being in so many countries. You said, TTS was your crown jewel. And here, it\u2019s up almost one-third year-over-year. So, so far, so good under since your Investor Day. Can you talk about some of the fee growth? I mean we kind of understand the NII growth, but the fee growth is double digits also. So I guess that\u2019s money in motion. And I think you described this as the world\u2019s largest wholesale global payment system. What\u2019s happening to give you double-digit top line growth there?\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Mike, and a great question. And I think one of the numbers I\u2019m almost more happy about than the stellar revenue growth was the fee growth quarter-over-quarter here. Because, obviously, we\u2019ve been benefiting in TTS from the rate environment, but we\u2019ve also been benefiting from the drivers behind the franchise. And the fee revenues are coming from multiple different products and different offerings that we have here. And we\u2019re typically looking and have consistently looked at growing our fee revenue as a percentage of the underlying growth in TTS. It got masked a bit when the rates environment was growing so much, but the different areas there around the world are making a big difference to just the strength of our earnings and the quality of our earnings in these areas.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And then as it relates to rates, generally, like what is it, like over 90% of your rate sensitivity is outside the U.S. And so shouldn\u2019t you be benefiting more than you originally thought, given some of these rate hikes? And I guess, Mark, are you just sandbagging a little bit? I get the uncertainties in IB backlog pushout. And no, I mean, we want you to have a reasonable bar to jump over. And I\u2019m just wondering if you set the bar high enough for yourself for this year.\nMark Mason: Yes. So again, I think that there is certainly more opportunity in terms of how rates move and capturing NII. As you pointed out, outside of the U.S., we articulate our interest rate exposure for a parallel shift. And that mix at the end of last year was the 90-10 that you mentioned for non-U.S. As I sit here in March, it probably is going to skew a little bit less non-U.S. and a little bit more towards the U.S., and you\u2019ll see that in the Q. With that said, I mentioned earlier, there is still a bit of uncertainty in terms of how rates continue to evolve here in the U.S. We will see how betas evolve. We reached terminal betas in the U.S. with our clients kind of at the end of last year. And so we will see kind of what happens in terms of pricing through the balance of 2023. And betas are not quite at terminal levels outside of the U.S. And so we will see the pacing of that, again, in light of how the interest rate curve may be evolving and frankly, in light of how we\u2019ve seen the broader sector turmoil play out. That could, in fact, play to our benefit. But we are also, again, an environment where there is quantitative tightening that is still at play. And then the final point I\u2019d make, Mike, that often people forget is that in that NII is legacy NII. And so as we continue with our wind downs, our divestitures, etcetera, that\u2019s going to be a headwind that we will have to deal with.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: I know during the prepared remarks, you talked a bit about Andy Sieg coming on Board. And I just wanted to understand how to think about the outlook for what you\u2019re doing with Wealth, not only in the U.S. but the non-U.S. locations, and also try to understand how much capital you think you could apply to that business relative to what you have today? Thanks.\nJane Fraser: Betsy, so we\u2019re obviously delighted that Andy is joining as our new Global Head of Wealth around my table. He\u2019s a tremendous leader with a great track record driving growth. He got deep product and digital expertise, proven people leader, and we will certainly be taking full advantage of his expertise and experience in the U.S. We\u2019re not shifting our strategy in Wealth. Its mandate is consistent with the strategy we laid out at Investment Day. And that\u2019s the day we see a lot of potential of growth in Asia as we fill in the coverage across the full wealth spectrum there. We will be scaling up in the U.S. by building out the investment offering and cross-selling into our existing and new clients across the country. We see tremendous potential of growth in our Private Bank and the family office franchise or really around the world. And there is a lot of synergies to be realized as we point out in the different KPIs and drivers, between the other four core businesses in terms of referrals and other business that we\u2019re able to generate across the franchise. So the core of the strategy will not be changing with him coming on Board. Mark, what else would you add in?\nMark Mason: One thing I\u2019d add is that, look, we are, I think, well positioned for as the market recovers, and it plays towards Wealth. When you look at kind of the client advisers, as you know, we\u2019ve been investing in bringing on new client advisers. We\u2019ve been increasing the number of new clients that we\u2019ve been onboarding as well. We\u2019ve invested in some of the investment products that we have. And so I feel like we are positioning ourselves for when this turns. And as it relates to your question regarding capital, this, in a normal cycle, is a very healthy returning business. And as the market turns and as we recover, we would look to deploy capital appropriate with the growth and return prospects that we see in front of us. It\u2019s also not as much of a capital-intensive business as other businesses. And so I think you\u2019ve got to keep both of those things in mind.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. And I think it\u2019s remarkable that your first two questions were essentially saying that your revenues are too conservative. So that\u2019s very notable for us. My first question is a follow-up to Betsy. I think everybody was certainly impressed, Jane, at the Andy Sieg hire. And clearly, he was running a much larger business that what Citi has today. And this is sort of a tricky question. Clearly, you\u2019re still working through some of the transformation. There is still a consent order. But given your strength as a global player, could Citi participate in perhaps inorganic opportunities that could be out there, having a result perhaps of the liquidity crisis that we saw that could potentially enhance your Wealth Management footprint more quickly?\nJane Fraser: We see plenty of potential for organic growth potential. And I think that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going to be focusing, Erika, because I look at the Private Bank and the family office. There is so much wealth creation, supplemented by our commercial banking relationship with a lot of the enterprises and the owners of those enterprises who are really generating the new industry champions in country after country, and we\u2019re extremely well positioned to capture that. I don\u2019t see an inorganic play that would actually help us on it. We also benefit because we don\u2019t have our own proprietary products and a sales force pushing those proprietary products were open architecture. And therefore, we\u2019re a very desirable partner for many of our key partners on the institutional side of the business to be able to provide very interesting value propositions, investment opportunities and the like to our clients around the world. And finally, we can see certainly areas in interesting digital plays, different partnerships, areas like that, that are of interest. So I\u2019ll never say never in the longer run. I\u2019m sure if something very attractive comes up, we will be very interested in looking at it. But it\u2019s not something right now that I think makes sense, given where we\u2019re focused. And no consent to actually almost independent of the consent orders. I think where \u2013 what we\u2019re looking at doing right now is getting this organic play right, and then we will see from there.\nMark Mason: I think it\u2019s pretty telling that we had 13,000 referrals from our retail bank.\nJane Fraser: Yes.\nMark Mason: To the wealth space, right or to our wealth business. And so a lot of embedded opportunity and it really speaks to the integrated model that we\u2019ve been talking about.\nJane Fraser: And I think the other bit I\u2019d also just point to is I think one of the things we do benefit from is that we aren\u2019t constrained by being dominated by a brokerage model in a particular way of doing Wealth. So part of the mandate for Andy and the ones that we\u2019ve been working on to date is really looking at what is modern Wealth Management and making sure that we are really well positioned that way, because I do think that will be more of the way of the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on capital. I appreciate the fact that the potential sale of the Mexico franchise would be a negative impact, but you\u2019re sitting at a pretty comfortable cushion now above your target. Obviously, expected future retained earnings growth should be more than an offset. So how do we think about \u2013 how are you thinking about the timing of restarting buybacks with your stock as cheap as it is?\nMark Mason: Yes. Thanks, Jim. Good morning. Look, we \u2013 as you point out, we grew capital pretty sizably this quarter, up to 13.4% from a CET1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago, some 200 basis points or so. And a good portion of that, a significant portion of that was really net income earnings generation, which is important. Look, the way we think about it is at 13.4%, we certainly have well above what\u2019s required from a reg point of view, and it includes our internal management buffer of about 100 basis points. But as we\u2019ve said in the past, there is certainly the Mexico transaction, and that would be a temporary drag, if you will, to CET1 at signing, the difference between signing and closing, if it were a sale to take place. And then there are a couple of other factors that are out there as well. So think about the Basel III end game that\u2019s out there and the capital requirements that could come out of that; think about the CCAR DFAST that is current \u2013 has been submitted and currently under review and what that might mean for stress capital buffers and; also think about just where we are in the broader economy and broader global macro environment that we\u2019re playing in and needing to see how that kind of evolves. And so when I think about all those factors, we\u2019re in a place where we will continue to take it quarter-by-quarter. But I\u2019d end by saying our bias is kind of where yours is, which is given where we\u2019re trading, all things being equal, we\u2019d like to be buying back shares. But we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that.\nJane Fraser: I think we will have more clarity fairly soon around a number of the factors. So we will be able to give you better clarity on timing before too long.\nJim Mitchell: Yes, all fair. And then maybe as a follow-up, just you mentioned increased macro assumptions embedded in reserves. Where are you now on the macro assumptions in the reserve book?\nMark Mason: So in terms of the reserve \u2013 again remember, we have a couple of different scenarios that we run when we calculate the CECL reserves. Our current reserves are based on those three macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects a 5.1%-or-so unemployment rate on a weighted basis over eight quarters. So that\u2019s relatively flat versus last quarter. The other point worth mentioning is that in this particular calculation for the quarter, we did skew a little bit more towards the downside in terms of the probability weighting than last quarter, again, in light of the macro environment and the combination of that as well as well as some normalization in the portfolio, including an increase in revolver activity contributed to the increase in reserves we saw. But to answer your question, unemployment at about 5.5 for be weighted \u2013 sorry, 5.1 for the weighted basis over the eight quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nJane Fraser: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: I wanted to start off with a question just on the IB trading outlook. On the trading side, just given some of the recent macro shocks, have you seen any evidence of that volatility? And are you still confident that you can sustain that mid-single-digit growth target? And just on the investment banking side, I wanted to see if there is any evidence of green shoots. It\u2019s been a challenging backdrop, as you noted, Mark, but I was hoping you could offer some color just across some of the different product lines across M&A, ECM, DCM.\nMark Mason: Why don\u2019t I start and then, Jane, feel free to jump in. Look, we had a \u2013 we saw a better performance in the quarter in markets then when I talked at the conference earlier in the quarter. And really, that played through in our Fixed Income business, which was up about 4% year-over-year, driven largely by strength in rates. And we saw rate volatility in the back end of the quarter, and we were well positioned to take advantage of that and serve clients, and that aided getting us to the down four in aggregate across markets. What we talked about for the full year is kind of relatively flat performance. And I still think that based on what we see today and subject to how the macro continues to evolve, that we will be able to deliver on that. But as you know, volatility, in many instances, plays to the favor of markets businesses. And so there is a bit of an unknown as to how that evolves, but I feel confident in the guidance that we\u2019ve given thus far on that. Jane, did you want...\nJane Fraser: Yes. I\u2019d jump in before you turn to banking as well. I think one of the differences with our franchise compared to some others is that we are the go-to bank for corporate. And that provides a highly attractive, but pretty steady flow of activity. This is obviously in the volatile markets we\u2019ve been seeing is, from our perspective, very good volatility because we\u2019re able to support our clients in rates, FX, commodity hedging. And it makes our risk flows much more diversified than our competitors, particularly in volatile markets like this. We\u2019re not taking positions. This is really attractive client flow business right at the heart of the global network. The other piece that I think is important in the mix here, too, is just the partnership with TTS cross-border payments. These are the elements that cornerstone of the FX franchise. So there is some pieces here of the volatility that one doesn\u2019t usually think of this as being client, so client heavy, but that\u2019s what\u2019s differentiating on the Citi franchise. Mark, back to you.\nMark Mason: Thanks. I think that\u2019s exactly right in terms of the corporate client base there. Look, in Investment Banking, obviously, the wallets down \u2013 were down meaningfully last year. We saw some performance \u2013 good performance in debt capital markets this quarter, up 66% versus the prior quarter, particularly as we saw activity in investment-grade names, which is an area of strength for us for sure. And I think there was a bit of momentum behind a bit more clarity on the direction of rates. And so we will see how that continues to evolve and play out. The other thing I would add is that we continue to have very good dialogue with clients as they manage through the environment and try to anticipate what the balance of the year looks like. And at some point, it\u2019s clear that clients are going to need to get back into the markets. But that trajectory is going to largely depend on the geopolitical and macro environment and how we all manage and navigate that uncertainty. So, very engaged, healthy pipeline, but subject to how the environment continues to evolve.\nSteven Chubak: That\u2019s great. And for my follow-up, just on PWM fee income trends. I am not going to ask you about the broader wealth strategy, but we are big fans of Andy here, so congrats on the hire. The one thing I did want to get a better sense of is how much of the sequential improvement that we saw in fees is a function of just partner payments being higher as credit continues to normalize. And how we should be thinking about the trajectory and fees within PBWM over the remainder of this year?\nMark Mason: I think there are a couple of things to kind of keep in mind in terms of PBWM fees. And I think part of it is that PBWM is a combination of both the cards business as well as the wealth business. And a good amount of the pressure that we have seen in fees, and that is still subject to how the environment evolves, is in the wealth space, because we continue to see fee pressure on investment activity and revenues there. And we will have to see how the market valuations move on some of the assets that we manage on behalf of clients and what momentum it drives in terms of more investment activity. So, I think that\u2019s a big part of the drag in fees, the upside that we have seen in fees and in banking and cards, again, I think will be subject to how activity and volume evolves across our cards business. We do expect revolving levels to continue, but purchase sales, while they are up year-over-year, when we look at kind of the latter months of the quarter. They have been under \u2013 the growth has been slowing and it\u2019s been quite concentrated in travel and entertainment. So, we will have to see how some of that volume activity evolves, and that will be a factor to keep in mind.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. One, in terms of the Banamex sale, I think Jane, you mentioned that maybe we might hear something relatively soon and you still are pursuing the dual-track process. One, if you do decide to go the IPO route, does that change the accounting dynamics, Mark, with regards to taking that hit early on if \u2013 given just the time it might take to go through the an IPO? And the outlook for the Mexican economy, the banks continues to be robust. Does that \u2013 is that impacting or influencing how you are thinking about the value that you should get from this transaction?\nJane Fraser: So, we are in a very active dialogue right now in Mexico. So, neither, Mark or I are going to comment in a lot of detail there. As you say, we are continuing to pursue a dual path, both the sale and an IPO. So, we will have an exit strategy either way. And we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders. So, we have got enormous body of work going on in Mexico to separate out the institutional business. I am pleased with the progress they are making. I think we are seeing \u2013 when we look at the performance of our Mexican franchise, a lot of the really strong performance is happening in our ICG business where Mexico is such a beneficiary of the supply chain dynamics that are happening around the world. And its location is obviously very beneficial given the proximity to the U.S. as well. So, we are seeing a lot of the dynamic and the big benefits here coming in the institutional franchise that we are keeping within Citi as a core part of business. So, the current Mexican economy doesn\u2019t really have so much of an impact on our current decision-making. The principle is we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders.\nMark Mason: Yes. And just to put some numbers to that. For the quarter, Mexico was up 16% revenue year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter up 5%, cards growth, deposit growth, so performing well, I would say. And in terms of the latter part of your question, Jane is exactly right. Everything we are doing is positioning us for both a private sale and/or an IPO, and we will choose the path that\u2019s best for shareholders. And IPO would take longer. It would likely take longer as we would want a set of full audited financials, etcetera. I would say that in terms of what the implications would be from an accounting point of view, CTA accounting is different for an IPO, so we would not recognize that CTA through the P&L. In an IPO, we wouldn\u2019t have at signing that impact that is different from that closing. And so that would not be an issue. The impact would be a matter of how much we IPO-ed at that time. So, love see a lot of moving pieces there. We would need to figure out if we ended up down that path. But hopefully, that gives you some sense of the scenarios there. But I would end with just one final point that Jane has made already, which is that the outcome that we choose will be the best outcome for our shareholders, our clients and employees.\nJane Fraser: And that will be an exit.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Hello. You guys have talked about bending the curve on cost, I think in the latter part of 2024. And I wanted to see if that\u2019s still the case. And I guess maybe just some clarification on what bending the curve means. Is that slowing expense growth absolutely dropped? Any kind of clarity on that and cost in general kind of medium-term would be helpful. Thank you.\nMark Mason: Thanks Matt. To answer your question very directly, yes, it is still the case. We are going to bend the curve, as I have mentioned in \u2013 towards the end of 2024. It does mean an absolute dollar reduction in expenses.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I mean I think in the past, you have kind of insinuated that, that\u2019s like the start of, hopefully, a more material drop in costs beyond, obviously, if it\u2019s far away, but just any additional color there, too. Thank you.\nMark Mason: Yes. Look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right. We recognize that expenses have been growing. They have been growing because we have been investing in the franchise, both transformation-wise, as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have in many of our franchises. But we are managing that very actively and very deliberately. And that means that we are looking to ensure that we are spending the money in the right way and the right places and that we are going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time. And that was all factored into the targets that we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term. And what that requires is that we start bending the curve in \u201824, as I have stated, and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency of about 60%, and we are positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% RoTCE point of view. There are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base. One, the divestitures that we have been talking about, right. The second is both the benefits from the transformation and other investments that I have just referenced. And the third is further organizational and management simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that we are exiting 14 consumer countries. And so those three factors, if you will, become very important and to ensure that we get to that lower cost structure and that we are able to deliver on the broader commitments that we are making with regards to returns.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hey Jane. Hey Mark.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: A couple of questions. Jane, maybe starting with you first, or Mark, both of you can answer it. In view of what the \u2013 the disruptions we have seen in the banking system in the month of March with what went on with the regional banks here in the U.S. and obviously, the large investment bank over in Switzerland, do you guys see changes coming, or what changes do you see coming in terms of regulatory, whether it\u2019s more capital, more liquidity? And it may not be directed at a company like yours because you are a global SIFI already, and it might be more regional orientated in the United States. And then as part of this question, Jane, can you guys give us some color on the deposit you and your peers made into First Republic? What was the thinking behind that as well?\nJane Fraser: Yes, sure. Thank you for the question, Gerard. Well, I would say that we hope that there will be a thoughtful and targeted approach to any changes in the regulatory and capital framework, and that they address the root causes of what actually happened here. And what happened is a combination of macro impacts from the sharp rapid rate increases and some idiosyncratic situation, namely a lack of proper asset and liability management at a small handful of banks. We don\u2019t see these issues as pervasive throughout the broader banking industry. But the events certainly highlight the importance of prudent asset and liability management. We still believe that there is plenty of capital amongst the large banks. And if capital requirements were to increase for the large banks by the regulators, it would exacerbate any credit tightening that might go on. And related to that, what continues to keep me most awake at night is the quantity and quality of activity in the shadow [ph] banking industry. It does not benefit from the same regulatory frameworks and protections for participants. And I amongst others fear that more activity getting driven into it, if the banking capital requirements increase, will be through the detriment of system, strength and stability. So, we hope that this approach will be thoughtful and targeted to where the issues actually were. As I said in my opening comments, we thought that the regulators, both at the local and the national and the international level, were very \u2013 were swift and effective in making sure that they tackle the issues that were in front, and we were absolutely delighted that the large banks acted as a source of strength. And let\u2019s just step back for a minute. In the face of tremendous market uncertainty, 11 of the largest U.S. banks were able to come together to inject $30 billion of deposits into First Republic in little over one day. And that speaks volumes for our capital and balance sheet positions. And I think the responsibility of large institutions and recognizing that we also play an important role here in helping stabilize situations like this. And we thought it was very important to help buy some time and also demonstrate our confidence in the overall U.S. banking system. So, I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor.\nGerard Cassidy: No, very insightful. Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up question, I noticed in your card, I think it was Slide 8, you gave us the prime \u2013 80% of the portfolio is prime, which is FICO score is greater than 680. I don\u2019t know if you would agree with this statement, but we are hearing that there were some FICO score inflation. As a result of the pandemic, a lot of consumers saw the FICO scores go up. And I have seen numbers as high as 70 points that may be in the high side. But can you guys \u2013 do you agree with that? And if you do, would you then expect the 700 FICO score customer at some point to behave like a 650 score customer?\nJane Fraser: I think the short answer is no, but let me let Mark answer that one.\nMark Mason: Yes. I think what\u2019s really important here, Gerard, is kind of what we are seeing in the way of the performance of the portfolio. So, again, I have heard that sentiment regarding FICO store inflation. We feel very confident in how we have assessed our customers and what it means to have 80% of our customers prime and greater than 680. And I think importantly, what we are seeing is we are seeing payment rates start to slow. We are seeing average interest-earning balances start to increase. We are seeing NCL rates increase, but particularly driven by the lower FICO score customers across the portfolio, which is where you would expect to start to see that drag occur. And the NCL rates that we are seeing are still well below what we would see in a normal cycle, right. And they are in line with what we have been forecasting for performance. So, there are no surprises that we are seeing in terms of how that curve is evolving. We would expect that it will get back to those normal levels towards the beginning of next year. It will likely play through those normal levels a bit before tapering. But my point here is that we understand our customers, the portfolio and how it reacts to the environment enough to forecast that out. And so far, that\u2019s been performing in line with that forecast and those estimates. And importantly, we continue to stress it to make sure we are not missing anything. And importantly, we carry a sizable reserve, as you know, as part of that $20 billion.\nJane Fraser: I would also add that we then just rely on FICO scores for assessing the credit of our customers and our portfolio. There is a tremendous amount of data that we draw upon that goes well, well beyond that. And that\u2019s also, as you can imagine, something that gives a lot more confidence. It\u2019s not just prior history and it\u2019s a wealth of data that is used.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nVivek Juneja: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions Mark and Jane.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nVivek Juneja: Mark, I want to go to your revenue. I hear you, you are keeping the revenue guidance unchanged. What is in your revenue assumption? I just want to unpeel that a little bit. What\u2019s in your revenue assumptions for rates, U.S. and internationally? And what is going on with deposit betas, particularly following the inflows you have seen recently in the U.S. with the crisis?\nMark Mason: Yes. So, I guess a couple of things. One, in terms of the rates that we have assumed, in the balance of the year, we have kind of assumed that rates would kind of probably \u2013 rates would flatten out after this quarter, after the second quarter and then trend down a bit towards the end of the year, down a bit to something like 450 or so, 450 or so. So, we may have one rate increase and then flat and then down to about 450. That could change. But candidly, if it changes a little bit here or there, it\u2019s unlikely to have a meaningful impact in 2023. That\u2019s likely to have more of an impact in 2024. So, we can debate that curve, but that\u2019s kind of what we have thus far in our outlook. The second point I would make is around \u2013 and that\u2019s U.S. rates. We are assuming \u2013 I don\u2019t have specifics in front of me in terms of the rate curves around the globe, but we are assuming kind of continued rate increases there, not of significant magnitude, but some assumptions there depending on where we are talking about. The beta assumptions that we have built in are for betas to continue to increase outside of the U.S. But again, they run lower than the U.S. in general, for our multinational clients. We expect that we will see in the PBWM retail banking or with PBWM client segment space that clients are likely to move towards either higher-yielding deposit products or investment products. And so we have factored those things into how we think about the outlook. And could that change or evolve? Absolutely, but that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s behind what we have assumed here.\nVivek Juneja: And just as a clarification, with the inflows you have seen recently in deposits with the crisis systems in the U.S., obviously, any other betas, the tempering a little bit, how much those are going up? Are you \u2013 is that slowing down or not any change so far?\nMark Mason: So, a couple of things I have mentioned. So, one, we did see inflows in the quarter associated with some of the sector turmoil. If you \u2013 we have looked at kind of deposit levels from, call it, March 7th, March 8th, through close to the end of March. And we certainly did see an uptick, call it, probably a little bit under $30 billion or so of inflows in that period of time with a good portion of that in our CCB, our commercial middle market client base. It\u2019s too soon to tell kind of how betas evolve, but we do think that a good portion of those deposits will likely be sticky. I think what\u2019s important here is that part of our strategy here is, in fact growing operating deposits with our large multinational clients and our middle market clients. And so we are going to continue to be focused on that. What\u2019s a little bit unclear is how the rate environment continues to evolve and what that means for how betas actually evolve, right. And we will have to kind of wait and see. It\u2019s too soon to tell as it relates to that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Hey Mark. Just a follow-up on the credit. So, you mentioned, obviously, that you moved your part of your CECL adjustment a little bit towards the \u2013 in your weightings. And you had previously talked about getting towards \u201cnormalized\u201d card losses, I think you had said by around the end of the year. So, can you just \u2013 given the changes that we are seeing ahead of us and definitely saw some normalization happen this quarter, can you just \u2013 are you still online for that getting to that 3 to 3.5 and 5, 5.5 in the respective card businesses by around year-end this year?\nMark Mason: Yes. Year-end, early next year, yes. We are still kind of on track on trend for that. Again, I would expect that they pick up a little bit after that before they start tapering down. But to answer your question, Ken, is yes, that\u2019s still the timeline, fourth quarter, early 2024, reaching those normalized levels.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Cool. And then one more just follow-up, end-of-period deposits down 3%, you mentioned the taxes. Are the taxes \u2013 fell across the business. When I look at the deposits page, there are a lot of ins and there are a lot of outs on an end-of-period basis. And just trying to get a sense of like what areas might have been impacted by that tax seasonality and where there was just some of the other pieces that you have already talked through in terms of inflows, outflows and everything else in between?\nMark Mason: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So, again, in the \u2013 when you look at our deposits on an average basis, you see on Page 26 that they tick-up a little bit. If you look at it on an end-of-period basis, they are down about 3%. And essentially, intra-quarter, particularly in March, as I mentioned earlier, we did see a sizable increase in flows. With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits. And then we have the seasonality point that I referenced in prepared \u2013 in my prepared remarks, excuse me, where we have both operational payments from our large TTS clients as well as tax payments and with our TTS clients, also with wealth clients, to some extent, kind of playing through the end-of-period deposits. And again, that for the most part is normal operating payments that we would expect to see at this time of year.\nJane Fraser: There are no surprises in what happened.\nMark Mason: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Just one clarification on that last answer. You said you had inter-quarter flow. Did you gain more deposits in the month of March? And was that in the U.S.?\nMark Mason: Yes, we did. Yes. That\u2019s what I was talking about, Mike, in terms of those flows. They did come largely in the U.S. in the month of March, following March and through kind of the end of March. They were overshadowed by these normal payments that I referenced. And we did \u2013 and we still see good activity kind of even as we came through March and in the early parts of April.\nJane Fraser: And that was both in the institutional business that we saw the inflows as well as in the PBWM.\nMike Mayo: And if you define deposits this way, I mean, if I am oversimplifying correct me, but look, you have 5,000 multinationals. You really target for payments, capital markets and banking. Those companies have a lot of deposits, a lot of services. That\u2019s the stickiest. That\u2019s where you said 80% of your clients in TTS have been with you for over 15 years. What are the deposits for those 5,000 multinationals? And I know I am asking the slice and dice in a little bit different way, but even just a general sense. Because the reason I am asking this is because I think there is a disconnect between selling percent of uninsured deposits as a measure of stickiness. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s valid. And you showed higher deposits, even though you have a big percentage of uninsured deposits or maybe that doesn\u2019t matter as much as some front pages of newspapers are suggesting. So, if you could address that.\nMark Mason: Yes. Thanks Mike. Look, I will tell you to turn to Page 26 in the earnings presentation, right. And we have broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have. And at the bottom, you see the TTS deposits. And this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside. And you can see the stability as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time. And to your point, these are largely operational deposits that these clients have with us. And we shouldn\u2019t mistake rate sensitivity or betas with stickiness, right. And because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here. Now, they are price-sensitive in the sense that as rates go up, we often have to re-price those. But remember, the relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships. And that\u2019s what gives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And so the other page in your own time you can look at is the page prior to that, which again speaks to the diversification of the portfolio, but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have been with us and they have grown with us. And so nearly 80% of our deposits are from clients that have greater than 15-year relationship with us, and that says a lot. And that \u2013 and so anyway, those are the two points I would make. Hopefully, that addresses your question around the stickiness.\nJane Fraser: Yes. I often say it takes the root canal to extract us from the operations of our clients just because of exactly what we are talking about here. And that\u2019s also we see it even with the mid-market clients that are a growing portion here as well because we are helping them expand internationally, and that stickiness comes through. And the LCR of 120% is a very high-quality LCR ratio.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Jen Landis for closing remarks.\nJen Landis: Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to IR. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the Citi first quarter 2023 earnings review call. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and hello to everyone joining us today. Well, 2023 is shaping up to be another interesting year. Given the tumultuous events of the last few weeks, I am going to share some observations and then we will turn to what was a good quarter. First, our banking system as a whole is very strong. While a small handful of institutions still have challenges to overcome, the U.S. financial system remains unmatched globally. And I feel confident saying that as someone who has worked in many different systems around the world. The U.S. system comprises a healthy mix of community banks, regional banks and larger global banks, including Citi. We all have important but different roles to play, serving different clients with different needs and on different scale. I would also point to the rapid response by state, federal and international regulators that help reinforce confidence in the system at a very critical juncture. I am pleased that Citi has been a source of stability for the financial system and a source of strength for our clients. That's not an accident. We are in a position to play this role, because our strategy is delivering a simpler, more focused bank. We benefit from a diversified earnings base and resilient business model. This is reinforced by our robust balance sheet management, liquidity position and strong risk management frameworks. We are disciplined in how we run the firm from client selection to capital planning. And it's also thanks to our people. And I want to express my pride in our colleagues around the world who worked tirelessly last month to serve clients as they turn to Citi as a port in the storm. Recent events have shown that prudent asset and liability management is absolutely paramount. While Mark is going to walk you through our approach and our focus on interest rate risk, liquidity and capital, I do want to mention a few things myself. In terms of assets, our loans are high quality and short duration. We have highly liquid investment securities and a significant amount of cash. We have over $1 trillion worth of available liquidity resources, including $584 billion of HQLA and an LCR of 120%. And we maintain a diverse set of funding sources, including over $1.3 trillion of deposits across corporates, consumers, industries and regions, many of which are operational in nature. Indeed, the cornerstone is our institutional deposit base, which comprises about 60% of our deposits. Most of these deposits are particularly sticky because they sit in operating accounts that are fully integrated into how our multinational clients run their businesses around the world from their payrolls, their supply chains, their cash and liquidity management. 80% of these deposits are with clients who use all three of our integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. The data that we aggregate from these deposits and their related flows is fundamental to how our clients manage their efficiency, risk and compliance. And this greatly increases our deposit stickiness. It's also why nearly 80% of these deposits are from client relationships that are 15 years old or more. Finally, we operate a strong risk framework that looks at both assets and liability concentrations across client segments, industry and region. And we are confident in the size and nature of our exposures, given our very rigorous stress testing. We also diligently manage counterparty risk, which is critical given the interconnectedness of financial institutions. We are in a strong position to navigate whatever environment we face, which is particularly relevant given the degree of uncertainty today. The Fed continues to use rate policy to battle inflation, which has been more than stubborn in services even as we see signs of cooling in labor and manufacturing. We expect the recent event to be disinflationary and credit to contract. We believe it's now more likely that the U.S. will enter into a shallow recession later this year. That could be exacerbated in depth and duration in a more severe credit crunch. But right now, the biggest unknown is the impact on terminal short-term U.S. interest rates and of course, how the debt ceiling plays out. In Europe, the ECB is on a similar but more difficult quest to payment inflation. They have asked some help from lower-than-expected energy prices and the outlook continues to be a bit brighter. However, the war in Ukraine sadly shows no sign of ending, and Europe places more structural challenges, such as the need for increased defense spending, higher energy costs and fiscal burdens that will make efforts to dampen inflation and stimulate growth more difficult. In Asia, the reopening of China is adding to the momentum in the region, although the Chinese consumer has been slower to rebound than expected. I saw many green shoots firsthand talking to our clients and our bankers in my various trips to India, Japan and Hong Kong this year. We have to keep a close eye on geopolitics as the U.S.-China relationship becomes increasingly strained and is fragmenting economic blocks. And we see this translate into a shift in flows and heightened cross-border volume across TTS and our global network. Now turning to how we performed this quarter. We reported net income of $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19. We had good revenue growth of 6% ex divestitures, and both revenue and expenses were in line with our guidance. Our ROTCE of nearly 11% benefited from the closing of the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam and would have been over 9% without those gains. Let me highlight our operating performance in each of our 5 core businesses. In Services, TTS has continued to go from strength to strength with revenues up 31%. Non-interest revenue was up 11% quarter-on-quarter on the back of increased cross-border activity and good performance in commercial cards due to the rebound of corporate travel. Securities Services wasn't too shabby either, up 23% as we executed on new mandates, onboarded new AUC and benefited from higher rates. Within market, our fixed income revenues were up 4% from a year ago. We benefited from excellent performance in rates and continued engagement from our corporate clients. The first quarter of 2022 was no slouch, as you may recall, but this quarter was our third best in a decade. Equities was much weaker, however, down markedly in both derivatives and cash, although it still had revenues north of $1 billion. Banking was down again, but there were signs of the beginning of a pickup, including increased activity in the investment-grade market. In U.S. Personal Banking, our cards businesses gained momentum as all drivers continued to normalize to pre-COVID levels and beyond. Branded Cards and Retail Services saw revenues up 18% and 24%. Retail Banking saw some growth as we continue to see good momentum in mortgages and installment lending and also experienced a significant increase in digital deposits. We did see a notable softening in consumer spending growth over the course of the quarter. Travel and entertainment continued to grow in March, but essentials were flat, and almost all other spend categories were down. Savings rates are below historic averages. And while the upper quintile of household income, still have roughly $1 trillion in excess savings, the savings of the lower quintiles have been significantly drawn down. So we're keeping a diligent eye on the lower FICO bands as economic growth and services spend slow. Finally, while revenues were down again, we remain confident about the prospects of our Wealth business. Despite the challenging headwinds, growth in Citigold accounts, client acquisition and client advisers were all solid, and we expect these drivers to flow through to revenues later this year and beyond. We also saw the early signs of a long-awaited Asian recovery. We built credit reserves this quarter on the back of growth in revolving balances in cards and poorer macro outlook. NCLs continued to normalize in consumer while the health of our corporate base was evident in another quarter of very low NPLs. Finally, we continue to generate capital through our earnings. With our CET1 ratio now at 13.4%, we have room to absorb the temporary upfront impact should we sign a deal for Mexico. As you know, we continue to pursue a dual-pass year and we are committed to increasing the amount of capital we return to our shareholders over time. As you can see from Slide 3, in addition to good operating performance from our businesses and despite everything else going on in the industry, we got a lot done this quarter as we implement the strategy we shared with you at Investor Day. We closed the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam. Indonesia and Taiwan are next on the list to close later in the year. Our Asian consumer sales will then be complete, and we are intensifying our efforts to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our organizational structure. We made some significant leadership announcements. I'm delighted that Andy Sieg will join City at my table as the new Head of Wealth Management. Andy is a widely respected leader in this space and comes to us after running an $18 billion business with $2.8 trillion in client balances. He is the latest and the most visible example of the excellent talent we have attracted over the last couple of years. With Karen Peetz retiring, we named Anand Selva as our Chief Operating Officer and asked him to take on running our enterprise-wide Transformation program, in addition to his current responsibilities. Anand has been at Citi for over 3 decades and has a strong track record of delivering results. In terms of our Transformation, we are completely focused on executing our plans to address the consent orders and improve our risk and control environment. Mark will walk you through specific examples of how we're modernizing our infrastructure, simplifying processes and improving data quality. Importantly, these efforts are improving the client experience and helping us deliver Citi's core capabilities to them. To wrap up, it's 1 year after our Investor Day, and I'm proud of the progress we've made and our relentless focus on delivering. Our strategy is clear. Our business model is resilient and diversified. Our balance sheet is strong. We're making good progress on execution. Amidst considerable turmoil, we are delivering on our guidance and our commitments. Our team is determined to continue delivering with excellence. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions. Yes. Glenn, I'll kick it off and pass it over to Mark. I feel very comfortable about how very well diversified our deposit bases across different countries, industries, clients and currencies. And it's extremely strong in that respect. And as you say, the majority of the institutional deposits are integrated into the operating accounts all around the world to enable the clients to run their day-to-day operations, the payroll, the working capital, the supplier financing, etcetera. And I think what's changed in the more digital world is, frankly, these have become even stickier because the amount of data, the extent of integration into the technology platforms and systems of the clients and the value that we extract and present back to the clients from the combination of our FX, trade, cash, etcetera, flows is incredibly important for their \u2013 and driving their efficiency, their risk management and their financial performance as well. So both the extent of that diversification and the increasing stickiness versus history is something that we're certainly not complacent about, but I think is why you see some of the pages we put into the deck as well, including in the back, on just the consistency of this space. Mark, what would you add? Thank you, Mike, and a great question. And I think one of the numbers I'm almost more happy about than the stellar revenue growth was the fee growth quarter-over-quarter here. Because, obviously, we've been benefiting in TTS from the rate environment, but we've also been benefiting from the drivers behind the franchise. And the fee revenues are coming from multiple different products and different offerings that we have here. And we're typically looking and have consistently looked at growing our fee revenue as a percentage of the underlying growth in TTS. It got masked a bit when the rates environment was growing so much, but the different areas there around the world are making a big difference to just the strength of our earnings and the quality of our earnings in these areas. Betsy, so we're obviously delighted that Andy is joining as our new Global Head of Wealth around my table. He's a tremendous leader with a great track record driving growth. He got deep product and digital expertise, proven people leader, and we will certainly be taking full advantage of his expertise and experience in the U.S. We're not shifting our strategy in Wealth. Its mandate is consistent with the strategy we laid out at Investment Day. And that's the day we see a lot of potential of growth in Asia as we fill in the coverage across the full wealth spectrum there. We will be scaling up in the U.S. by building out the investment offering and cross-selling into our existing and new clients across the country. We see tremendous potential of growth in our Private Bank and the family office franchise or really around the world. And there is a lot of synergies to be realized as we point out in the different KPIs and drivers, between the other four core businesses in terms of referrals and other business that we're able to generate across the franchise. So the core of the strategy will not be changing with him coming on Board. Mark, what else would you add in? We see plenty of potential for organic growth potential. And I think that's really where we're going to be focusing, Erika, because I look at the Private Bank and the family office. There is so much wealth creation, supplemented by our commercial banking relationship with a lot of the enterprises and the owners of those enterprises who are really generating the new industry champions in country after country, and we're extremely well positioned to capture that. I don't see an inorganic play that would actually help us on it. We also benefit because we don't have our own proprietary products and a sales force pushing those proprietary products were open architecture. And therefore, we're a very desirable partner for many of our key partners on the institutional side of the business to be able to provide very interesting value propositions, investment opportunities and the like to our clients around the world. And finally, we can see certainly areas in interesting digital plays, different partnerships, areas like that, that are of interest. So I'll never say never in the longer run. I'm sure if something very attractive comes up, we will be very interested in looking at it. But it's not something right now that I think makes sense, given where we're focused. And no consent to actually almost independent of the consent orders. I think where \u2013 what we're looking at doing right now is getting this organic play right, and then we will see from there. Yes. And I think the other bit I'd also just point to is I think one of the things we do benefit from is that we aren't constrained by being dominated by a brokerage model in a particular way of doing Wealth. So part of the mandate for Andy and the ones that we've been working on to date is really looking at what is modern Wealth Management and making sure that we are really well positioned that way, because I do think that will be more of the way of the future. I think we will have more clarity fairly soon around a number of the factors. So we will be able to give you better clarity on timing before too long. Good morning. Yes. I'd jump in before you turn to banking as well. I think one of the differences with our franchise compared to some others is that we are the go-to bank for corporate. And that provides a highly attractive, but pretty steady flow of activity. This is obviously in the volatile markets we've been seeing is, from our perspective, very good volatility because we're able to support our clients in rates, FX, commodity hedging. And it makes our risk flows much more diversified than our competitors, particularly in volatile markets like this. We're not taking positions. This is really attractive client flow business right at the heart of the global network. The other piece that I think is important in the mix here, too, is just the partnership with TTS cross-border payments. These are the elements that cornerstone of the FX franchise. So there is some pieces here of the volatility that one doesn't usually think of this as being client, so client heavy, but that's what's differentiating on the Citi franchise. Mark, back to you. So, we are in a very active dialogue right now in Mexico. So, neither, Mark or I are going to comment in a lot of detail there. As you say, we are continuing to pursue a dual path, both the sale and an IPO. So, we will have an exit strategy either way. And we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders. So, we have got enormous body of work going on in Mexico to separate out the institutional business. I am pleased with the progress they are making. I think we are seeing \u2013 when we look at the performance of our Mexican franchise, a lot of the really strong performance is happening in our ICG business where Mexico is such a beneficiary of the supply chain dynamics that are happening around the world. And its location is obviously very beneficial given the proximity to the U.S. as well. So, we are seeing a lot of the dynamic and the big benefits here coming in the institutional franchise that we are keeping within Citi as a core part of business. So, the current Mexican economy doesn't really have so much of an impact on our current decision-making. The principle is we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders. And that will be an exit. Yes, sure. Thank you for the question, Gerard. Well, I would say that we hope that there will be a thoughtful and targeted approach to any changes in the regulatory and capital framework, and that they address the root causes of what actually happened here. And what happened is a combination of macro impacts from the sharp rapid rate increases and some idiosyncratic situation, namely a lack of proper asset and liability management at a small handful of banks. We don't see these issues as pervasive throughout the broader banking industry. But the events certainly highlight the importance of prudent asset and liability management. We still believe that there is plenty of capital amongst the large banks. And if capital requirements were to increase for the large banks by the regulators, it would exacerbate any credit tightening that might go on. And related to that, what continues to keep me most awake at night is the quantity and quality of activity in the shadow [ph] banking industry. It does not benefit from the same regulatory frameworks and protections for participants. And I amongst others fear that more activity getting driven into it, if the banking capital requirements increase, will be through the detriment of system, strength and stability. So, we hope that this approach will be thoughtful and targeted to where the issues actually were. As I said in my opening comments, we thought that the regulators, both at the local and the national and the international level, were very \u2013 were swift and effective in making sure that they tackle the issues that were in front, and we were absolutely delighted that the large banks acted as a source of strength. And let's just step back for a minute. In the face of tremendous market uncertainty, 11 of the largest U.S. banks were able to come together to inject $30 billion of deposits into First Republic in little over one day. And that speaks volumes for our capital and balance sheet positions. And I think the responsibility of large institutions and recognizing that we also play an important role here in helping stabilize situations like this. And we thought it was very important to help buy some time and also demonstrate our confidence in the overall U.S. banking system. So, I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor. I think the short answer is no, but let me let Mark answer that one. I would also add that we then just rely on FICO scores for assessing the credit of our customers and our portfolio. There is a tremendous amount of data that we draw upon that goes well, well beyond that. And that's also, as you can imagine, something that gives a lot more confidence. It's not just prior history and it's a wealth of data that is used. There are no surprises in what happened. And that was both in the institutional business that we saw the inflows as well as in the PBWM. Yes. I often say it takes the root canal to extract us from the operations of our clients just because of exactly what we are talking about here. And that's also we see it even with the mid-market clients that are a growing portion here as well because we are helping them expand internationally, and that stickiness comes through. And the LCR of 120% is a very high-quality LCR ratio."

            "content": "Thanks, Jane and good morning everyone. I am going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; and spend a little more time on expenses, our balance sheet and capital; then I will turn to the results of each segment. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19 and an ROTCE of nearly 11% on $21.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $950 million, largely driven by the gain on sale of the India Consumer business. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.86, with an ROTCE of over 9%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and increased 6%, excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across Services, Fixed Income and U.S. Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Wealth as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exit and wind down. Our results include expenses of $13.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year. Excluding divestiture-related costs in the prior year, expenses increased 5%, largely driven by the transformation, other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reductions from the exit and wind downs. Cost of credit was approximately $2 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in car net credit losses and ACL and other provision build of approximately $700 million, largely related to a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in card revolving balance. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. Transformation investments drove 1% of the growth, largely in the data, finance and risk and control programs. And 4% of the increase is driven by structural, largely in the form of compensation and benefits, including the full year impact of the people we hired last year as well as those we hired in the first quarter. Embedded in the structural bucket are a few key items. First, other risk and control investments that are enterprise-wide and in the businesses, which make up about 2% of the total expense increase. Second, the impact of additional front and back-office hires. Third, inflation and severance costs. All of this was partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exits. And across the firm, technology-related expenses grew 12%. We recognize these investments have driven a significant increase in expenses, but they are crucial to modernize the firm, address the consent orders and position Citi for success in the years to come. Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to spend a few minutes giving you some tangible examples of what we're investing in and the benefits we'll see over time. In many cases, these investments will simplify our processes and platforms. For example, we are retiring and consolidating 20 cash equities platforms to 1 single modern platform, eliminating costs over time. And we have consolidated 11 platforms to 1 global sanction-screening platform, reducing false alerts, improving the client experience and eliminating costs. We're also modernizing our infrastructure and the security of our data and information by enhancing cybersecurity through the use of AI and improving the security of our infrastructure and devices, leading to fewer operating losses. And we are leveraging industry-leading cloud-based solutions to modernize and streamline the connectivity between our front-office systems and the general ledger, eliminating manual processes and operating costs over time. We're driving the strategy by investing in the client experience, both in terms of our technology interface and innovative new products. We launched our cloud-based instant payments platform for e-commerce clients in TTS. We're also deploying CitiDirect Commercial Banking, our mobile and digital interface for commercial clients, so they too can open accounts and access all products and services across ICG in the same way our large corporate clients do. And finally, we're investing in data to create advanced decision-making, client-targeting and risk management capabilities, which has allowed us to enhance our returns through greater RWA efficiency. And we expect many of these investments to generate efficiencies that will allow us to self-fund future investments over time. On Slide 7, we show net interest income, deposits and loans, where I'll speak to sequential variant. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $80 million, largely driven by interest-earning balances in cards. Average loans were up slightly as growth in PBWM was largely offset by a decline in ICG. Average deposits were also up slightly, driven by growth in both PBWM and ICG, and our net interest margin increased 2 basis points. On Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We're well reserved for the current environment with nearly $20 billion of reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio, was approximately 2.7%. And within that U.S. cards is 8.1%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in U.S. cards. And of that exposure, nearly 80% is to customers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And NCL rates, while reflecting some typical seasonality this quarter, are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in wealth and predominantly mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiary. And corporate non-accrual loans remain low at about 40 basis points of total loans. As you can see on the page, we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totaled $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels, and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. On Slide 9, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We've added a few additional metrics to the page to provide additional transparency into how we manage the balance sheet. We maintain a very strong $2.5 trillion balance sheet, which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high-quality diversified assets. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our strategy and well-diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors and individuals with global needs. First, the majority of our deposits, $819 billion are institutional and span 90 countries. And the majority of these institutional deposits tend to be interest rate sensitive. So when rates go up, we reprice the deposits accordingly, but that reprice takes into account the overall client relationship as well as the level of rates. But despite this interest rate sensitivity, these deposits tend to be stable as they are tied to the operational services that we provide. And these institutional deposits are complemented by $437 billion of U.S. retail consumer and global wealth deposits, as you can see on the bottom right side of the page. These deposits are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work as well as across regions and products, with 75% of U.S. Citigold clients and approximately 50% of ultra-high net worth clients having been with Citi for more than 10 years. Our wealth deposits tend to also be interest rate sensitive, but this usually results in our customers moving to higher-yielding deposits and investment products. Now turning to the asset side. At a high level, you can think of our deposits being largely deployed in 3 asset buckets: loans, investment securities and cash, which complement the interest rate sensitivity and liquidity value of our liability. And this deployment is also linked to our strategy. We use our resources to lend and transact with our clients in ways that deepen the relationship and drive returns for our shareholders while maintaining strong liquidity and capital. Our $652 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans, and the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.3 years as the majority of these loans are variable rate. About 35% of our balance sheet is in cash and investment securities, which contribute to our $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. And at the end of the quarter, we had an LCR of 120%, which means we have roughly $100 billion of HQLA in excess of the amount required by the rule to cover stressed outflows. And you can see the details of this on Page 27 in the appendix. But just as important as the quantum of liquidity is the composition and duration of that liquidity and our $513 billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, agency and other sovereign bonds and is split evenly between available for sale and held to maturity, where we've maintained a short duration of less than 3 years, so we could benefit from higher interest rates. And we actively and prudently manage our assets and liabilities by considering a range of possible stress scenarios and how they might impact interest rate risks, liquidity and capital. So in summary, our assets and liabilities are aligned across interest rate sensitivity, liquidity value and duration and reflect a diversified business model and execution of our strategy. On Slide 10, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Walking from the end of the fourth quarter, first, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common, which added 38 basis points; second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points; third, impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 7 basis point increase; and finally, the remaining 4 basis point increase was largely driven by the RWA benefit from closing our consumer exits. We ended the quarter with a 13.4% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 40 basis points higher than last quarter, and this includes a 100 basis point internal management book. And as it relates to buybacks, we did not buy back any stock this quarter, and we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. On Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the first quarter. Revenues were up 1% this quarter, largely driven by Services and Fixed Income, mostly offset by Investment Banking and Equities. Expenses increased 4%, driven by transformation, other risk and control investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $72 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. This resulted in net income of approximately $3.3 billion, up 23% driven by the lower cost of credit and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. ICG delivered a 13.8% ROTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down 2%, reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up 3% as we continue to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. And sequentially, average deposits were up 1%. And on an end-of-period basis, ICG deposits were down 3% sequentially, driven by seasonality as our clients tend to make tax payments in the first quarter. On Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 31%, driven by 41% growth in net interest income and 13% in NIR with growth across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 6%, reflecting continued Swift share gains; cross-border flows up 10%, outpacing global GDP growth; and commercial card volumes up roughly 40%, led by spend in travel. So while the rate environment drove about 60% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the remaining 40% as we continue to deepen relationships with existing clients and win new clients. In fact, client wins are up approximately 50% across all segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. In Securities Services, revenues grew 23% as net interest income grew 94%, driven by higher interest rates across currency, partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. We are pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration from significant client wins, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher-returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. Markets revenues were down 4% as growth in fixed Income was more than offset by Equities. Fixed Income revenues were up 4% relative to a very strong quarter last year as strength in our rates franchise was partially offset by a decline in FX and commodities. Equities revenues were down 25%, also relative to a strong quarter last year, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in cash and equity derivatives. Corporate client flows remain strong and stable, and we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA target. And finally, Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 21%, driven by Investment Banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. Having said that, we do see revenue growth sequentially, largely driven by the investment-grade market opening up. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress that we're making in ICG. Now turning to Slide 13, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 9%, driven by net interest income growth of 10%, partially offset by a 1% decline in non-interest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in Wealth. Expenses were also up 9%, predominantly driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately $500 million, largely driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumption and growth in card revolving balance. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 3%, largely reflecting our wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, largely driven by higher credit costs. On Slide 14, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 18%, driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 17%; card spend volumes, up 9%; and average loans, up 15%. Retail services revenues were up 24%, also driven by higher net interest income. For both card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline. And that, combined with the investments that we've been making, contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 18% in branded cards and 11% in Retail Services. Retail Banking revenues were up 3%, primarily driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in personal installment lending, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. In fact, consistent with the strategy, we continue to leverage our retail network to drive over 13,000 Wealth referrals in the first quarter. Wealth revenues were down 9%, driven by continued investment fee headwind and higher deposit costs, particularly in the Private Bank. However, we did see notable improvement in revenues in Asia, which were up approximately 20% on a sequential basis. Client Advisers were up 3%, and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our Wealth business with new clients in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work up 62% and 81%, respectively. While the environment continues to remain challenging for Wealth, we're seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy. On Slide 15, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues grew 48%, driven by a gain on sale of our Consumer business in India, partially offset by the wind downs and closed consumer exit. Expenses decreased 24%, largely driven by the absence of a goodwill impairment we had in the prior year as well as the impact of the wind-downs and closed consumer exits. On Slide 16, we show results for Corporate/Other for the first quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses increased, driven by transformation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few key points. Despite recent events and the economic uncertainty that remains, our full year outlook for revenue and expenses remains unchanged. We have a very strong balance sheet with a diversified set of assets and funding sources and ample capital and liquidity. This positions us well to serve clients and navigate any number of scenarios. We're seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses and continue to execute on our strategy. The financial path will not be linear, but we are confident that we can achieve our medium-term targets. And finally, I'm incredibly proud of how our firm and our employees have continued to help our clients navigate the recent environment and support the health of the overall banking system. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Yes. Thanks, Glenn. Good morning. I appreciate the question. Look, we did have a very solid first quarter. But as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, there are a number of things that are still out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear, including, frankly, as we contemplate the direction of rates and what's required to tame inflation, let alone the uncertainty that we've seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter. And so when I think about that and I think about, frankly, how betas have evolved and the likelihood of a recession in the back half of the year, which we had built into our outlook, I remain comfortable with the guidance that we've set here. And as \u2013 and when you think about where that comes from, the strength in TTS, the strength in Securities Services, both benefiting from the rate hikes we saw last year, but also deepening relationships with new and existing clients, the card momentum, which is really about seeing more revolving activity as payment rates start to slow and the recovery in Investment Banking and Wealth is not as swift as we would like. And so we have to see how that plays out, too. So when I put those things together, there are certainly some puts and takes that speaks to the diversification of our business model, but it leaves me in a place where I'm comfortable with the guidance that we've set. And if that changes, we will certainly update you, but that's where we are. I think that's exactly right, Jane. And Glenn, I'm glad you pointed out, Pages 25 and 26, which clearly lay out that diversification, but also the scale and stability of those deposits over an extended period of time. The only thing I'd add additional to that would be, obviously, we're in an environment where there is quantitative tightening that's occurring. That's going to have a broad industry impact as we've started to see already. But we're also in an environment where rates are increasing. We will see how that plays out through the balance of the year. That has an impact on betas, but we shouldn't mistake price sensitivity or interest rate sensitivity with the stickiness of the deposits. And so we've obviously talked about betas increasing, particularly in our TTS portfolio, more so in the U.S. It obviously will continue to increase outside of the U.S., but we will work the relationship that we have with those clients and the breadth of services that we bring to influence and impact pricing. And more importantly, because of the operating nature of them, we do see them as very stable. Yes. So again, I think that there is certainly more opportunity in terms of how rates move and capturing NII. As you pointed out, outside of the U.S., we articulate our interest rate exposure for a parallel shift. And that mix at the end of last year was the 90-10 that you mentioned for non-U.S. As I sit here in March, it probably is going to skew a little bit less non-U.S. and a little bit more towards the U.S., and you'll see that in the Q. With that said, I mentioned earlier, there is still a bit of uncertainty in terms of how rates continue to evolve here in the U.S. We will see how betas evolve. We reached terminal betas in the U.S. with our clients kind of at the end of last year. And so we will see kind of what happens in terms of pricing through the balance of 2023. And betas are not quite at terminal levels outside of the U.S. And so we will see the pacing of that, again, in light of how the interest rate curve may be evolving and frankly, in light of how we've seen the broader sector turmoil play out. That could, in fact, play to our benefit. But we are also, again, an environment where there is quantitative tightening that is still at play. And then the final point I'd make, Mike, that often people forget is that in that NII is legacy NII. And so as we continue with our wind downs, our divestitures, etcetera, that's going to be a headwind that we will have to deal with. Good morning. One thing I'd add is that, look, we are, I think, well positioned for as the market recovers, and it plays towards Wealth. When you look at kind of the client advisers, as you know, we've been investing in bringing on new client advisers. We've been increasing the number of new clients that we've been onboarding as well. We've invested in some of the investment products that we have. And so I feel like we are positioning ourselves for when this turns. And as it relates to your question regarding capital, this, in a normal cycle, is a very healthy returning business. And as the market turns and as we recover, we would look to deploy capital appropriate with the growth and return prospects that we see in front of us. It's also not as much of a capital-intensive business as other businesses. And so I think you've got to keep both of those things in mind. I think it's pretty telling that we had 13,000 referrals from our retail bank. To the wealth space, right or to our wealth business. And so a lot of embedded opportunity and it really speaks to the integrated model that we've been talking about. Yes. Thanks, Jim. Good morning. Look, we \u2013 as you point out, we grew capital pretty sizably this quarter, up to 13.4% from a CET1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago, some 200 basis points or so. And a good portion of that, a significant portion of that was really net income earnings generation, which is important. Look, the way we think about it is at 13.4%, we certainly have well above what's required from a reg point of view, and it includes our internal management buffer of about 100 basis points. But as we've said in the past, there is certainly the Mexico transaction, and that would be a temporary drag, if you will, to CET1 at signing, the difference between signing and closing, if it were a sale to take place. And then there are a couple of other factors that are out there as well. So think about the Basel III end game that's out there and the capital requirements that could come out of that; think about the CCAR DFAST that is current \u2013 has been submitted and currently under review and what that might mean for stress capital buffers and; also think about just where we are in the broader economy and broader global macro environment that we're playing in and needing to see how that kind of evolves. And so when I think about all those factors, we're in a place where we will continue to take it quarter-by-quarter. But I'd end by saying our bias is kind of where yours is, which is given where we're trading, all things being equal, we'd like to be buying back shares. But we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that. So in terms of the reserve \u2013 again remember, we have a couple of different scenarios that we run when we calculate the CECL reserves. Our current reserves are based on those three macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects a 5.1%-or-so unemployment rate on a weighted basis over eight quarters. So that's relatively flat versus last quarter. The other point worth mentioning is that in this particular calculation for the quarter, we did skew a little bit more towards the downside in terms of the probability weighting than last quarter, again, in light of the macro environment and the combination of that as well as well as some normalization in the portfolio, including an increase in revolver activity contributed to the increase in reserves we saw. But to answer your question, unemployment at about 5.5 for be weighted \u2013 sorry, 5.1 for the weighted basis over the eight quarters. Good morning. Why don't I start and then, Jane, feel free to jump in. Look, we had a \u2013 we saw a better performance in the quarter in markets then when I talked at the conference earlier in the quarter. And really, that played through in our Fixed Income business, which was up about 4% year-over-year, driven largely by strength in rates. And we saw rate volatility in the back end of the quarter, and we were well positioned to take advantage of that and serve clients, and that aided getting us to the down four in aggregate across markets. What we talked about for the full year is kind of relatively flat performance. And I still think that based on what we see today and subject to how the macro continues to evolve, that we will be able to deliver on that. But as you know, volatility, in many instances, plays to the favor of markets businesses. And so there is a bit of an unknown as to how that evolves, but I feel confident in the guidance that we've given thus far on that. Jane, did you want... Thanks. I think that's exactly right in terms of the corporate client base there. Look, in Investment Banking, obviously, the wallets down \u2013 were down meaningfully last year. We saw some performance \u2013 good performance in debt capital markets this quarter, up 66% versus the prior quarter, particularly as we saw activity in investment-grade names, which is an area of strength for us for sure. And I think there was a bit of momentum behind a bit more clarity on the direction of rates. And so we will see how that continues to evolve and play out. The other thing I would add is that we continue to have very good dialogue with clients as they manage through the environment and try to anticipate what the balance of the year looks like. And at some point, it's clear that clients are going to need to get back into the markets. But that trajectory is going to largely depend on the geopolitical and macro environment and how we all manage and navigate that uncertainty. So, very engaged, healthy pipeline, but subject to how the environment continues to evolve. I think there are a couple of things to kind of keep in mind in terms of PBWM fees. And I think part of it is that PBWM is a combination of both the cards business as well as the wealth business. And a good amount of the pressure that we have seen in fees, and that is still subject to how the environment evolves, is in the wealth space, because we continue to see fee pressure on investment activity and revenues there. And we will have to see how the market valuations move on some of the assets that we manage on behalf of clients and what momentum it drives in terms of more investment activity. So, I think that's a big part of the drag in fees, the upside that we have seen in fees and in banking and cards, again, I think will be subject to how activity and volume evolves across our cards business. We do expect revolving levels to continue, but purchase sales, while they are up year-over-year, when we look at kind of the latter months of the quarter. They have been under \u2013 the growth has been slowing and it's been quite concentrated in travel and entertainment. So, we will have to see how some of that volume activity evolves, and that will be a factor to keep in mind. Yes. And just to put some numbers to that. For the quarter, Mexico was up 16% revenue year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter up 5%, cards growth, deposit growth, so performing well, I would say. And in terms of the latter part of your question, Jane is exactly right. Everything we are doing is positioning us for both a private sale and/or an IPO, and we will choose the path that's best for shareholders. And IPO would take longer. It would likely take longer as we would want a set of full audited financials, etcetera. I would say that in terms of what the implications would be from an accounting point of view, CTA accounting is different for an IPO, so we would not recognize that CTA through the P&L. In an IPO, we wouldn't have at signing that impact that is different from that closing. And so that would not be an issue. The impact would be a matter of how much we IPO-ed at that time. So, love see a lot of moving pieces there. We would need to figure out if we ended up down that path. But hopefully, that gives you some sense of the scenarios there. But I would end with just one final point that Jane has made already, which is that the outcome that we choose will be the best outcome for our shareholders, our clients and employees. Thanks Matt. To answer your question very directly, yes, it is still the case. We are going to bend the curve, as I have mentioned in \u2013 towards the end of 2024. It does mean an absolute dollar reduction in expenses. Yes. Look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right. We recognize that expenses have been growing. They have been growing because we have been investing in the franchise, both transformation-wise, as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have in many of our franchises. But we are managing that very actively and very deliberately. And that means that we are looking to ensure that we are spending the money in the right way and the right places and that we are going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time. And that was all factored into the targets that we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term. And what that requires is that we start bending the curve in \u201824, as I have stated, and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency of about 60%, and we are positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% RoTCE point of view. There are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base. One, the divestitures that we have been talking about, right. The second is both the benefits from the transformation and other investments that I have just referenced. And the third is further organizational and management simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that we are exiting 14 consumer countries. And so those three factors, if you will, become very important and to ensure that we get to that lower cost structure and that we are able to deliver on the broader commitments that we are making with regards to returns. Good morning. Yes. I think what's really important here, Gerard, is kind of what we are seeing in the way of the performance of the portfolio. So, again, I have heard that sentiment regarding FICO store inflation. We feel very confident in how we have assessed our customers and what it means to have 80% of our customers prime and greater than 680. And I think importantly, what we are seeing is we are seeing payment rates start to slow. We are seeing average interest-earning balances start to increase. We are seeing NCL rates increase, but particularly driven by the lower FICO score customers across the portfolio, which is where you would expect to start to see that drag occur. And the NCL rates that we are seeing are still well below what we would see in a normal cycle, right. And they are in line with what we have been forecasting for performance. So, there are no surprises that we are seeing in terms of how that curve is evolving. We would expect that it will get back to those normal levels towards the beginning of next year. It will likely play through those normal levels a bit before tapering. But my point here is that we understand our customers, the portfolio and how it reacts to the environment enough to forecast that out. And so far, that's been performing in line with that forecast and those estimates. And importantly, we continue to stress it to make sure we are not missing anything. And importantly, we carry a sizable reserve, as you know, as part of that $20 billion. Good morning. Yes. So, I guess a couple of things. One, in terms of the rates that we have assumed, in the balance of the year, we have kind of assumed that rates would kind of probably \u2013 rates would flatten out after this quarter, after the second quarter and then trend down a bit towards the end of the year, down a bit to something like 450 or so, 450 or so. So, we may have one rate increase and then flat and then down to about 450. That could change. But candidly, if it changes a little bit here or there, it's unlikely to have a meaningful impact in 2023. That's likely to have more of an impact in 2024. So, we can debate that curve, but that's kind of what we have thus far in our outlook. The second point I would make is around \u2013 and that's U.S. rates. We are assuming \u2013 I don't have specifics in front of me in terms of the rate curves around the globe, but we are assuming kind of continued rate increases there, not of significant magnitude, but some assumptions there depending on where we are talking about. The beta assumptions that we have built in are for betas to continue to increase outside of the U.S. But again, they run lower than the U.S. in general, for our multinational clients. We expect that we will see in the PBWM retail banking or with PBWM client segment space that clients are likely to move towards either higher-yielding deposit products or investment products. And so we have factored those things into how we think about the outlook. And could that change or evolve? Absolutely, but that's kind of what's behind what we have assumed here. So, a couple of things I have mentioned. So, one, we did see inflows in the quarter associated with some of the sector turmoil. If you \u2013 we have looked at kind of deposit levels from, call it, March 7th, March 8th, through close to the end of March. And we certainly did see an uptick, call it, probably a little bit under $30 billion or so of inflows in that period of time with a good portion of that in our CCB, our commercial middle market client base. It's too soon to tell kind of how betas evolve, but we do think that a good portion of those deposits will likely be sticky. I think what's important here is that part of our strategy here is, in fact growing operating deposits with our large multinational clients and our middle market clients. And so we are going to continue to be focused on that. What's a little bit unclear is how the rate environment continues to evolve and what that means for how betas actually evolve, right. And we will have to kind of wait and see. It's too soon to tell as it relates to that. Yes. Year-end, early next year, yes. We are still kind of on track on trend for that. Again, I would expect that they pick up a little bit after that before they start tapering down. But to answer your question, Ken, is yes, that's still the timeline, fourth quarter, early 2024, reaching those normalized levels. Yes, it's a good question. So, again, in the \u2013 when you look at our deposits on an average basis, you see on Page 26 that they tick-up a little bit. If you look at it on an end-of-period basis, they are down about 3%. And essentially, intra-quarter, particularly in March, as I mentioned earlier, we did see a sizable increase in flows. With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits. And then we have the seasonality point that I referenced in prepared \u2013 in my prepared remarks, excuse me, where we have both operational payments from our large TTS clients as well as tax payments and with our TTS clients, also with wealth clients, to some extent, kind of playing through the end-of-period deposits. And again, that for the most part is normal operating payments that we would expect to see at this time of year. Yes. Yes, we did. Yes. That's what I was talking about, Mike, in terms of those flows. They did come largely in the U.S. in the month of March, following March and through kind of the end of March. They were overshadowed by these normal payments that I referenced. And we did \u2013 and we still see good activity kind of even as we came through March and in the early parts of April. Yes. Thanks Mike. Look, I will tell you to turn to Page 26 in the earnings presentation, right. And we have broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have. And at the bottom, you see the TTS deposits. And this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside. And you can see the stability as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time. And to your point, these are largely operational deposits that these clients have with us. And we shouldn't mistake rate sensitivity or betas with stickiness, right. And because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here. Now, they are price-sensitive in the sense that as rates go up, we often have to re-price those. But remember, the relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships. And that's what gives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And so the other page in your own time you can look at is the page prior to that, which again speaks to the diversification of the portfolio, but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have been with us and they have grown with us. And so nearly 80% of our deposits are from clients that have greater than 15-year relationship with us, and that says a lot. And that \u2013 and so anyway, those are the two points I would make. Hopefully, that addresses your question around the stickiness."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to Citi's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today's call will be hosted by Jenn Landis, Head, Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJennifer Landis: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials, as well as in our SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. Well, we certainly live in interesting times, and while I usually start our calls with our views on the global macro-environment, we're particularly proud of our progress this quarter and so I shall start there. Indeed, in a pivotal year, this quarter contains multiple proof points that we are moving in the right direction and that our strategy is delivering concrete results. We saw revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the firm and across all five businesses. Our businesses performed well as the rate-cutting cycle began with a double-digit increase in fee-based revenues, reflecting the growing diversity of our earnings mix. We continue to have share gains in services and banking. In wealth, we saw a sizable increase in client investments and flows. We brought expenses down, whilst continuing to invest in our transformation and businesses, and we continued to attract the top leaders in the industry and successfully combine them with our own teams in banking and wealth. So, while we are not yet where we want to be, the impact of the changes we're making is clearly evident in our momentum and our improving performance. Turning to the macro. Now while growth is a notch slower than last year, global economic performance continues to be surprisingly resilient. Whatever you want to call the US landing, the sentiment around it is more optimistic, supported by the recent positive payrolls report. And we see a healthy yet more discerning US consumer and a US corporate sector on its front foot. Manufacturing weakness is restraining a modest rebound in Europe, which continues to struggle with more structural challenges around its competitiveness as highlighted by Draghi's report. And in China, consumer sentiment and the property market remain a concern as markets await details on the expected fiscal stimulus. India, ASEAN, Japan, the Middle East, Mexico, and Brazil are all notable bright spots globally. Today, we reported net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.51 with an RoTCE of 7%. Overall revenues grew by 3% ex-divestitures, with each of our core businesses delivering growth and positive operating leverage. While we continue to make substantial investments in our transformation, the efficiencies gained from our simplification and other efforts drove a 2% reduction in overall expenses. Turning to the five businesses. Services delivered a record quarter with revenues up by 8%. Fee growth, the best indicator of underlying momentum was significant. And this combined with loan and deposit volume growth drove this quarter's excellent performance. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 4% year-over-year, reflecting good underlying momentum in the core drivers. And Security Services was up 24%, reflecting the benefit of new mandates and an increase in assets under custody. Both TTS and Security Services achieved over 10% wallet share in our target markets through the first half of the year. Last week, we announced that we are the first global bank to complete the integration of our cross-border services with Mastercard Move. Now this will ultimately enable near-instant secure payments to the vast Mastercard debit network, starting with 14 markets with more to come early next year. And this is another great example of our continued investment in market-leading innovations. In Markets, revenues were up slightly on the back of a better-than-expected September. Equities was up 32% with robust performance across all products. Our continued strong performance in Equities validates both our strategy and execution to grow Prime and Cash. Fixed Income, however, was down 6%. Our Rates and Currencies business didn't match last year's standout performance. It was a particularly pleasing quarter in banking. Despite the muted IPO market, investment banking fees are up 44%, that's driven by investment-grade debt issuance as our clients pulled forward activity ahead of the US election. Corporate sentiment remains positive as Boards pursue strategic transactions such as the $36 billion Mars acquisition of Kellanova, where we are the sole advisor and the lead financier. Our strategy in banking continues to gain momentum. We are steadily growing our share in key target sectors, such as healthcare and tech with a healthy pipeline ahead and a significant upside of our franchise continues to attract the top talent to Citi. During the quarter, we announced an innovative $25 billion private credit partnership with our long-time client Apollo, giving us the ability to source new transactions without using our balance sheet. This partnership positions us with another solution for debt financing for our clients and it allows us to engage in private credit with the same depths and expertise as we currently do with syndicated debt markets. We are also starting to see the positive impact of the significant changes we've implemented in our Wealth franchise with revenues up 9%. It's a notable example of the traction that I referenced earlier. As Andy and the team intensify the focus on our Investments business, we grew client investment assets by 24% and we were particularly pleased with the performance in Asia and in Citigold. I continue to be excited by the opportunities and the sheer potential of our franchise. During the quarter, we signed an agreement to exit trust administration and fiduciary services as we continue to sharpen the focus of our Wealth business. We have more to do to reach our medium-term margin and return targets, but this quarter is a good indicator that we are on the way there. US Personal Banking revenues were up 3%. We grew Branded Cards' revenues by 8% with account acquisitions, spend and payment rates, all driving higher interest-earning balances. Lower discretionary spending is impacting our retail services portfolio. However, we continue to see lower payment rates contributing to interest earning balances. In retail banking, we are growing our mortgage portfolio as the rate environment shifts, as well as growing overall loans. The US consumer dynamics remain remarkably consistent with prior quarters. Our customers are healthy, but more discerning in their spend with signs of stress isolated to the lower FICOs. We have maintained strong credit discipline and our card portfolios continue to perform very much in line with our expectations. In terms of capital, while uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame prevails, our capital position remains very robust and we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.7%. During the quarter, we returned $2.1 billion in capital, including the repurchase of $1 billion of common shares. We will continue to repurchase stock as we evaluate the right level on a quarterly basis. As you know, our transformation is our number one priority. This quarter, we closed another longstanding consent order, which related to the effectiveness of our anti-money laundering systems. We have increased our investments in areas where we have not made sufficient progress such as data quality management. I and the management team remain steadfast and determined to get this transformation right and to get this done. We will close out this pivotal year with momentum and with determination to continue to improve performance in each business and the firm overall. We are committed to meeting our revenue and expense targets for the year, as well as our return target for the medium term. I am very proud of our senior leadership and the entire organization as we demonstrate the potential of our unique global franchise. It is a privilege to lead this firm. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise. And then spend a little more time on the businesses. On Slide 5, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.51, and an RoTCE of 7% on $20.3 billion of revenues. Total revenues were up 1% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues were up 3%, driven by growth across each of our businesses. As you can see on the bottom-left side of the page, net interest income, excluding markets was down 1% year-over-year, largely due to lower interest rates in Argentina. And non-interest revenue, excluding markets was up 9% as we continued to see strong fee momentum across services, banking, and wealth. Year-to-date revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and are up 3% excluding divestiture-related impacts. Expenses were $13.3 billion, down 2%, largely driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume related expenses and continued investments in the transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Year-to-date, expenses are up 1%, primarily driven by the FDIC special assessment and civil money penalties. Cost of credit was $2.7 billion, largely driven by net credit losses in card, as well as ACL builds across the businesses, primarily for portfolio growth and mix. At the end of the quarter, we had over $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%, and year-to-date, excluding the divestiture-related impacts, we generated positive operating leverage for the firm and reported an RoTCE of 7.2%. On Slide 6, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. This quarter, we reported expenses of $13.3 billion, down 2% and 1% sequentially. As we've said before, we will continue to increase our investments to address data governance and data quality related to regulatory reporting and are committed to spending whatever is necessary to address these areas and the transformation more broadly. Although a lot more work remains, we have started to see benefits from our prior investments play through. We've continued to simplify our technology infrastructure, retiring over 450 applications year-to-date and now over 1,250 since our 2022 Investor Day. We've upgraded 100% of our over 2,300 ATMs in North America and Asia Pacific to next-gen software for better customer security and monitoring. And we've streamlined our cloud onboarding process, reducing time to onboard applications to the public cloud from over seven weeks to two weeks. Each of these initiatives will result in both improvement of our operating efficiency and our safety and soundness. And in terms of our full-year expenses, we continue to expect that we will be at the higher end of the guidance range of $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, excluding the FDIC special assessment and Civil Money Penalties. And as we've said before, we, of course, will continue to look for opportunities to absorb the Civil Money Penalties. On Slide 7, we show net interest income, loans, and deposits where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the third quarter, net interest income declined 1%. Excluding markets, net interest income was up 4%, largely driven by volume growth in USPB, as well as higher deposit spreads in services and wealth. NIM declined by 8 basis points, driven by a decline in markets due to seasonally higher dividends in the second quarter. Average loans were up 1%, driven by growth in services and USPB, partially offset by modest declines in Banking and Legacy Franchise. Average deposits were roughly flat as growth in Services was largely offset by a decline in Legacy Franchise. And as you think about guidance for NII ex-markets in the fourth quarter, as short-end rates continue to come down, we expect a headwind on floating-rate assets, which will be somewhat offset by disciplined deposit pricing. Further offsetting that will be a continued benefit from securities being reinvested at higher yield. And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing NII headwind as Legacy Franchises loans and deposits continue to come down. So taking all of this into account, we expect NII ex-markets to be roughly flat sequentially in the fourth quarter and for the full year to be slightly down, better than we had previously guided. On Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite framework. Across our cards portfolio, approximately 85% of our loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. Based on what we see, the US consumer continues to remain healthy and resilient. Spend and payment rates continue to normalize and underlying credit performance remains broadly in line with our expectations. NCLs increased year-over-year as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years continue to mature at the same time. Sequentially, NCLs declined while delinquencies increased, both in line with historical third quarter seasonality. Absent this seasonality, we continue to see stabilization in early-stage delinquencies. We remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 8.2% for our US card portfolio. Our corporate portfolio is largely investment-grade and corporate non-accrual loans remained low at 31 basis points. As such, we feel very comfortable with the over $22 billion of total reserves that we have in the current environment. Turning to Slide 9, we provide details on our balance sheet, capital, and liquidity, which are a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy, and business model. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well-diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types. $840 billion are corporate, spanning 90 countries, and are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $400 billion are well-diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail, and Wealth and Work offerings. And of our total deposits, roughly 70% are US dollar-denominated with the remainder spanning over 60 currencies. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework. Our $689 billion loan portfolio is well-diversified across consumer and corporate loans. In the quarter, deposit growth outpaced loan growth, resulting in higher cash balances, which contributed to available liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. We continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities, which position us well to serve our clients and execute on our growth strategy. On Slide 10, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we generated $3 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $2.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of 18 basis points. Third, we generated 12 basis points from unrealized AFS gain. And finally, the remaining 9 basis point reduction was driven by an increase in RWA as we continue to invest in accretive growth opportunities. We ended the third quarter with a preliminary CET1 capital ratio of 13.7%, relative to our target of 13.3%. As a reminder, effective October 1st, our new CET1 capital ratio requirement is 12.1%, and we still plan on holding a 100 basis point management buffer on top of that for now. As we think about the coming quarters, there are a few things that we will continue to consider as we manage our capital levels, including client demand, as well as how the macro and Basel III Endgame evolves. We will take all of this into account as it relates to capital levels and the level of share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Turning to the businesses on Slide 11. In Services, revenues were up 8%, reflecting continued momentum across Security Services and TTS, both of which continued to gain share through the first half of this year. Net interest income was roughly flat as the benefit of higher deposit volume was largely offset by a decline in interest rates in Argentina. On a sequential basis, net interest income was up 7%, driven by volume growth as we continue to onboard high-quality operating deposits and the benefit from higher deposit spread. Non-interest revenue increased 33% driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina as well as continued strength in underlying fee drivers in TTS and security services. Excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation, NIR increased 11%, driven by growth in cross-border transactions, US dollar clearing volumes, and commercial card volume. Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by investments in technology, other risk and controls, and product innovation, including the expansion of the CitiDirect commercial banking platform into additional markets. Cost of credit was $127 million, primarily driven by a build related to unremittable corporate dividends being held on behalf of clients. Average loans increased 5%, primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance, as well as working capital loans. Average deposits increased 4% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.7 billion and continues to deliver a high RoTCE coming in at 26.4% for the quarter and 24.7% year-to-date. On Slide 12, we show the results for markets for the third quarter. Markets' revenues were up 1%, driven by growth in equities, partially offset by a decline in fixed income. Equities revenues increased 32%, driven by momentum in Prime with balances up approximately 22%, growth in derivatives, and higher cash volume. Fixed income revenues decreased 6%, driven by rates and currencies, which was down 10%, partially offset by spread products and other fixed income, which was up 5%. While rates and currencies declined from last year, which was the strongest third quarter in the previous 10 years, we did see good momentum in FX from increased corporate client activity. Spread products and other fixed income was higher, driven by financing securitization volumes and underwriting fees, partially offset by lower commodities on lower gas volatility. Expenses increased 1%, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was $141 million, driven by an ACL build primarily related to portfolio mix and spread product. Average loans increased 10%, largely driven by asset-backed lending and spread products as well as margin loans in equity. Average trading account assets increased 18%, largely driven by client demand for US treasuries, foreign government securities, and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.9% for the quarter and 9.7% year-to-date. On Slide 13, we show the results for banking for the third quarter. Banking revenues were up 16%, largely driven by growth in investment banking. Investment banking revenues were up 31% and fees were up 44% with increases across debt capital markets, advisory, and equity capital markets. DCM benefited from continued strong investment-grade issuance. Advisory benefited from strong announced deal volume earlier this year. And in ECM, we saw a stronger follow-on activity, which was offset by fewer IPOs amid market volatility in August. Both year-to-date and in the quarter, we've driven wallet share gain, including in the healthcare and technology sectors where we've been investing. Corporate lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges increased 5%, primarily driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. Expenses decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits of headcount reductions as we continue to right-size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $177 million, driven by an ACL build primarily for portfolio mix changes. Average loans decreased 1% as we maintained strict discipline around returns. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the third quarter in a row and delivered net income of $238 million with an RoTCE of 4.3% for the quarter and 7.2% year-to-date. On Slide 14, we show the results for Wealth for the third quarter. As you can see from our performance this quarter, we are making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to continue. Revenue was up 9% driven by a 15% increase in NIR as we grew investment fee revenues on momentum in client investment assets, which grew 24%. NII increased 6%, driven by higher deposit volumes and spreads. Expenses decreased 4%, driven by the continued benefit of headcount reductions as we right-size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $33 million, largely driven by net credit losses of $27 million. End of period client balances increased 14%, driven by higher client investment assets and deposits, both in North America and internationally. Average deposits increased 4%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. Average loans decreased 1% as we continued to optimize capital usage. Wealth generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $283 million with an RoTCE of 8.5% for the quarter and 6.8% year-to-date. On Slide 15, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the third quarter. US Personal Banking revenues were up 3%, driven by NII growth of 2% and lower partner payments. Branded cards revenues increased 8% with interest-earning balances growth of 8% as payment rates continued to normalize and we continue to see growth in spend volume, which were up 3%. Retail services revenues were down 1% due to a slowing growth rate in interest-earning balance. Retail banking revenues decreased 8%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. Expenses decreased 1%, driven by continuous productivity focus, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was $1.9 billion, largely driven by net credit losses and a modest build for volume growth. We continue to expect branded cards to be in the 3.5% to 4% NCL range for the full year. In Retail Services, we continue to expect to be around the high end of the 5.75% to 6.25% range for the full year, driven by both the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as well as lower sales activity at our partners. Average deposits decreased 23%, largely driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposit to our wealth business. USPB generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $522 million with an RoTCE of 8.2% for the quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. As we've said before, the USPB segment creates a lot of value for the firm. We knew 2024 would be a tough year as we lap the credit costs, but we have a path to higher returns. We will continue to drive revenue growth through product innovation while improving the operating efficiency of the business and at the same time, we expect the credit environment to normalize, all of which will ultimately drive USPB to a high-teens return over the medium term. On Slide 16, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 18%, primarily driven by closed, exits and winddowns as well as margin compression on mortgage securities that have extended. Expenses were down 5% as the reduction from closed, exits and winddowns was partially offset by a legal reserve. And cost of credit was $289 million, largely driven by net credit losses and an ACL build in Mexico. Slide 17 shows our full-year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance. We generated $61.6 billion of revenue year-to-date, driven by NIR ex-markets growth of 12%, and are on track to meet our $80 billion to $81 billion full year guidance. As I mentioned, we now expect NII ex-markets to be slightly down for the full year. And with year-to-date expenses of $40.4 billion, excluding the FDIC special assessment and Civil Money Penalties, we continue to expect to be on the higher end of our full year guidance range. As we take a step back, the third quarter represents another quarter of solid progress, and a set of proof points towards improving firm-wide and business performance. We remain focused on continuing to improve our performance and executing on our transformation. These priorities remain critical to strengthening our operations and becoming a more efficient, agile, and client-centric company as we continue to make progress on achieving our medium-term targets. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. Good guidance. I appreciate it. I'm curious on the card losses in Retail Financial Services. If you could talk to like the 2024 exit rate seems like it will be higher than the full year guide at 6.25%. Maybe you could talk to the trajectory there and then the huge reserves that you have built in there and anything you could tell us about the portfolio so we can keep the expectations in the right spot. Thanks.\nMark Mason: Yes, sure. Why don't I take that? Good morning, Glenn. So a couple of things. So one, I think that on Retail Services, you're seeing a couple of things kind of play out. So one, you're seeing kind of spend volumes trend down a bit. You are seeing payment rates come down as well. That obviously is fueling the average interest-earning balanced growth that we're seeing. And then you're also seeing with the spend volume come down, there's a denominator effect that plays through, which pushes up obviously the loss rates that we -- that we're seeing. That still in the quarter is in line with our guidance. But in light of what we saw earlier in the year and normal seasonality, we'd expect that number to be on the higher end of that range and likely higher in the fourth quarter. But the higher in the fourth quarter again depends on what traffic is like and what the holiday spending season looks like through the end of the year. I would say the reserve levels we have are very healthy as it relates to this portfolio. I think in the back of the deck, we show kind of the reserve-to-loan ratio at about 11.7% or so. So well reserved for the Retail Services portfolio in light of the environment that we're in. Similarly, we are seeing the stabilization from a delinquency point-of-view across both portfolios kind of play through. And so, net-net, we are, obviously, actively managing this. The retail partner activity is a critical component of it and that will drive fourth quarter activity or levels, but we do feel as if we'll end up on the higher end of the range here.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Thanks for all that, Mark. Just one quickie on your partnership with Apollo, very interesting and in line with a lot of other things we've seen. So, I'm curious on why -- how you thought about going with one specific partner versus a group? And then more importantly, are there other parts of the franchise that could benefit -- with stronger ties to private markets, I'm thinking specifically in the asset-backed world? I appreciate it. Thank you.\nJane Fraser: Yes. So we're delighted to partner with Apollo because, what this does is, it's uniting our comprehensive banking reach and expertise together and it's enabling us to offer our clients more innovative and tailored financing solutions. There will be some other partners involved in this as well. Mubadala is another participant in this. And when we look at this, it's very, very beneficial for our clients. We're always looking at how we can best serve our clients, give them the most options. And this platform enhances corporate and sponsor clients' access to the private lending capital pool at real scale. I think $25 billion is a very sizable partnership here and it provides funding certainty and strategic transactions. It's exclusive for [LPOs] (ph), non-investment grade in the US. The US is obviously the bulk of the private credit market, so the BMS globally. It would be great to see that market developing in Europe. And I -- it wouldn't surprise me to see us doing more partnerships in other pieces going forward.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess maybe, Mark, for you like looking at Slide 7 on NII, and maybe we can break it down into markets and ex-markets. In the ex-markets NII, $11.96 billion this quarter. Based on what you've said, the back book repricing deposit flex, is it safe to conclude that the ex-markets NII bottomed in 2Q 2024? And I noticed the securities yield actually went lower 7 bps quarter-over-quarter. So was there something one-off that impacted the yields this quarter relative to the expectations you outlined earlier?\nMark Mason: Yes. So when you look at Slide 7, you got a couple of things playing through. So your point around that the low number, the low $11.46 in the second quarter, that really is a combination relative to first quarter FX translation, some seasonally lower card balances, and lower interest payments in Argentina playing through that sequential 1Q to 2Q. The third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, is really a byproduct of volumes on the lending side and spreads, deposit spreads in services, and wealth. I think that I've already given kind of the guide for the fourth quarter where that is likely to be flat. But I think it's important to just remind everyone of the headwinds and tailwinds that play through this NII line. And from a tailwind point-of-view, I would expect to see continued volume from loans, and USPB in particular, but also services and we're talking ex-markets of services. I'd also expect to see continued benefit from the reinvestment of securities at higher yields. And then we're actively managing beta as it relates to with our clients. And if you think about kind of what we saw in the uptick of rates, we're actively managing that on the downtick as it relates to our institutional clients. I think the other point here is, let's not forget that our interest-rate sensitivity skews more towards non-US. And so a lot of what we think about and talk about tends to be how US rates move and the betas around that. We're still going to have a bit of beta catch-up outside of the US and so that's one of the headwinds there as well as the legacy franchise exits. So you've got this long-winded way of saying, I do expect flat into the fourth quarter. I'm not going to give guidance for 2025. But what I will say is to keep the growth momentum to get to our medium-term targets, that's 4% to 5% of a CAGR and that's going to be a combination of NII and NIR, but skewing NIR, and I want to point that out because the third quarter and the year-to-date numbers that you see in our performance shows very strong fee NIR growth across each of these five businesses. And I don't want to lose sight of that as you all really try to get a handle on how we get to that medium-term. We're evidencing that shift towards more fee revenue as we speak. So I'll stop there, but I think that's important and hopefully, I've answered your question around the NII forecast here.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Yes. That's helpful. And agreed on the fee momentum. Just one quick on the Wealth segment. We've seen a considerable progress year-to-date in terms of going from a zero ROE to about 8.5% RoTCE, significant operating leverage. I think I heard Jane say that momentum should continue. Is it fair to assume that RoTCE remains -- like wealth remains a positive story as we think about how Citi's ROE continues to improve from here as we get towards the targets? Any color on the wealth side would be helpful. Thank you.\nJane Fraser: Yes, I agree with you. I think we're all very pleased to see the progress. On the strategy we laid out at Investor Day, the wealth target we have in the medium term is 15% to 20%. And with that, a 25% to 30% operating margin. And we're making steady progress there. I think the first piece was putting the pieces of the global wealth organization together. And now we're focused on positioning for growth and reshaping the business to deliver the returns that we all expect. A very important part of that is shifting our mix by growing investments. We had 24% growth in client investment assets this quarter. I would call that a good start to realizing the potential that we have here. And at the same time, Andy continues to right-size our expense base and drive productivity. Our adviser productivity increased over 50% in Citigold North America. So a number of different areas that are -- that he's focused on so that we can continue to grow the investment space, including some important new talent that we've been bringing in that I'm sure you've noticed.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. What assurance can you give that Citi can both meet its 2026 expense guide, the $51 billion to $53 billion? And I know the year-to-date run-rate implies $54 billion. So getting from that $54 billion run-rate down to the $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026 and meet its regulatory targets. In other words, assurance that Citi can both walk and chew gum at the same time. And I guess I'd highlight, as you know, on October 2nd, Senator Warren asked the OCC to impose growth restrictions because Citi is \u201ctoo big to manage\u201d. Now I would assume you don't agree with that, but still the question that a lot of people have is, what assurances can you give that an asset cap won't happen at Citigroup? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Thanks, Mike. So why don't I start with your expense question and then I'm sure Jane will chime in on some of the other parts of your question? So look, we put out medium-term targets of $51 billion to $53 billion in 2026, revenue dependent, of course, and that's with the -- consistent with the target we gave of less than 60% efficiency ratio. And we've got a target this year, as you know, on the high-end of $53.8 billion. And so we've got to get from $53.8 billion down to $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026. I'm not giving guidance for 2025, but you can expect that would probably likely glide down to that number. What's driving the reduction? So we've talked before about $1.5 billion in savings, largely related to the restructuring and driving down headcount reduction associated with that. We talked about another $500 million to $1 billion related to expense reductions from eliminating stranded cost. As we continue to exit, we're out of nine of these consumer countries already. And we talk about starting to see efficiencies and benefits from the investments in the transformation and technology towards the end of 2026. And those are the three drivers that are important for us to continue to realize between now and 2026. Will there be headwinds? Yes, there will be. The transformation is a multi-year process. We're also investing in risk and controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations. Of course, there'll be headwinds, but there will also be things that we shift away from. There'll be tailwinds associated with it. Jane mentioned some of the productivity efforts that both Andy as well as Vis are pushing on. You look across these businesses and you see positive operating leverage across the board. So that means that Andy Morton, as well as Gonzalo are too looking at their cost structures at expenses that they can take out or productivity that they might improve. And so there will be additional costs that we have to incur. We incurred additional costs this year, but there also be additional productivity savings that we've continue to tease out to ensure that we get to these targets.\nJane Fraser: And Mike, let me pick up on part of the second part of the question in terms of the progress on the transformation. As you know, as Mark is talking about, the transformation reverses historic under-investment in Citi's infrastructure. It enhances our risk and control environment. And it's a strategic overhaul as we've talked about that goes well beyond the consent order to simplify and to strengthen Citi to the benefit of all of the stakeholders we have. We are already a very different Citi today. We've made enormous change over the past three years, dramatically simpler business model, significant org change. So we align our structure to that model. We now have a flatter organization with greater accountability. And as Mark talked about through the investments in our transformation, we're focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure risk and controls, and all of that reduces risk as we go. We are well on the way in executing the transformation plans. We've made meaningful progress as was acknowledged publicly by one of our regulators. And it's a wide range book of work. We've made significant strides in areas such as risk management, compliance, and accountability. And that's well beyond the big bodies of work about consolidating our platforms. So, we had 1,250 retired since 2022, as Mark mentioned. Other areas of progress enhance our stress-testing capabilities. They're faster, more frequent, more precise assessments. We put in place new target operating models for wholesale credit risk, enterprise risk, price risk firmwide. A huge body of work reducing risk and high-risk processes such as payments and markets through systemic preventative controls. We've been implementing the Cin[ph] platform this is the strategic cloud solution for market risk analytics that values trades on-demand and at scale. And we've embedded risk and controls into our performance management framework and tied that to compensation for the full firm. So these are just giving you a flavor of this big body of work that we are executing and getting done with risk. I was very pleased that we closed the FRB, AML, BSA consent order, particularly given heightened risk and scrutiny in this area. That is the third consent order we've closed since 2021. And we've been very transparent on where there are areas in which our execution is delayed against our original timelines, and as is the case with our data work, we take a step back, determine what we need to change in those areas, and get back on track, and make relevant tech and people investments. So I feel very confident about the strategy we've laid out for the firm, the deliberate path we're on, the huge progress we've already made, and that we will continue making with determination and with clarity going forward.\nMike Mayo: So just one follow-up when -- and you do have the amended consent order that's not new anymore. But is this a problem with your dealing with clients or is this an issue with giving the regulators the information that they need? And just again, you don't -- just to confirm, you don't have an asset cap now, is it fair to assume that you don't expect an asset cap anytime soon, or could you have an asset cap and we don't even know about that? Thanks.\nJane Fraser: We don't have any problems dealing with our clients, quite the opposite. We're a source of strength for our clients in terms of the provision of their payments businesses, their trading businesses, their consumer credit businesses all across the board. So I would say quite the opposite. We are a source of tremendous strength for them and you see that in the results of this quarter on -- which were very pleasing across the board in every single one of our businesses. And we are working closely with our regulators. We incorporate their feedback as well as our own lessons learned if we fall behind in an element of the consent orders, but do understand the breadth of the consent order work as I laid out and the meaningful progress we're making across multiple areas. And when we fall behind in an area, we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address it. So I'm -- I feel very comfortable.\nMark Mason: Yes. So again, we don't have -- we're not talking about issues as it relates to client information, client data or client reporting. We're not talking about information as it relates to financials. We're talking about regulatory reporting, all right, in regular reported reporting, as I've mentioned in prior calls, we're a global firm. We've got over 11,000 regulatory reports. And we're talking about ensuring that the data that we capture at trade entry is the data that's required to ultimately show up on these various regulatory reports in the way that we need it, ensuring that we've got the proper controls on that front-end. So we don't do -- we don't have to do a lot of the reconciliation and management and manual adjustments to that data in order to get it how we need it in the report and ensuring that we have standardized rules and controls around that process so that we can do it as efficiently as possible. But this is largely around ensuring that we improve those regulatory reports that we have to produce by starting with the underlying data that's required to do that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, good morning. Mark, consensus expectations and it is just another expense question in a different way, but consensus has you not hitting your revenue growth targets and you certainly free to disagree and I think that's fine. But they also have your expenses at the high end of your $51 billion to $53 billion range in 2026. I guess, does that make sense or do you feel confident that if revenues do sort of disappoint your targets that you could come in at the -- you should or can come in at the lower end of that range to help get to your RoTCE target?\nMark Mason: Yes. So let's take it in pieces. So I think the first thing is that, I think Jane and I have been very consistent with trying to give guidance on full year performance for the past couple of years. And we've largely actually delivered on that guidance. If you look at the top-line growth since Investor Day, it's largely consistent with what we talked about in the medium term. If you looked at the expense guidance that we've given, largely consistent with that, including this year, even if I -- even as I look at the $80 billion to $81 billion revenue guidance we gave for the year and you look at the $60.6 billion that we've done year-to-date and you think about what we have to deliver in order to hit that target, that is achievable, particularly when you remember that we had a large Argentina devaluation last year. That fee momentum required in the fourth quarter is very achievable. And we believe that we will obviously hit the high end of the range for 2024. As I think about that outer year period and the guidance that we gave there, look, you all want proof points before you actually believe that we can deliver on that medium-term target. I'm pointing you to proof points. I'm hopeful that as you see those proof points through 2024, full year and each of the quarters that you will start to believe in that revenue momentum that's required in the medium term. The fee revenue is a very good indicator. What we delivered this year and this quarter is a very good indicator of the momentum we should see across these businesses in the next couple of years. I also hope that you would then see that as we deliver on the expense target that we have a path to continuing to deliver on the medium-term expense target, the drivers of which I mentioned earlier. Yes, if revenues come in short of the target that we've set for ourselves, you would naturally expect for the volume and transaction-related expenses and compensation expenses to come down in a commensurate way with that revenue decline. And you would also expect that we would look to see if there are other productivity opportunities that we can tease out in order to still deliver on that operating efficiency target that we've set for ourselves.\nJim Mitchell: No, that's great color. I appreciate it. And maybe just as a follow-up on the capital question. I guess one thing that's been a bit of a headwind over the last year has been sort of growth in the DTA deductions. Do we start to see that become a tailwind again? How do we think about that accreting back into capital over the next couple of years?\nMark Mason: Yes. Look, the main driver of our DTA utilization will be driving higher income in the US. That's going to be the major driver. And as we think about -- so as you think about each of the strategies that Jane has described for our business, you will often hear the importance of winning in the US. You'll hear it as it relates to banking and the activity that we saw, the strong performance we saw this quarter in [indiscernible] world, you hear it as it relates to the wealth business and the importance of us growing investments, particularly in North America. You see it in USPB, which is largely a US-focused business. That DTA utilization is about us increasing net income or higher net income in the US and as we work to execute on our client-driven strategy, we are looking for opportunities to do that. We're incenting the business to drive that momentum. And that's what's going to give us a higher utilization on a quarter-by-quarter in the coming years.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi. I think we --\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: [Multiple Speakers] Good afternoon, guys. The first one is for you, Jane. As I speak with longer-term investors, they often offer the commentary that clearly, the path from the 7% RoTCE this quarter to the 11% to 12% is -- hopefully will be bridged and to be able to initiate a position before that progress is made they really sort of want to see more capital optimization. And this question is not really the same question I ask you about buybacks every quarter, but really maybe a progress update on Banamex. So there was chatter in the market about Banamex needed to have four quarters of separate financials before being IPOed. And I'm wondering if you could give us specific progress on how that's going. And Mark, maybe remind us on what Banamex's contribution is as we think about the unlocking that excess capital versus taking it out of the P&L?\nJane Fraser: Yes. I'd be delighted to, Erika. And I would also just before I jump into Banamex from point to a laser-focus on capital optimization. It's been a mantra for a long time in our markets business in banking and a discipline that we've driven throughout the organization. And I would say there isn't anyone at Citi that is not keenly aware of the focus around optimizing our capital. Returning to shareholders, particularly given where we're trading and making sure that we drive to returns. So if I turn to Banamex, our singular focus right now is the separation of the two banks, which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of this year. This has been an enormous body of work because we are creating effectively [De novo] (ph]), Mexico's eighth-largest bank. We've just now got the core regulatory authorizations that we need to proceed with separation. Although there are a few other approvals pending. We are in the very final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover and later on in Q4. Once the separation is complete, we will turn our full attention to the IPO itself and the successful execution of the IPO is the highest priority for our Head of International, Ernesto Torres Cantu to run Banamex and our incoming Banamex Executive Chairman who starts this quarter, Nacho Deschamps. We plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors that we can control. But I think as Mark and I have always said, the timing is going to be driven by market conditions to ensure we maximize the shareholder value. And we're making the necessary investments to continue growing share and I was very pleased that Banamex outpaced the average market revenue growth year-to-date, good expense discipline being maintained despite the complex separation process and the environment. So I'm pleased with where we are and I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor of what the path ahead looks like.\nMark Mason: Yes. In terms of the second part of your question, a couple of things. So one, we've been seeing good growth in our Mexico consumer business. We've also been investing in it appropriately so to make sure that we protect the strength of that franchise as we prepare it for separation and ultimately for the IPO. Erika, if I understood your question right, if you turn to Page 16 of the deck in the bottom right-hand side, we show the P&L for Mexico consumer for 2022 and 2023. And so you can see the contribution from a revenue and expense point-of-view, it's about $1.5 billion in 2023. And I believe we probably -- I think it's about $4 billion or so of TCE that we have associated with this business. So that gives you some sense for the contribution, but it continues to perform quite well as we manage it through the -- through this process.\nErika Najarian: Perfect. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, I'm sure it is frustrating for you to see the stock reaction in a quarter where you had PPNR strength and better expectations for net interest income in the fourth quarter. So maybe I'll frame the question this way for you, Mark. As we think about the gyrations in interest-rate expectations globally, maybe remind us sort of -- is it fair to assume that Citi is asset-sensitive internationally and neutrally positioned domestically. How should we think about late fees? I know you told us that late fees going to $8 for a part of your initial -- your initial guide for the year. And additionally, I think perhaps because capital markets was so strong across the board across all of your peers, maybe that's not why you're getting good credit for your strength this quarter. So as we look into 2025 and having NIR be that bigger contribution to your revenue CAGR, maybe walk us through what are the other sort of core fee strengths that we should look forward to other than like -- other than FIC and banking remaining strong and coming back that could bring into that path to 2026.\nMark Mason: Okay. There's a lot there, but thank you. Thank you for the question. I would like to see the stock reacting much more favorably because this really has been a strong quarter for us. And in fact, as you mentioned, NII, when you look through it, we've in fact taken our NII guidance up just a tad bit as we referenced that the full year would be slightly down versus modestly down with the fourth quarter that's flat to the third quarter. And so that is an important takeaway. I mentioned the headwinds and tailwinds earlier and we shouldn't lose sight of those. We will get a lift from reinvesting the securities as those mature, we will continue to see volume growth and those are important drivers of tailwind activity for us. You rightfully mentioned our interest rate exposure analysis that we do on a quarterly basis that reflects the asset sensitivity of our business. And last quarter, it was about $1.6 billion, or so of a negative, assuming a 100 basis point decline across the curve, assuming a static balance sheet, and cross currencies. And as you look at that asset sensitivity, again, you rightfully pointed out that we skew non-US in terms of the magnitude of that decline in NII, should we see that parallel shift. And in fact, it's as much as $1.3 billion, or so of that $1.6 billion is non-US dollar related across 60 currencies. And so you'd have to see all of that move in tandem for that drag. And the US dollar drag is about $300 million, assuming a 100 basis point shift, and that's been coming down. If you look back over the quarters, we've been thoughtfully managing that down and that's down to about a $300 million number. I would expect when we print the third quarter too, it will be down a bit more. And so again, we are asset-sensitive, but it does skew outside of the US, and thank you for asking the question because I think it's important to remind our investors and analysts of that dynamic, which in many ways may be different from that of other institutions. In terms of the late fees, we did say that we were including late fees in our assumptions and our outlook that we've given. I'll state the obvious, Erika, which is that we want people to obviously paid on time and we do everything that we can to assist and ensure that they do that. With that said, we don't have a definitive timeline on late fees, nor are we overly reliant on late fees to drive revenue for our firm. And so it looks like that decisioning will likely kind of fall closer to sometime in 2025. And so there is a small adjustment in the last quarter of our revenue forecast, but it's inside of the guidance that we gave and doesn't materially change that in any way. And then the last part of your question, I think, was around NIR and the fee revenue. And as I mentioned earlier, I'm not going to give guidance for 2025, but I think your question was around where are we likely to see continued momentum as it relates to fee revenue growth. And I'd start with services, which with fees were up some 33% year-over-year. And yes, we should adjust for the Argentine peso devaluation. But even if you adjust for that, it's double-digit, 11% year-over-year non-interest revenue growth. And when you look at those drivers, they've been consistently strong, cross-border transaction value up 8%, US dollar clearing volume up 7%, commercial card spend up 8%. In the supplement, you'll see that it's mid-to-high single-digit year-to-date growth across those KPIs as well. We expect that will continue with our corporate clients and as we bring on new commercial clients as well. I'll turn you to -- if you look at Banking, we talked about already, so I won't kind of lean into that too much, but except to highlight a really strong quarter in Banking, in investment banking fees, in particular, the rebound that we've been talking about, but importantly, us capturing share in that rebound and these important partnerships that position us well as sponsors start to lean back into the market, the investments that we've been making in talent and sectors we need to strengthen, all of those things are going to play to continued fee momentum as we go into 2025. Wealth, again, really strong performance this quarter with revenues up 9%. But look at the client investment assets up 24%. The client balance is up 14%. That's driving fee momentum and it's a keen area of focus for Andy and that team that he's pulled together and it's a real opportunity for us given the $5 trillion or so of assets that our clients hold away from us and we're better positioning ourselves to capture that. And then finally, you can see kind of continued momentum on USPB. But it's across-the-board is what I'm saying, Erika, in terms of that fee momentum, and it is important. It's an important aspect as we think about getting to those medium-term targets in that 4% to 5% revenue.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Mark. Hi, Jane.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Mark, you touched on in your prepared comments about growing the US Personal Banking RoTCE to higher levels. And you mentioned two items. One, innovative products and the normalization of credit costs. Can you elaborate on those two items that will be contributing to the driver aside from the efficiency improvement that you also touched on?\nMark Mason: Yes, sure. So I mean, so obviously, USPB is a combination of the cards businesses that we have in the retail banking business and that cards portfolio has both branded as well as retail services as part of it. And even within branded, we have proprietary cards where we frankly have been looking to how we can come up with new innovative products. So an example of product innovation is the recent refresh that we did of our Strata Premier Card, which was designed to drive acquisition and engagement with a new rewards offering. And with that acquisitions are up some 7% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for branded cards. So that's an example of product innovation. Another one is we also launched Flex Pay at Costco a few quarters ago, and you can see good installment loan growth as a consequence of that, up some 15% or so. And so that type of product creation is important to acquisitions. It's important to ensuring the card stays top of wallet and important to kind of driving some of that top-line performance. And then the other thing that I mentioned, you're right, was around cost of credit and that really is the continued normalization of cost of credit. I mentioned a couple of times now the idea that multiple vintages are maturing at the same time and that's kind of -- that has to play through and us to -- for us to kind of see a more normal level of credit. And that will be important to the returns. And again, we are starting to see stabilization in both the cost of credit line, but also in delinquencies and that's a good indicator for us.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And just following up on credit. In the Banking division, you guys mentioned cost of credit was, I think, $107 million due to a ACL build of $141 million and it was due to a mix -- a change in the mix in the portfolio. Can you share with us what that mix change was that drove this provision?\nMark Mason: Yes. There's nothing -- it's a mix of kind of different asset classes and clients that we've lent against. There's nothing material or significant in that number when you look at the non-accrual loans, that ratio is still 31 basis points. So it's a mix change of our exposures, but nothing material there.\nJane Fraser: And we continue to see a very healthy corporate sector really across the world.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nVivek Juneja: Hi. Two questions to Jane and Mark. One is on expenses and the other is on your response to the asset cap question before. So first one, expenses for an easier one. You had -- earlier in the year, you had said you expect about $700 million to $1 billion of severance charges in the $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. Did you have any in the third quarter? Expect any in the fourth? And do you expect to be done with those this year or any to continue into next year too?\nMark Mason: Yes. So that number was a combination of restructuring charges and severance charges or repositioning charges. And we break out obviously restructuring so that you can see those. And this restructuring component was largely driven by the org simplification. That will be done this year. The normal severance or repositioning charges that we take as a normal course of BAU, you'd expect that to occur in any year and it certainly will be part of 2025 and 2026 going forward. We did have some this quarter. I would expect that we will have some next quarter, but I don't see us being outsider by any stretch, the range that I gave and again the range was for the combination of both.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. Thanks on that. And shifting to the asset cap question, Jane and Mark. I -- we didn't hear a clear answer on, A, do you have an asset cap? And B, if -- even if you don't, what is the effective implication or impact of what the regulators have said?\nJane Fraser: So let me be crystal clear. We do not have an asset cap and there are no additional measures other than what was announced in July in place and not expecting any. So then the implications of what we're doing as I've laid out, we've increased investments in the areas where we were behind, particularly in the data related to our regulatory processes and regulatory reporting. We're increasing investment behind it, and we continue to make progress -- material progress on the orders in place, including closing the BSA/AML order this quarter. The third order closed since 2021.\nVivek Juneja: And you don't expect anything meaningful, Jane, that would impact business like there was this new story about the China sub-license that you didn't get approved by the regulator. Anything more meaningful like that might be occurring that maybe --\nJane Fraser: Absolutely, let me be crystal clear. Absolutely nothing.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Just a couple of clarification questions. I guess first on Banamex, are you on track to sell IPO at the fourth quarter of next year or does it just get pushed out by a quarter with the legal separation taking a little bit longer?\nJane Fraser: Look, I think as I mentioned in response to Erika's question, we plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors we can control. The timing is going to get driven by how we maximize shareholder value and that will be market conditions. So that's where we stand.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Sorry. So I think that means it's by the end of 2025, you talk about 1Q 2026, but that was kind of my clarification question on that.\nJane Fraser: [Multiple Speakers]\nMatt O\u2019Connor: I thought you need four quarters -- I thought you needed four quarters after you legally separated it to officially IPO it?\nJane Fraser: We believe as we stand at the moment, we will -- we would be ready to IPO at the end of 2025. It's much more a focus on what the market conditions at that point will be. And Mark and I are in very, very much focused on the shareholder value and maximizing that over -- rushing over one quarter versus another quarter.\nMark Mason: And there's no hard rule on -- Sorry, go ahead.\nJane Fraser: Yes. There isn't a hard rule on -- you have to have got four full quarters after you have separated.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: I see. Okay. That's super helpful. We just haven't had that many of these, so that's helpful. And then just separately, I think in the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned a modest provision within services for some of the unremitted corporate dividends. And I just wanted to clarify that, and what country is that? And I guess I thought there wasn't really much liability to you guys from that. So any clarification on that? I know it was a small amount, but I think that might be helpful. Thank you.\nMark Mason: Sure. It's a small amount. And if you look in the back of the deck, we have a page on Russia exposure, it's related to that.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay, but still feel like there's not risk to you guys from all those kind of trapped dividends. And I guess why take a small reserve if there's legally any risk to you guys?\nMark Mason: Well, it's the way we treat the exposure there. We're following kind of the guidelines on how we need to treat exposures in the country that we aren't able to distribute to clients, but we actually have to hold on their behalf. And so we have to book a reserve associated with that. And so we do that. We obviously show on the page what the exposure is in the event of a loss of control and you can kind of see how that ultimately nets out, but we're following the appropriate guidelines for what's required to for reserves of that nature.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nMark Mason: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRyan Kenny: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I have one for Mark. So you mentioned that services NII is a tailwind as rates declined. Can you just unpack how that happens? Is there any benefit from swap roll-off or pay floating swaps that we should be thinking about that's embedded in that statement?\nMark Mason: There are a couple of things kind of to keep in mind on the Services business. So one is, obviously this is a client business, it's not just a deposit-taking business. And so how we think about pricing to those clients becomes really important. You've got the US and non-US dynamic that's playing through, where for institutional clients, we've largely been holding to the higher betas that we saw as rates have ticked up again with the relationship in mind and we have some offsetting pressure outside of the US as those betas kind of catch-up. But I think importantly, you also heard me mentioned the reinvestment into securities at higher yields and that reinvestment or those higher yields ultimately play out through the businesses. And so that will show up as part of kind of NII as we think about services, but the other businesses as well. And so those are important components of the NII story for services. I think when you look at the end quarter performance and NII is down 5%, a big part of that is driven by the Argentina high -- lower or rates movement in the quarter versus last year. So lower rates we're earning in Argentina playing through that line, particularly in this quarter. If you adjusted for that on the NII line, it would be flat to slightly a little bit better. So that's really what it is. It's kind of management of client relationships as well as the higher earnings on reinvested securities contributing to that as well as volume from operating account growth that we expect.\nRyan Kenny: Thank you.\nMark Mason: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSaul Martinez: Hey guys. I guess a couple of quick questions. First, just a follow-up on Banamex. Jane, as you know, there are concerns about judicial reform in Mexico and the implications for rule of law and Mexican asset prices have suffered as a result, I think the largest Mexican bank trades up something in the neighbourhood of seven times earnings. If market conditions don't improve and Mexican asset prices remain depressed and these concerns persist, then what -- I mean, do you just wait till market conditions improve, or how do you think about this process in the context of what seems to be a deteriorating macro backdrop for Mexico?\nJane Fraser: Yes. We've got to wait and see what the market conditions will be, but the North Star for me and for Mark is crystal clear, right? It is optimizing and maximizing our shareholder value. And so, if the conditions are not appropriate at that time, then we will wait until they are. In the meantime, the business is performing well. It's accretive to our returns. It's not a drag here in any shape or form. And so there is no need to rush for a suboptimal result here. But we will IPO and we will exit Banamex, but we won't do that in a reckless manner. We will be disciplined about it as you would expect us to be and as I think we're demonstrating that we are on multiple different dimensions.\nSaul Martinez: Great. Fair enough. And then I guess a follow-up on the US Personal Banking RoTCE improvement and the normalization of cost of credit, it seems to be a big component of that. But Mark, can you just remind us where you are in terms of the cost of credit versus what you would think a more normalized level is for Branded Cards and Retail Services? I guess how much more -- how much of a tailwind does a more normalized credit environment entail in terms of the credit costs?\nMark Mason: Again, I don't want to get into 2025 at this stage. I mean, I assure you we will give more color and commentary on that as we get into the fourth quarter earnings in January. What I will say, again, as you think about these businesses we do see continued top-line -- we do expect continued top-line momentum. We've had eight consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in USPB of 49% this quarter. So we're managing the expense base well. We think there's more upside to the top line. We're really focused on growth across the portfolios. And I do think that cost of credit, again, if for no other reason, but the compounding effect of those vintages maturing as well as kind of inflation starting to come off, rates trickling down, that should be better for the consumer and should start to play out in both the macroeconomic scenarios that we run for CECL purposes, but also ultimately in delinquencies and NCLs. And we're starting to see that improvement in delinquencies and its stabilization already somewhat. So I don't want to get into guidance, but that's kind of how I think about the drivers or contributors to improve returns over the medium term.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi, thanks for the clarification on the asset cap question that I asked earlier. And I know you are limited on how much you can say about regulators, but just to be clear, because a lot of email traffic going back, you did say there is no asset cap and you don't expect one and you don't expect other additional actions at this time.\nJane Fraser: Correct.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And I guess, look, I have great respect. I'm an ex-regulator, Paul Volcker was my hero. I respect regulators and nobody wants to see you cut corners to get to your $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. But I'm just wondering -- and you have consolidated systems, apps, layers, bureaucracy and you're divesting lots of activity. So it's just even the amended consent order was surprising because you have taken so many efforts and if you should have had an amended consent order or other actions, they probably should have been in place one, five, 10, or literally 20 years ago. And so that's just confusing on the outside. So with that said, is this a matter of spending more money or about doing these tasks more intelligently? In other words, if you put more gas in the tank, the car is not going faster. So is it the amount of resources or just being more intelligent in terms of resolving some of these regulatory issues?\nJane Fraser: So, let me break it down to a couple of pieces. So I start off just to remind everyone, the consent orders are very, very broad and this -- the action that was taken was because we're behind in a narrower area, which is the data, particularly regarding our regulatory reporting where we're behind is the main area of focus. We moved swiftly to address it. We're very transparent about it from early on in the year that we were falling behind on this. And overall, I'm pleased with our progress. And as you say, Mike, I listed a number of areas of progress and trying to make it as tangible as we can, given what we can and can't say as this is supervisory. I'm pleased that our businesses continue to improve their performance while the transformation is going on. They are the two priorities we have this year. So I think effectively, yes, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. And the huge benefit of all of the simplification on the business, on the organization, the other efforts is making it easier for us to execute and be very focused. And well, maybe, Mark, I pass it over to you.\nMark Mason: I think your question is helpful in the sense that you said, is it kind of a rethink on our approach or is it the need to spend more money? And one of the things that we've done, Mike, is take a step back and look at how we've been approaching data, for example. So this is -- and we are going to make -- we have made some changes to our approach. And those changes relate to how we get after resolving data issues that are identified, ensuring that there is engagement from the front-end business from the functions that are most relevant and that there's consideration for what's required on reg reporting, in order for us to get that process, streamlined and correct. And so there is -- there are aspects of this that require a change in our approach and we've been taking that change and making that change rather, and we'll make more changes accordingly as we've taken that step back. And then the other -- and there are aspects of it that require at a minimum review of what is causing either the delay or us not moving at the pace that we'd like to or that we'd like to move or that our regulators would like. And that is in fact what the resource review plan was that was in the amended consent order. It was basically a statement saying that you need to ensure that you have sufficient resources and that they're allocated towards achieving the timely and sustainable compliance. And so part of our process is in fact that taking a regular review of what is on track in the way of our milestones and deliverables, where we see things that are being delayed or going red, what is the underlying root cause for why? Is it a resource issue where we need to put more dollars and people or technology to it? Is it a process issue where we need to reconsider our approach? And on the other side of that root cause, taking action to fix it. And so your question is spot-on. The answer is that in many instances, it will be a little bit of both. But importantly, our processes include that type of analysis and assessment so that we can get after the execution on this in an effective way. I hope that helps.\nJane Fraser: And all of this drives productivity and other benefits for our shareholders as well as making sure that we're strengthening Citi from the regulatory perspective.\nMike Mayo: And then my last follow-up, you know, to the extent that you see a disconnect between your performance and the stock price, that would seem to create more of an opportunity to buy the stock at $64 when tangible book value is $90. And so I hope that I've used this analogy before, but hopefully, you're selling the chairs and the desks and the silverware and the executive dining room to go ahead and buyback stock, whatever you can.\nJane Fraser: Yes. It's clearly given where we are trading, it is -- we're very focused around the opportunities to buyback stock and mindful of the importance of it. And equally, yes, we are proud of the performance of the franchise this quarter. It was a very strong quarter and an important set of proof points for our investors that we are on a deliberate path. We're making the progress that we need to and actually pretty excited about the path ahead of us and the potential that we see.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.\nJennifer Landis: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Please follow up with IR if you have any additional questions. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes Citi's third quarter 2024 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. Well, we certainly live in interesting times, and while I usually start our calls with our views on the global macro-environment, we're particularly proud of our progress this quarter and so I shall start there. Indeed, in a pivotal year, this quarter contains multiple proof points that we are moving in the right direction and that our strategy is delivering concrete results. We saw revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the firm and across all five businesses. Our businesses performed well as the rate-cutting cycle began with a double-digit increase in fee-based revenues, reflecting the growing diversity of our earnings mix. We continue to have share gains in services and banking. In wealth, we saw a sizable increase in client investments and flows. We brought expenses down, whilst continuing to invest in our transformation and businesses, and we continued to attract the top leaders in the industry and successfully combine them with our own teams in banking and wealth. So, while we are not yet where we want to be, the impact of the changes we're making is clearly evident in our momentum and our improving performance. Turning to the macro. Now while growth is a notch slower than last year, global economic performance continues to be surprisingly resilient. Whatever you want to call the US landing, the sentiment around it is more optimistic, supported by the recent positive payrolls report. And we see a healthy yet more discerning US consumer and a US corporate sector on its front foot. Manufacturing weakness is restraining a modest rebound in Europe, which continues to struggle with more structural challenges around its competitiveness as highlighted by Draghi's report. And in China, consumer sentiment and the property market remain a concern as markets await details on the expected fiscal stimulus. India, ASEAN, Japan, the Middle East, Mexico, and Brazil are all notable bright spots globally. Today, we reported net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.51 with an RoTCE of 7%. Overall revenues grew by 3% ex-divestitures, with each of our core businesses delivering growth and positive operating leverage. While we continue to make substantial investments in our transformation, the efficiencies gained from our simplification and other efforts drove a 2% reduction in overall expenses. Turning to the five businesses. Services delivered a record quarter with revenues up by 8%. Fee growth, the best indicator of underlying momentum was significant. And this combined with loan and deposit volume growth drove this quarter's excellent performance. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 4% year-over-year, reflecting good underlying momentum in the core drivers. And Security Services was up 24%, reflecting the benefit of new mandates and an increase in assets under custody. Both TTS and Security Services achieved over 10% wallet share in our target markets through the first half of the year. Last week, we announced that we are the first global bank to complete the integration of our cross-border services with Mastercard Move. Now this will ultimately enable near-instant secure payments to the vast Mastercard debit network, starting with 14 markets with more to come early next year. And this is another great example of our continued investment in market-leading innovations. In Markets, revenues were up slightly on the back of a better-than-expected September. Equities was up 32% with robust performance across all products. Our continued strong performance in Equities validates both our strategy and execution to grow Prime and Cash. Fixed Income, however, was down 6%. Our Rates and Currencies business didn't match last year's standout performance. It was a particularly pleasing quarter in banking. Despite the muted IPO market, investment banking fees are up 44%, that's driven by investment-grade debt issuance as our clients pulled forward activity ahead of the US election. Corporate sentiment remains positive as Boards pursue strategic transactions such as the $36 billion Mars acquisition of Kellanova, where we are the sole advisor and the lead financier. Our strategy in banking continues to gain momentum. We are steadily growing our share in key target sectors, such as healthcare and tech with a healthy pipeline ahead and a significant upside of our franchise continues to attract the top talent to Citi. During the quarter, we announced an innovative $25 billion private credit partnership with our long-time client Apollo, giving us the ability to source new transactions without using our balance sheet. This partnership positions us with another solution for debt financing for our clients and it allows us to engage in private credit with the same depths and expertise as we currently do with syndicated debt markets. We are also starting to see the positive impact of the significant changes we've implemented in our Wealth franchise with revenues up 9%. It's a notable example of the traction that I referenced earlier. As Andy and the team intensify the focus on our Investments business, we grew client investment assets by 24% and we were particularly pleased with the performance in Asia and in Citigold. I continue to be excited by the opportunities and the sheer potential of our franchise. During the quarter, we signed an agreement to exit trust administration and fiduciary services as we continue to sharpen the focus of our Wealth business. We have more to do to reach our medium-term margin and return targets, but this quarter is a good indicator that we are on the way there. US Personal Banking revenues were up 3%. We grew Branded Cards' revenues by 8% with account acquisitions, spend and payment rates, all driving higher interest-earning balances. Lower discretionary spending is impacting our retail services portfolio. However, we continue to see lower payment rates contributing to interest earning balances. In retail banking, we are growing our mortgage portfolio as the rate environment shifts, as well as growing overall loans. The US consumer dynamics remain remarkably consistent with prior quarters. Our customers are healthy, but more discerning in their spend with signs of stress isolated to the lower FICOs. We have maintained strong credit discipline and our card portfolios continue to perform very much in line with our expectations. In terms of capital, while uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame prevails, our capital position remains very robust and we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.7%. During the quarter, we returned $2.1 billion in capital, including the repurchase of $1 billion of common shares. We will continue to repurchase stock as we evaluate the right level on a quarterly basis. As you know, our transformation is our number one priority. This quarter, we closed another longstanding consent order, which related to the effectiveness of our anti-money laundering systems. We have increased our investments in areas where we have not made sufficient progress such as data quality management. I and the management team remain steadfast and determined to get this transformation right and to get this done. We will close out this pivotal year with momentum and with determination to continue to improve performance in each business and the firm overall. We are committed to meeting our revenue and expense targets for the year, as well as our return target for the medium term. I am very proud of our senior leadership and the entire organization as we demonstrate the potential of our unique global franchise. It is a privilege to lead this firm. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions. Yes. So we're delighted to partner with Apollo because, what this does is, it's uniting our comprehensive banking reach and expertise together and it's enabling us to offer our clients more innovative and tailored financing solutions. There will be some other partners involved in this as well. Mubadala is another participant in this. And when we look at this, it's very, very beneficial for our clients. We're always looking at how we can best serve our clients, give them the most options. And this platform enhances corporate and sponsor clients' access to the private lending capital pool at real scale. I think $25 billion is a very sizable partnership here and it provides funding certainty and strategic transactions. It's exclusive for [LPOs] (ph), non-investment grade in the US. The US is obviously the bulk of the private credit market, so the BMS globally. It would be great to see that market developing in Europe. And I -- it wouldn't surprise me to see us doing more partnerships in other pieces going forward. Yes, I agree with you. I think we're all very pleased to see the progress. On the strategy we laid out at Investor Day, the wealth target we have in the medium term is 15% to 20%. And with that, a 25% to 30% operating margin. And we're making steady progress there. I think the first piece was putting the pieces of the global wealth organization together. And now we're focused on positioning for growth and reshaping the business to deliver the returns that we all expect. A very important part of that is shifting our mix by growing investments. We had 24% growth in client investment assets this quarter. I would call that a good start to realizing the potential that we have here. And at the same time, Andy continues to right-size our expense base and drive productivity. Our adviser productivity increased over 50% in Citigold North America. So a number of different areas that are -- that he's focused on so that we can continue to grow the investment space, including some important new talent that we've been bringing in that I'm sure you've noticed. And Mike, let me pick up on part of the second part of the question in terms of the progress on the transformation. As you know, as Mark is talking about, the transformation reverses historic under-investment in Citi's infrastructure. It enhances our risk and control environment. And it's a strategic overhaul as we've talked about that goes well beyond the consent order to simplify and to strengthen Citi to the benefit of all of the stakeholders we have. We are already a very different Citi today. We've made enormous change over the past three years, dramatically simpler business model, significant org change. So we align our structure to that model. We now have a flatter organization with greater accountability. And as Mark talked about through the investments in our transformation, we're focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure risk and controls, and all of that reduces risk as we go. We are well on the way in executing the transformation plans. We've made meaningful progress as was acknowledged publicly by one of our regulators. And it's a wide range book of work. We've made significant strides in areas such as risk management, compliance, and accountability. And that's well beyond the big bodies of work about consolidating our platforms. So, we had 1,250 retired since 2022, as Mark mentioned. Other areas of progress enhance our stress-testing capabilities. They're faster, more frequent, more precise assessments. We put in place new target operating models for wholesale credit risk, enterprise risk, price risk firmwide. A huge body of work reducing risk and high-risk processes such as payments and markets through systemic preventative controls. We've been implementing the Cin[ph] platform this is the strategic cloud solution for market risk analytics that values trades on-demand and at scale. And we've embedded risk and controls into our performance management framework and tied that to compensation for the full firm. So these are just giving you a flavor of this big body of work that we are executing and getting done with risk. I was very pleased that we closed the FRB, AML, BSA consent order, particularly given heightened risk and scrutiny in this area. That is the third consent order we've closed since 2021. And we've been very transparent on where there are areas in which our execution is delayed against our original timelines, and as is the case with our data work, we take a step back, determine what we need to change in those areas, and get back on track, and make relevant tech and people investments. So I feel very confident about the strategy we've laid out for the firm, the deliberate path we're on, the huge progress we've already made, and that we will continue making with determination and with clarity going forward. We don't have any problems dealing with our clients, quite the opposite. We're a source of strength for our clients in terms of the provision of their payments businesses, their trading businesses, their consumer credit businesses all across the board. So I would say quite the opposite. We are a source of tremendous strength for them and you see that in the results of this quarter on -- which were very pleasing across the board in every single one of our businesses. And we are working closely with our regulators. We incorporate their feedback as well as our own lessons learned if we fall behind in an element of the consent orders, but do understand the breadth of the consent order work as I laid out and the meaningful progress we're making across multiple areas. And when we fall behind in an area, we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address it. So I'm -- I feel very comfortable. Yes. I'd be delighted to, Erika. And I would also just before I jump into Banamex from point to a laser-focus on capital optimization. It's been a mantra for a long time in our markets business in banking and a discipline that we've driven throughout the organization. And I would say there isn't anyone at Citi that is not keenly aware of the focus around optimizing our capital. Returning to shareholders, particularly given where we're trading and making sure that we drive to returns. So if I turn to Banamex, our singular focus right now is the separation of the two banks, which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of this year. This has been an enormous body of work because we are creating effectively [De novo] (ph]), Mexico's eighth-largest bank. We've just now got the core regulatory authorizations that we need to proceed with separation. Although there are a few other approvals pending. We are in the very final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover and later on in Q4. Once the separation is complete, we will turn our full attention to the IPO itself and the successful execution of the IPO is the highest priority for our Head of International, Ernesto Torres Cantu to run Banamex and our incoming Banamex Executive Chairman who starts this quarter, Nacho Deschamps. We plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors that we can control. But I think as Mark and I have always said, the timing is going to be driven by market conditions to ensure we maximize the shareholder value. And we're making the necessary investments to continue growing share and I was very pleased that Banamex outpaced the average market revenue growth year-to-date, good expense discipline being maintained despite the complex separation process and the environment. So I'm pleased with where we are and I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor of what the path ahead looks like. And we continue to see a very healthy corporate sector really across the world. So let me be crystal clear. We do not have an asset cap and there are no additional measures other than what was announced in July in place and not expecting any. So then the implications of what we're doing as I've laid out, we've increased investments in the areas where we were behind, particularly in the data related to our regulatory processes and regulatory reporting. We're increasing investment behind it, and we continue to make progress -- material progress on the orders in place, including closing the BSA/AML order this quarter. The third order closed since 2021. Absolutely, let me be crystal clear. Absolutely nothing. Look, I think as I mentioned in response to Erika's question, we plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors we can control. The timing is going to get driven by how we maximize shareholder value and that will be market conditions. So that's where we stand. [Multiple Speakers] We believe as we stand at the moment, we will -- we would be ready to IPO at the end of 2025. It's much more a focus on what the market conditions at that point will be. And Mark and I are in very, very much focused on the shareholder value and maximizing that over -- rushing over one quarter versus another quarter. Yes. There isn't a hard rule on -- you have to have got four full quarters after you have separated. Yes. We've got to wait and see what the market conditions will be, but the North Star for me and for Mark is crystal clear, right? It is optimizing and maximizing our shareholder value. And so, if the conditions are not appropriate at that time, then we will wait until they are. In the meantime, the business is performing well. It's accretive to our returns. It's not a drag here in any shape or form. And so there is no need to rush for a suboptimal result here. But we will IPO and we will exit Banamex, but we won't do that in a reckless manner. We will be disciplined about it as you would expect us to be and as I think we're demonstrating that we are on multiple different dimensions. Correct. So, let me break it down to a couple of pieces. So I start off just to remind everyone, the consent orders are very, very broad and this -- the action that was taken was because we're behind in a narrower area, which is the data, particularly regarding our regulatory reporting where we're behind is the main area of focus. We moved swiftly to address it. We're very transparent about it from early on in the year that we were falling behind on this. And overall, I'm pleased with our progress. And as you say, Mike, I listed a number of areas of progress and trying to make it as tangible as we can, given what we can and can't say as this is supervisory. I'm pleased that our businesses continue to improve their performance while the transformation is going on. They are the two priorities we have this year. So I think effectively, yes, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. And the huge benefit of all of the simplification on the business, on the organization, the other efforts is making it easier for us to execute and be very focused. And well, maybe, Mark, I pass it over to you. And all of this drives productivity and other benefits for our shareholders as well as making sure that we're strengthening Citi from the regulatory perspective. Yes. It's clearly given where we are trading, it is -- we're very focused around the opportunities to buyback stock and mindful of the importance of it. And equally, yes, we are proud of the performance of the franchise this quarter. It was a very strong quarter and an important set of proof points for our investors that we are on a deliberate path. We're making the progress that we need to and actually pretty excited about the path ahead of us and the potential that we see."

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise. And then spend a little more time on the businesses. On Slide 5, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.51, and an RoTCE of 7% on $20.3 billion of revenues. Total revenues were up 1% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues were up 3%, driven by growth across each of our businesses. As you can see on the bottom-left side of the page, net interest income, excluding markets was down 1% year-over-year, largely due to lower interest rates in Argentina. And non-interest revenue, excluding markets was up 9% as we continued to see strong fee momentum across services, banking, and wealth. Year-to-date revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and are up 3% excluding divestiture-related impacts. Expenses were $13.3 billion, down 2%, largely driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume related expenses and continued investments in the transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Year-to-date, expenses are up 1%, primarily driven by the FDIC special assessment and civil money penalties. Cost of credit was $2.7 billion, largely driven by net credit losses in card, as well as ACL builds across the businesses, primarily for portfolio growth and mix. At the end of the quarter, we had over $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%, and year-to-date, excluding the divestiture-related impacts, we generated positive operating leverage for the firm and reported an RoTCE of 7.2%. On Slide 6, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. This quarter, we reported expenses of $13.3 billion, down 2% and 1% sequentially. As we've said before, we will continue to increase our investments to address data governance and data quality related to regulatory reporting and are committed to spending whatever is necessary to address these areas and the transformation more broadly. Although a lot more work remains, we have started to see benefits from our prior investments play through. We've continued to simplify our technology infrastructure, retiring over 450 applications year-to-date and now over 1,250 since our 2022 Investor Day. We've upgraded 100% of our over 2,300 ATMs in North America and Asia Pacific to next-gen software for better customer security and monitoring. And we've streamlined our cloud onboarding process, reducing time to onboard applications to the public cloud from over seven weeks to two weeks. Each of these initiatives will result in both improvement of our operating efficiency and our safety and soundness. And in terms of our full-year expenses, we continue to expect that we will be at the higher end of the guidance range of $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, excluding the FDIC special assessment and Civil Money Penalties. And as we've said before, we, of course, will continue to look for opportunities to absorb the Civil Money Penalties. On Slide 7, we show net interest income, loans, and deposits where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the third quarter, net interest income declined 1%. Excluding markets, net interest income was up 4%, largely driven by volume growth in USPB, as well as higher deposit spreads in services and wealth. NIM declined by 8 basis points, driven by a decline in markets due to seasonally higher dividends in the second quarter. Average loans were up 1%, driven by growth in services and USPB, partially offset by modest declines in Banking and Legacy Franchise. Average deposits were roughly flat as growth in Services was largely offset by a decline in Legacy Franchise. And as you think about guidance for NII ex-markets in the fourth quarter, as short-end rates continue to come down, we expect a headwind on floating-rate assets, which will be somewhat offset by disciplined deposit pricing. Further offsetting that will be a continued benefit from securities being reinvested at higher yield. And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing NII headwind as Legacy Franchises loans and deposits continue to come down. So taking all of this into account, we expect NII ex-markets to be roughly flat sequentially in the fourth quarter and for the full year to be slightly down, better than we had previously guided. On Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite framework. Across our cards portfolio, approximately 85% of our loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. Based on what we see, the US consumer continues to remain healthy and resilient. Spend and payment rates continue to normalize and underlying credit performance remains broadly in line with our expectations. NCLs increased year-over-year as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years continue to mature at the same time. Sequentially, NCLs declined while delinquencies increased, both in line with historical third quarter seasonality. Absent this seasonality, we continue to see stabilization in early-stage delinquencies. We remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 8.2% for our US card portfolio. Our corporate portfolio is largely investment-grade and corporate non-accrual loans remained low at 31 basis points. As such, we feel very comfortable with the over $22 billion of total reserves that we have in the current environment. Turning to Slide 9, we provide details on our balance sheet, capital, and liquidity, which are a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy, and business model. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well-diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types. $840 billion are corporate, spanning 90 countries, and are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $400 billion are well-diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail, and Wealth and Work offerings. And of our total deposits, roughly 70% are US dollar-denominated with the remainder spanning over 60 currencies. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework. Our $689 billion loan portfolio is well-diversified across consumer and corporate loans. In the quarter, deposit growth outpaced loan growth, resulting in higher cash balances, which contributed to available liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. We continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities, which position us well to serve our clients and execute on our growth strategy. On Slide 10, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we generated $3 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $2.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of 18 basis points. Third, we generated 12 basis points from unrealized AFS gain. And finally, the remaining 9 basis point reduction was driven by an increase in RWA as we continue to invest in accretive growth opportunities. We ended the third quarter with a preliminary CET1 capital ratio of 13.7%, relative to our target of 13.3%. As a reminder, effective October 1st, our new CET1 capital ratio requirement is 12.1%, and we still plan on holding a 100 basis point management buffer on top of that for now. As we think about the coming quarters, there are a few things that we will continue to consider as we manage our capital levels, including client demand, as well as how the macro and Basel III Endgame evolves. We will take all of this into account as it relates to capital levels and the level of share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Turning to the businesses on Slide 11. In Services, revenues were up 8%, reflecting continued momentum across Security Services and TTS, both of which continued to gain share through the first half of this year. Net interest income was roughly flat as the benefit of higher deposit volume was largely offset by a decline in interest rates in Argentina. On a sequential basis, net interest income was up 7%, driven by volume growth as we continue to onboard high-quality operating deposits and the benefit from higher deposit spread. Non-interest revenue increased 33% driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina as well as continued strength in underlying fee drivers in TTS and security services. Excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation, NIR increased 11%, driven by growth in cross-border transactions, US dollar clearing volumes, and commercial card volume. Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by investments in technology, other risk and controls, and product innovation, including the expansion of the CitiDirect commercial banking platform into additional markets. Cost of credit was $127 million, primarily driven by a build related to unremittable corporate dividends being held on behalf of clients. Average loans increased 5%, primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance, as well as working capital loans. Average deposits increased 4% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.7 billion and continues to deliver a high RoTCE coming in at 26.4% for the quarter and 24.7% year-to-date. On Slide 12, we show the results for markets for the third quarter. Markets' revenues were up 1%, driven by growth in equities, partially offset by a decline in fixed income. Equities revenues increased 32%, driven by momentum in Prime with balances up approximately 22%, growth in derivatives, and higher cash volume. Fixed income revenues decreased 6%, driven by rates and currencies, which was down 10%, partially offset by spread products and other fixed income, which was up 5%. While rates and currencies declined from last year, which was the strongest third quarter in the previous 10 years, we did see good momentum in FX from increased corporate client activity. Spread products and other fixed income was higher, driven by financing securitization volumes and underwriting fees, partially offset by lower commodities on lower gas volatility. Expenses increased 1%, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was $141 million, driven by an ACL build primarily related to portfolio mix and spread product. Average loans increased 10%, largely driven by asset-backed lending and spread products as well as margin loans in equity. Average trading account assets increased 18%, largely driven by client demand for US treasuries, foreign government securities, and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.9% for the quarter and 9.7% year-to-date. On Slide 13, we show the results for banking for the third quarter. Banking revenues were up 16%, largely driven by growth in investment banking. Investment banking revenues were up 31% and fees were up 44% with increases across debt capital markets, advisory, and equity capital markets. DCM benefited from continued strong investment-grade issuance. Advisory benefited from strong announced deal volume earlier this year. And in ECM, we saw a stronger follow-on activity, which was offset by fewer IPOs amid market volatility in August. Both year-to-date and in the quarter, we've driven wallet share gain, including in the healthcare and technology sectors where we've been investing. Corporate lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges increased 5%, primarily driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. Expenses decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits of headcount reductions as we continue to right-size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $177 million, driven by an ACL build primarily for portfolio mix changes. Average loans decreased 1% as we maintained strict discipline around returns. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the third quarter in a row and delivered net income of $238 million with an RoTCE of 4.3% for the quarter and 7.2% year-to-date. On Slide 14, we show the results for Wealth for the third quarter. As you can see from our performance this quarter, we are making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to continue. Revenue was up 9% driven by a 15% increase in NIR as we grew investment fee revenues on momentum in client investment assets, which grew 24%. NII increased 6%, driven by higher deposit volumes and spreads. Expenses decreased 4%, driven by the continued benefit of headcount reductions as we right-size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $33 million, largely driven by net credit losses of $27 million. End of period client balances increased 14%, driven by higher client investment assets and deposits, both in North America and internationally. Average deposits increased 4%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. Average loans decreased 1% as we continued to optimize capital usage. Wealth generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $283 million with an RoTCE of 8.5% for the quarter and 6.8% year-to-date. On Slide 15, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the third quarter. US Personal Banking revenues were up 3%, driven by NII growth of 2% and lower partner payments. Branded cards revenues increased 8% with interest-earning balances growth of 8% as payment rates continued to normalize and we continue to see growth in spend volume, which were up 3%. Retail services revenues were down 1% due to a slowing growth rate in interest-earning balance. Retail banking revenues decreased 8%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. Expenses decreased 1%, driven by continuous productivity focus, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was $1.9 billion, largely driven by net credit losses and a modest build for volume growth. We continue to expect branded cards to be in the 3.5% to 4% NCL range for the full year. In Retail Services, we continue to expect to be around the high end of the 5.75% to 6.25% range for the full year, driven by both the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as well as lower sales activity at our partners. Average deposits decreased 23%, largely driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposit to our wealth business. USPB generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $522 million with an RoTCE of 8.2% for the quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. As we've said before, the USPB segment creates a lot of value for the firm. We knew 2024 would be a tough year as we lap the credit costs, but we have a path to higher returns. We will continue to drive revenue growth through product innovation while improving the operating efficiency of the business and at the same time, we expect the credit environment to normalize, all of which will ultimately drive USPB to a high-teens return over the medium term. On Slide 16, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 18%, primarily driven by closed, exits and winddowns as well as margin compression on mortgage securities that have extended. Expenses were down 5% as the reduction from closed, exits and winddowns was partially offset by a legal reserve. And cost of credit was $289 million, largely driven by net credit losses and an ACL build in Mexico. Slide 17 shows our full-year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance. We generated $61.6 billion of revenue year-to-date, driven by NIR ex-markets growth of 12%, and are on track to meet our $80 billion to $81 billion full year guidance. As I mentioned, we now expect NII ex-markets to be slightly down for the full year. And with year-to-date expenses of $40.4 billion, excluding the FDIC special assessment and Civil Money Penalties, we continue to expect to be on the higher end of our full year guidance range. As we take a step back, the third quarter represents another quarter of solid progress, and a set of proof points towards improving firm-wide and business performance. We remain focused on continuing to improve our performance and executing on our transformation. These priorities remain critical to strengthening our operations and becoming a more efficient, agile, and client-centric company as we continue to make progress on achieving our medium-term targets. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. Yes, sure. Why don't I take that? Good morning, Glenn. So a couple of things. So one, I think that on Retail Services, you're seeing a couple of things kind of play out. So one, you're seeing kind of spend volumes trend down a bit. You are seeing payment rates come down as well. That obviously is fueling the average interest-earning balanced growth that we're seeing. And then you're also seeing with the spend volume come down, there's a denominator effect that plays through, which pushes up obviously the loss rates that we -- that we're seeing. That still in the quarter is in line with our guidance. But in light of what we saw earlier in the year and normal seasonality, we'd expect that number to be on the higher end of that range and likely higher in the fourth quarter. But the higher in the fourth quarter again depends on what traffic is like and what the holiday spending season looks like through the end of the year. I would say the reserve levels we have are very healthy as it relates to this portfolio. I think in the back of the deck, we show kind of the reserve-to-loan ratio at about 11.7% or so. So well reserved for the Retail Services portfolio in light of the environment that we're in. Similarly, we are seeing the stabilization from a delinquency point-of-view across both portfolios kind of play through. And so, net-net, we are, obviously, actively managing this. The retail partner activity is a critical component of it and that will drive fourth quarter activity or levels, but we do feel as if we'll end up on the higher end of the range here. Yes. So when you look at Slide 7, you got a couple of things playing through. So your point around that the low number, the low $11.46 in the second quarter, that really is a combination relative to first quarter FX translation, some seasonally lower card balances, and lower interest payments in Argentina playing through that sequential 1Q to 2Q. The third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, is really a byproduct of volumes on the lending side and spreads, deposit spreads in services, and wealth. I think that I've already given kind of the guide for the fourth quarter where that is likely to be flat. But I think it's important to just remind everyone of the headwinds and tailwinds that play through this NII line. And from a tailwind point-of-view, I would expect to see continued volume from loans, and USPB in particular, but also services and we're talking ex-markets of services. I'd also expect to see continued benefit from the reinvestment of securities at higher yields. And then we're actively managing beta as it relates to with our clients. And if you think about kind of what we saw in the uptick of rates, we're actively managing that on the downtick as it relates to our institutional clients. I think the other point here is, let's not forget that our interest-rate sensitivity skews more towards non-US. And so a lot of what we think about and talk about tends to be how US rates move and the betas around that. We're still going to have a bit of beta catch-up outside of the US and so that's one of the headwinds there as well as the legacy franchise exits. So you've got this long-winded way of saying, I do expect flat into the fourth quarter. I'm not going to give guidance for 2025. But what I will say is to keep the growth momentum to get to our medium-term targets, that's 4% to 5% of a CAGR and that's going to be a combination of NII and NIR, but skewing NIR, and I want to point that out because the third quarter and the year-to-date numbers that you see in our performance shows very strong fee NIR growth across each of these five businesses. And I don't want to lose sight of that as you all really try to get a handle on how we get to that medium-term. We're evidencing that shift towards more fee revenue as we speak. So I'll stop there, but I think that's important and hopefully, I've answered your question around the NII forecast here. Thanks, Mike. So why don't I start with your expense question and then I'm sure Jane will chime in on some of the other parts of your question? So look, we put out medium-term targets of $51 billion to $53 billion in 2026, revenue dependent, of course, and that's with the -- consistent with the target we gave of less than 60% efficiency ratio. And we've got a target this year, as you know, on the high-end of $53.8 billion. And so we've got to get from $53.8 billion down to $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026. I'm not giving guidance for 2025, but you can expect that would probably likely glide down to that number. What's driving the reduction? So we've talked before about $1.5 billion in savings, largely related to the restructuring and driving down headcount reduction associated with that. We talked about another $500 million to $1 billion related to expense reductions from eliminating stranded cost. As we continue to exit, we're out of nine of these consumer countries already. And we talk about starting to see efficiencies and benefits from the investments in the transformation and technology towards the end of 2026. And those are the three drivers that are important for us to continue to realize between now and 2026. Will there be headwinds? Yes, there will be. The transformation is a multi-year process. We're also investing in risk and controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations. Of course, there'll be headwinds, but there will also be things that we shift away from. There'll be tailwinds associated with it. Jane mentioned some of the productivity efforts that both Andy as well as Vis are pushing on. You look across these businesses and you see positive operating leverage across the board. So that means that Andy Morton, as well as Gonzalo are too looking at their cost structures at expenses that they can take out or productivity that they might improve. And so there will be additional costs that we have to incur. We incurred additional costs this year, but there also be additional productivity savings that we've continue to tease out to ensure that we get to these targets. Yes. So again, we don't have -- we're not talking about issues as it relates to client information, client data or client reporting. We're not talking about information as it relates to financials. We're talking about regulatory reporting, all right, in regular reported reporting, as I've mentioned in prior calls, we're a global firm. We've got over 11,000 regulatory reports. And we're talking about ensuring that the data that we capture at trade entry is the data that's required to ultimately show up on these various regulatory reports in the way that we need it, ensuring that we've got the proper controls on that front-end. So we don't do -- we don't have to do a lot of the reconciliation and management and manual adjustments to that data in order to get it how we need it in the report and ensuring that we have standardized rules and controls around that process so that we can do it as efficiently as possible. But this is largely around ensuring that we improve those regulatory reports that we have to produce by starting with the underlying data that's required to do that. Yes. So let's take it in pieces. So I think the first thing is that, I think Jane and I have been very consistent with trying to give guidance on full year performance for the past couple of years. And we've largely actually delivered on that guidance. If you look at the top-line growth since Investor Day, it's largely consistent with what we talked about in the medium term. If you looked at the expense guidance that we've given, largely consistent with that, including this year, even if I -- even as I look at the $80 billion to $81 billion revenue guidance we gave for the year and you look at the $60.6 billion that we've done year-to-date and you think about what we have to deliver in order to hit that target, that is achievable, particularly when you remember that we had a large Argentina devaluation last year. That fee momentum required in the fourth quarter is very achievable. And we believe that we will obviously hit the high end of the range for 2024. As I think about that outer year period and the guidance that we gave there, look, you all want proof points before you actually believe that we can deliver on that medium-term target. I'm pointing you to proof points. I'm hopeful that as you see those proof points through 2024, full year and each of the quarters that you will start to believe in that revenue momentum that's required in the medium term. The fee revenue is a very good indicator. What we delivered this year and this quarter is a very good indicator of the momentum we should see across these businesses in the next couple of years. I also hope that you would then see that as we deliver on the expense target that we have a path to continuing to deliver on the medium-term expense target, the drivers of which I mentioned earlier. Yes, if revenues come in short of the target that we've set for ourselves, you would naturally expect for the volume and transaction-related expenses and compensation expenses to come down in a commensurate way with that revenue decline. And you would also expect that we would look to see if there are other productivity opportunities that we can tease out in order to still deliver on that operating efficiency target that we've set for ourselves. Yes. Look, the main driver of our DTA utilization will be driving higher income in the US. That's going to be the major driver. And as we think about -- so as you think about each of the strategies that Jane has described for our business, you will often hear the importance of winning in the US. You'll hear it as it relates to banking and the activity that we saw, the strong performance we saw this quarter in [indiscernible] world, you hear it as it relates to the wealth business and the importance of us growing investments, particularly in North America. You see it in USPB, which is largely a US-focused business. That DTA utilization is about us increasing net income or higher net income in the US and as we work to execute on our client-driven strategy, we are looking for opportunities to do that. We're incenting the business to drive that momentum. And that's what's going to give us a higher utilization on a quarter-by-quarter in the coming years. Good morning. Yes. In terms of the second part of your question, a couple of things. So one, we've been seeing good growth in our Mexico consumer business. We've also been investing in it appropriately so to make sure that we protect the strength of that franchise as we prepare it for separation and ultimately for the IPO. Erika, if I understood your question right, if you turn to Page 16 of the deck in the bottom right-hand side, we show the P&L for Mexico consumer for 2022 and 2023. And so you can see the contribution from a revenue and expense point-of-view, it's about $1.5 billion in 2023. And I believe we probably -- I think it's about $4 billion or so of TCE that we have associated with this business. So that gives you some sense for the contribution, but it continues to perform quite well as we manage it through the -- through this process. Okay. There's a lot there, but thank you. Thank you for the question. I would like to see the stock reacting much more favorably because this really has been a strong quarter for us. And in fact, as you mentioned, NII, when you look through it, we've in fact taken our NII guidance up just a tad bit as we referenced that the full year would be slightly down versus modestly down with the fourth quarter that's flat to the third quarter. And so that is an important takeaway. I mentioned the headwinds and tailwinds earlier and we shouldn't lose sight of those. We will get a lift from reinvesting the securities as those mature, we will continue to see volume growth and those are important drivers of tailwind activity for us. You rightfully mentioned our interest rate exposure analysis that we do on a quarterly basis that reflects the asset sensitivity of our business. And last quarter, it was about $1.6 billion, or so of a negative, assuming a 100 basis point decline across the curve, assuming a static balance sheet, and cross currencies. And as you look at that asset sensitivity, again, you rightfully pointed out that we skew non-US in terms of the magnitude of that decline in NII, should we see that parallel shift. And in fact, it's as much as $1.3 billion, or so of that $1.6 billion is non-US dollar related across 60 currencies. And so you'd have to see all of that move in tandem for that drag. And the US dollar drag is about $300 million, assuming a 100 basis point shift, and that's been coming down. If you look back over the quarters, we've been thoughtfully managing that down and that's down to about a $300 million number. I would expect when we print the third quarter too, it will be down a bit more. And so again, we are asset-sensitive, but it does skew outside of the US, and thank you for asking the question because I think it's important to remind our investors and analysts of that dynamic, which in many ways may be different from that of other institutions. In terms of the late fees, we did say that we were including late fees in our assumptions and our outlook that we've given. I'll state the obvious, Erika, which is that we want people to obviously paid on time and we do everything that we can to assist and ensure that they do that. With that said, we don't have a definitive timeline on late fees, nor are we overly reliant on late fees to drive revenue for our firm. And so it looks like that decisioning will likely kind of fall closer to sometime in 2025. And so there is a small adjustment in the last quarter of our revenue forecast, but it's inside of the guidance that we gave and doesn't materially change that in any way. And then the last part of your question, I think, was around NIR and the fee revenue. And as I mentioned earlier, I'm not going to give guidance for 2025, but I think your question was around where are we likely to see continued momentum as it relates to fee revenue growth. And I'd start with services, which with fees were up some 33% year-over-year. And yes, we should adjust for the Argentine peso devaluation. But even if you adjust for that, it's double-digit, 11% year-over-year non-interest revenue growth. And when you look at those drivers, they've been consistently strong, cross-border transaction value up 8%, US dollar clearing volume up 7%, commercial card spend up 8%. In the supplement, you'll see that it's mid-to-high single-digit year-to-date growth across those KPIs as well. We expect that will continue with our corporate clients and as we bring on new commercial clients as well. I'll turn you to -- if you look at Banking, we talked about already, so I won't kind of lean into that too much, but except to highlight a really strong quarter in Banking, in investment banking fees, in particular, the rebound that we've been talking about, but importantly, us capturing share in that rebound and these important partnerships that position us well as sponsors start to lean back into the market, the investments that we've been making in talent and sectors we need to strengthen, all of those things are going to play to continued fee momentum as we go into 2025. Wealth, again, really strong performance this quarter with revenues up 9%. But look at the client investment assets up 24%. The client balance is up 14%. That's driving fee momentum and it's a keen area of focus for Andy and that team that he's pulled together and it's a real opportunity for us given the $5 trillion or so of assets that our clients hold away from us and we're better positioning ourselves to capture that. And then finally, you can see kind of continued momentum on USPB. But it's across-the-board is what I'm saying, Erika, in terms of that fee momentum, and it is important. It's an important aspect as we think about getting to those medium-term targets in that 4% to 5% revenue. Good morning. Yes, sure. So I mean, so obviously, USPB is a combination of the cards businesses that we have in the retail banking business and that cards portfolio has both branded as well as retail services as part of it. And even within branded, we have proprietary cards where we frankly have been looking to how we can come up with new innovative products. So an example of product innovation is the recent refresh that we did of our Strata Premier Card, which was designed to drive acquisition and engagement with a new rewards offering. And with that acquisitions are up some 7% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for branded cards. So that's an example of product innovation. Another one is we also launched Flex Pay at Costco a few quarters ago, and you can see good installment loan growth as a consequence of that, up some 15% or so. And so that type of product creation is important to acquisitions. It's important to ensuring the card stays top of wallet and important to kind of driving some of that top-line performance. And then the other thing that I mentioned, you're right, was around cost of credit and that really is the continued normalization of cost of credit. I mentioned a couple of times now the idea that multiple vintages are maturing at the same time and that's kind of -- that has to play through and us to -- for us to kind of see a more normal level of credit. And that will be important to the returns. And again, we are starting to see stabilization in both the cost of credit line, but also in delinquencies and that's a good indicator for us. Yes. There's nothing -- it's a mix of kind of different asset classes and clients that we've lent against. There's nothing material or significant in that number when you look at the non-accrual loans, that ratio is still 31 basis points. So it's a mix change of our exposures, but nothing material there. Yes. So that number was a combination of restructuring charges and severance charges or repositioning charges. And we break out obviously restructuring so that you can see those. And this restructuring component was largely driven by the org simplification. That will be done this year. The normal severance or repositioning charges that we take as a normal course of BAU, you'd expect that to occur in any year and it certainly will be part of 2025 and 2026 going forward. We did have some this quarter. I would expect that we will have some next quarter, but I don't see us being outsider by any stretch, the range that I gave and again the range was for the combination of both. And there's no hard rule on -- Sorry, go ahead. Sure. It's a small amount. And if you look in the back of the deck, we have a page on Russia exposure, it's related to that. Well, it's the way we treat the exposure there. We're following kind of the guidelines on how we need to treat exposures in the country that we aren't able to distribute to clients, but we actually have to hold on their behalf. And so we have to book a reserve associated with that. And so we do that. We obviously show on the page what the exposure is in the event of a loss of control and you can kind of see how that ultimately nets out, but we're following the appropriate guidelines for what's required to for reserves of that nature. Yes. There are a couple of things kind of to keep in mind on the Services business. So one is, obviously this is a client business, it's not just a deposit-taking business. And so how we think about pricing to those clients becomes really important. You've got the US and non-US dynamic that's playing through, where for institutional clients, we've largely been holding to the higher betas that we saw as rates have ticked up again with the relationship in mind and we have some offsetting pressure outside of the US as those betas kind of catch-up. But I think importantly, you also heard me mentioned the reinvestment into securities at higher yields and that reinvestment or those higher yields ultimately play out through the businesses. And so that will show up as part of kind of NII as we think about services, but the other businesses as well. And so those are important components of the NII story for services. I think when you look at the end quarter performance and NII is down 5%, a big part of that is driven by the Argentina high -- lower or rates movement in the quarter versus last year. So lower rates we're earning in Argentina playing through that line, particularly in this quarter. If you adjusted for that on the NII line, it would be flat to slightly a little bit better. So that's really what it is. It's kind of management of client relationships as well as the higher earnings on reinvested securities contributing to that as well as volume from operating account growth that we expect. Yes. Again, I don't want to get into 2025 at this stage. I mean, I assure you we will give more color and commentary on that as we get into the fourth quarter earnings in January. What I will say, again, as you think about these businesses we do see continued top-line -- we do expect continued top-line momentum. We've had eight consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in USPB of 49% this quarter. So we're managing the expense base well. We think there's more upside to the top line. We're really focused on growth across the portfolios. And I do think that cost of credit, again, if for no other reason, but the compounding effect of those vintages maturing as well as kind of inflation starting to come off, rates trickling down, that should be better for the consumer and should start to play out in both the macroeconomic scenarios that we run for CECL purposes, but also ultimately in delinquencies and NCLs. And we're starting to see that improvement in delinquencies and its stabilization already somewhat. So I don't want to get into guidance, but that's kind of how I think about the drivers or contributors to improve returns over the medium term. I think your question is helpful in the sense that you said, is it kind of a rethink on our approach or is it the need to spend more money? And one of the things that we've done, Mike, is take a step back and look at how we've been approaching data, for example. So this is -- and we are going to make -- we have made some changes to our approach. And those changes relate to how we get after resolving data issues that are identified, ensuring that there is engagement from the front-end business from the functions that are most relevant and that there's consideration for what's required on reg reporting, in order for us to get that process, streamlined and correct. And so there is -- there are aspects of this that require a change in our approach and we've been taking that change and making that change rather, and we'll make more changes accordingly as we've taken that step back. And then the other -- and there are aspects of it that require at a minimum review of what is causing either the delay or us not moving at the pace that we'd like to or that we'd like to move or that our regulators would like. And that is in fact what the resource review plan was that was in the amended consent order. It was basically a statement saying that you need to ensure that you have sufficient resources and that they're allocated towards achieving the timely and sustainable compliance. And so part of our process is in fact that taking a regular review of what is on track in the way of our milestones and deliverables, where we see things that are being delayed or going red, what is the underlying root cause for why? Is it a resource issue where we need to put more dollars and people or technology to it? Is it a process issue where we need to reconsider our approach? And on the other side of that root cause, taking action to fix it. And so your question is spot-on. The answer is that in many instances, it will be a little bit of both. But importantly, our processes include that type of analysis and assessment so that we can get after the execution on this in an effective way. I hope that helps."

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJenn Landis: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, let me first address the regulatory actions by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Controller of the Currency, which were announced on Wednesday. These actions pertain to the consent orders we entered into with both agencies in 2020. And those orders covered four primary areas: risk management, data governance, controls, and compliance. Addressing these areas is the primary goal of our transformation, our number one priority. It is a multi-year effort to modernize our infrastructure, unify disparate tech platforms, and automate processes and controls. This week's actions focused primarily on data quality management. We've been public this year about the fact that we were behind in this particular area and that we had increased our investment as a result. The regulatory actions consisted of two civil money penalties and under the amended consent order with the OCC, a new process designed to ensure we're allocating sufficient resources to meet our remediation milestones and that is called the Resource Review Plan. We are currently developing a plan for submission to the OCC. Now by way of background, while the Federal Reserve is the primary regulator for Citigroup, our bank holding company, the OCC is a primary regulator for Citibank, N.A., we call it CBNA, which is our largest banking vehicle with approximately 70% of our assets. The amended consent order with the OCC allows CBNA to continue paying to Citigroup at a minimum the dividends necessary for debt service, preferred dividends and other non-discretionary obligations. While we're developing and seeking OCC consent for our Resource Review Plan, dividend amounts above that would require the OCC's non-objection. Now these dividends are intercompany payments that are made from CBNA ultimately to the parent Citigroup. They should not be confused with the common dividends Citigroup pays to its shareholders. Indeed, there is no restriction on Citigroup's ability to pay common dividends to shareholders, nor is there a restriction to buying back shares. And let me be very clear, even with the investments needed for our transformation, Citigroup has more than sufficient resources to also invest in our businesses and make the planned return of capital to our shareholders. We will increase our dividend from $0.53 to $0.56 a share as we announced in late June and we will resume modest buybacks this quarter. While these actions were not entirely unexpected to us, it is no doubt disappointing for our investors and for our people. We completely understand that. At the same time, we're confident in our ability to get these specific areas where they need to be, as we have been able to do in other areas of the transformation. And we are pleased that it was acknowledged on Wednesday that we have made meaningful progress in executing our transformation and simplifying our firm. A multi-year undertaking such as this was never going to be linear, but I can assure you, the investments we have been making are starting to come together to reduce risk, improve controls and deliver very tangible outcomes. The tech investments we have made are making a difference. We have reduced the time it takes to book loans, automated controls for our traders to reduce errors, move risk analytics to a cloud-based infrastructure, and increase the resiliency of our platforms to reduce downtime. The changes to our organization and our culture are making a difference. We have eliminated managerial constructs and layers, whilst empowering our leaders. We introduced new tools to better manage human capital needs. Our focus on culture has increased accountability and attracted great new talent such as Vis Raghavan, Tim Ryan, and Andy Sieg. You have my and the entire management team's commitment that we will address any area of the consent order where we are behind by putting the necessary resources and focus behind it. We will get this work where it needs to be as we have with the execution of our strategy and the simplification of our organization. Now, turning to what was another good quarter, our results show the relentless focus we have in executing our strategy as we continue to drive towards our medium-term return target. We reported net income of $3.2 billion with an earnings per share of $1.52 and an RoTCE of 7.2%. Revenues were up 4% overall as well as up in each of our five core businesses, where all but one had positive operating leverage. Expenses were down 2% year-over-year. The steps we're taking to simplify our organization, right-size businesses such as Markets and Wealth, and reduce stranded costs are beginning to take hold even as we increase investment in our transformation. Over the medium-term, we expect these simplification and stranded cost actions to drive $2 billion to $2.5 billion in annual run rate saves. Services grew 3%, driven by solid fee growth, which we have prioritized. TTS saw increased activity in cross-border payments and in commercial cards. Security services was up 10% with new client onboarding, deepening with existing clients and market valuations, helping increase our assets under custody by a preliminary 9%. At our recent Services Investor Day, we very much enjoyed the opportunity to talk to you in-depth about how we're going to continue to grow this high-returning business. And we're very pleased that people are starting to recognize why we describe it as our crown jewel. Overall, Markets had a strong finish to the quarter, leading to better performance than we'd anticipated. Fixed income was slightly down year-on-year due to lower FX and rates, but we had good issuance and loan growth in financing and securitization, an area which generates attractive returns. Equities was up 37%, driven by strong performance in derivatives, which includes a gain on the Visa B exchange offer. Banking was up 38%, as the wallet rebound gained some momentum and we again grew share. Our clients continued to access debt capital markets with investment-grade issuance near-record levels. Equity issuance increased, particularly in convertibles, as companies wait for a fuller opening of the IPO window. Investment banking fees were up 63% versus the prior year, and we've seen some healthy volumes associated with announced deals year-to-date, particularly in natural resources and technology. Combined with the strong pipeline, advisory activity looks promising as we think about the rest of the year [Technical Difficulty]. Wealth is starting to improve. Growth in client investment assets drove stronger investment revenue, especially in Citigold, and was up a preliminary 15%. Our focus on rationalizing the expense base is also starting to pay off with expenses down 4%. Andy and his team continue to attract top talent from the industry, as they focus on our investments business and on enhancing the client experience. US Personal Banking saw revenue growth of 6% with all three businesses again contributing to the top-line. There was good revolving balance and loan growth in both branded cards and retail services, and we continue to see differentiation in the credit segment with the lower-income customers seeing pressure. Retail banking benefited from higher mortgage loans and improved deposit spreads, while delivering strong referrals to Wealth. Overall, while we saw operating margin expansion, our poor returns were pressured by the combination of credit seasonality and the normalization of certain vintages. We certainly expect USPB's returns to improve from here. The recent stress tests again showcased the strength of our balance sheet. Our CET1 ratio now stands at 13.6% and we expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1, given the reduction of our stress capital buffer. Our tangible book value per share grew to $87.53. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion in capital to our common shareholders and we are increasing our dividend by 6%. We expect to buy back $1 billion in common shares this quarter, and we will continue to assess the level of buybacks on a quarterly basis, particularly given the uncertainty around the Basel III endgame. Looking at the macro environment as we enter the second half of the year, US is still the world's most structurally sound economy. After a break in progress, inflation now appears back on a downward trajectory. Services spending has remained on an upward trend, although there are clear signs of a softening labor market and the tightening of the consumer budget. And, of course, you might have heard there is an election in November. In Europe, while rate cuts have begun, the region's lack of competitiveness continues to be a drag on growth. In Asia, China is growing moderately, albeit with government stimulus, and their pivot to high-tech manufacturing is being challenged by tariffs on EVs and semiconductors. Despite this uncertainty, as you saw at our Services Investor Day when we went through our performance over the last two years, our business model can produce good results in a wide variety of macro environments and there is plenty of upside for us across our five businesses. We have made an incredible amount of progress in simplification, both strategically and organizationally. We've completed most of the exits of our international consumer markets. We streamlined our organization to catalyze agility and faster decision-making. We are modernizing our infrastructure to improve our client service, and we are automating processes to strengthen controls. We are on a deliberate path. We will continue to execute our transformation and our strategy so we can meet our medium-term targets and then continue to further improve our returns over time. With that, let me turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions.\nMark Mason: Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the business. On Slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.52 and RoTCE of 7.2% on $20.1 billion of revenue. Total revenues were up 4%, driven by growth across all businesses as well as an approximate $400 million gain related to the Visa B exchange offer. A significant portion of this gain is reflected in equity markets with the remainder reflected in all other. Expenses were $13.4 billion, down 2% and 6% on a sequential basis. The combination of revenue growth and expense decline drove positive operating leverage for the firm and the majority of our businesses. Cost of credit was $2.5 billion, primarily driven by higher card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases and all businesses except USPB, where we built for loan growth. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion of total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. On Slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. This quarter, we reported expenses of $13.4 billion, down 2% and 6% sequentially, which includes the $136 million civil money penalties imposed by the Fed and OCC earlier this week. The decrease in expenses was primarily driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification, stranded cost reductions, and lower repositioning costs, partially offset by continued investment in transformation and the Fed and the OCC penalty. As we said over the past few months, we will continue to invest in the transformation and technology to modernize our operations and risk and control infrastructure. We expect these investments to offset some of our sales and headcount reduction going forward. However, based on what we know today, we will likely be at the higher end of the expense guidance range, excluding the FDIC special assessment and the civil money penalties. With that said, we will, of course, continue to look for opportunities to absorb the civil money penalties. Before going into the balance sheet and the business results for the quarter, I'd like to also give more color on the transformation and address what the Fed and OCC announced Wednesday. We've made good progress on our transformation in certain areas over the last few years, and I want to highlight some of those areas before discussing the announcement. First, wholesale credit and loan operations, where we implemented a consistent end-to-end operating model and consolidated multiple systems with enhanced technology, this has not only reduced risk, but enhanced operating efficiency and the client experience. We've also made improvements in risk and compliance as we enhanced our risk assessment and technology capabilities to increase automation for monitoring. And in data, while there's a lot more to do, we stood up a data governance process and streamlined our data architecture to ultimately facilitate straight-through processing. Overall, we've improved risk management and consolidated and upgraded systems and platforms to improve our resiliency. These efforts represent meaningful examples of how we're making progress against our transformation milestones. That said, we have fallen short in data quality management, particularly related to regulatory reporting, which we've acknowledged publicly since the beginning of the year. As such, we've begun to put additional investments and resources in place to not only address data quality management related to regulatory reporting and data governance, but also stress-testing capabilities, including DFAST and Resolution and Recovery. We also reprioritized our efforts to ensure we're focused on data that impact these reports first. We take this feedback from our regulators very seriously and we're committed to allocating all the resources necessary to meet their expectations. Now, turning back to the quarterly results. On Slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans, where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the second quarter, net interest income was roughly flat. Excluding Markets, net interest income was down 3%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation, seasonally lower revolving card balances, and lower interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher deposit spreads in Wealth. Average loans were roughly flat as growth in cards and Mexico consumer was largely offset by slight declines across businesses. And average deposits decreased by 1%, largely driven by seasonal outflows and transfers to investments in Wealth as well as non-operational outflows in TTS. On Slide 10, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite framework. Across our card portfolios, approximately 86% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. And while we continue to see an overall resilient US consumer, we also continue to see a divergence in performance and behavior across FICO and income bands. When we look across our consumer clients, only the highest income quartile has more savings than they did at the beginning of 2019, and it is the over 740 FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and maintaining high payment rates. Lower FICO bands customers are seeing sharper drops in payment rates and borrowing more as they are more acutely impacted by high inflation and interest rates. That said, as we will discuss later, we're seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance across our cards portfolio. And we've taken this all into account in our reserving and we remain well reserved with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 8.1% for our total card portfolio. Our corporate portfolio is largely investment-grade at approximately 82% as of the second quarter, and we saw a nearly $500 million sequential decrease in corporate non-accrual loans, largely driven by upgrades and repayments. Additionally, this quarter, we saw an improvement in our macro assumptions driven by HPI, oil prices, and equity market valuations. And our credit loss reserves continues to incorporate a scenario weighted-average unemployment rate of nearly 5% and a downside unemployment rate of nearly 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves that we have in the current environment. Turning to Slide 11, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital, and liquidity. It is this strength that allows us to support clients through periods of uncertainty and volatility. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy, and diversified business model. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well-diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types. The majority of our deposits are corporate at $807 billion and span 90 countries. And as you heard at the Services Investor Day, most of these deposits are held in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world, making them operational in nature and therefore very stable. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $404 billion are well-diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail, and Wealth at Work offering, as well as across regions and products. Of our total deposits, 68% are US dollar-denominated with the remainder spanning over 60 currency. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework. Our $688 billion loan portfolio is well-diversified across consumer and corporate loans, and about one-third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high-quality short-duration investment securities that contribute to our approximately $900 billion of available liquidity resources. We continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities, which position us to be a source of strength for the industry and importantly for our clients. On Slide 12, we show a sequential walk to provide more detail on the drivers of our CET1 ratio this quarter. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 130 basis points or approximately $15 billion above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. We expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1, which incorporates the reduction in our stress capital buffer from 4.3% to the indicative SCB of 4.1% we announced a couple of weeks ago. We were pleased to see the improvement in our DFAST results and the corresponding reduction in our SCB. That said, even with the reduction, our capital requirement does not yet fully reflect our simplification efforts, the benefits of our transformation or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to reduce our capital requirements over time. And as a reminder, we announced an increase to our common dividend from $0.53 per share to $0.56 per share following the SCB result. And as Jane mentioned earlier, we plan on doing $1 billion of buybacks this quarter. So now turning to Slide 13. Before I get into the businesses, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, we implemented a revenue-sharing arrangement within Banking and between Banking, Services and Markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing is included in the all other line for each business in our financial supplement. In Services, revenues were up 3% this quarter, reflecting continued underlying momentum across both TTS and security services. Net interest income was down 1%, largely driven by lower earnings on our net investment in Argentina, partially offset by the benefit of higher US and non-US interest rates relative to the prior-year period. Non-interest revenue increased to 11%, driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers as well as a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. The underlying growth in both businesses is a result of our continued investment in product innovation, client experience, and platform modernization that we highlighted during our Services Investor Day last month. Expenses increased 9%, largely driven by an Argentina-related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense, and continued investments in product innovation and technology. Cost of credit was a benefit of $27 million, driven by an ACL release in the quarter. Average loans were up 3%, primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance, particularly in Asia, as well as working capital loans to corporate in commercial clients in Latin America and Asia. Average deposits were down 1%, driven by non-operating deposit outflows. At the same time, we continue to see good operating deposit inflows. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion, and Services continues to deliver a high RoTCE coming in at 23.8% for the quarter. On Slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the second quarter. Market revenues were up 6%. Fixed income revenues decreased 3%, driven by rates and currencies, which were down 11% on the back of lower volatility and tighter spreads. This was partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed income, which was up 20%, primarily driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization in underwriting fees. In addition to a benefit from the Visa B exchange offer, we continue to see good underlying momentum in equity, primarily driven by equity derivatives, and we continue to make progress in prime with balances up approximately 18%. Expenses decreased 1%, driven by productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was a benefit of $11 million as an ACL release more than offset net credit loss. Average loans increased to 11%, largely driven by asset-backed lending and spread products. Average trading assets increased 12%, largely driven by client demand for treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated positive operating leverage, and delivered net income of approximately $1.4 billion, with an RoTCE of 10.7% for the quarter. On Slide 15, we show the results for Banking for the second quarter. Banking revenues increased 38%, driven by growth in investment banking and corporate lending. Investment banking revenues increased 60%, driven by strength across capital markets and advisory, given favorable market conditions. DCM continued to benefit from strong issuance activities, mainly in investment grade as issuers continued to derisk funding plans in advance of what could be a more volatile second half in the context of a number of important global elections as well as the macro environment. In ECM, excluding China A shares, we're seeing a pickup in IPO activity, led by the US as well as continued convertible issuance as issuers take advantage of strong equity market performance and expectations for rates to be higher for longer. And in advisory, we're seeing revenues from the relatively low announced activity in 2023 coming to fruition as those transactions close. Both year-to-date and in the quarter, we gained share across DCM, ECM, and advisory, particularly in technology, where we've been investing. Corporate lending revenues excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage again this quarter as expenses decreased 10%, primarily driven by actions taken to right-size the expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $32 million, driven by an ACL release, reflecting an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by net credit loss. Average loans decreased 4% as we maintain strict discipline around returns combined with lower overall demand for credit. Net income was $406 million, and RoTCE was 7.5% for the quarter. On Slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the second quarter. Wealth revenues increased 2%, driven by a 13% increase in NIR from higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by a 4% decrease in NII from higher mortgage funding costs. We continue to see good momentum in non-interest revenue as we benefited from double-digit client investment asset growth, both in North America and internationally, driven by net new client investment assets as well as market valuation. Expenses were down 4%, driven by the initial benefit of expense reductions as we right-sized the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $9 million as an ACL release more than offset net credit loss. Preliminary end-of-period client balances increased 9%, driven by higher client investment assets as well as higher deposits. Average loans were flat as we continue to optimize capital usage. Average deposits increased 2%, largely reflecting the transfer of relationships and associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. Client investment assets were up 15%, driven by net new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuation. Wealth generated positive operating leverage this quarter, and delivered net income of $210 million, with an RoTCE of 6.4% for the quarter. On Slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the second quarter. US Personal Banking revenues increased 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments. Branded cards revenues increased 8%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 9% as payment rates continue to moderate and we continue to see growth in spend volumes up 3%, primarily driven by customers with FICO scores of 740 or higher. Retail services revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by lower payments from Citi to our partners due to higher net credit losses and interest-earning balances grew 8%. Retail banking revenues increased 3%, driven by higher deposit spreads as well as mortgage and installment loan growth. USPB also generated positive operating leverage this quarter, with expenses down 2%, driven by lower technology and compensation costs, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit increased to $2.3 billion, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion and an ACL build of approximately $400 million, reflecting volume growth in the quarter. But let me remind you of the three things driving our NCLs this quarter. First, card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years are all maturing at the same time. These vintages were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. Second, we continue to see seasonally higher NCLs in the second quarter. Third, certain pockets of customers continue to be impacted by persistent inflation and higher interest rates resulting in higher losses. However, across both portfolios, we are seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance, but we will continue to watch the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as the year progresses. Despite these factors, we still expect branded cards to be in the 3.5% to 4% NCL range for the full year, and retail services to be at the high end of the range of 5.75% to 6.25%. Average deposits decreased 18% as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business more than offset the underlying growth. Net income was $121 million, and RoTCE for the quarter was 1.9%. As we said before, we will continue to take actions to manage through the regulatory headwind, lap the credit cycle, and grow revenue while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business to ultimately get to a high-teens return over the medium-term. On Slide 18, we show results for all other on a managed basis, which includes corporate/other and legacy franchises, and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 22%, primarily driven by the closed exit and winddowns and higher funding costs, partially offset by growth in Mexico as well as the impact from the Visa B exchange offer. And expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by closed exit and winddowns. Slide 19 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance, both of which remain unchanged. We continue to remain laser-focused on executing on our transformation and enhancing the business' performance. And while we recognize there's a lot more to do on transformation, we are pleased with the progress that we're making towards our 2024 and medium-term targets and remain committed to these targets. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Could you elaborate more on the amended consent order? Jane, you said it was disappointing to have gotten that this week. It's almost four years into the consent order. And a little bit why it hasn't been resolved? And what's on the -- that's the loss column, and maybe a little bit more on the win column too. I mean you have, what, 12,000 people thrown at the problem, billions of dollars. Is it not enough people? Not enough money? Is it -- do you need to look at it in a different way? Are you not talking the same language? I mean, you have John Dugan as your Lead Independent Director, exit of the OCC, and it seems like you got your report card, I guess you passed overall, they went out of the way to say some nice things, but it looks like you got failing grades and data and regulatory management. So, your confidence is going to be resolved, but it's already been four years and it hasn't been resolved. So, what is it going to take from here? And how can you resolve the regulatory concerns while continuing or serving shareholders better? And then, in the win column, since it's so nebulous this back-office, what are you achieving? You mentioned some items, but you could put more meat on those bones? Thanks.\nJane Fraser: Yes. Thank you, Mike. That's a few different parts of that. So, let's start by just taking a step back. Our transformation is addressing decades of underinvestment in large parts of Citi's infrastructure and in our risk and control environment. And when you unpack that, those areas where we had an absence of enforced enterprise-wide standards and governance, we've had a siloed organization that's prevented scale, a culture where a lot of groups are allowed to solve problems -- the same problem in different ways, fragmented tech platforms, manual processes and controls and a weak first-line of defense, too few subject matter experts. So, this is a massive body of work that goes well beyond the consent order. And this is not old Citi putting in band-aid. This is Citi tackling the root issues head-on. It's a multi-year undertaking as we've talked about and you saw the statement by one of our regulators this week, we have made meaningful progress on our transformation -- excuse me, and on our simplification. Mark, do you want to...\nMark Mason: Yeah. And so, what -- as Jane says, the progress that we -- that we've made, it spans multiple parts of the consent order and transformation work. Remember, that consent order and transformation work includes risk, it includes controls, it includes compliance, it includes data and data-related to the regulatory reporting. And we've got evidence and proof points of progress against all of those things.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Mark.\nMark Mason: Yes.\nJane Fraser: So, transforming -- to answer your question about how do we fix it and serve our investors at the same time, transforming Citi will drive benefits for our shareholders, our clients, and our regulators. This is not mutually exclusive. At the beginning of the year, we honed in on two priorities, the transformation and improving our business performance. And we're able to do so because we've largely cleared the decks. We have a clear focused strategy. We've executed the divestitures. We've got a much simpler organization, so we can focus on these two priorities and we are able to do both. You can see that in our results again this quarter, multiple solid proof points on the execution of the strategy and we know what we need to do on both fronts. We have plans in place on the transformation and on the strategy and we're executing against them. We have been and we will be transparent when we have issues and how we're addressing them.\nMark Mason: Yeah. And just to add a couple of data points to that, Mike, you've heard us mention some of these before, but we've retired platforms. We've reduced the number of data centers. Platforms are down some 300. We've moved from 39 corporate loan platforms down to south of 20. We've got 20 cash equities execution platforms down to one. We've reduced the six reporting ledgers down to one, 11 sanctioned platforms down to one. So, we've been making considerable progress over the past couple of years. With that said, there's a lot more work to be done around the data regulatory reporting work. If you think about Citi, we've got 11,000 global total reg reports, right? So, we've got to make sure that the data that's going into those reports is the quality of the data that we want it to be, but more importantly, that we're doing it efficiently that it doesn't take thousands of people to reconcile that information. And so, this is an end-to-end process in the way we're approaching it. One example is the 2052a liquidity report that we have. It has 750,000 lines of data, and that data is -- it's important again that we're efficiently collecting it from multiple systems with standards and governance that ensures that it's of the quality that we want it to be without again having to have manual activity supporting it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thank you. So, Mark, I heard your comments on credit this year -- I'm talking US Personal Banking. I heard your comments for credit for the rest of this year and I think in a position that you're very conservative reserves. But right now, you put up a 3% margin, credit costs are almost half of what revenues are in the space. I guess, my question is, as we roll forward, in a slowing economy with likely a little bit lower some rate cuts, how does the P&L evolve? How does it improve from here? Because can we be expecting credit cost to come in a slowing economy? I'm just trying to figure out the path forward because it could be impactful that USPB obviously marches to where you need it to be.\nMark Mason: Yeah. Look, like I said, we do think that there is certainly upside to USPB. We're looking for that upside in the medium-term targets that we've set for ourselves. You got to remember that when you look at the quarter and you look at the half, frankly that we're still in a period where we're seeing the normalization of the cost of credit. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a compounding [Technical Difficulty] now maturing at the same time that's playing through the P&L, that's not just true for us, that's true for others as well. And so, we'd expect and we are -- we do believe we're seeing some signs of a cresting when you look at delinquencies now. And so, we would expect that those losses start to normalize and loss rates start to come down as we go towards the medium-term. At the same time, we're investing in the business and we're looking to see continued growth in volume and on the top-line. And the combination of those things as we drive towards the medium-term will help us to deliver both the top-line growth and certainly improve returns from where we sit today and in-line with what we've guided to. So, it's a combination of top-line performance from volume, and obviously, the environment plays into that, but we feel like we've got a reasonable assumption around top-line growth there, cost of credit normalizing, continued discipline on the expense line, allowing for us to get improved returns across that USPB business.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. I appreciate all of that. And one quickie on DCM. You had amazingly good performance. There's been plenty of conversation about pull-forward this year on just refi driving like three quarters of the activity. Could you just help us think through the second half, when thinking about DCM and just to make sure that we don't like start modeling this into perpetuity?\nJane Fraser: Look, I think when we think about the back half of '24, we're going to see a different mix of activity in Banking. We do still expect demand to be quite strong across our capital market products because you've got a wall of maturing debt securities coming up in the second half that carry on for a couple of years. But we did see some clients accelerating issuances into the first half, getting ahead of potential market volatility. So, if you put it all together, I think we expect the rate environment and the financing markets to continue to be accommodative and as well as to a continued deal-making with M&A being a bit larger in the overall mix, although some of the regulatory elements have put a damper on part of that.\nMark Mason: Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that is, look, the wallet for the year is obviously going to depend on a couple of things. So, one, the return of a more normalized IPO market; two, the direction of volatility of interest rates; the ongoing global conflicts that we're all kind of seeing and witnessing; and then finally, as Jane mentioned in her remarks, the elections and what those outcomes look like, not just in the US but abroad. And so, there are a number of factors there that will play to the wallet, but as we said, we believe we're well-positioned to be there to serve our clients and to do so in a way that makes good economic sense.\nOperator: The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, good morning. Just Mark, maybe on NII down almost 4% year-over-year, it seems a little bit more than the guidance, but down modestly for the year. So, can you discuss sort of the puts and takes this quarter and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory for the rest of the year?\nMark Mason: Yeah. So, I'd say a couple of things. So, one, as I mentioned, in the quarter, and if you see it on Slide 9, ex-Markets were down about 3%. That's largely driven by some FX translation that played through, but also some seasonally lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in Argentina. And what that is in Argentina, we have capital there, the policy rate was adjusted downward, and as that happened, we obviously earn less on that capital that flows through the NII line. As I think about the back half of the year and the guidance we have of modestly down, there are a couple of puts and takes to keep in mind. So, one is going to be rates, right? So, as I think about the higher yield that we can earn on reinvestment, that will be a tailwind that plays through from an NII point of view. The second would be volume growth, particularly in our card loans portfolio. And we do expect to see continued volume growth across the -- certainly the branded portfolio and so that will be another tailwind for us on the NII line. In terms of the headwinds, you've got the lower NII earned in Argentina from rates that will continue to play through. We've got assumed higher average betas in 2024, specifically on the non-US side. We still have in our forecast the impact of CFPB late fee. So, assuming that that goes into effect for this year, that will have an impact and it's in the forecast. And then, the impact of lost NII from the exits that we have. And so, the combination of those things will probably mean that NII in the back half of the year is a little bit higher than the first half, but again, consistent with the guidance that we gave of modestly down.\nJim Mitchell: That's helpful. And maybe just quickly kind of a similar question on expenses, better-than-expected this quarter, but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges. I think to get to the high end of your range, you'd have to be up a little bit in the back half from 2Q run rate, is that because you expect more repositioning/restructuring in the second half, or maybe just talk through expense trajectory from here?\nMark Mason: Yeah. So that's right. When I talked about at the first quarter, I talked about kind of a downward trend for each of the quarters after Q1. The second quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting. I'm sticking with the guidance and that does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in -- will come in higher than the second quarter. That's a combination of a couple of things, including the pace of hiring and investment that we will do in the transformation work that has to be done. It also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our businesses across the firm and the franchise. And then, the second quarter did -- yes, the second quarter did have a one-time or so in some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter around advertising and marketing and some of the other line items. So, yes, the second quarter will -- the third and fourth quarter, the back half will be higher than the second quarter, but consistent with the guidance that I've given.\nOperator: The next question is from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi. I had two questions, and I'll ask the first one on expenses first since it's a good follow-up to the previous. Mark, just to clarify, let's just say take the highest end-of-year range at $53.8 billion, just trying to think about how consensus will move. So, we take that $53.8 billion and then add the $285 million of FDIC expenses year-to-date so far and add the civil money penalties of $136 million, so that gets us to $54.2 billion for the year and any other repositioning charges in the second half of the year would already be included in the $53.8 billion?\nMark Mason: So, yes, the answer to last part of your question is yes. So, in the range that I've given, $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, that includes our estimate for the full year of repositioning and any restructuring charges. That range excludes the FDIC special assessment that we saw earlier in the year and it excludes the CMP of $136 million.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And my second question is for Jane. I mean, I'm sure you're getting tired of the question on capital return. So you're buying back $1 billion -- you plan to buy back $1 billion this quarter. It looks like you didn't buy back any in the second quarter. And I'm asking this question in this context because consensus has a buyback of nearly $1 billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of next year and ramping higher. And I guess, is the $1 billion number a catch-up pace because you didn't buy back any in the second quarter? And I fully appreciate that you also have the Banamex IPO coming, which is different from peers that are also waiting for Basel clarification, but I'm just wondering, do we need to wait for that Banamex IPO for the company to feel comfortable moving away from that quarter-to-quarter guidance? And also, of course, I just want to readdress the beginning of the question when I asked specifically about the pace.\nJane Fraser: Okay. So, we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks. We are going to continue to give quarterly -- and make it a quarterly determination as to the level. And a lot of that is to do with the uncertainty about the forthcoming regulatory changes. I think we were delighted to see a slight reduction in our stress capital buffer, reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model and also good to see the benefits of our strategy playing out, but with the regulatory changes uncertain and we are -- that's one of the major factors for us to continue with the quarterly guidance.\nMark Mason: Yeah. That's right. On the first part of your question, Erika, I'd say, look, we were in discussions with our regulators and we made a prudent call as it relates to buybacks in the quarter for Q2 [Technical Difficulty] Q3, as we talked about would be at $1 billion and that should not be necessarily viewed as a run rate level. As Jane mentioned, we'll take it quarter-by-quarter from here.\nOperator: The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark.\nMark Mason: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Mark, regarding the comments you made about the higher credit losses, the three factors that you gave us, can you also talk about if this was a factor at all for you folks? Was there any FICO score inflation back during the pandemic that might be playing into these kind of credit losses? And as part of the credit card question, you mentioned the CFPB, the fees that you have factored them, the lower fees, you factor that into your forward look, where do we stand on that? Do you guys have any color on that as well?\nMark Mason: Yeah. So, on the first part of the question, look, we all kind of have talked about in the past the prospect of FICO inflation back during the COVID period of time. We've been very, very focused on ensuring that acquisitions that we've made have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get comfortable with the quality of new customers that we've been bringing on. In light of the environment, we have looked at moving towards higher FICO scores for new account acquisitions. But as I think about what we're seeing now, there is that dichotomy that I mentioned where we have the higher FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and that frankly have still continued strong balances in savings and it's really the lower FICO band customers where we're seeing the sharper drop in payment rates and more borrowing. And so, the FICO inflation has effectively kind of fizzled out when we look at the mix and dynamic of the customer portfolio that we have at this point. And in terms of the CFPB, late fees, well, I don't have an update on that. Like I said, we've built in an assumption in the -- in our forecast, but in terms of the timing, I don't have a formal update on the certainty of it.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Hey, thanks, good morning. Hey, Mark, talking about the NII outlook and the fact that now we've got a little bit of a discrepancy starting between US rates, maybe higher for longer, and then the beginnings of some of the non-US curves starting to at least put forth their first cut, I know we've got that good chart that you have in the Qs about the relative contributions, can you just help us understand a little bit of like just generally how you're thinking through that discrepancy and how that informs the difference between US-related NII and non-US-related NII as you go forward?\nMark Mason: Yeah, thank you. So look, I think that as we look at it out through the -- certainly through the medium-term, we expect to see continued NII growth at obviously a modest level, certainly lower than what we've seen historically. And that's in large part because -- or in-part, I should say, because of how we've been managing the balance sheet and that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a higher yield on them relative to what we were earning. In some instances, they were five-year terms on some of these investments. And so, we still think there's some upside from a reinvestment point of view. The point you make around kind of non-US dollar or US rates kind of coming off, that will play through a little bit as we think about the beta increases that we're expecting outside of the US. And so, we've assumed that we have higher betas pickup outside of the US. If rates kind of come off in a more substantive way, then we could see kind of a little less NII pressure than we're forecasting there. But net-net, as I think about the combination of volume growth that we're expecting between loans and deposits over that medium-term, the higher yield we can earn on our assets, combined with the pricing capabilities that we have across the portfolio, offsetting some of that beta, we believe will have continued NII growth. As I think about what I often point to in terms of the IRE analysis and you have to remember that, that is a shock to the current balance sheet and it assumes that the full curve is moving simultaneously across currencies. And in that case, the 100 basis point parallel shift downward would be a negative $1.6 billion, with about $1.3 billion of that coming from non-US dollar. But again, that does assume that all of those currencies come down at the same time and doesn't account for the rebalancing of the balance sheet and things that I mentioned like the reinvestment higher yields that we'd be able to earn.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Okay. And just one follow-up on the OCC amendment, and that's specifically related to the resource review plan. Do you have a line-of-sight on how long that will take you guys to finish because it seems like -- and is that what we should be thinking about in terms of just understanding like what side of what you need to get done in terms of the other language that's written in the order?\nJane Fraser: So, Ken, look, the Resource Review Plan is just that it's a plan to ensure that we have sufficient resources allocated towards achieving a timely and sustainable compliance with the order. Essentially, if an area is delayed or looking as if it could be, we'll determine what additional resourcing, if any, is required to get back on track, and then we'll share that with the OCC in a more formalized way than we do today. We obviously review this pretty constantly ourselves. We're already working on the plan after it's finalized with the OCC. So, it will be confidential supervisory information that we can't disclose. So, we won't be able to tell you that the plan is -- whether the plan -- what the nature of the plan is going to be, but it won't be much more complicated than what we talked about. And we're expecting to get it, we're not expecting this to take long.\nOperator: The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good afternoon.\nMark Mason: Hello.\nJane Fraser: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So, I know we talked a lot about expenses. I just have one kind of overarching question here, which is on how we should think about the path of expenses between now and the medium term as we have kind of come quite a long way in the simplification process, maybe if you could give us a sense as to how far along simplification impact on expenses we are? And overlapping with the regulatory requirements, do these net out or are we skewed a little bit more towards regulatory requirements being a bit heavier than what's left on simplification from here? Thanks.\nMark Mason: So, thank you, Betsy. I guess, I'd say a couple of things. So, I think we said it in the past, so the target for the medium-term, I think 2026 is somewhere around $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. As we've said, we'll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we've done and another $500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that medium-term period. And so, we've made, I think, very good headway, as Jane has mentioned in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that, those saves will -- have started to generate some of those saves in the early part of that, meaning this year will likely be offset by continued investment that we're making in areas of the business like transformation, but also in business-led or driven growth. And you should expect in terms of the trend that we would have a downward trend towards 2026 and achieving that range.\nJane Fraser: And I just want to reiterate, we remain confident that we will meet our 11% to 12% RoTCE target over the medium-term. And we've got the -- we have the ability to manage the different elements we've been talking about today, making sure that we're investing sufficient resources into the transformation, so we can be on-track with that, as well as in our businesses, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders. And so, we feel confident around that and good about that we can manage this.\nMark Mason: Yeah, I think that's a great point, Jane. Look, the reality is, as was pointed out earlier, we spent about $3 billion last year, a little bit under that on the transformation-related work. And the plan has called for us to spend a little bit more than that this year. And frankly, in the first half of the year, as we work through the transformation work and some of the things that Jane and I have mentioned earlier in the year that we've been focused on like data and data related to regulatory reporting, we've had to spend more than we had planned for in the first half, right? And we've done that and we funded that. We've been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidance that we've given for the full year. So, we are managing this entire expense base, right? So, not -- the whole $53-plus billion of it, we are actively managing that with an eye towards what's required from a transformation point of view to keep it on-track, to accelerate in areas where we're behind, and to shore up areas where we are tracking in accordance to what the order requires and where are there other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up the expense base. And so, things like the work that Andy Sieg has done with the finance team around that expense base and finding efficiencies there are opportunities that we've been able to tease out of the business. Things that we have done in parts of USPB and that we have continued to get up there in parts of Banking, which you see in the down 10% this quarter are areas where we've been keenly focused on, where are there duplicative roles, where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of. So, long-winded way of saying, we understand the expense guidance that we've given. We also understand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with what's required and we are doing both.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.\nOperator: The next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nVivek Juneja: Hi. Okay, let me just clarify this, Mark and Jane, just to make sure that we all have it right. The $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion does not include anything thus far on what you think you may need to spend on the Resource Review Plan, meaning what additional resources you would have to put to fix the consent order, am I right there?\nJane Fraser: No, you're not right. So, I think -- as you've heard us talk about, Vivek, for a while now that we knew the areas that we were behind in elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making the investments, some of that is in people, some of that is in our technology spend, it's using different tools and capabilities to get areas addressed earlier and we began that earlier in the year. And you saw that acknowledged as well by our regulators, who pointed to the fact that we've already begun addressing the areas that we're behind. Mark?\nMark Mason: That's right, Jane. What you have heard is that, despite having to spend more, some $250 million or so more, we're not changing the guidance, right? And so, we have -- as Jane mentioned, we have worked on areas already that we've needed to and we have looked for ways to absorb that and are doing so within our guidance.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. So, going forward, even though this plan is still to be sort of put together and approved by the regulators, we should not expect any change to this expense?\nMark Mason: Look, the plan -- the Resource Review Plan, as Jane mentioned, is what we're working through now with the regulators. That will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and allocating the appropriate resources to accomplishing the commitments that we have. Appropriate resources can range from people to technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution. If you think about what that will entail, it will entail areas where we are delayed or behind as we identify those areas, being able to tease out the root cause of any delay and ensure that we've got proper funding allocated to get it back on track. And that's me framing out how I think about what something like this might look like. And so, what we're saying is that, if we identify issues in the quarters to come that we haven't identified already, that's the process we're going to apply to those issues. And as you've heard us say repeatedly, we're going to spend whatever is necessary to then get those things back on track, and as we've done thus far this year, we're going to look for opportunities to absorb those headwinds. I hope that's clear.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatt O'Connor: Hi. Apologies if I missed it in the opening remarks, but what drove the decline in credit card revenues from 1Q to 2Q? It looks like they were down about 6% in aggregate even though average loans went up, spending went up. What was the driver of that?\nMark Mason: Credit card revenues seasonality...\nJane Fraser: Yeah. Seasonality...\nMark Mason: Seasonality playing through there.\nJane Fraser: Sequentially.\nMark Mason: Yeah, sequentially. Yeah.\nJane Fraser: I think if you look year-over-year, you'll be able to see a pretty common trend there. The consumer is slowing in some of the -- in the spend, as Mark had referred to Matt, but -- and a lot of the spending and the growth areas we are seeing and the underlying numbers is being driven by the affluent customer.\nMark Mason: Yeah, I think there's also the dynamic on the CRS of the reward -- across the portfolio of rewards playing through from one quarter to the other. So, the combination of those things are playing through the revenue line there.\nJane Fraser: But nothing that's particularly worrying us, Matt.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. And then, just separately on -- the very early kind of part of the prepared remarks, you talked about the dividends being capped in terms of what can be upstreamed from the bank to the holding company because of the OCC thing that came out this week. Like, for all intents and purposes, like does that impact how you run the company or subsidiary or impact liquidity or capital? I understood the comment, no change to dividends or buybacks at the holding company, but is there any impact from that, that we would notice on the outside? Thank you.\nJane Fraser: Look, the -- let's be clear. This action does not impact our ability to return capital to our shareholders. The dividends that are referenced are just intercompany payments from CBNA to the parents. So, first of all, don't confuse what a dividend is here. We will -- it's not going to impact how we run the company, the subsidiary, the capital or the liquidity at all, and the dividends are not capped.\nMark Mason: Yeah. I think the -- Jane, that's right. And I think let's not lose sight of the purpose of the orders that are there. And the purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that we're funding and allocating the effort appropriately, right? So, the regulators want essentially the same thing we want, right, is for us to get this done, right? And so, that is the primary objective. The reference to the dividending from out of CBNA up to the parent is certainly referenced there between now and establishing that Resource Review Plan, but as Jane mentioned that does not constrain the parent from doing the things that it will need to do. And as opposed to -- it's not a cap. What it is, is that anything above the debt service of the parent or the preferred dividends and other non-discretionary obligations would require a non-objection from the OCC.\nJane Fraser: Until the resource plan is agreed...\nMark Mason: Until the resource plan...\nJane Fraser: And as you'll have seen the resource plan needs to be submitted within 30 days. And as I indicated, we're working on that one and not anticipating that to be a problem.\nOperator: The next question is from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSaul Martinez: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just -- I guess I just want to follow-up on the latter question. I just want to be very clear. So, the -- what you're saying is that the requirement that CBNA receive a non-objection to before dividending upstream to the parent, that does not impact how you think about your capital flexibility, how you think about -- it doesn't restrict you in any way and shouldn't impact, for example, your ability to benefit from -- for example, a Basel endgame rule that is softened or some of the benefits, Mark, that you talked about in terms of simplification. So, you don't see this impacting your ongoing level of capital flexibility and your ability to repurchase stock going forward if some of these things actually do play out?\nMark Mason: No. No, I don't.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. That's fair enough. That's clear as it can be. Good.\nMark Mason: Thank you.\nSaul Martinez: Second question on, I just want to follow-up on USPB. I mean, I still -- I get the point that you're seeing normalization in losses in cards, but even if I adjust for reserve builds, your RoTCE is still single-digit. I would think even at these NCL levels, your cards business is pretty profitable. You're a scale player. I mean, you're above sort of pre-pandemic levels, but not -- I don't know if I -- it doesn't seem like it's that much higher by a dramatic amount. It would seem to imply that the retail bank is a huge drag on profitability even maybe even losing money, I don't know. But can you just talk about what you can do to sort of improve the retail bank profitability and just give any more color that you can in terms of the path to get to that high-teen RoTCE that you talked about?\nJane Fraser: Yeah, let me let me kick-off there. And let's say, look, clearly, we're very focused on improving the returns in USPB to get us to the high-teens level over the medium term. And you've seen us generating healthy positive operating leverage this quarter. We've had a number of quarters of good revenue growth. And as Mark said, however, we're at the low point of the credit cycle. We knew this year we would see the pressure on returns from the elevated NCLs and some of the industry headwinds we've talked about. But as the NCL rates approach steady-state levels and the mitigating actions that all of us have been putting in place against the industry headwinds as those take hold, we expect the returns will improve and support the medium -- the firm-wide medium-term targets. In the retail bank, we're continuing to focus on growing share in our six core markets and we're doing that leveraging our physical and digital assets and it plays an important role in enabling the wealth continuum and the growth that we are looking at in our Wealth franchise. We are continuing to improve our operating efficiency, being very disciplined in expense management and managing carefully the branch and digital productivity of the retail bank network. But we're at the high point of the credit cycle, it's driving the low point for USPB, and as I said in my remarks, we're expecting to see those returns improve from here.\nOperator: The next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good afternoon. So, Mark, I have a fairly technical question on DTA utilization and specifically the NOLs. The deduction is still fairly significant at $12 billion. It roughly equates to about 10% of your market cap. And the good news here, I suppose is that it should come back into capital over time, but we've seen very little utilization over the past two years despite the firm being profitable. And so, wanted to better understand is, what's constraining your ability to utilize those DTAs? And are there catalysts on the horizon that can actually help accelerate that utilization beyond organic earnings generation?\nMark Mason: Mason Yeah, thank you. So, I'm going to give you a very simple answer to a very complicated question. It really comes down to driving US income, right? And so, we are focused on not just all of the things that we've mentioned, but driving higher income in the US that allows for us to utilize the disallowed DTA. We saw some of that in the quarter, and we expect to see more of it as we move through the medium-term, but that is the major driver of that utilization. And...\nJane Fraser: And we've got our -- and we have many of our business heads very much focused around that opportunity as well. So, winning in the US is a very important leg, for example, of the strategy that this is refreshing. Similarly, we see opportunities in -- from the commercial bank, we see it in Wealth, we see it in obviously in US Personal Banking and in Services. So, we're very -- we're focused from a business strategy point of view on this not just from the financial side.\nSteven Chubak: Yeah, thank you both for that color. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Just on the retail services business, we are seeing some evidence that your competitors in this space have been more aggressive leading with price in an effort to win some new mandates. I was hoping you could just speak to what you're seeing across the competitor set and your appetite or willingness to potentially offer better economics in response to increased competition from some of your peers?\nJane Fraser: Well, I think you'll be delighted to hear that we're very focused on returns rather than just on revenues. So, when we enter into discussions with a partner who may be a new RFP for their portfolio or looking at new ones such as the one we just agreed with Dillard's, it's all about the returns and the profile of the business rather than the revenue side of things. And it's a shift probably from some of the ways in the past, but I'm very pleased with how disciplined the team is being around this and we're seeing the benefits of it.\nMark Mason: And that may be different from what you hear and see from other players in the space, but as Jane mentioned, we're keenly focused on ensuring that, yes, we have a good partnership, but that we're generating an appropriate return. That's part of achieving our medium-term targets. And as you know, since you brought up retail cards, I mean, when we think about how CECL works in the reserves you have to establish for these partnerships, we're establishing full lifetime reserves that's on the balance sheet where ultimately we end up splitting those through the partner sharing economics. So, it's another important consideration as we think about expanding and taking on these relationships and renegotiating partnerships to making sure that returns make good sense for us.\nJane Fraser: And Mark and I have no problem saying no to revenue that doesn't come at the right returns and being very disciplined around that.\nOperator: The next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nVivek Juneja: Hi. Sorry, just a follow-up on this whole consent order stuff, Jane. What do you think this does in terms of timing? How much longer for you to sort of get this past you? Are you talking couple of years? Is it now longer by a year? Any sense of that? Any sense of helping us think through that?\nJane Fraser: Look, in terms of the consent order and the areas we've had delays, there are four areas to the consent order; it's risk management, it's data governance, it's around compliance, and it's around control. As we've said, we were falling behind in certain areas related to data and we've been investing to address the areas that we were behind. We also saw an increase in the scope related to regulatory reporting. So, we added some more bodies of work there and we are well underway. So, we are not expecting this to extend on the original expectations that we have on when we will complete the body of work for the consent order. We have a target state for the different areas of it. We have the plan to achieve those target states. We'll make the investments necessary to ensure that we do so. We'll try and get this done as quickly, but as robustly as possible. And we're doing this by making strategic fixes and investments rather than what I would call the old city way, which is a series of band-aids that remediate, but don't actually fix the underlying issue. And that way, we are delivering for our shareholders as well as our regulators and our clients because we're putting in strategic solutions that will benefit all, but I'm not expecting this to change the timeframes.\nVivek Juneja: Thank you.\nOperator: The final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Just two clarifications. So, this is a very high-profile amendment to the consent order. And I think what I hear you saying, but if you can confirm, your risk compliance and controls are getting passing grades. It's really the data. And as it relates to the data, you're talking about, 11,000 regulatory reports, some of which have 750,000 lines of data. Is that really the scope of what you need to fix? Because people see this externally and say, hey, you're failing in terms of overall controls and resiliency, but I think I hear you saying it's really more about just the data and the regulatory reporting, which is important, but more of a slice of a broader picture. Is that correct?\nJane Fraser: Yeah. Mike, maybe I just -- you're asking a great and it's an important question. So maybe I try and explain what we -- the data elements because it's an area that Mark and I have pointed to. So, first of all, we use data all over the firm. We use it to deliver 72 million customer statements every month. Our corporate clients, that you heard about at our Service Investor Day access account data real-time across multiple countries on CitiDirect, and we're moving $5 trillion roughly per day for those clients around the world. We trade billions of dollars in a millisecond on our trading platforms. We can see our liquidity positions real-time around the world. This can only be done if you've got pretty pristine data and highly automated ecosystems. So -- but what is the transformation doing? What it is doing is simplifying how data moves through the firm and it's about upgrading the management and governance over those flows. And we -- as I've said, we're doing a strategic overhaul of large parts of our infrastructure. So, what are we doing? We're making sure we're capturing data accurately using smart tools and automation. We will often talk about this smart system, make sure there's no errors when we book a trade. We've seen our error rate down 85% as a result of it. We're housing our upstream data in two standardized repositories. They're the golden sources, Olympus and Data Hub, which you've heard me talk about a few times. And they're a golden source now for all of the downstream data use, populating the thousands of regulatory reports Mark talked about and other areas. And what a single repository means is that the data models, the data quality rules, the controls you put in place to govern and manage that data, they all sit in one place rather than being distributed all over the firm as they have been historically. Mark has been investing in building a standardized reporting infrastructure. You've heard us talk about a single full-suite reporting ledger versus the six or so reporting ledgers that we've had in the past. And we're delivering all of this through consolidated systems, through the automation and streamlining of data flows. So, instead of being in multiple pipes, the flows go through single pipes. So, it's a -- sorry to get a bit plumber on you for a moment, but I think it's important to understand what it is, because it's a lot of work. It's a strategic overhaul. It's not a series of tactical fixes. Where we're behind, as we do the work on data, we identify specific issues we need to fix as we execute the plan that we have in place. There's some more areas to address and we knew back when we did the plan. So, we've -- and we've also accelerated the work on improving the accuracy of our regulatory reports and we increased the scope of this work as well. It's more comprehensive than originally planned. So, what we're doing? We're adding resources and data experts. We're learning from best practices. And we're using some great AI and other data tools that are helping to identify anomalies in data and data flows much quickly. We're also to the -- to some of the culture side, we're learning from pilots how do we accelerate broader deployment at scale across the firm in a consistent enterprise-wide manner. So, all of these things in the data side are going to enable us to leapfrog competitors, more revenue opportunities, better client service, fewer buffers, drive more efficiencies, and hope at the end of -- the end goal here is, it becomes a competitive advantage for the firm. That is the data plan. Clearly, there's a very important element of it related to the consent orders. We're behind in a few areas. We're investing. We've already begun that investment, as Mark and I have talked about, to get it done, we'll get it done.\nMark Mason: The only thing I'll add...\nMike Mayo: Real short follow-up...\nMark Mason: Sorry. What was that, Mike?\nMike Mayo: Yeah, just to say -- real short follow-up to that. So you're doing all this great stuff, but you still fell short. Just in, like, one sentence, despite doing all this great stuff that you described, the regulators still said you didn't get it done. Why after doing all that, didn't you get that it done in the eyes of the regulators and why won't be fixed now? Just like a one-sentence explanation for that if you have it?\nJane Fraser: I always said that a transformation of this magnitude over multiple years would not be linear. We have many steps forward. We have setbacks, we adjust, we learn from them, we move forward, and we get back on track.\nMark Mason: And Mike, if I could just put one number into context, because you played back the 11,000, which was a number of global regulatory reports across the landscape here. There are probably 15 to 30 that are core US reports that are pivotal to our US regulators. And a lot of what we're discussing here is about ensuring that we're prioritizing the data that impacts those 15 to 30 reports as we work through this.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.\nJenn Landis: Thank you all for joining us. Please let us know if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes Citi's second quarter 2024 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, let me first address the regulatory actions by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Controller of the Currency, which were announced on Wednesday. These actions pertain to the consent orders we entered into with both agencies in 2020. And those orders covered four primary areas: risk management, data governance, controls, and compliance. Addressing these areas is the primary goal of our transformation, our number one priority. It is a multi-year effort to modernize our infrastructure, unify disparate tech platforms, and automate processes and controls. This week's actions focused primarily on data quality management. We've been public this year about the fact that we were behind in this particular area and that we had increased our investment as a result. The regulatory actions consisted of two civil money penalties and under the amended consent order with the OCC, a new process designed to ensure we're allocating sufficient resources to meet our remediation milestones and that is called the Resource Review Plan. We are currently developing a plan for submission to the OCC. Now by way of background, while the Federal Reserve is the primary regulator for Citigroup, our bank holding company, the OCC is a primary regulator for Citibank, N.A., we call it CBNA, which is our largest banking vehicle with approximately 70% of our assets. The amended consent order with the OCC allows CBNA to continue paying to Citigroup at a minimum the dividends necessary for debt service, preferred dividends and other non-discretionary obligations. While we're developing and seeking OCC consent for our Resource Review Plan, dividend amounts above that would require the OCC's non-objection. Now these dividends are intercompany payments that are made from CBNA ultimately to the parent Citigroup. They should not be confused with the common dividends Citigroup pays to its shareholders. Indeed, there is no restriction on Citigroup's ability to pay common dividends to shareholders, nor is there a restriction to buying back shares. And let me be very clear, even with the investments needed for our transformation, Citigroup has more than sufficient resources to also invest in our businesses and make the planned return of capital to our shareholders. We will increase our dividend from $0.53 to $0.56 a share as we announced in late June and we will resume modest buybacks this quarter. While these actions were not entirely unexpected to us, it is no doubt disappointing for our investors and for our people. We completely understand that. At the same time, we're confident in our ability to get these specific areas where they need to be, as we have been able to do in other areas of the transformation. And we are pleased that it was acknowledged on Wednesday that we have made meaningful progress in executing our transformation and simplifying our firm. A multi-year undertaking such as this was never going to be linear, but I can assure you, the investments we have been making are starting to come together to reduce risk, improve controls and deliver very tangible outcomes. The tech investments we have made are making a difference. We have reduced the time it takes to book loans, automated controls for our traders to reduce errors, move risk analytics to a cloud-based infrastructure, and increase the resiliency of our platforms to reduce downtime. The changes to our organization and our culture are making a difference. We have eliminated managerial constructs and layers, whilst empowering our leaders. We introduced new tools to better manage human capital needs. Our focus on culture has increased accountability and attracted great new talent such as Vis Raghavan, Tim Ryan, and Andy Sieg. You have my and the entire management team's commitment that we will address any area of the consent order where we are behind by putting the necessary resources and focus behind it. We will get this work where it needs to be as we have with the execution of our strategy and the simplification of our organization. Now, turning to what was another good quarter, our results show the relentless focus we have in executing our strategy as we continue to drive towards our medium-term return target. We reported net income of $3.2 billion with an earnings per share of $1.52 and an RoTCE of 7.2%. Revenues were up 4% overall as well as up in each of our five core businesses, where all but one had positive operating leverage. Expenses were down 2% year-over-year. The steps we're taking to simplify our organization, right-size businesses such as Markets and Wealth, and reduce stranded costs are beginning to take hold even as we increase investment in our transformation. Over the medium-term, we expect these simplification and stranded cost actions to drive $2 billion to $2.5 billion in annual run rate saves. Services grew 3%, driven by solid fee growth, which we have prioritized. TTS saw increased activity in cross-border payments and in commercial cards. Security services was up 10% with new client onboarding, deepening with existing clients and market valuations, helping increase our assets under custody by a preliminary 9%. At our recent Services Investor Day, we very much enjoyed the opportunity to talk to you in-depth about how we're going to continue to grow this high-returning business. And we're very pleased that people are starting to recognize why we describe it as our crown jewel. Overall, Markets had a strong finish to the quarter, leading to better performance than we'd anticipated. Fixed income was slightly down year-on-year due to lower FX and rates, but we had good issuance and loan growth in financing and securitization, an area which generates attractive returns. Equities was up 37%, driven by strong performance in derivatives, which includes a gain on the Visa B exchange offer. Banking was up 38%, as the wallet rebound gained some momentum and we again grew share. Our clients continued to access debt capital markets with investment-grade issuance near-record levels. Equity issuance increased, particularly in convertibles, as companies wait for a fuller opening of the IPO window. Investment banking fees were up 63% versus the prior year, and we've seen some healthy volumes associated with announced deals year-to-date, particularly in natural resources and technology. Combined with the strong pipeline, advisory activity looks promising as we think about the rest of the year [Technical Difficulty]. Wealth is starting to improve. Growth in client investment assets drove stronger investment revenue, especially in Citigold, and was up a preliminary 15%. Our focus on rationalizing the expense base is also starting to pay off with expenses down 4%. Andy and his team continue to attract top talent from the industry, as they focus on our investments business and on enhancing the client experience. US Personal Banking saw revenue growth of 6% with all three businesses again contributing to the top-line. There was good revolving balance and loan growth in both branded cards and retail services, and we continue to see differentiation in the credit segment with the lower-income customers seeing pressure. Retail banking benefited from higher mortgage loans and improved deposit spreads, while delivering strong referrals to Wealth. Overall, while we saw operating margin expansion, our poor returns were pressured by the combination of credit seasonality and the normalization of certain vintages. We certainly expect USPB's returns to improve from here. The recent stress tests again showcased the strength of our balance sheet. Our CET1 ratio now stands at 13.6% and we expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1, given the reduction of our stress capital buffer. Our tangible book value per share grew to $87.53. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion in capital to our common shareholders and we are increasing our dividend by 6%. We expect to buy back $1 billion in common shares this quarter, and we will continue to assess the level of buybacks on a quarterly basis, particularly given the uncertainty around the Basel III endgame. Looking at the macro environment as we enter the second half of the year, US is still the world's most structurally sound economy. After a break in progress, inflation now appears back on a downward trajectory. Services spending has remained on an upward trend, although there are clear signs of a softening labor market and the tightening of the consumer budget. And, of course, you might have heard there is an election in November. In Europe, while rate cuts have begun, the region's lack of competitiveness continues to be a drag on growth. In Asia, China is growing moderately, albeit with government stimulus, and their pivot to high-tech manufacturing is being challenged by tariffs on EVs and semiconductors. Despite this uncertainty, as you saw at our Services Investor Day when we went through our performance over the last two years, our business model can produce good results in a wide variety of macro environments and there is plenty of upside for us across our five businesses. We have made an incredible amount of progress in simplification, both strategically and organizationally. We've completed most of the exits of our international consumer markets. We streamlined our organization to catalyze agility and faster decision-making. We are modernizing our infrastructure to improve our client service, and we are automating processes to strengthen controls. We are on a deliberate path. We will continue to execute our transformation and our strategy so we can meet our medium-term targets and then continue to further improve our returns over time. With that, let me turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions. Yes. Thank you, Mike. That's a few different parts of that. So, let's start by just taking a step back. Our transformation is addressing decades of underinvestment in large parts of Citi's infrastructure and in our risk and control environment. And when you unpack that, those areas where we had an absence of enforced enterprise-wide standards and governance, we've had a siloed organization that's prevented scale, a culture where a lot of groups are allowed to solve problems -- the same problem in different ways, fragmented tech platforms, manual processes and controls and a weak first-line of defense, too few subject matter experts. So, this is a massive body of work that goes well beyond the consent order. And this is not old Citi putting in band-aid. This is Citi tackling the root issues head-on. It's a multi-year undertaking as we've talked about and you saw the statement by one of our regulators this week, we have made meaningful progress on our transformation -- excuse me, and on our simplification. Mark, do you want to... Thank you, Mark. So, transforming -- to answer your question about how do we fix it and serve our investors at the same time, transforming Citi will drive benefits for our shareholders, our clients, and our regulators. This is not mutually exclusive. At the beginning of the year, we honed in on two priorities, the transformation and improving our business performance. And we're able to do so because we've largely cleared the decks. We have a clear focused strategy. We've executed the divestitures. We've got a much simpler organization, so we can focus on these two priorities and we are able to do both. You can see that in our results again this quarter, multiple solid proof points on the execution of the strategy and we know what we need to do on both fronts. We have plans in place on the transformation and on the strategy and we're executing against them. We have been and we will be transparent when we have issues and how we're addressing them. Look, I think when we think about the back half of '24, we're going to see a different mix of activity in Banking. We do still expect demand to be quite strong across our capital market products because you've got a wall of maturing debt securities coming up in the second half that carry on for a couple of years. But we did see some clients accelerating issuances into the first half, getting ahead of potential market volatility. So, if you put it all together, I think we expect the rate environment and the financing markets to continue to be accommodative and as well as to a continued deal-making with M&A being a bit larger in the overall mix, although some of the regulatory elements have put a damper on part of that. Okay. So, we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks. We are going to continue to give quarterly -- and make it a quarterly determination as to the level. And a lot of that is to do with the uncertainty about the forthcoming regulatory changes. I think we were delighted to see a slight reduction in our stress capital buffer, reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model and also good to see the benefits of our strategy playing out, but with the regulatory changes uncertain and we are -- that's one of the major factors for us to continue with the quarterly guidance. So, Ken, look, the Resource Review Plan is just that it's a plan to ensure that we have sufficient resources allocated towards achieving a timely and sustainable compliance with the order. Essentially, if an area is delayed or looking as if it could be, we'll determine what additional resourcing, if any, is required to get back on track, and then we'll share that with the OCC in a more formalized way than we do today. We obviously review this pretty constantly ourselves. We're already working on the plan after it's finalized with the OCC. So, it will be confidential supervisory information that we can't disclose. So, we won't be able to tell you that the plan is -- whether the plan -- what the nature of the plan is going to be, but it won't be much more complicated than what we talked about. And we're expecting to get it, we're not expecting this to take long. Hi, Betsy. And I just want to reiterate, we remain confident that we will meet our 11% to 12% RoTCE target over the medium-term. And we've got the -- we have the ability to manage the different elements we've been talking about today, making sure that we're investing sufficient resources into the transformation, so we can be on-track with that, as well as in our businesses, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders. And so, we feel confident around that and good about that we can manage this. No, you're not right. So, I think -- as you've heard us talk about, Vivek, for a while now that we knew the areas that we were behind in elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making the investments, some of that is in people, some of that is in our technology spend, it's using different tools and capabilities to get areas addressed earlier and we began that earlier in the year. And you saw that acknowledged as well by our regulators, who pointed to the fact that we've already begun addressing the areas that we're behind. Mark? Yeah. Seasonality... Sequentially. I think if you look year-over-year, you'll be able to see a pretty common trend there. The consumer is slowing in some of the -- in the spend, as Mark had referred to Matt, but -- and a lot of the spending and the growth areas we are seeing and the underlying numbers is being driven by the affluent customer. But nothing that's particularly worrying us, Matt. Look, the -- let's be clear. This action does not impact our ability to return capital to our shareholders. The dividends that are referenced are just intercompany payments from CBNA to the parents. So, first of all, don't confuse what a dividend is here. We will -- it's not going to impact how we run the company, the subsidiary, the capital or the liquidity at all, and the dividends are not capped. Until the resource plan is agreed... And as you'll have seen the resource plan needs to be submitted within 30 days. And as I indicated, we're working on that one and not anticipating that to be a problem. Yeah, let me let me kick-off there. And let's say, look, clearly, we're very focused on improving the returns in USPB to get us to the high-teens level over the medium term. And you've seen us generating healthy positive operating leverage this quarter. We've had a number of quarters of good revenue growth. And as Mark said, however, we're at the low point of the credit cycle. We knew this year we would see the pressure on returns from the elevated NCLs and some of the industry headwinds we've talked about. But as the NCL rates approach steady-state levels and the mitigating actions that all of us have been putting in place against the industry headwinds as those take hold, we expect the returns will improve and support the medium -- the firm-wide medium-term targets. In the retail bank, we're continuing to focus on growing share in our six core markets and we're doing that leveraging our physical and digital assets and it plays an important role in enabling the wealth continuum and the growth that we are looking at in our Wealth franchise. We are continuing to improve our operating efficiency, being very disciplined in expense management and managing carefully the branch and digital productivity of the retail bank network. But we're at the high point of the credit cycle, it's driving the low point for USPB, and as I said in my remarks, we're expecting to see those returns improve from here. And we've got our -- and we have many of our business heads very much focused around that opportunity as well. So, winning in the US is a very important leg, for example, of the strategy that this is refreshing. Similarly, we see opportunities in -- from the commercial bank, we see it in Wealth, we see it in obviously in US Personal Banking and in Services. So, we're very -- we're focused from a business strategy point of view on this not just from the financial side. Well, I think you'll be delighted to hear that we're very focused on returns rather than just on revenues. So, when we enter into discussions with a partner who may be a new RFP for their portfolio or looking at new ones such as the one we just agreed with Dillard's, it's all about the returns and the profile of the business rather than the revenue side of things. And it's a shift probably from some of the ways in the past, but I'm very pleased with how disciplined the team is being around this and we're seeing the benefits of it. And Mark and I have no problem saying no to revenue that doesn't come at the right returns and being very disciplined around that. Look, in terms of the consent order and the areas we've had delays, there are four areas to the consent order; it's risk management, it's data governance, it's around compliance, and it's around control. As we've said, we were falling behind in certain areas related to data and we've been investing to address the areas that we were behind. We also saw an increase in the scope related to regulatory reporting. So, we added some more bodies of work there and we are well underway. So, we are not expecting this to extend on the original expectations that we have on when we will complete the body of work for the consent order. We have a target state for the different areas of it. We have the plan to achieve those target states. We'll make the investments necessary to ensure that we do so. We'll try and get this done as quickly, but as robustly as possible. And we're doing this by making strategic fixes and investments rather than what I would call the old city way, which is a series of band-aids that remediate, but don't actually fix the underlying issue. And that way, we are delivering for our shareholders as well as our regulators and our clients because we're putting in strategic solutions that will benefit all, but I'm not expecting this to change the timeframes. Yeah. Mike, maybe I just -- you're asking a great and it's an important question. So maybe I try and explain what we -- the data elements because it's an area that Mark and I have pointed to. So, first of all, we use data all over the firm. We use it to deliver 72 million customer statements every month. Our corporate clients, that you heard about at our Service Investor Day access account data real-time across multiple countries on CitiDirect, and we're moving $5 trillion roughly per day for those clients around the world. We trade billions of dollars in a millisecond on our trading platforms. We can see our liquidity positions real-time around the world. This can only be done if you've got pretty pristine data and highly automated ecosystems. So -- but what is the transformation doing? What it is doing is simplifying how data moves through the firm and it's about upgrading the management and governance over those flows.

            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the business. On Slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.52 and RoTCE of 7.2% on $20.1 billion of revenue. Total revenues were up 4%, driven by growth across all businesses as well as an approximate $400 million gain related to the Visa B exchange offer. A significant portion of this gain is reflected in equity markets with the remainder reflected in all other. Expenses were $13.4 billion, down 2% and 6% on a sequential basis. The combination of revenue growth and expense decline drove positive operating leverage for the firm and the majority of our businesses. Cost of credit was $2.5 billion, primarily driven by higher card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases and all businesses except USPB, where we built for loan growth. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion of total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. On Slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. This quarter, we reported expenses of $13.4 billion, down 2% and 6% sequentially, which includes the $136 million civil money penalties imposed by the Fed and OCC earlier this week. The decrease in expenses was primarily driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification, stranded cost reductions, and lower repositioning costs, partially offset by continued investment in transformation and the Fed and the OCC penalty. As we said over the past few months, we will continue to invest in the transformation and technology to modernize our operations and risk and control infrastructure. We expect these investments to offset some of our sales and headcount reduction going forward. However, based on what we know today, we will likely be at the higher end of the expense guidance range, excluding the FDIC special assessment and the civil money penalties. With that said, we will, of course, continue to look for opportunities to absorb the civil money penalties. Before going into the balance sheet and the business results for the quarter, I'd like to also give more color on the transformation and address what the Fed and OCC announced Wednesday. We've made good progress on our transformation in certain areas over the last few years, and I want to highlight some of those areas before discussing the announcement. First, wholesale credit and loan operations, where we implemented a consistent end-to-end operating model and consolidated multiple systems with enhanced technology, this has not only reduced risk, but enhanced operating efficiency and the client experience. We've also made improvements in risk and compliance as we enhanced our risk assessment and technology capabilities to increase automation for monitoring. And in data, while there's a lot more to do, we stood up a data governance process and streamlined our data architecture to ultimately facilitate straight-through processing. Overall, we've improved risk management and consolidated and upgraded systems and platforms to improve our resiliency. These efforts represent meaningful examples of how we're making progress against our transformation milestones. That said, we have fallen short in data quality management, particularly related to regulatory reporting, which we've acknowledged publicly since the beginning of the year. As such, we've begun to put additional investments and resources in place to not only address data quality management related to regulatory reporting and data governance, but also stress-testing capabilities, including DFAST and Resolution and Recovery. We also reprioritized our efforts to ensure we're focused on data that impact these reports first. We take this feedback from our regulators very seriously and we're committed to allocating all the resources necessary to meet their expectations. Now, turning back to the quarterly results. On Slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans, where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the second quarter, net interest income was roughly flat. Excluding Markets, net interest income was down 3%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation, seasonally lower revolving card balances, and lower interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher deposit spreads in Wealth. Average loans were roughly flat as growth in cards and Mexico consumer was largely offset by slight declines across businesses. And average deposits decreased by 1%, largely driven by seasonal outflows and transfers to investments in Wealth as well as non-operational outflows in TTS. On Slide 10, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite framework. Across our card portfolios, approximately 86% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. And while we continue to see an overall resilient US consumer, we also continue to see a divergence in performance and behavior across FICO and income bands. When we look across our consumer clients, only the highest income quartile has more savings than they did at the beginning of 2019, and it is the over 740 FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and maintaining high payment rates. Lower FICO bands customers are seeing sharper drops in payment rates and borrowing more as they are more acutely impacted by high inflation and interest rates. That said, as we will discuss later, we're seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance across our cards portfolio. And we've taken this all into account in our reserving and we remain well reserved with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 8.1% for our total card portfolio. Our corporate portfolio is largely investment-grade at approximately 82% as of the second quarter, and we saw a nearly $500 million sequential decrease in corporate non-accrual loans, largely driven by upgrades and repayments. Additionally, this quarter, we saw an improvement in our macro assumptions driven by HPI, oil prices, and equity market valuations. And our credit loss reserves continues to incorporate a scenario weighted-average unemployment rate of nearly 5% and a downside unemployment rate of nearly 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves that we have in the current environment. Turning to Slide 11, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital, and liquidity. It is this strength that allows us to support clients through periods of uncertainty and volatility. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy, and diversified business model. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well-diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types. The majority of our deposits are corporate at $807 billion and span 90 countries. And as you heard at the Services Investor Day, most of these deposits are held in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world, making them operational in nature and therefore very stable. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $404 billion are well-diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail, and Wealth at Work offering, as well as across regions and products. Of our total deposits, 68% are US dollar-denominated with the remainder spanning over 60 currency. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework. Our $688 billion loan portfolio is well-diversified across consumer and corporate loans, and about one-third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high-quality short-duration investment securities that contribute to our approximately $900 billion of available liquidity resources. We continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities, which position us to be a source of strength for the industry and importantly for our clients. On Slide 12, we show a sequential walk to provide more detail on the drivers of our CET1 ratio this quarter. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 130 basis points or approximately $15 billion above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. We expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1, which incorporates the reduction in our stress capital buffer from 4.3% to the indicative SCB of 4.1% we announced a couple of weeks ago. We were pleased to see the improvement in our DFAST results and the corresponding reduction in our SCB. That said, even with the reduction, our capital requirement does not yet fully reflect our simplification efforts, the benefits of our transformation or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to reduce our capital requirements over time. And as a reminder, we announced an increase to our common dividend from $0.53 per share to $0.56 per share following the SCB result. And as Jane mentioned earlier, we plan on doing $1 billion of buybacks this quarter. So now turning to Slide 13. Before I get into the businesses, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, we implemented a revenue-sharing arrangement within Banking and between Banking, Services and Markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing is included in the all other line for each business in our financial supplement. In Services, revenues were up 3% this quarter, reflecting continued underlying momentum across both TTS and security services. Net interest income was down 1%, largely driven by lower earnings on our net investment in Argentina, partially offset by the benefit of higher US and non-US interest rates relative to the prior-year period. Non-interest revenue increased to 11%, driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers as well as a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. The underlying growth in both businesses is a result of our continued investment in product innovation, client experience, and platform modernization that we highlighted during our Services Investor Day last month. Expenses increased 9%, largely driven by an Argentina-related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense, and continued investments in product innovation and technology. Cost of credit was a benefit of $27 million, driven by an ACL release in the quarter. Average loans were up 3%, primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance, particularly in Asia, as well as working capital loans to corporate in commercial clients in Latin America and Asia. Average deposits were down 1%, driven by non-operating deposit outflows. At the same time, we continue to see good operating deposit inflows. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion, and Services continues to deliver a high RoTCE coming in at 23.8% for the quarter. On Slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the second quarter. Market revenues were up 6%. Fixed income revenues decreased 3%, driven by rates and currencies, which were down 11% on the back of lower volatility and tighter spreads. This was partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed income, which was up 20%, primarily driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization in underwriting fees. In addition to a benefit from the Visa B exchange offer, we continue to see good underlying momentum in equity, primarily driven by equity derivatives, and we continue to make progress in prime with balances up approximately 18%. Expenses decreased 1%, driven by productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was a benefit of $11 million as an ACL release more than offset net credit loss. Average loans increased to 11%, largely driven by asset-backed lending and spread products. Average trading assets increased 12%, largely driven by client demand for treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated positive operating leverage, and delivered net income of approximately $1.4 billion, with an RoTCE of 10.7% for the quarter. On Slide 15, we show the results for Banking for the second quarter. Banking revenues increased 38%, driven by growth in investment banking and corporate lending. Investment banking revenues increased 60%, driven by strength across capital markets and advisory, given favorable market conditions. DCM continued to benefit from strong issuance activities, mainly in investment grade as issuers continued to derisk funding plans in advance of what could be a more volatile second half in the context of a number of important global elections as well as the macro environment. In ECM, excluding China A shares, we're seeing a pickup in IPO activity, led by the US as well as continued convertible issuance as issuers take advantage of strong equity market performance and expectations for rates to be higher for longer. And in advisory, we're seeing revenues from the relatively low announced activity in 2023 coming to fruition as those transactions close. Both year-to-date and in the quarter, we gained share across DCM, ECM, and advisory, particularly in technology, where we've been investing. Corporate lending revenues excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage again this quarter as expenses decreased 10%, primarily driven by actions taken to right-size the expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $32 million, driven by an ACL release, reflecting an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by net credit loss. Average loans decreased 4% as we maintain strict discipline around returns combined with lower overall demand for credit. Net income was $406 million, and RoTCE was 7.5% for the quarter. On Slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the second quarter. Wealth revenues increased 2%, driven by a 13% increase in NIR from higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by a 4% decrease in NII from higher mortgage funding costs. We continue to see good momentum in non-interest revenue as we benefited from double-digit client investment asset growth, both in North America and internationally, driven by net new client investment assets as well as market valuation. Expenses were down 4%, driven by the initial benefit of expense reductions as we right-sized the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $9 million as an ACL release more than offset net credit loss. Preliminary end-of-period client balances increased 9%, driven by higher client investment assets as well as higher deposits. Average loans were flat as we continue to optimize capital usage. Average deposits increased 2%, largely reflecting the transfer of relationships and associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. Client investment assets were up 15%, driven by net new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuation. Wealth generated positive operating leverage this quarter, and delivered net income of $210 million, with an RoTCE of 6.4% for the quarter. On Slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the second quarter. US Personal Banking revenues increased 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments. Branded cards revenues increased 8%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 9% as payment rates continue to moderate and we continue to see growth in spend volumes up 3%, primarily driven by customers with FICO scores of 740 or higher. Retail services revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by lower payments from Citi to our partners due to higher net credit losses and interest-earning balances grew 8%. Retail banking revenues increased 3%, driven by higher deposit spreads as well as mortgage and installment loan growth. USPB also generated positive operating leverage this quarter, with expenses down 2%, driven by lower technology and compensation costs, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit increased to $2.3 billion, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion and an ACL build of approximately $400 million, reflecting volume growth in the quarter. But let me remind you of the three things driving our NCLs this quarter. First, card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years are all maturing at the same time. These vintages were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. Second, we continue to see seasonally higher NCLs in the second quarter. Third, certain pockets of customers continue to be impacted by persistent inflation and higher interest rates resulting in higher losses. However, across both portfolios, we are seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance, but we will continue to watch the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as the year progresses. Despite these factors, we still expect branded cards to be in the 3.5% to 4% NCL range for the full year, and retail services to be at the high end of the range of 5.75% to 6.25%. Average deposits decreased 18% as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business more than offset the underlying growth. Net income was $121 million, and RoTCE for the quarter was 1.9%. As we said before, we will continue to take actions to manage through the regulatory headwind, lap the credit cycle, and grow revenue while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business to ultimately get to a high-teens return over the medium-term. On Slide 18, we show results for all other on a managed basis, which includes corporate/other and legacy franchises, and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 22%, primarily driven by the closed exit and winddowns and higher funding costs, partially offset by growth in Mexico as well as the impact from the Visa B exchange offer. And expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by closed exit and winddowns. Slide 19 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance, both of which remain unchanged. We continue to remain laser-focused on executing on our transformation and enhancing the business' performance. And while we recognize there's a lot more to do on transformation, we are pleased with the progress that we're making towards our 2024 and medium-term targets and remain committed to these targets. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. Yeah. And so, what -- as Jane says, the progress that we -- that we've made, it spans multiple parts of the consent order and transformation work. Remember, that consent order and transformation work includes risk, it includes controls, it includes compliance, it includes data and data-related to the regulatory reporting. And we've got evidence and proof points of progress against all of those things. Yes. Yeah. And just to add a couple of data points to that, Mike, you've heard us mention some of these before, but we've retired platforms. We've reduced the number of data centers. Platforms are down some 300. We've moved from 39 corporate loan platforms down to south of 20. We've got 20 cash equities execution platforms down to one. We've reduced the six reporting ledgers down to one, 11 sanctioned platforms down to one. So, we've been making considerable progress over the past couple of years. With that said, there's a lot more work to be done around the data regulatory reporting work. If you think about Citi, we've got 11,000 global total reg reports, right? So, we've got to make sure that the data that's going into those reports is the quality of the data that we want it to be, but more importantly, that we're doing it efficiently that it doesn't take thousands of people to reconcile that information. And so, this is an end-to-end process in the way we're approaching it. One example is the 2052a liquidity report that we have. It has 750,000 lines of data, and that data is -- it's important again that we're efficiently collecting it from multiple systems with standards and governance that ensures that it's of the quality that we want it to be without again having to have manual activity supporting it. Yeah. Look, like I said, we do think that there is certainly upside to USPB. We're looking for that upside in the medium-term targets that we've set for ourselves. You got to remember that when you look at the quarter and you look at the half, frankly that we're still in a period where we're seeing the normalization of the cost of credit. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a compounding [Technical Difficulty] now maturing at the same time that's playing through the P&L, that's not just true for us, that's true for others as well. And so, we'd expect and we are -- we do believe we're seeing some signs of a cresting when you look at delinquencies now. And so, we would expect that those losses start to normalize and loss rates start to come down as we go towards the medium-term. At the same time, we're investing in the business and we're looking to see continued growth in volume and on the top-line. And the combination of those things as we drive towards the medium-term will help us to deliver both the top-line growth and certainly improve returns from where we sit today and in-line with what we've guided to. So, it's a combination of top-line performance from volume, and obviously, the environment plays into that, but we feel like we've got a reasonable assumption around top-line growth there, cost of credit normalizing, continued discipline on the expense line, allowing for us to get improved returns across that USPB business. Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that is, look, the wallet for the year is obviously going to depend on a couple of things. So, one, the return of a more normalized IPO market; two, the direction of volatility of interest rates; the ongoing global conflicts that we're all kind of seeing and witnessing; and then finally, as Jane mentioned in her remarks, the elections and what those outcomes look like, not just in the US but abroad. And so, there are a number of factors there that will play to the wallet, but as we said, we believe we're well-positioned to be there to serve our clients and to do so in a way that makes good economic sense. Yeah. So, I'd say a couple of things. So, one, as I mentioned, in the quarter, and if you see it on Slide 9, ex-Markets were down about 3%. That's largely driven by some FX translation that played through, but also some seasonally lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in Argentina. And what that is in Argentina, we have capital there, the policy rate was adjusted downward, and as that happened, we obviously earn less on that capital that flows through the NII line. As I think about the back half of the year and the guidance we have of modestly down, there are a couple of puts and takes to keep in mind. So, one is going to be rates, right? So, as I think about the higher yield that we can earn on reinvestment, that will be a tailwind that plays through from an NII point of view. The second would be volume growth, particularly in our card loans portfolio. And we do expect to see continued volume growth across the -- certainly the branded portfolio and so that will be another tailwind for us on the NII line. In terms of the headwinds, you've got the lower NII earned in Argentina from rates that will continue to play through. We've got assumed higher average betas in 2024, specifically on the non-US side. We still have in our forecast the impact of CFPB late fee. So, assuming that that goes into effect for this year, that will have an impact and it's in the forecast. And then, the impact of lost NII from the exits that we have. And so, the combination of those things will probably mean that NII in the back half of the year is a little bit higher than the first half, but again, consistent with the guidance that we gave of modestly down. Yeah. So that's right. When I talked about at the first quarter, I talked about kind of a downward trend for each of the quarters after Q1. The second quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting. I'm sticking with the guidance and that does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in -- will come in higher than the second quarter. That's a combination of a couple of things, including the pace of hiring and investment that we will do in the transformation work that has to be done. It also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our businesses across the firm and the franchise. And then, the second quarter did -- yes, the second quarter did have a one-time or so in some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter around advertising and marketing and some of the other line items. So, yes, the second quarter will -- the third and fourth quarter, the back half will be higher than the second quarter, but consistent with the guidance that I've given. So, yes, the answer to last part of your question is yes. So, in the range that I've given, $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, that includes our estimate for the full year of repositioning and any restructuring charges. That range excludes the FDIC special assessment that we saw earlier in the year and it excludes the CMP of $136 million. Yeah. That's right. On the first part of your question, Erika, I'd say, look, we were in discussions with our regulators and we made a prudent call as it relates to buybacks in the quarter for Q2 [Technical Difficulty] Q3, as we talked about would be at $1 billion and that should not be necessarily viewed as a run rate level. As Jane mentioned, we'll take it quarter-by-quarter from here. Good morning. Yeah. So, on the first part of the question, look, we all kind of have talked about in the past the prospect of FICO inflation back during the COVID period of time. We've been very, very focused on ensuring that acquisitions that we've made have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get comfortable with the quality of new customers that we've been bringing on. In light of the environment, we have looked at moving towards higher FICO scores for new account acquisitions. But as I think about what we're seeing now, there is that dichotomy that I mentioned where we have the higher FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and that frankly have still continued strong balances in savings and it's really the lower FICO band customers where we're seeing the sharper drop in payment rates and more borrowing. And so, the FICO inflation has effectively kind of fizzled out when we look at the mix and dynamic of the customer portfolio that we have at this point. And in terms of the CFPB, late fees, well, I don't have an update on that. Like I said, we've built in an assumption in the -- in our forecast, but in terms of the timing, I don't have a formal update on the certainty of it. Yeah, thank you. So look, I think that as we look at it out through the -- certainly through the medium-term, we expect to see continued NII growth at obviously a modest level, certainly lower than what we've seen historically. And that's in large part because -- or in-part, I should say, because of how we've been managing the balance sheet and that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a higher yield on them relative to what we were earning. In some instances, they were five-year terms on some of these investments. And so, we still think there's some upside from a reinvestment point of view. The point you make around kind of non-US dollar or US rates kind of coming off, that will play through a little bit as we think about the beta increases that we're expecting outside of the US. And so, we've assumed that we have higher betas pickup outside of the US. If rates kind of come off in a more substantive way, then we could see kind of a little less NII pressure than we're forecasting there. But net-net, as I think about the combination of volume growth that we're expecting between loans and deposits over that medium-term, the higher yield we can earn on our assets, combined with the pricing capabilities that we have across the portfolio, offsetting some of that beta, we believe will have continued NII growth. As I think about what I often point to in terms of the IRE analysis and you have to remember that, that is a shock to the current balance sheet and it assumes that the full curve is moving simultaneously across currencies. And in that case, the 100 basis point parallel shift downward would be a negative $1.6 billion, with about $1.3 billion of that coming from non-US dollar. But again, that does assume that all of those currencies come down at the same time and doesn't account for the rebalancing of the balance sheet and things that I mentioned like the reinvestment higher yields that we'd be able to earn. Hello. So, thank you, Betsy. I guess, I'd say a couple of things. So, I think we said it in the past, so the target for the medium-term, I think 2026 is somewhere around $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. As we've said, we'll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we've done and another $500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that medium-term period. And so, we've made, I think, very good headway, as Jane has mentioned in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that, those saves will -- have started to generate some of those saves in the early part of that, meaning this year will likely be offset by continued investment that we're making in areas of the business like transformation, but also in business-led or driven growth. And you should expect in terms of the trend that we would have a downward trend towards 2026 and achieving that range. Yeah, I think that's a great point, Jane. Look, the reality is, as was pointed out earlier, we spent about $3 billion last year, a little bit under that on the transformation-related work. And the plan has called for us to spend a little bit more than that this year. And frankly, in the first half of the year, as we work through the transformation work and some of the things that Jane and I have mentioned earlier in the year that we've been focused on like data and data related to regulatory reporting, we've had to spend more than we had planned for in the first half, right? And we've done that and we funded that. We've been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidance that we've given for the full year. So, we are managing this entire expense base, right? So, not -- the whole $53-plus billion of it, we are actively managing that with an eye towards what's required from a transformation point of view to keep it on-track, to accelerate in areas where we're behind, and to shore up areas where we are tracking in accordance to what the order requires and where are there other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up the expense base. And so, things like the work that Andy Sieg has done with the finance team around that expense base and finding efficiencies there are opportunities that we've been able to tease out of the business. Things that we have done in parts of USPB and that we have continued to get up there in parts of Banking, which you see in the down 10% this quarter are areas where we've been keenly focused on, where are there duplicative roles, where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of. So, long-winded way of saying, we understand the expense guidance that we've given. We also understand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with what's required and we are doing both. That's right, Jane. What you have heard is that, despite having to spend more, some $250 million or so more, we're not changing the guidance, right? And so, we have -- as Jane mentioned, we have worked on areas already that we've needed to and we have looked for ways to absorb that and are doing so within our guidance. Look, the plan -- the Resource Review Plan, as Jane mentioned, is what we're working through now with the regulators. That will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and allocating the appropriate resources to accomplishing the commitments that we have. Appropriate resources can range from people to technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution. If you think about what that will entail, it will entail areas where we are delayed or behind as we identify those areas, being able to tease out the root cause of any delay and ensure that we've got proper funding allocated to get it back on track. And that's me framing out how I think about what something like this might look like. And so, what we're saying is that, if we identify issues in the quarters to come that we haven't identified already, that's the process we're going to apply to those issues. And as you've heard us say repeatedly, we're going to spend whatever is necessary to then get those things back on track, and as we've done thus far this year, we're going to look for opportunities to absorb those headwinds. I hope that's clear. Credit card revenues seasonality... Seasonality playing through there. Yeah, sequentially. Yeah. Yeah, I think there's also the dynamic on the CRS of the reward -- across the portfolio of rewards playing through from one quarter to the other. So, the combination of those things are playing through the revenue line there. Yeah. I think the -- Jane, that's right. And I think let's not lose sight of the purpose of the orders that are there. And the purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that we're funding and allocating the effort appropriately, right? So, the regulators want essentially the same thing we want, right, is for us to get this done, right? And so, that is the primary objective. The reference to the dividending from out of CBNA up to the parent is certainly referenced there between now and establishing that Resource Review Plan, but as Jane mentioned that does not constrain the parent from doing the things that it will need to do. And as opposed to -- it's not a cap. What it is, is that anything above the debt service of the parent or the preferred dividends and other non-discretionary obligations would require a non-objection from the OCC. Until the resource plan... No. No, I don't. Thank you. Mason Yeah, thank you. So, I'm going to give you a very simple answer to a very complicated question. It really comes down to driving US income, right? And so, we are focused on not just all of the things that we've mentioned, but driving higher income in the US that allows for us to utilize the disallowed DTA. We saw some of that in the quarter, and we expect to see more of it as we move through the medium-term, but that is the major driver of that utilization. And... And that may be different from what you hear and see from other players in the space, but as Jane mentioned, we're keenly focused on ensuring that, yes, we have a good partnership, but that we're generating an appropriate return. That's part of achieving our medium-term targets. And as you know, since you brought up retail cards, I mean, when we think about how CECL works in the reserves you have to establish for these partnerships, we're establishing full lifetime reserves that's on the balance sheet where ultimately we end up splitting those through the partner sharing economics. So, it's another important consideration as we think about expanding and taking on these relationships and renegotiating partnerships to making sure that returns make good sense for us. The only thing I'll add... Sorry. What was that, Mike? And Mike, if I could just put one number into context, because you played back the 11,000, which was a number of global regulatory reports across the landscape here. There are probably 15 to 30 that are core US reports that are pivotal to our US regulators. And a lot of what we're discussing here is about ensuring that we're prioritizing the data that impacts those 15 to 30 reports as we work through this."

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin.\nJennifer Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining our First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials, as well as in our SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane.\nJane Fraser : Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Today, I'm going to touch on the macroeconomic environment before I update you on the progress we're making, and then I'll discuss the quarter. While global economic performance was surprisingly [desynchronized] (ph) last year, the overall story has been consistent of late, one of economic resiliency supported by tight labor markets and the consumer. Growth this year looks poised to slow in many markets, and conditions are generally disinflationary. We're already seeing some Central Banks in the emerging markets starting to cut rates. In the U.S., a soft landing is viewed as increasingly, likely. But we continue to see a tale of two Europe's, with Germany hurt by the weak demand for goods, while southern European countries such as Spain and Greece benefit from stronger demand in services. In Asia, Japan is joining in the [areas of] (ph) bright spot, and China's economy has gained some more traction, although its property market remains a concern. Amidst all these dynamics, we continue to focus on executing against our strategy and delivering the best of Citi to all our stakeholders. I said 2024 will be a pivotal year for us, as we put our business and organizational simplification largely behind us and we focus on two main priorities. The transformation and the performance of our businesses and the firm. Last month marked the end to the organizational simplification that we announced in September. The result is a cleaner, simpler management structure that fully aligns to and facilitates our strategy. We are now more client-centric. We're already seeing faster decision making and a nimbler organization at work. We have clear lines of accountability, starting with my management team. Fewer layers, increased spans of control and frankly much less bureaucracy and needless complexity. It will all help us run the company more efficiently, will enhance our clients' experience and improve our agility and ability to execute. And while reducing expenses wasn't the primary driver of the program, more roles were ultimately impacted than the 5,000 that we discussed in January. We also took a number of other steps to sharpen our business focus and improve returns by right-placing businesses to better capture synergies, exiting certain businesses in markets that just didn't fit with our strategy, and right-sizing the workforce in wealth. As a result of all these combined steps, which include the simplification, we are eliminating approximately 7,000 positions, which will generate $1.5 billion of annualized run rate expense saves. The combination of these actions and the measures we're taking to eliminate our remaining stranded costs will drive $2 billion to $2.5 billion in cumulative annualized run rate saves in the medium-term. We are keeping a close eye on the execution of these efforts and overall resourcing to ensure we safeguard our commitment to the transformation. As you know, given its magnitude and scale, the transformation is a multi-year effort to address issues that have spanned over two decades. We've made steady progress as we retire multiple legacy platforms, streamline end-to-end processes, and strengthen our risk and control environment, all of which are necessary not only to meet the expectations of our regulators, but also to serve our clients more effectively. A transformation of this magnitude, well it's never linear. So while we've made good progress in many areas, there are a few where we are intensifying our efforts, such as automating certain regulatory processes and the data related to regulatory reporting. We're committed to getting these right and we'll look to self-fund the necessary investments to do so. Turning to the quarter, we had a good start to a pivotal year. We reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, earnings per share of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on over $21 billion of revenues. Our revenues were up over 3% year-over-year, excluding divestitures, which was primarily the $1 billion gain from the India consumer sale last year. Our expenses were slightly down quarter-over-quarter, excluding the FDIC special assessments. Services continues to perform well and generate very attractive returns. Revenue was up 8% for the quarter as both businesses won new mandates and deepened relationships with existing clients. Fees were up a pleasing 10% for services year-over-year driven by the investments we've made across our product offering platforms and client experience. In Securities Services, we took share again this quarter, and in TTS, cross-border activity continued to outpace global GDP growth and commercial card spend remained robust. We look forward to diving deeper into these two businesses at our investor presentation on services in June. Markets bounced back from a tough final quarter in \u201823. While revenues were down 7% as lower volatility impacted rates and currencies, that was off a very strong first quarter last year. We saw good client activity in equities and in spread products, where both new issuance and securitization activity were particularly robust. We fully integrated our financing and securitization capabilities within our markets business and we started to see the benefits of having a unified spread product offering for our clients. The rebound in banking gained speed during the quarter, led by near record levels of investment grade debt issuance, as improved market conditions enabled issuers to pull forward activity. And after a bit of a slow start, ECM picked up in the second half of the quarter, notably in convertibles. Our strong performance in both DCM and ECM drove investment banking revenue growth of 35% and overall banking revenue growth of 49%. While M&A revenues are still low across The Street, I was pleased that we participated in some of the significant deals announced in the quarter, such as Diamondback's merger with Endeavor Energy and Catalent\u2019s merger with Nova Holdings. We are cautiously optimistic that we could see a measured reopening of the IPO market in the second quarter in light of improved market valuation.\n.: As you've seen, Andy continues to form his team and is focused on three areas. First, rationalizing the expense base. Second, turning on the growth engine by focusing on investment revenues. And third, enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience. Now these won't happen overnight, but getting these things right will help us get more than our fair share of the $5 trillion of assets that our clients have away from us. And that will help us get our returns to where they need to be in this business in the medium-term. USPB had double-digit revenue growth for the sixth straight quarter. We feel good about our position and our resiliency as a prime lend-centric issuer and are seeing positive momentum across proprietary card and partner card businesses. Healthy spend growth persists in branded cards, primarily driven by our more affluent customers. Across both portfolios, increased demand for credit continues to drive strong growth in interest earning balances. And while they're only a small part of our portfolio, we are keeping an eye on the customers in the lower FICO bands. We also continue to see strong engagement in digital payment offerings, such as Citi Pay, as a point-of-sale lending product, which is easily integrated into merchants\u2019 checkout processes. And we are driving more value from our retail branches, as well as getting the expense base right to increase returns there. Our balance sheet is strong across the board, an intentional result of our high quality assets, robust capital and liquidity positions, and rigorous risk management. During the first quarter, we returned $1.5 billion in capital to our common shareholders and that includes $500 million through share buybacks. Our CET1 ratio ticked up to a preliminary 13.5% and we grew our tangible book value per share to $86.67. We have a great franchise around the world with great clients who are served by great colleagues. I'm pleased with where we are and I'm excited about where we're going. With the organizational simplification behind us and a good quarter under our belt, we have started this critical year on the right foot. Now while there will be bumps in the road, no doubt, we will continue to execute with discipline and we are committed to reaching our medium-term targets. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will both be delighted, as always to take your questions. Thank you.\nMark Mason : Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on our year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the business. On slide six, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, EPS of $1.58, and an RoTCE of 7.6% on $21.1 billion of revenue. Total revenues were down 2% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely consisting of the $1 billion gain from the sale of the India consumer business, in the prior year, revenues were up more than 3% driven by growth across banking, USPB, and services, partially offset by declines in markets and wealth. Expenses were $14.2 billion, up 7% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment, expenses were up 5%. Cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion, primarily driven by higher card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases in wealth, banking, and legacy franchise. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.8%. On Slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. We reported expenses of $14.2 billion, which included the incremental FDIC special assessment of roughly $250 million. Also included in this number are $225 million of restructuring charges, largely related to the organizational simplification. In total, we've incurred approximately $1 billion of restructuring costs over the last two quarters. As part of these actions we expect approximately $1.5 billion of annualized run rate saves over the medium-term related to our headcount reduction of approximately 7,000. In addition to the restructuring, we took approximately $260 million of repositioning costs largely related to our efficiency efforts across the firm, including a reduction of stranded costs associated with the consumer divestitures. The expected savings from these actions will allow us to continue to fund additional investments in the transformation this year. And relative to the prior year, the remainder of the expense growth was largely driven by inflation and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. In the remainder of the year, we expect a more normalized level of repositioning, which is already embedded in our guidance. Therefore, you can expect our quarterly expense trend to go down from here in-line with our $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion ex. FDIC expense guidance. On Slide 8, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the first quarter, net interest income decreased by $317 million, largely driven by markets, which resulted in a 4 basis point decrease in net interest margin. Excluding markets, net interest income was relatively flat. Average loans were up $4 billion, primarily driven by loans in spread product in markets, as well as card and mortgage loans in U.S. Personal banking, partially offset by declines in service. And average deposits were up nearly $7 billion, primarily driven by services, as we continue to grow high quality operating deposits. On Slide 9, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. This quarter we adjusted our FICO distribution to be more aligned with the industry reporting practices and now show our FICO mix using a 660 threshold. Across branded cards and retail services, approximately 85% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. And we remain well-reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.2% for our total card portfolio. In our corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade, which is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans at 0.5% of total corporate loans. As a reminder, our loan loss reserves incorporate a scenario-weighted average unemployment rate of approximately 5%, which includes a downside scenario unemployment rate of close to 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves we have in the current environment. Turning to Slide 10, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital and liquidity. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion high-quality balance sheet, which increased 1% sequentially. Despite this increase, we were able to decrease our risk-weighted assets, reflecting our continued optimization efforts and focus on capital efficiency. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy, and diversified business model. The foundation of our funding is a $1.3 trillion deposit base, which is well diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types. The majority of our deposits, $812 billion, are corporate and span 90 countries. Most of our corporate deposits reside in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. In most cases, we are fully integrated in our client systems and help them efficiently manage their operations through our three integrated services, payments and collections, liquidity management, and working capital solutions, all of which greatly increased the stickiness of these deposits. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $423 billion, are well diversified across the private bank, Citigold, retail, and wealth at work, as well as across regions and products. Now turning to the asset side. Over the last several years, we've maintained a strong risk appetite framework and have been very deliberate about how we deploy our deposits and other liabilities into high quality assets. This starts with our $675 billion loan portfolio, which is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans. And the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.2 years. About one-third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high quality, short duration investment securities that contribute to our nearly $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. And for the quarter, we had an LCR of 117%. So to wrap it up, we are active and deliberate in the management of our balance sheet, which is reflected in our high-quality assets and strong capital and liquidity position. On Slide 11, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we generated $3.1 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 13 basis points. Third, we saw an increase in our disallowed DTA, which resulted in a 10 basis point decrease. And finally, the remaining 6 basis point benefit was largely driven by a reduction in RWA. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 120 basis points, or over $13 billion above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. That said, our current capital requirement does not yet reflect our simplification efforts, the benefits of our transformation, or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to bring down capital requirements over time. So now turning to slide 12. Before I get into the businesses, let me remind you that in the fourth quarter we implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within banking and between banking services and markets to reflect the benefits that businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing is included in the all-other line for each business in our financial supplement. In services, revenues were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued momentum across both TTS and Securities Services. Net interest income increased 6%, driven by higher deposit and trade loan spreads. Non-interest revenue increased 14%, largely driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers. In TTS, cross-border volumes increased 9%. U.S. Dollar clearing volumes increased 3%, and commercial card spend volumes increased 5%, all of which was driven by strong corporate client activity. In Securities Services, our preliminary assets under custody and administration increased 11% benefiting from higher market valuations, as well as new client onboarding. The growth in both businesses is a direct result of our continued investment in product innovation, the client experience, and platform modernization to gain share across all client segments. TTS continues to maintain its Number One position with large corporate and FI clients, and see good momentum in the commercial client segment, and we continue to gain share in Securities Services. Expenses increased 11%, largely driven by continued investments in technology and product innovation. Cost of credit was $64 million as net credit losses remain low. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion. Average loans were up 4% primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients. However, it is worth noting that we continue to see good operating deposit inflow. And services continues to deliver a high RoTCE of 24.1% for the quarter. On slide 13, we show the results for markets for the first quarter. Markets revenues were down 7% as lower fixed income revenues more than offset growth in equities. Fixed income revenues decreased 10% driven by rates and currencies, which were down 21% on the back of lower volatility and a strong quarter in the prior year. This was partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed income, which was up 26% driven by an increase in client activity, particularly in asset-backed lending. And we continue to see good underlying momentum in equities, with revenues up 5% driven by growth across cash trading and equity derivatives. And we continue to make progress in prime with balances up more than 10%. Expenses increased 7%, largely driven by the absence of a legal reserve release last year. Cost of credit was $200 million, primarily driven by macroeconomic assumptions related to loans and spread products that impacted reserves. Net income was approximately $1.4 billion. Average loans increased 8%, primarily driven by asset-backed lending and spread products due to an improvement in market activity. Average trading assets increased 4% sequentially, largely driven by seasonally stronger activity in the first quarter. Markets delivered an RoTCE of 10.4% for the quarter. On slide 14, we show the results for banking for the first quarter. Banking revenues increased 49% driven by growth in investment banking and corporate lending and lower losses on loan hedges. As I previously mentioned, corporate lending results include the impact of revenue sharing from investment banking, services and markets. Investment banking revenues increased 35% driven by DCM and ECM, as improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity, particularly investment grade, which is running at near record levels. Advisory revenues declined given the low level of announced merger activity last year. However, in the quarter, we participated in the pickup and announced M&A across sectors, including those where we've been investing, such as technology and healthcare. Corporate lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 34%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage this quarter as expenses decreased 4%, driven by actions taken to right size the expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $129 million, primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition. The [NPL] (ph) rate was 0.3% of average loans, and we ended the quarter with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 1.5%. Net income was approximately $536 million. Average loans decreased 6%, as we maintained strict discipline around capital efficiency as we optimized corporate loan balances. RoTCE was 9.9% for the quarter, reflecting a rebound in activity, reserve releases, and continued expense discipline. On slide 15, we show the results for wealth for the first quarter. Wealth revenues decreased 4%, driven by a 13% decrease in NII from lower deposit spreads and higher mortgage funding costs, partially offset by higher investment fee revenue. We're seeing good momentum in non-interest revenue, which was up 11% as we benefited from higher investment assets across regions, driven by increased client activity, as well as market valuation. Expenses were up 3% driven by technology investments focused on risk and controls, as well as platform enhancements, partially offset by the initial benefits of expense reduction as we continue to right-size the workforce. Cost of credit was a benefit of $170 million, driven by a reserve release of approximately $200 million, primarily related to a change in estimate, as we enhanced our data related to margin lending collateral. Net income was $150 million. End of period, client balances increased 6% driven by higher client investment assets. Average loans were flat as we continue to optimize capital usage. Average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting lower deposits in the private bank and Wealth at Work, and the continued shift of deposits to higher yielding investments on Citi's platform, which more than offset the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB. Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by net new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuation. RoTCE was 4.6% for the quarter. Looking ahead, we're going to improve the returns of our wealth business by executing on our three foundational priorities. As Jane mentioned, this will take time, but over the medium to longer term, we view this as a greater than 20% return business. On Slide 16, we show the results for U.S. Personal Banking for the first quarter. U.S. Personal Banking revenues increased 10% driven by NII growth of 8%, and lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues increased 7%, driven by interest earning balance growth of 10%, as payment rates continue to moderate. And we continue to see healthy growth in spend volumes up 4%, primarily driven by our more affluent customers. Retail services revenues increased 18%, primarily driven by lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses, as well as interest earning balance growth of 9%. Retail banking revenues increased 1% driven by higher deposit spreads, loan growth, and improved mortgage margins. Expenses were roughly flat due to lower compensation costs, including repositioning, offset by higher volume related expenses. Cost of credit of approximately $2.2 billion increased 34%, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic and are now maturing. In branded cards, the NCL rate came in at 3.65%, in-line with our expectations. In retail services, the NCL rate of 6.32% was slightly above the high end of our guidance range for the full year and will likely remain above the range in the second quarter, reflecting historical seasonality patterns. However, given the persistent inflation, higher interest rates, and continued sales pressure at our partners, we now expect to be closer to the high end of the full year NCL guidance range for retail service. This expectation, along with the continued mix shift from transactors to revolvers across both portfolios, led to an ACL build of approximately $340 million. Net income decreased to $347 million. Average deposits decreased 10% and as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business more than offset the underlying growth. RoTCE for the quarter was 5.5%. We recognize that this business is facing a number of headwinds from a regulatory perspective and from higher credit costs given where we are in the credit cycle, both of which are putting pressure on returns for the quarter and for the full year 2024. However, this doesn't impact our longer-term view of the business. We feel good about our position as a prime and lend-centric issuer. We will continue to take mitigating actions to manage through the headwinds, [lap] (ph) the credit cycle, and drive more value from retail banking and retail services, while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business, all of which will ultimately result in a higher returning business over the medium-term. On Slide 17, we show results for All Other, on a Managed Basis, which includes corporate other and legacy franchises, and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 9%, primarily driven by closed exits and wind-downs, as well as higher funding costs, partially offset by higher revenue in Mexico. And expenses increased 18%, primarily driven by the incremental FDIC special assessment and restructuring charges, partially offset by lower expenses from the wind-down and exit markets. Slide 18 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance, both of which remain unchanged. We have accomplished a lot over the past few years and have made substantial progress on simplifying our business and organizational structure. The year is off to a good start as we are laser focused on executing the transformation and enhancing the business performance. These two priorities will not only enable us to be a more efficient, agile company, but a client-centric one that brings together the best of Citi to drive revenue growth and improve return. And we are on the path to reach our 11% to 12% return target over the medium-term. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Well, you just finished your seven months of your org simplification and you said 7,000 positions go away with $1.5 billion of expense savings. So that's very concrete, but more generally after 20 years, 30 years, 40 years of matrix structure down to five lines of business, you're reporting these differently, you're talking about them differently. But the question that I think a lot of people have is, are you simply reporting these lines of business differently or are you actually running them differently? Thanks.\nJane Fraser: Thank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through, it is what we said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes, not only to the organization model that we have, but how we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy. It's simplified the bank, it's eliminated needless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance, as you can see. It's increased accountability. And very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients, but also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us. So maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive. The first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and that eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer. And we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run end-to-end under the direct management of those five business heads, an example being operations. And -- it's enabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end-to-end and total P&L focus, so focus on the bottom-line and the returns, driving growth, expense discipline, et cetera. We also right place businesses to align with the strategy. So banking, all being under one umbrella, the investment bank, the corporate bank, commercial bank, really helping us drive synergies there. Putting finance, F&S and securitization into markets so that we have a unified spread product there, also beginning to see the benefits of that this quarter. So that's an example on the businesses, but I do want to highlight a couple of other areas around this change. So by eliminating the regional layer and putting in a far slimmer, lighter management structure in place in the geographies. That's enabled us to make sure that our countries are focused on client delivery and legal entity management. And we've eliminated the whole shadow geographic P&L. We've eliminated a large number of committees in the geographies. And this is where a lot of the functional and management roles were streamlined and eliminated through the last seven months. And we also broke the regions into smaller, lighter clusters. And that allows us to much better capture the big changes in trade flows and financial flows, et cetera, we're seeing around the world. It's just much nimbler. The third piece, we created the client organizations. So that organization makes sure that our core capabilities and disciplines are being applied firm-wide to drive revenue synergies. And then the governance has got a lot easier. It took up a lot of time. And we've given much clearer mandates in that we've more than halved the number of committees. That's 200 committees plus that we've eliminated in the firm, either by consolidating them or eliminating them. The spans and layers, if you exclude me, 98% of the firm now operates within eight layers. That is a much, much faster decision-making. It's much quicker to get execution done. It also means that you can very quickly get closer to where the engine [room] (ph) of the firm is. We've got clearer accountabilities, we've eliminated most co-heads, we've reduced matrix reporting, we've got the producer to non-producer ratio improved. So all of this really means, as I've said, a clearer deck, so we can be laser-focused on business performance in those five businesses and the transformation. It already feels different. Around my table, I'm much closer to the businesses and the clients. It makes it much easier for Mark and I and the rest of the team to run the bank like an operator versus the head of a holding company. You don't have to go through these aggregator layers to get things done. And we're done, as we said we would be at this point, we're wrapping up the final consultation period, not an easy few months with the organization. We've had to say goodbye to some very good people. We put a lot of change through the organization. And now as we close the chapter on this, we look forward to being back in BAU mode, again continuing to drive improvements in simplification and processes and alike. But now the focus is going to be really getting the full benefit from all the changes we've made in business and organization and moving forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from Glenn Schorr at Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks very much. Yes, so I think it shows how much you've helped us, see the simpler organization. I think people have totally bought into the expense story, so a lot of credit for you guys. I think where I personally and others still have questions on is, on the revenue side and getting to those 4% to 5% medium-term targets. So could you take us just conceptually where we're going to -- where you think you'll drive that growth from this baseline where we're at now? And if you want, you can totally use my second question in there and tell us what good things you're doing inside the Investment Banking line to help tease out one of the [industry] (ph)?\nJane Fraser: It's not that one in, Glenn. So I'll kick off with some of this, pass it to Mark and then I'll come back to banking. So look, we are laser focused on the growth and improving the returns of these businesses to where they should and will be in the medium-term. And it's not just the growth story, but let me anchor it in those medium-term return targets. In services, we want to continue around the mid-20s in RoTCE. Banking should be getting to around 15%. Markets 10% to 13%. So we'd like to see at the higher end of that range. USPB getting that back to the mid-teens and then moving on to the high teens in the medium-term. And then lastly, as Andy and Mark have talked about getting wealth to a 15% to 20% return in the medium-term, but the goals to the mid-20s in the longer-term here. And we're confident that our strategy is going to drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5% CAGR in the medium-term. And that's a combination of maintaining our leadership in certain businesses, gaining shares in others. We have good client growth. Look at our win rate for example in TTS at over 80%. We've got our commercial bank also bringing in new clients in the mid-market and helping them accelerate their growth and success around the world. But Mark, let me pass it over to you.\nMark Mason: Sure. And good morning, Glenn. And we appreciate the acknowledgement around the expenses. As you know, we've been quite focused on that and working hard to ensure that we deliver on what we say, we're going to do there. I'd point on the revenue line, I'd first point to, if you look back since Investor Day, we've in fact been able to deliver on the guidance that we've given for the medium-term, so that 4% to 5% top-line growth. And yes, it was a different rate environment, but that growth that we delivered over the past couple of years has been a mix of both revenue and underlying business strength. As you think about the guidance we talked about for this year, we talked about the NII ex-markets being down modestly. And so what that means is that the momentum and the growth that we expect is going to come from the non-interest revenue. And I think this quarter, is a good example of where and how that\u2019s likely to play through. So the revenue topline being up 3 plus percent. But when you look through each of the businesses and if you look on each of the pages where we disclosed the revenue, you can see the underlying NIR growth in the bottom left hand corner of each of those pages that's coming through as well. So security services up 14% with growth in both TTS between cross-border clearing commercial cards, but also -- and security services, right, with the growth that we're seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody. We expect that trend to continue with existing clients and more -- and new clients, as well as how we do more with our commercial market -- commercial middle market business excuse me. So NIR growth there, the investment banking pieces, the other driver of fees, we\u2019re seeing that while it start to rebound, we\u2019re part of that rebound, the announced transactions were part of those in sectors that we've been investing in. We're bringing in new talent to help us realize and experience that. And even in wealth, where we're not pleased with the top-line performance this quarter, down 4%. When you look through that, we do have good underlying NII growth in the quarter in wealth, and that's up 11% year-over-year. And it's in the area that Andy and the team is leaning in on, which is investments, and not just in one region, but across all the regions. And then finally, the USPB piece, which is showing good NII growth as well. So the long and short of it is that the 4% growth that's implied in $80 billion to $81 billion, is going to be continued momentum, largely in fees, helping us to deliver for our clients and make continued progress towards that medium-term target.\nJane Fraser: So let me pick up the [side] (ph). I'm sure Jenn Landis will give us the evil eye for sneaking in a second question there, Glenn, but let me pick up on banking and what's going on there. So we have a very clear strategy that we've been executing over the last couple of years, really to lay the foundation for growth in banking. North America is our key priority. It's the biggest contributor to the global IB wallet. Tech, health care, and industrials are likely to constitute over 50% of the fee wallet going forward. So we have better aligned our resources to position the franchise for this, defending areas of traditional strength in industrials and the like energy, whilst investing in high-growth sectors such as healthcare and technology with some strong talent. Financial sponsors are sitting on $3 trillion of estimated firepower, which they are incentivized to deploy. So they're likely to be between 20% to 30% of global investment banking fees. We have great relationships with this community. We have built that over years and decades. You are going to see us more active in the LevFin space, in the right situations for our key clients, and we will continue to ensure we are well-positioned to active around this important opportunity. You'll likely see us seeking to remain competitive in the private capital asset class, that can be an important source of liquidity for many clients. And the middle market will be fertile hunting ground for corporates and private equity. And our investment bank and commercial bank are going to be closely coordinated to harvest the deal flow around the world. And indeed, the new org structure that I was just talking about really enables us to drive a more joined-up, client-centric strategic coverage across corporate, commercial, and investment banking. So over and above the wallet recovery, Mark and I can be very laser focused on ensuring that we're driving revenue growth from a more holistic focus on the wallet share across flow and episodic activity. Vis Raghavan is the right person to take over at this important moment for our banking franchise. The momentum that we've been generating with the foundations we've been laying, the intention here from him is to accelerate that. He will focus on increasing our performance intensity, driving productivity and discipline growth and he will keep us firmly on the path towards delivering on our commitments, fundamentally improving the operating margin, generating higher returns and that all-important fee revenue.\nOperator: Our next question is from Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning. Or, yes -- we're almost pinging into the afternoon here.\nJane Fraser: Hi Betsy.\nMark Mason: Great to hear you, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I guess a couple of questions. Well, I know we talked through the institutional securities business already on moving that expense ratio a little bit. Could we dig in a little bit on the wealth side, because the expense ratio there is running a little higher, and so it would be useful just to understand the pace or speed or timeframe when we should expect to see that start to inflect?\nJane Fraser: Yes, absolutely. And some of it, just as a reminder, the actions that we've been taking on org simplification and that Andy's also been taking in the wealth business. We will work through notice periods in the coming weeks, and so you'll see the impact coming through in our headcount numbers, and in wealth and the expense base next quarter. Look, As Mark said in his opening and Andy's been talking about, this should be a sort of up to a 30% pre-tax margin business. Andy's focused on rationalizing the expense base. He's also, as Mark said, turning on the growth engine, he's enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience. The heart of the opportunity for us lies with our existing clients. They are an extraordinary client base, but they're under-penetrated. So [now] (ph) the operating efficiency is frankly going to be -- is going to come on the revenue side here. That said, Andy's taken a number of pretty decisive moves this quarter on the expense side. Mark, let me pass it over to you.\nMark Mason: Yes, I mean, look, I think that the quarter expenses that you see of growth of 3% is not yet reflective of the work that Andy has been steadfast at. There is still some investment in there in technology and in the platform that's important, but I think coming out of the first quarter you'll start to see some of the reduction in expenses that's a byproduct of that work. And the work has been across the entire expense base in the wealth business. So that includes non-client-facing roles and support staff. It includes looking at the productivity of existing bankers and advisors. And those kind of reductions will start to play out in the subsequent quarters. I do want to point out, as Jane mentioned, this is a growth business for us. And so you can see on some of the metrics on page 15, the bottom left, some of those good signs of investment momentum. And I highlight that because as the expenses come down from some of those efficiencies, there will be a need for us to continue to invest and replenish low-performing or low-producing bankers and advisors with resources that actually can generate the revenues we expect and take advantage of the client opportunity that's in front of us. So long-winded way of saying, there's some operating efficiency upside for us for sure is a combination of the top-line and the expense we\u2019re playing through the balance of the quarters in the year here.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jim Mitchell at Seaport Global. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJim Mitchell: Okay, good morning. Jane and Mark, I very much appreciate the comments on your growth opportunities and driving growth, but revenues are often dictated by the macro that \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit out of your control. Can you talk a little bit about the flexibility on the expenses, you have a range in 2026 of [51 to 53] (ph), So if revenues are coming in below the targets, is it, I guess, a, fair to assume you'd be at the very low end of that range, or is it -- and I think there is some revenue growth built in there. So is there some flexibility to the downside to try to get your targets in a tougher revenue environment? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Yeah, look I mean with the top-line growth as you've heard us say, is a CAGR of 4% to 5%. We put that target out there [51 to 53] (ph) as a range of what we're working towards. We're given you a good sense of how we expect to get there with the $2 billion to $2.5 billion reduction by then. We've already signaled the $1.5 billion that's in front of us. The reality is that if there's softness in revenues, that's why we have a range. Obviously, the volume-related expenses would come down with any softness in revenue. And depending on the drivers of why that revenue is softening, we'd look at the investments that we're making across the business and make sure that those are appropriately calibrated for where we are in the cycle and what we're seeing on the top-line. With that said, we've got to continue to invest in the transformation. We're not going to compromise that. That's going to be something that we have to spend on to ensure we continue to get right. But that's kind of how the dynamic works. There's a top, we've got a mix of businesses that I think we've demonstrated resiliency around if you think about the past couple of years. And we expect for those to continue to drive some top-line momentum but we've got levers in case they don't.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala at Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thank you. I guess just one question, Mark. Around capital. So you talked about [$13 billion] over the Reg. minimum. You could easily be doing 2 times the buyback you did in one quarter, if not more. I know you don't like to talk about out quarters, but give us a sense of, at least this quarter, should we expect the pace of buybacks to increase and if you could provide additional color as we think about the rest of the year would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nMark Mason: Sure, look \u2013 and I've said it repeatedly, Jane has said it repeatedly given where we trade, we think buying back is smart and we'd like to do as much as we possibly can and -- as much as makes sense, in light of the uncertainty that's out there. We have run at about [$13.5 billion] (ph) this quarter. That does give us capacity above the [$13.3 billion] (ph). (Technical Difficulty) we want to make sure we can support the clients that want to do business with us, whether that be in markets or other parts of the franchise. And then there's still uncertainty out there about how the capital regulation evolves. The good news is, we are hearing kind of favorable things about how the Basel III endgame proposal could evolve, but that hasn't happened yet. It's not finalized. It's not in place yet. And so we want to see how that continues to play out. We're obviously in the midst of a CCAR process. We want to see how that evolves. And we'll continue to take the buyback decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but we recognize that there's an opportunity there and we'll get after it just as soon as it makes good sense for us.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erika Najarian at UBS. Please unmute your line and ask your question.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good afternoon. Hey. So, you know, clearly the theme of this -- that's emerging on the Q&A is, you know, a healthy skepticism about the revenue targets in-line with the, in light of the expense declines, which you know, it's not really as analysts, where we're sort of a little bit [parroting] (ph) what we're hearing from long-only investors that haven't yet you know jumped into the stock. So to that end I guess I'm going to ask Ebrahim's question differently then ask a question about card late fees. How are you balancing, clearly your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from $500 million, but growing revenues at a 4% to 5% CAGR, you know, would mean potentially some capital clawback into the business. I guess, how are you balancing that, especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at Citi than any other money center peer. And could you give us a sense of what card late fees are and, you know, how that would impact the $80 billion to $81 billion for the year, if we do get an earlier implementation in October?\nMark Mason: Yeah, thank you, Erika. On the first part of the question, I just remind you and everyone else that we're playing for the long-term here, right? So we have set some medium-term targets. Obviously, Jane has re-casted the vision and the strategy. I think we're making very good progress against that. But we're playing for the long-term. And what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise. It's why I've given you a range around the expenses at least in part. It's why I've continued to stress the importance of protecting the transformation and risk and control spend. And it's why, I started the answer to Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there where the returns to do so makes sense. And so we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other resources against that longer-term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good returns against the idea of returning that to shareholders. And so this will continue to do that. It's an everyday assessment. It's an everyday discussion with the teams. Frankly, it's why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the clients that we're using balance sheet with and ensuring that we're driving broader revenues across the platform. And so that's kind of how we're operating in terms of making that trade-off on a regular basis, in addition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that we're in. In terms of the second part of your question around late fees, we haven't disclosed kind of the dollar amount of the late fees. What I would say is that we did and have factored that into the $80 billion to $81 billion. And the only thing I'd add to that is, it did kind of -- it's being implemented a bit earlier than what we had assumed, but again, it's inside of the range of the guidance that I've given you for top-line revenue for the year.\nJane Fraser: And also just as a reminder, 85% of our [two-CCAR] (ph) portfolios are prime. And in CRS, where you tend to see some of the lower income households, we do have that -- the economics of the fee change will be shared with our partners in CRS. So we want our customers to pay on time with a number of mechanisms to do so. But in terms of the economics, I think we, along with the rest of the industry, will be putting in mitigating actions over time, some of which we've already begun to implement.\nOperator: Our next question is from John McDonald at Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn McDonald: Thanks. Mark, I was hoping you'd give a little more color on how you're feeling about the credit card charge-offs. You maintained the outlook for the year. You mentioned the higher end on retail services. You still feel like -- you'll see a peak this year and what kind of metrics are you looking at in terms of delinquency formation and seasoning to inform that view that you might see the peak in card charge-offs this year?\nMark Mason: Yeah, thanks, John. We have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively. We've seen continued top-line growth, we've seen continued average interest earnings, balance growth. We've talked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The range that we've given on branded cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the portfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so we're watching the lower income customer profile or customers that we have. But again, as Jane mentioned, we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with. Where we're really seeing the pressure is where I mentioned in terms of retail services. And so there, the current NCLs are higher than the high end of the full year range that I've given. But if you look back, that is not inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio where the first two quarters are higher than the back half of the year, in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses tend to mature or materialize through that process. And so I\u2019d expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in Q1, but also in Q2 before coming down. And then I still expect that in 2025, you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off of these ranges. But look, the reality is that we continue to watch it in the factors that are out there, that are important include how unemployment evolves, what happens with inflation, what happens with interest rates and those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time. I think the final point I'd make, and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, is that we have to remember that the loss rates in both portfolios reflect multiple vintages maturing at the same time. And you'll recall, and this is an industry dynamic, you know, through the COVID and pandemic period, losses were at an all-time low, payment rates at all-time highs, supported by government stimulus. And now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature albeit at a lagged pace from what would be normal. And we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done, start to mature at their normal pace. And so these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact, and that's an important factor we can't lose sight of. But the bottom-line is that we're watching it. The macro factors matter. We feel good about the quality mix that we have and we'll kind of see how things evolve from here.\nJohn McDonald: Okay, and on the branded side, you still expect kind of the peak this year. You're still inside of the range for the full year and expect 2025, you could move lower on the branded charge-offs?\nMark Mason: Yes, I still kind of expect that trend line of peaking and then kind of moving a bit lower in branded.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Usdin at Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Great, thanks. Can I follow up on the card line of thinking and just ask you, Mark, to talk a little bit about just cost of credit? We did still see some card-related build this quarter, even with the comments you just made and seasonal softer loan growth. So just from a bigger picture perspective, how do you think -- continue to think about reserve builds from here and how that informs your outlook for cost of credit?\nMark Mason: Yeah, sure. Look, I think that, you know, when I think about the reserve builds, I think it's the same factors that come into play. So obviously the view on the macro is important. And right now, if you think about some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio, the unemployment assumption weighted is about 5%, the downside is about you know 7% kind of weighted over the period. And so feel -- how that evolves will be an important factor. How [HPI] (ph) evolves will be, you know, important consideration here for this portfolio. But also what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they increase or decrease. And then the final piece is mix, and it's kind of related to that revolver point. As we see the mix evolve from transactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve, from a lifetime point of view, we have to continue to build. And so it's -- why I mentioned on John's question, you know, the importance of looking at, you know, the interest rates looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base, because all of those things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the reserves. But I will say, Ken, as I sit here and think about what we have in the quarter, I feel very good about the reserve levels. The 8.2% for combined kind of, you know, ACL to loan ratio feels right for the mix of this portfolio, and we'll continue to watch it.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And a separate question on TTS. That NII related to TTS has been remarkable with rising rates. This quarter, granted there was a lesser day and there could be currency stuff in there, the first quarter that it stepped back, I'm just wondering like where is that in its asset liability sensitivity, the TTS-NII, and what are your thoughts about that piece of the NII puzzle going forward? Thanks.\nMark Mason: Sure. Yeah, I think I'd say a couple things. We do have some Argentina playing through the NII line. I will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying beta activity. And we have seen, this is a corporate client, it is an institutional client, we have seen betas, particularly in the US, at kind of normalized or terminal levels and playing a bit through that. We are seeing betas outside of the U.S., continue to increase as it relates to the TTS client base. But all of that, again, is inside of the range that we've talked about. I don't expect to see kind of year-over-year growth on the NII line anywhere close to kind of what we've seen in prior years, prior quarters, just in light of kind of how the rate environments evolved and in light of kind of quantitative tightening \u2013 and tightening and the impact on deposit levels. The last point I'd make on this is, we will continue to drive and see growth as it relates to the operating deposits. And that'll be an important tailwind that kind of plays through.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vivek Juneja at JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, thank you. Jane, Mark, just a question maybe on Argentina. You had -- you've shown $100 million in NII, total net income benefit of $500 million after tax, so probably implying about $500 million, $600 million of non-interest income benefit. Which line item -- sorry, which segment did that come through and is that sustainable?\nMark Mason: Yeah, look, there's a mix obviously of things that are driving that net income, including a tax impact on the heels of last year Argentina devaluation activity that's in that line. But the short answer is that you know if you think about the nature of the business that we do in Argentina, it is a big part of our institutional client relationships. And the primary activities include some of the TTS type of activities that we've talked about, so liquidity management payments, custody within the services business. And so you'd see a good portion of the activity in Argentina playing through the services business, some of it in markets as well, but again, the majority of the activity in services.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thanks so much. Our next question is from Scott Siefers at Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nScott Siefers: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I think you touched on at least a component of this a couple questions ago, but maybe just broadly an update on your rate positioning. I guess I only ask because it looks like we might be starting to diverge in terms of global rate trajectories, if we potentially go, lower in Europe but higher here for a while. In the aggregate, do these kind of complicate your management or make you feel better or worse about the overall NII momentum for the company?\nMark Mason: Yeah, let me try and take it in two pieces, I guess. So one is, if I think about how the rate implies have evolved from the three to six to now something a little bit north of one, in the context of what I expect for our performance. It doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81 billion. And in part, that's because, as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally backloaded, as well as some of the other factors that play through. So, you know, Argentina just announced a policy rate reduction yesterday or a couple of days ago. If rates are a bit higher for longer, we'll watch how the betas continue to evolve. I mentioned earlier the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner. Late fees are actually booked in our NII line and so those factors you know put me in a place where I feel like, there'll certainly be puts and takes around how that rate curves evolve, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the guidance where it is. To answer your broader question in terms of kind of how we're positioned, you know, I'd point you to the 10-K that we have that's out -- and in that 10-K, we offer as we have before a number of IRE scenarios for plus or minus 100 basis points and what it means for our business. And if you look at it, you'll see that for the aggregate firm, for Citi, U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar, that we're asset sensitive. So as rates increase, we should see an increase in our NII performance. But if you look at the breakdown, and that's about, I think it was about a [$1.4 billion] (ph) or something in terms of the impact of that move. But if you look at the breakdown, what the breakdown will show is that for U.S. dollar, at this point, we're neutral. So if rates were to go up, rates were to go down, no material impact as it relates to our revenue. For the non-U.S. dollar, we're still quite asset sensitive, right. And so that should give you some sense for at that -- and we recognize the limitations with IRE, it assumes, you know, a 100 basis point parallel shift across the curve, the static balance sheet, et cetera. But that should give you some sense for the implications of the rate curve moves as it relates to our book of business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy at RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi Mark, hi Jane.\nJane Fraser: Hi, Gerard.\nMark Mason: Hi Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Mark, can you share with us, there's been obviously a lot of conversation around the credit card charge-offs and the credit quality there. If we could shift over to the corporate side, which obviously is very strong. We've seen spreads narrow in the markets on high-yield corporate debt, leveraged debt, et cetera. It's very robust out there, but around the global geopolitical risk, do you think the spreads would be widening. Can you guys share with us what you're seeing in the corporate side in terms of competition, are underwriting standards getting a little weaker now, as people are trying to grow their books, what are you seeing on that front?\nMark Mason: Look, we're still seeing good demand for corporate credit. And what I'd say is that we've been very disciplined about where we want to play on the risk profile here. We've been very disciplined in terms of the investment grade, you know, large multinationals that we serve. And that hasn't shifted from an underwriting point of view. We have seen spaces like private credit pick up quite a bit. And that, I think, will continue to evolve. I think, importantly, as we think about our corporate lending activity, you'll note that, actually, we've been very disciplined about how we want to deploy balance sheet and part of that again is a byproduct of the revenue sharing that we've implemented where there's been healthy debate and discussion around the names that we want to continue to serve and whether they're positioned to take advantage of the broader platform that we have. And so I think the space will continue to evolve. I think there's been good, healthy demand, despite continued strong balance sheets. And part of that demand has been because of where rates are likely to go and continue to evolve. And I think we're well positioned to be thoughtful about that. But Jane, you may want to add a couple points to it.\nJane Fraser: Yeah, look, around the world, the corporate client base and our commercial banking mid-market client base have very healthy balance sheets. And we're also seeing market access gradually opening up as well, which is also helpful for the quality issuers across all asset classes. We've seen both the issuers taking advantage as well as the investors. The deals are well oversubscribed. So that's also been beneficial as corporates think about their financing needs. The other piece I just pop out there as well is the recent large M&A announcements in multiple industries is a sign of rising confidence from CEOs and Boards. And active discussions are increasing as supportive capital markets create confidence as people think about larger strategic transactions. This is going to feed acquisition finance, bridge financing, and some of the higher margin capital markets and lending activity as well. So as we look forward, I think it's recognizing the shift in some of the drivers from companies just investing, refinancing, looking at where they can, diversifying their capital, raising in different quarters. But I just close by saying, I couldn't agree with you more about geopolitical risks and fragility. I think the market's too -- but it's too benign in its risk pricing on some of these factors.\nMark Mason: Important for us to take \u2026\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMatt O'Connor: Hi. In your prepared remarks, you talked about intensifying certain efforts regarding regulatory processes and data on Slide 4 here. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate on, you know, I guess what you're doing or trying to do differently on that front and if there's any meaningful financial impact. Thank you.\nJane Fraser: Yeah, look, I think Matt, as we've talked about many times, the transformation is our top priority. It will be for the next few years. It is foundational for our future success, both in terms of delivering the strategy and the medium-term financial path. And we've been making significant investments behind it, as well as not only in the consent order but also making sure we've got this modern efficient infrastructure. We're currently deep into a very large body of work, upgrading our data architecture, automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms. And all of these help enhance our business performance more broadly, not just the risk and control in the medium-term. As I've said, though -- there are a few areas where we are intensifying our efforts, such as the automation of certain regulatory processes and data remediation, particularly related to regulatory reporting. We're committed to getting these right. The org changes will help us with execution and making sure that we have the impetus and everything that we need behind it, the investments that we need. We keep a close eye on execution, making sure we've got the right level of resourcing and expertise. And we'll invest what we need to do, to make sure that we address these different concerns. I can't go into much more detail in terms of our CSI, obviously, but \u2013 at [some day] (ph) this magnitude, you'd expect us to have some areas where we have good progress and others where we need to intensify efforts.\nMark Mason: Yeah -- I mean, I think that's exactly right. But you'd also expect that in this type of environment and on the heels of the regional bank stress last year that we're looking at stress scenarios, we're enhancing our CCAR processes, we're enhancing our resolution and recovery processes, all of those things just to kind of -- to make sure that we're shoring up capabilities and you'd expect that across the industry quite frankly.\nOperator: Our next question is from Saul Martinez at HSBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSaul Martinez: Hi, good afternoon. I'll change tack a little bit here, but I'm curious if there's any update on the Mexican IPO, and more specifically I'm kind of curious how [set it stone] (ph) the IPO processes -- you will have a new administration and even if the candidate from same-party, she may have a less confrontational view the private sector, perhaps be more allowing a low bank -- local bank to extract value from buying a bank. And, you know, I guess if the facts on the ground were to change, would you be open to a sale potentially being back on the table? Because it does seem like this is a situation where a private market valuation could be higher and even materially higher than a public market valuation.\nJane Fraser: The guiding principle that we have and we've had all along is making sure that we make a decision here that is in the best interest of our shareholders and makes the most sense for them. We are -- we never say never, but we are very focused on the IPO path here. We believe it is the right one for our shareholders. We are well on track in the path in Mexico. We are very pleased to bring Ignacio Deschamps in as the Banamex Chairman to help guide the IPO process. We announced the management teams for the two banks earlier this quarter. We're far down the path of the technological separation of both banks and then the full legal separation in the second half of the year. Obviously, the election is coming up fairly shortly, but we're not anticipating that we would be deviating from the IPO path. That is the path that we are on at the moment. I'll never say never, but we do believe that this is the right one. But we'll keep an eye on what's happening in Mexico as we always do.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Kotowski at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChris Kotowski: Hello and thanks. Just a quick one for Mark. Previously you had talked about quote bending the cost curve, between the third and the fourth quarter of this year. And on this call I thought I heard you say, it's basically bent that second quarter should be down and we should be sequentially lower from here. So did it just happened six months earlier or is there still some other bending that comes late this year.\nMark Mason: I'll take it. I'll take that.\nJane Fraser: Damn. I wanted that one.\nMark Mason: I'll take that. I mean I'll take the win, a downward trajectory from here through the end of the year in-line with the guidance of $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. And so yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Chubak at Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good afternoon. So Mark.\nJane Fraser: Hello, Steven.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. I did want to ask on DFAST and SCB, just recognizing this will be the last opportunity before the results come out. The macro scenario Fed assumptions look quite similar to last year, but just given the significant transformation that's underway, repositioning actions which [admittedly] (ph) depressed earnings last year. I want to get a sense as to whether there are any [IDEO] (ph) factors that could result in greater SCB volatility in the coming exam and just broader thoughts on the longer-term trajectory for the SCB, just given the Org simplification efforts are underway.\nMark Mason: Yes, Steven. The first part of your question is just impossible to answer, to be candid with you, right? We obviously have an internal base scenario we've run. We have a severely adverse scenario that we've run. We've provided a balance sheet as part of the submission, but ultimately, the regulators have to run through their models, the information that we've provided and that informs what happens with the stress capital buffer. And we don't have as much transparency to that as we'd like. And so really hard to call at this stage. The second part of your question, I think is spot on, and I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks, in that we have the medium-term targets that we've set. And we're still in the midst of kind of the execution of our strategy, the evolution of the business mix and the business model. The mix towards more consistent, predictable, and repeatable revenue streams that would impact PPNR, the simplification which obviously plays through an expense base that will be lower, when we get to that medium term period. So all of those things, the divestitures and kind of what that means and how that might impact the G-SIB score and the like, and the freeing up of capital, which we've already freed up, you know, $6 billion or so. And so all of those things have kind of yet to have been factored in. And we believe will be beneficial to the SCB over the medium term.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mayo at Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. A follow-up, Mark. You said, TTS, we said -- we will have growth and operational deposits. And I was just wondering what gives you such confidence that you will or is that accelerating or the same pace or what?\nMark Mason: We have seen growth in the quarter, in operating deposits. The confidence comes from the focus that we've had with our existing clients, as well as the growth we've seen with new clients, doing more with existing and more countries, more deeply penetrating the commercial middle market space. And so we've been very thoughtfully focused on deposits that obviously give us the most value and also provide the most stickiness, as it relates to that relationship. And so yes, the confidence is rooted in what we're seeing in the way of underlying operating deposit growth, including inside this quarter.\nJane Fraser: It's also a lot of the investments that we've been making, fuel a lot of the growth we've got. We have a market leading product innovations and those continue to drive good returns, good growth. If it's Citi Token Services, Citi Payment Express, 24/7 -- all of these different elements really mean that this business is utterly invaluable and indispensable to our clients. And the stickiness of the deposits, and the operating deposits comes with that. So we feel good about that growth. And you'll hear more about this as well, Mike, in the Investor Day in mid-June, which will be, I think we hope will be very helpful to everyone, so you really get your arms around how this business operates, makes money and see why we call it a crown jewel.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vivek Juneja at JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, Mark. A completely different topic because I think I understood your answer to be just for my previous question to be the tax benefits, so we'll leave it at that. I don\u2019t know, if it is different, then I need to go down that path. But the question I signed on to ask was, you talked about the percentage of revolvers increasing from transactors in the private label and the retail partner cards. What is that percentage and how does it compare with what it was pre-pandemic?\nMark Mason: Yeah, I don't -- we haven't broken down the transactor versus revolver mix, and so I'm not going to get into that. I will say that the revolver levels are at least back to where they were pre-pandemic and leave it at that. But we are seeing kind of continued revolver activity which you'd expect kind of given the way the cycle has evolved and given payment rates have started to moderate and the stimulus has kind of unwound and so all of that is kind of consistent with expectations but obviously is a factor in reserve levels as I mentioned earlier.\nOperator: Our final question is from Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Thanks so much. I just wanted to make sure of one thing on the expenses. I know in the past you've talked about the fact that 1Q will be a little elevated with the restructuring, and you showed that was the $225 million in the quarter. And then when we look to 2Q, should we still be expecting a step down in 2Q? And is that step down just the elimination of the $225 million? Or is there some restructuring that we're likely to see in 2Q as well? In other words, should I just fade sequentially 2Q, 3Q, 4Q to hit your annual number? Or is there a bigger step down in 2Q that I should still be expecting here, thanks.\nMark Mason: Sure, I think you should just fade it to answer your question very directly. But I'd also point out that, you know, in Q1, if you really look through to it, it has the $250 million of FDIC charge in it. And so when you back that out, we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided. All right? Despite that, I'm telling you the same -- I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the end of the year. And while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity around repositioning that plays through. So hopefully, that answers your question, Betsy. The guidance still holds and the downward trend is what we are managing towards as we kind of play out the balance of the year.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks.\nJennifer Landis : Thank you all for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please call us and we look forward to talking to you. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes the Citi First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jane Fraser",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Today, I'm going to touch on the macroeconomic environment before I update you on the progress we're making, and then I'll discuss the quarter. While global economic performance was surprisingly [desynchronized] (ph) last year, the overall story has been consistent of late, one of economic resiliency supported by tight labor markets and the consumer. Growth this year looks poised to slow in many markets, and conditions are generally disinflationary. We're already seeing some Central Banks in the emerging markets starting to cut rates. In the U.S., a soft landing is viewed as increasingly, likely. But we continue to see a tale of two Europe's, with Germany hurt by the weak demand for goods, while southern European countries such as Spain and Greece benefit from stronger demand in services. In Asia, Japan is joining in the [areas of] (ph) bright spot, and China's economy has gained some more traction, although its property market remains a concern. Amidst all these dynamics, we continue to focus on executing against our strategy and delivering the best of Citi to all our stakeholders. I said 2024 will be a pivotal year for us, as we put our business and organizational simplification largely behind us and we focus on two main priorities. The transformation and the performance of our businesses and the firm. Last month marked the end to the organizational simplification that we announced in September. The result is a cleaner, simpler management structure that fully aligns to and facilitates our strategy. We are now more client-centric. We're already seeing faster decision making and a nimbler organization at work. We have clear lines of accountability, starting with my management team. Fewer layers, increased spans of control and frankly much less bureaucracy and needless complexity. It will all help us run the company more efficiently, will enhance our clients' experience and improve our agility and ability to execute. And while reducing expenses wasn't the primary driver of the program, more roles were ultimately impacted than the 5,000 that we discussed in January. We also took a number of other steps to sharpen our business focus and improve returns by right-placing businesses to better capture synergies, exiting certain businesses in markets that just didn't fit with our strategy, and right-sizing the workforce in wealth. As a result of all these combined steps, which include the simplification, we are eliminating approximately 7,000 positions, which will generate $1.5 billion of annualized run rate expense saves. The combination of these actions and the measures we're taking to eliminate our remaining stranded costs will drive $2 billion to $2.5 billion in cumulative annualized run rate saves in the medium-term. We are keeping a close eye on the execution of these efforts and overall resourcing to ensure we safeguard our commitment to the transformation. As you know, given its magnitude and scale, the transformation is a multi-year effort to address issues that have spanned over two decades. We've made steady progress as we retire multiple legacy platforms, streamline end-to-end processes, and strengthen our risk and control environment, all of which are necessary not only to meet the expectations of our regulators, but also to serve our clients more effectively. A transformation of this magnitude, well it's never linear. So while we've made good progress in many areas, there are a few where we are intensifying our efforts, such as automating certain regulatory processes and the data related to regulatory reporting. We're committed to getting these right and we'll look to self-fund the necessary investments to do so. Turning to the quarter, we had a good start to a pivotal year. We reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, earnings per share of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on over $21 billion of revenues. Our revenues were up over 3% year-over-year, excluding divestitures, which was primarily the $1 billion gain from the India consumer sale last year. Our expenses were slightly down quarter-over-quarter, excluding the FDIC special assessments. Services continues to perform well and generate very attractive returns. Revenue was up 8% for the quarter as both businesses won new mandates and deepened relationships with existing clients. Fees were up a pleasing 10% for services year-over-year driven by the investments we've made across our product offering platforms and client experience. In Securities Services, we took share again this quarter, and in TTS, cross-border activity continued to outpace global GDP growth and commercial card spend remained robust. We look forward to diving deeper into these two businesses at our investor presentation on services in June. Markets bounced back from a tough final quarter in \u201823. While revenues were down 7% as lower volatility impacted rates and currencies, that was off a very strong first quarter last year. We saw good client activity in equities and in spread products, where both new issuance and securitization activity were particularly robust. We fully integrated our financing and securitization capabilities within our markets business and we started to see the benefits of having a unified spread product offering for our clients. The rebound in banking gained speed during the quarter, led by near record levels of investment grade debt issuance, as improved market conditions enabled issuers to pull forward activity. And after a bit of a slow start, ECM picked up in the second half of the quarter, notably in convertibles. Our strong performance in both DCM and ECM drove investment banking revenue growth of 35% and overall banking revenue growth of 49%. While M&A revenues are still low across The Street, I was pleased that we participated in some of the significant deals announced in the quarter, such as Diamondback's merger with Endeavor Energy and Catalent's merger with Nova Holdings. We are cautiously optimistic that we could see a measured reopening of the IPO market in the second quarter in light of improved market valuation. Thank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through, it is what we said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes, not only to the organization model that we have, but how we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy. It's simplified the bank, it's eliminated needless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance, as you can see. It's increased accountability. And very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients, but also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us. So maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive. The first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and that eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer. And we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run end-to-end under the direct management of those five business heads, an example being operations. And -- it's enabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end-to-end and total P&L focus, so focus on the bottom-line and the returns, driving growth, expense discipline, et cetera. We also right place businesses to align with the strategy. So banking, all being under one umbrella, the investment bank, the corporate bank, commercial bank, really helping us drive synergies there. Putting finance, F&S and securitization into markets so that we have a unified spread product there, also beginning to see the benefits of that this quarter. So that's an example on the businesses, but I do want to highlight a couple of other areas around this change. So by eliminating the regional layer and putting in a far slimmer, lighter management structure in place in the geographies. That's enabled us to make sure that our countries are focused on client delivery and legal entity management. And we've eliminated the whole shadow geographic P&L. We've eliminated a large number of committees in the geographies. And this is where a lot of the functional and management roles were streamlined and eliminated through the last seven months. And we also broke the regions into smaller, lighter clusters. And that allows us to much better capture the big changes in trade flows and financial flows, et cetera, we're seeing around the world. It's just much nimbler. The third piece, we created the client organizations. So that organization makes sure that our core capabilities and disciplines are being applied firm-wide to drive revenue synergies. And then the governance has got a lot easier. It took up a lot of time. And we've given much clearer mandates in that we've more than halved the number of committees. That's 200 committees plus that we've eliminated in the firm, either by consolidating them or eliminating them. The spans and layers, if you exclude me, 98% of the firm now operates within eight layers. That is a much, much faster decision-making. It's much quicker to get execution done. It also means that you can very quickly get closer to where the engine [room] (ph) of the firm is. We've got clearer accountabilities, we've eliminated most co-heads, we've reduced matrix reporting, we've got the producer to non-producer ratio improved. So all of this really means, as I've said, a clearer deck, so we can be laser-focused on business performance in those five businesses and the transformation. It already feels different. Around my table, I'm much closer to the businesses and the clients. It makes it much easier for Mark and I and the rest of the team to run the bank like an operator versus the head of a holding company. You don't have to go through these aggregator layers to get things done. And we're done, as we said we would be at this point, we're wrapping up the final consultation period, not an easy few months with the organization. We've had to say goodbye to some very good people. We put a lot of change through the organization. And now as we close the chapter on this, we look forward to being back in BAU mode, again continuing to drive improvements in simplification and processes and alike. But now the focus is going to be really getting the full benefit from all the changes we've made in business and organization and moving forward. It's not that one in, Glenn. So I'll kick off with some of this, pass it to Mark and then I'll come back to banking. So look, we are laser focused on the growth and improving the returns of these businesses to where they should and will be in the medium-term. And it's not just the growth story, but let me anchor it in those medium-term return targets. In services, we want to continue around the mid-20s in RoTCE. Banking should be getting to around 15%. Markets 10% to 13%. So we'd like to see at the higher end of that range. USPB getting that back to the mid-teens and then moving on to the high teens in the medium-term. And then lastly, as Andy and Mark have talked about getting wealth to a 15% to 20% return in the medium-term, but the goals to the mid-20s in the longer-term here. And we're confident that our strategy is going to drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5% CAGR in the medium-term. And that's a combination of maintaining our leadership in certain businesses, gaining shares in others. We have good client growth. Look at our win rate for example in TTS at over 80%. We've got our commercial bank also bringing in new clients in the mid-market and helping them accelerate their growth and success around the world. But Mark, let me pass it over to you. So let me pick up the [side] (ph). I'm sure Jenn Landis will give us the evil eye for sneaking in a second question there, Glenn, but let me pick up on banking and what's going on there. So we have a very clear strategy that we've been executing over the last couple of years, really to lay the foundation for growth in banking. North America is our key priority. It's the biggest contributor to the global IB wallet. Tech, health care, and industrials are likely to constitute over 50% of the fee wallet going forward. So we have better aligned our resources to position the franchise for this, defending areas of traditional strength in industrials and the like energy, whilst investing in high-growth sectors such as healthcare and technology with some strong talent. Financial sponsors are sitting on $3 trillion of estimated firepower, which they are incentivized to deploy. So they're likely to be between 20% to 30% of global investment banking fees. We have great relationships with this community. We have built that over years and decades. You are going to see us more active in the LevFin space, in the right situations for our key clients, and we will continue to ensure we are well-positioned to active around this important opportunity. You'll likely see us seeking to remain competitive in the private capital asset class, that can be an important source of liquidity for many clients. And the middle market will be fertile hunting ground for corporates and private equity. And our investment bank and commercial bank are going to be closely coordinated to harvest the deal flow around the world. And indeed, the new org structure that I was just talking about really enables us to drive a more joined-up, client-centric strategic coverage across corporate, commercial, and investment banking. So over and above the wallet recovery, Mark and I can be very laser focused on ensuring that we're driving revenue growth from a more holistic focus on the wallet share across flow and episodic activity. Vis Raghavan is the right person to take over at this important moment for our banking franchise. The momentum that we've been generating with the foundations we've been laying, the intention here from him is to accelerate that. He will focus on increasing our performance intensity, driving productivity and discipline growth and he will keep us firmly on the path towards delivering on our commitments, fundamentally improving the operating margin, generating higher returns and that all-important fee revenue. Hi Betsy. Yes, absolutely. And some of it, just as a reminder, the actions that we've been taking on org simplification and that Andy's also been taking in the wealth business. We will work through notice periods in the coming weeks, and so you'll see the impact coming through in our headcount numbers, and in wealth and the expense base next quarter. Look, As Mark said in his opening and Andy's been talking about, this should be a sort of up to a 30% pre-tax margin business. Andy's focused on rationalizing the expense base. He's also, as Mark said, turning on the growth engine, he's enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience. The heart of the opportunity for us lies with our existing clients. They are an extraordinary client base, but they're under-penetrated. So [now] (ph) the operating efficiency is frankly going to be -- is going to come on the revenue side here. That said, Andy's taken a number of pretty decisive moves this quarter on the expense side. Mark, let me pass it over to you. And also just as a reminder, 85% of our [two-CCAR] (ph) portfolios are prime. And in CRS, where you tend to see some of the lower income households, we do have that -- the economics of the fee change will be shared with our partners in CRS. So we want our customers to pay on time with a number of mechanisms to do so. But in terms of the economics, I think we, along with the rest of the industry, will be putting in mitigating actions over time, some of which we've already begun to implement. Hi, Gerard. Yeah, look, around the world, the corporate client base and our commercial banking mid-market client base have very healthy balance sheets. And we're also seeing market access gradually opening up as well, which is also helpful for the quality issuers across all asset classes. We've seen both the issuers taking advantage as well as the investors. The deals are well oversubscribed. So that's also been beneficial as corporates think about their financing needs. The other piece I just pop out there as well is the recent large M&A announcements in multiple industries is a sign of rising confidence from CEOs and Boards. And active discussions are increasing as supportive capital markets create confidence as people think about larger strategic transactions. This is going to feed acquisition finance, bridge financing, and some of the higher margin capital markets and lending activity as well. So as we look forward, I think it's recognizing the shift in some of the drivers from companies just investing, refinancing, looking at where they can, diversifying their capital, raising in different quarters. But I just close by saying, I couldn't agree with you more about geopolitical risks and fragility. I think the market's too -- but it's too benign in its risk pricing on some of these factors. Yeah, look, I think Matt, as we've talked about many times, the transformation is our top priority. It will be for the next few years. It is foundational for our future success, both in terms of delivering the strategy and the medium-term financial path. And we've been making significant investments behind it, as well as not only in the consent order but also making sure we've got this modern efficient infrastructure. We're currently deep into a very large body of work, upgrading our data architecture, automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms. And all of these help enhance our business performance more broadly, not just the risk and control in the medium-term. As I've said, though -- there are a few areas where we are intensifying our efforts, such as the automation of certain regulatory processes and data remediation, particularly related to regulatory reporting. We're committed to getting these right. The org changes will help us with execution and making sure that we have the impetus and everything that we need behind it, the investments that we need. We keep a close eye on execution, making sure we've got the right level of resourcing and expertise. And we'll invest what we need to do, to make sure that we address these different concerns. I can't go into much more detail in terms of our CSI, obviously, but \u2013 at [some day] (ph) this magnitude, you'd expect us to have some areas where we have good progress and others where we need to intensify efforts. The guiding principle that we have and we've had all along is making sure that we make a decision here that is in the best interest of our shareholders and makes the most sense for them. We are -- we never say never, but we are very focused on the IPO path here. We believe it is the right one for our shareholders. We are well on track in the path in Mexico. We are very pleased to bring Ignacio Deschamps in as the Banamex Chairman to help guide the IPO process. We announced the management teams for the two banks earlier this quarter. We're far down the path of the technological separation of both banks and then the full legal separation in the second half of the year. Obviously, the election is coming up fairly shortly, but we're not anticipating that we would be deviating from the IPO path. That is the path that we are on at the moment. I'll never say never, but we do believe that this is the right one. But we'll keep an eye on what's happening in Mexico as we always do. Damn. I wanted that one. Hello, Steven. It's also a lot of the investments that we've been making, fuel a lot of the growth we've got. We have a market leading product innovations and those continue to drive good returns, good growth. If it's Citi Token Services, Citi Payment Express, 24/7 -- all of these different elements really mean that this business is utterly invaluable and indispensable to our clients. And the stickiness of the deposits, and the operating deposits comes with that. So we feel good about that growth. And you'll hear more about this as well, Mike, in the Investor Day in mid-June, which will be, I think we hope will be very helpful to everyone, so you really get your arms around how this business operates, makes money and see why we call it a crown jewel."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mark Mason",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on our year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the business. On slide six, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, EPS of $1.58, and an RoTCE of 7.6% on $21.1 billion of revenue. Total revenues were down 2% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely consisting of the $1 billion gain from the sale of the India consumer business, in the prior year, revenues were up more than 3% driven by growth across banking, USPB, and services, partially offset by declines in markets and wealth. Expenses were $14.2 billion, up 7% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment, expenses were up 5%. Cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion, primarily driven by higher card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases in wealth, banking, and legacy franchise. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.8%. On Slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. We reported expenses of $14.2 billion, which included the incremental FDIC special assessment of roughly $250 million. Also included in this number are $225 million of restructuring charges, largely related to the organizational simplification. In total, we've incurred approximately $1 billion of restructuring costs over the last two quarters. As part of these actions we expect approximately $1.5 billion of annualized run rate saves over the medium-term related to our headcount reduction of approximately 7,000. In addition to the restructuring, we took approximately $260 million of repositioning costs largely related to our efficiency efforts across the firm, including a reduction of stranded costs associated with the consumer divestitures. The expected savings from these actions will allow us to continue to fund additional investments in the transformation this year. And relative to the prior year, the remainder of the expense growth was largely driven by inflation and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. In the remainder of the year, we expect a more normalized level of repositioning, which is already embedded in our guidance. Therefore, you can expect our quarterly expense trend to go down from here in-line with our $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion ex. FDIC expense guidance. On Slide 8, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the first quarter, net interest income decreased by $317 million, largely driven by markets, which resulted in a 4 basis point decrease in net interest margin. Excluding markets, net interest income was relatively flat. Average loans were up $4 billion, primarily driven by loans in spread product in markets, as well as card and mortgage loans in U.S. Personal banking, partially offset by declines in service. And average deposits were up nearly $7 billion, primarily driven by services, as we continue to grow high quality operating deposits. On Slide 9, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. This quarter we adjusted our FICO distribution to be more aligned with the industry reporting practices and now show our FICO mix using a 660 threshold. Across branded cards and retail services, approximately 85% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. And we remain well-reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.2% for our total card portfolio. In our corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade, which is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans at 0.5% of total corporate loans. As a reminder, our loan loss reserves incorporate a scenario-weighted average unemployment rate of approximately 5%, which includes a downside scenario unemployment rate of close to 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves we have in the current environment. Turning to Slide 10, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital and liquidity. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion high-quality balance sheet, which increased 1% sequentially. Despite this increase, we were able to decrease our risk-weighted assets, reflecting our continued optimization efforts and focus on capital efficiency. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy, and diversified business model. The foundation of our funding is a $1.3 trillion deposit base, which is well diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types. The majority of our deposits, $812 billion, are corporate and span 90 countries. Most of our corporate deposits reside in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. In most cases, we are fully integrated in our client systems and help them efficiently manage their operations through our three integrated services, payments and collections, liquidity management, and working capital solutions, all of which greatly increased the stickiness of these deposits. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $423 billion, are well diversified across the private bank, Citigold, retail, and wealth at work, as well as across regions and products. Now turning to the asset side. Over the last several years, we've maintained a strong risk appetite framework and have been very deliberate about how we deploy our deposits and other liabilities into high quality assets. This starts with our $675 billion loan portfolio, which is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans. And the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.2 years. About one-third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high quality, short duration investment securities that contribute to our nearly $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. And for the quarter, we had an LCR of 117%. So to wrap it up, we are active and deliberate in the management of our balance sheet, which is reflected in our high-quality assets and strong capital and liquidity position. On Slide 11, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we generated $3.1 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 13 basis points. Third, we saw an increase in our disallowed DTA, which resulted in a 10 basis point decrease. And finally, the remaining 6 basis point benefit was largely driven by a reduction in RWA. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 120 basis points, or over $13 billion above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. That said, our current capital requirement does not yet reflect our simplification efforts, the benefits of our transformation, or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to bring down capital requirements over time. So now turning to slide 12. Before I get into the businesses, let me remind you that in the fourth quarter we implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within banking and between banking services and markets to reflect the benefits that businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing is included in the all-other line for each business in our financial supplement. In services, revenues were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued momentum across both TTS and Securities Services. Net interest income increased 6%, driven by higher deposit and trade loan spreads. Non-interest revenue increased 14%, largely driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers. In TTS, cross-border volumes increased 9%. U.S. Dollar clearing volumes increased 3%, and commercial card spend volumes increased 5%, all of which was driven by strong corporate client activity. In Securities Services, our preliminary assets under custody and administration increased 11% benefiting from higher market valuations, as well as new client onboarding. The growth in both businesses is a direct result of our continued investment in product innovation, the client experience, and platform modernization to gain share across all client segments. TTS continues to maintain its Number One position with large corporate and FI clients, and see good momentum in the commercial client segment, and we continue to gain share in Securities Services. Expenses increased 11%, largely driven by continued investments in technology and product innovation. Cost of credit was $64 million as net credit losses remain low. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion. Average loans were up 4% primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients. However, it is worth noting that we continue to see good operating deposit inflow. And services continues to deliver a high RoTCE of 24.1% for the quarter. On slide 13, we show the results for markets for the first quarter. Markets revenues were down 7% as lower fixed income revenues more than offset growth in equities. Fixed income revenues decreased 10% driven by rates and currencies, which were down 21% on the back of lower volatility and a strong quarter in the prior year. This was partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed income, which was up 26% driven by an increase in client activity, particularly in asset-backed lending. And we continue to see good underlying momentum in equities, with revenues up 5% driven by growth across cash trading and equity derivatives. And we continue to make progress in prime with balances up more than 10%. Expenses increased 7%, largely driven by the absence of a legal reserve release last year. Cost of credit was $200 million, primarily driven by macroeconomic assumptions related to loans and spread products that impacted reserves. Net income was approximately $1.4 billion. Average loans increased 8%, primarily driven by asset-backed lending and spread products due to an improvement in market activity. Average trading assets increased 4% sequentially, largely driven by seasonally stronger activity in the first quarter. Markets delivered an RoTCE of 10.4% for the quarter. On slide 14, we show the results for banking for the first quarter. Banking revenues increased 49% driven by growth in investment banking and corporate lending and lower losses on loan hedges. As I previously mentioned, corporate lending results include the impact of revenue sharing from investment banking, services and markets. Investment banking revenues increased 35% driven by DCM and ECM, as improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity, particularly investment grade, which is running at near record levels. Advisory revenues declined given the low level of announced merger activity last year. However, in the quarter, we participated in the pickup and announced M&A across sectors, including those where we've been investing, such as technology and healthcare. Corporate lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 34%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage this quarter as expenses decreased 4%, driven by actions taken to right size the expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $129 million, primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition. The [NPL] (ph) rate was 0.3% of average loans, and we ended the quarter with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 1.5%. Net income was approximately $536 million. Average loans decreased 6%, as we maintained strict discipline around capital efficiency as we optimized corporate loan balances. RoTCE was 9.9% for the quarter, reflecting a rebound in activity, reserve releases, and continued expense discipline. On slide 15, we show the results for wealth for the first quarter. Wealth revenues decreased 4%, driven by a 13% decrease in NII from lower deposit spreads and higher mortgage funding costs, partially offset by higher investment fee revenue. We're seeing good momentum in non-interest revenue, which was up 11% as we benefited from higher investment assets across regions, driven by increased client activity, as well as market valuation. Expenses were up 3% driven by technology investments focused on risk and controls, as well as platform enhancements, partially offset by the initial benefits of expense reduction as we continue to right-size the workforce. Cost of credit was a benefit of $170 million, driven by a reserve release of approximately $200 million, primarily related to a change in estimate, as we enhanced our data related to margin lending collateral. Net income was $150 million. End of period, client balances increased 6% driven by higher client investment assets. Average loans were flat as we continue to optimize capital usage. Average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting lower deposits in the private bank and Wealth at Work, and the continued shift of deposits to higher yielding investments on Citi's platform, which more than offset the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB. Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by net new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuation. RoTCE was 4.6% for the quarter. Looking ahead, we're going to improve the returns of our wealth business by executing on our three foundational priorities. As Jane mentioned, this will take time, but over the medium to longer term, we view this as a greater than 20% return business. On Slide 16, we show the results for U.S. Personal Banking for the first quarter. U.S. Personal Banking revenues increased 10% driven by NII growth of 8%, and lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues increased 7%, driven by interest earning balance growth of 10%, as payment rates continue to moderate. And we continue to see healthy growth in spend volumes up 4%, primarily driven by our more affluent customers. Retail services revenues increased 18%, primarily driven by lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses, as well as interest earning balance growth of 9%. Retail banking revenues increased 1% driven by higher deposit spreads, loan growth, and improved mortgage margins. Expenses were roughly flat due to lower compensation costs, including repositioning, offset by higher volume related expenses. Cost of credit of approximately $2.2 billion increased 34%, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic and are now maturing. In branded cards, the NCL rate came in at 3.65%, in-line with our expectations. In retail services, the NCL rate of 6.32% was slightly above the high end of our guidance range for the full year and will likely remain above the range in the second quarter, reflecting historical seasonality patterns. However, given the persistent inflation, higher interest rates, and continued sales pressure at our partners, we now expect to be closer to the high end of the full year NCL guidance range for retail service. This expectation, along with the continued mix shift from transactors to revolvers across both portfolios, led to an ACL build of approximately $340 million. Net income decreased to $347 million. Average deposits decreased 10% and as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business more than offset the underlying growth. RoTCE for the quarter was 5.5%. We recognize that this business is facing a number of headwinds from a regulatory perspective and from higher credit costs given where we are in the credit cycle, both of which are putting pressure on returns for the quarter and for the full year 2024. However, this doesn't impact our longer-term view of the business. We feel good about our position as a prime and lend-centric issuer. We will continue to take mitigating actions to manage through the headwinds, [lap] (ph) the credit cycle, and drive more value from retail banking and retail services, while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business, all of which will ultimately result in a higher returning business over the medium-term. On Slide 17, we show results for All Other, on a Managed Basis, which includes corporate other and legacy franchises, and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 9%, primarily driven by closed exits and wind-downs, as well as higher funding costs, partially offset by higher revenue in Mexico. And expenses increased 18%, primarily driven by the incremental FDIC special assessment and restructuring charges, partially offset by lower expenses from the wind-down and exit markets. Slide 18 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance, both of which remain unchanged. We have accomplished a lot over the past few years and have made substantial progress on simplifying our business and organizational structure. The year is off to a good start as we are laser focused on executing the transformation and enhancing the business performance. These two priorities will not only enable us to be a more efficient, agile company, but a client-centric one that brings together the best of Citi to drive revenue growth and improve return. And we are on the path to reach our 11% to 12% return target over the medium-term. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. Sure. And good morning, Glenn. And we appreciate the acknowledgement around the expenses. As you know, we've been quite focused on that and working hard to ensure that we deliver on what we say, we're going to do there. I'd point on the revenue line, I'd first point to, if you look back since Investor Day, we've in fact been able to deliver on the guidance that we've given for the medium-term, so that 4% to 5% top-line growth. And yes, it was a different rate environment, but that growth that we delivered over the past couple of years has been a mix of both revenue and underlying business strength. As you think about the guidance we talked about for this year, we talked about the NII ex-markets being down modestly. And so what that means is that the momentum and the growth that we expect is going to come from the non-interest revenue. And I think this quarter, is a good example of where and how that's likely to play through. So the revenue topline being up 3 plus percent. But when you look through each of the businesses and if you look on each of the pages where we disclosed the revenue, you can see the underlying NIR growth in the bottom left hand corner of each of those pages that's coming through as well. So security services up 14% with growth in both TTS between cross-border clearing commercial cards, but also -- and security services, right, with the growth that we're seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody. We expect that trend to continue with existing clients and more -- and new clients, as well as how we do more with our commercial market -- commercial middle market business excuse me. So NIR growth there, the investment banking pieces, the other driver of fees, we're seeing that while it start to rebound, we're part of that rebound, the announced transactions were part of those in sectors that we've been investing in. We're bringing in new talent to help us realize and experience that. And even in wealth, where we're not pleased with the top-line performance this quarter, down 4%. When you look through that, we do have good underlying NII growth in the quarter in wealth, and that's up 11% year-over-year. And it's in the area that Andy and the team is leaning in on, which is investments, and not just in one region, but across all the regions. And then finally, the USPB piece, which is showing good NII growth as well. So the long and short of it is that the 4% growth that's implied in $80 billion to $81 billion, is going to be continued momentum, largely in fees, helping us to deliver for our clients and make continued progress towards that medium-term target. Great to hear you, Betsy. Yes, I mean, look, I think that the quarter expenses that you see of growth of 3% is not yet reflective of the work that Andy has been steadfast at. There is still some investment in there in technology and in the platform that's important, but I think coming out of the first quarter you'll start to see some of the reduction in expenses that's a byproduct of that work. And the work has been across the entire expense base in the wealth business. So that includes non-client-facing roles and support staff. It includes looking at the productivity of existing bankers and advisors. And those kind of reductions will start to play out in the subsequent quarters. I do want to point out, as Jane mentioned, this is a growth business for us. And so you can see on some of the metrics on page 15, the bottom left, some of those good signs of investment momentum. And I highlight that because as the expenses come down from some of those efficiencies, there will be a need for us to continue to invest and replenish low-performing or low-producing bankers and advisors with resources that actually can generate the revenues we expect and take advantage of the client opportunity that's in front of us. So long-winded way of saying, there's some operating efficiency upside for us for sure is a combination of the top-line and the expense we're playing through the balance of the quarters in the year here. Yeah, look I mean with the top-line growth as you've heard us say, is a CAGR of 4% to 5%. We put that target out there [51 to 53] (ph) as a range of what we're working towards. We're given you a good sense of how we expect to get there with the $2 billion to $2.5 billion reduction by then. We've already signaled the $1.5 billion that's in front of us. The reality is that if there's softness in revenues, that's why we have a range. Obviously, the volume-related expenses would come down with any softness in revenue. And depending on the drivers of why that revenue is softening, we'd look at the investments that we're making across the business and make sure that those are appropriately calibrated for where we are in the cycle and what we're seeing on the top-line. With that said, we've got to continue to invest in the transformation. We're not going to compromise that. That's going to be something that we have to spend on to ensure we continue to get right. But that's kind of how the dynamic works. There's a top, we've got a mix of businesses that I think we've demonstrated resiliency around if you think about the past couple of years. And we expect for those to continue to drive some top-line momentum but we've got levers in case they don't. Sure, look \u2013 and I've said it repeatedly, Jane has said it repeatedly given where we trade, we think buying back is smart and we'd like to do as much as we possibly can and -- as much as makes sense, in light of the uncertainty that's out there. We have run at about [$13.5 billion] (ph) this quarter. That does give us capacity above the [$13.3 billion] (ph). (Technical Difficulty) we want to make sure we can support the clients that want to do business with us, whether that be in markets or other parts of the franchise. And then there's still uncertainty out there about how the capital regulation evolves. The good news is, we are hearing kind of favorable things about how the Basel III endgame proposal could evolve, but that hasn't happened yet. It's not finalized. It's not in place yet. And so we want to see how that continues to play out. We're obviously in the midst of a CCAR process. We want to see how that evolves. And we'll continue to take the buyback decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but we recognize that there's an opportunity there and we'll get after it just as soon as it makes good sense for us. Yeah, thank you, Erika. On the first part of the question, I just remind you and everyone else that we're playing for the long-term here, right? So we have set some medium-term targets. Obviously, Jane has re-casted the vision and the strategy. I think we're making very good progress against that. But we're playing for the long-term. And what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise. It's why I've given you a range around the expenses at least in part. It's why I've continued to stress the importance of protecting the transformation and risk and control spend. And it's why, I started the answer to Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there where the returns to do so makes sense. And so we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other resources against that longer-term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good returns against the idea of returning that to shareholders. And so this will continue to do that. It's an everyday assessment. It's an everyday discussion with the teams. Frankly, it's why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the clients that we're using balance sheet with and ensuring that we're driving broader revenues across the platform. And so that's kind of how we're operating in terms of making that trade-off on a regular basis, in addition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that we're in. In terms of the second part of your question around late fees, we haven't disclosed kind of the dollar amount of the late fees. What I would say is that we did and have factored that into the $80 billion to $81 billion. And the only thing I'd add to that is, it did kind of -- it's being implemented a bit earlier than what we had assumed, but again, it's inside of the range of the guidance that I've given you for top-line revenue for the year. Yeah, thanks, John. We have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively. We've seen continued top-line growth, we've seen continued average interest earnings, balance growth. We've talked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The range that we've given on branded cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the portfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so we're watching the lower income customer profile or customers that we have. But again, as Jane mentioned, we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with. Where we're really seeing the pressure is where I mentioned in terms of retail services. And so there, the current NCLs are higher than the high end of the full year range that I've given. But if you look back, that is not inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio where the first two quarters are higher than the back half of the year, in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses tend to mature or materialize through that process. And so I'd expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in Q1, but also in Q2 before coming down. And then I still expect that in 2025, you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off of these ranges. But look, the reality is that we continue to watch it in the factors that are out there, that are important include how unemployment evolves, what happens with inflation, what happens with interest rates and those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time. I think the final point I'd make, and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, is that we have to remember that the loss rates in both portfolios reflect multiple vintages maturing at the same time. And you'll recall, and this is an industry dynamic, you know, through the COVID and pandemic period, losses were at an all-time low, payment rates at all-time highs, supported by government stimulus. And now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature albeit at a lagged pace from what would be normal. And we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done, start to mature at their normal pace. And so these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact, and that's an important factor we can't lose sight of. But the bottom-line is that we're watching it. The macro factors matter. We feel good about the quality mix that we have and we'll kind of see how things evolve from here. Yes, I still kind of expect that trend line of peaking and then kind of moving a bit lower in branded. Yeah, sure. Look, I think that, you know, when I think about the reserve builds, I think it's the same factors that come into play. So obviously the view on the macro is important. And right now, if you think about some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio, the unemployment assumption weighted is about 5%, the downside is about you know 7% kind of weighted over the period. And so feel -- how that evolves will be an important factor. How [HPI] (ph) evolves will be, you know, important consideration here for this portfolio. But also what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they increase or decrease. And then the final piece is mix, and it's kind of related to that revolver point. As we see the mix evolve from transactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve, from a lifetime point of view, we have to continue to build. And so it's -- why I mentioned on John's question, you know, the importance of looking at, you know, the interest rates looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base, because all of those things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the reserves. But I will say, Ken, as I sit here and think about what we have in the quarter, I feel very good about the reserve levels. The 8.2% for combined kind of, you know, ACL to loan ratio feels right for the mix of this portfolio, and we'll continue to watch it. Sure. Yeah, I think I'd say a couple things. We do have some Argentina playing through the NII line. I will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying beta activity. And we have seen, this is a corporate client, it is an institutional client, we have seen betas, particularly in the US, at kind of normalized or terminal levels and playing a bit through that. We are seeing betas outside of the U.S., continue to increase as it relates to the TTS client base. But all of that, again, is inside of the range that we've talked about. I don't expect to see kind of year-over-year growth on the NII line anywhere close to kind of what we've seen in prior years, prior quarters, just in light of kind of how the rate environments evolved and in light of kind of quantitative tightening \u2013 and tightening and the impact on deposit levels. The last point I'd make on this is, we will continue to drive and see growth as it relates to the operating deposits. And that'll be an important tailwind that kind of plays through. Yeah, look, there's a mix obviously of things that are driving that net income, including a tax impact on the heels of last year Argentina devaluation activity that's in that line. But the short answer is that you know if you think about the nature of the business that we do in Argentina, it is a big part of our institutional client relationships. And the primary activities include some of the TTS type of activities that we've talked about, so liquidity management payments, custody within the services business. And so you'd see a good portion of the activity in Argentina playing through the services business, some of it in markets as well, but again, the majority of the activity in services. Yeah, let me try and take it in two pieces, I guess. So one is, if I think about how the rate implies have evolved from the three to six to now something a little bit north of one, in the context of what I expect for our performance. It doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81 billion. And in part, that's because, as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally backloaded, as well as some of the other factors that play through. So, you know, Argentina just announced a policy rate reduction yesterday or a couple of days ago. If rates are a bit higher for longer, we'll watch how the betas continue to evolve. I mentioned earlier the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner. Late fees are actually booked in our NII line and so those factors you know put me in a place where I feel like, there'll certainly be puts and takes around how that rate curves evolve, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the guidance where it is. To answer your broader question in terms of kind of how we're positioned, you know, I'd point you to the 10-K that we have that's out -- and in that 10-K, we offer as we have before a number of IRE scenarios for plus or minus 100 basis points and what it means for our business. And if you look at it, you'll see that for the aggregate firm, for Citi, U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar, that we're asset sensitive. So as rates increase, we should see an increase in our NII performance. But if you look at the breakdown, and that's about, I think it was about a [$1.4 billion] (ph) or something in terms of the impact of that move. But if you look at the breakdown, what the breakdown will show is that for U.S. dollar, at this point, we're neutral. So if rates were to go up, rates were to go down, no material impact as it relates to our revenue. For the non-U.S. dollar, we're still quite asset sensitive, right. And so that should give you some sense for at that -- and we recognize the limitations with IRE, it assumes, you know, a 100 basis point parallel shift across the curve, the static balance sheet, et cetera. But that should give you some sense for the implications of the rate curve moves as it relates to our book of business. Hi Gerard. Look, we're still seeing good demand for corporate credit. And what I'd say is that we've been very disciplined about where we want to play on the risk profile here. We've been very disciplined in terms of the investment grade, you know, large multinationals that we serve. And that hasn't shifted from an underwriting point of view. We have seen spaces like private credit pick up quite a bit. And that, I think, will continue to evolve. I think, importantly, as we think about our corporate lending activity, you'll note that, actually, we've been very disciplined about how we want to deploy balance sheet and part of that again is a byproduct of the revenue sharing that we've implemented where there's been healthy debate and discussion around the names that we want to continue to serve and whether they're positioned to take advantage of the broader platform that we have. And so I think the space will continue to evolve. I think there's been good, healthy demand, despite continued strong balance sheets. And part of that demand has been because of where rates are likely to go and continue to evolve. And I think we're well positioned to be thoughtful about that. But Jane, you may want to add a couple points to it. Important for us to take ... Yeah -- I mean, I think that's exactly right. But you'd also expect that in this type of environment and on the heels of the regional bank stress last year that we're looking at stress scenarios, we're enhancing our CCAR processes, we're enhancing our resolution and recovery processes, all of those things just to kind of -- to make sure that we're shoring up capabilities and you'd expect that across the industry quite frankly. I'll take it. I'll take that. I'll take that. I mean I'll take the win, a downward trajectory from here through the end of the year in-line with the guidance of $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. And so yes. Yes, Steven. The first part of your question is just impossible to answer, to be candid with you, right? We obviously have an internal base scenario we've run. We have a severely adverse scenario that we've run. We've provided a balance sheet as part of the submission, but ultimately, the regulators have to run through their models, the information that we've provided and that informs what happens with the stress capital buffer. And we don't have as much transparency to that as we'd like. And so really hard to call at this stage. The second part of your question, I think is spot on, and I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks, in that we have the medium-term targets that we've set. And we're still in the midst of kind of the execution of our strategy, the evolution of the business mix and the business model. The mix towards more consistent, predictable, and repeatable revenue streams that would impact PPNR, the simplification which obviously plays through an expense base that will be lower, when we get to that medium term period. So all of those things, the divestitures and kind of what that means and how that might impact the G-SIB score and the like, and the freeing up of capital, which we've already freed up, you know, $6 billion or so. And so all of those things have kind of yet to have been factored in. And we believe will be beneficial to the SCB over the medium term. We have seen growth in the quarter, in operating deposits. The confidence comes from the focus that we've had with our existing clients, as well as the growth we've seen with new clients, doing more with existing and more countries, more deeply penetrating the commercial middle market space. And so we've been very thoughtfully focused on deposits that obviously give us the most value and also provide the most stickiness, as it relates to that relationship. And so yes, the confidence is rooted in what we're seeing in the way of underlying operating deposit growth, including inside this quarter. Yeah, I don't -- we haven't broken down the transactor versus revolver mix, and so I'm not going to get into that. I will say that the revolver levels are at least back to where they were pre-pandemic and leave it at that. But we are seeing kind of continued revolver activity which you'd expect kind of given the way the cycle has evolved and given payment rates have started to moderate and the stimulus has kind of unwound and so all of that is kind of consistent with expectations but obviously is a factor in reserve levels as I mentioned earlier. Sure, I think you should just fade it to answer your question very directly. But I'd also point out that, you know, in Q1, if you really look through to it, it has the $250 million of FDIC charge in it. And so when you back that out, we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided. All right? Despite that, I'm telling you the same -- I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the end of the year. And while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity around repositioning that plays through. So hopefully, that answers your question, Betsy. The guidance still holds and the downward trend is what we are managing towards as we kind of play out the balance of the year."
