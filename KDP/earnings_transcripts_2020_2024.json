This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call.  I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tyson Seely. Mr. Seely, please go ahead.\nTyson Seely: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued two press releases, the first announcing that our Board has approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.60 to $0.75 per share on an annualized basis beginning with the second quarter dividend announcement subject to official declaration by our Board of Directors. As part of that announcement, we also indicated that the Board has declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.15 for the first quarter of 2021. The second press release covers our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. Both releases are available on our website at keurigdrpepper.com in the Investors section.  Consistent with previous quarters, today, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, excluding items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance.  Details of the excluded items are included in our reconciliation tables, including -- included in our press release and our 10-K, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance.  Here with me virtually today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our CEO -- CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio.  And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Tyson, and good morning. Before getting started, I'd like to express my best wishes to everyone that you and your families are well. It's hard to believe that we've all been operating under the pandemic for almost a year. And while vaccines are providing hope for a return to normalcy later this year, the spike in COVID cases in January, followed by extreme weather in February suggest that 2021 will be another unpredictable year.  At the start of the pandemic, we put in place our ONE KDP plan, which prioritize keeping our employees safe and healthy, delivering for our customers and consumers and providing for our communities. These priorities have served us well. Additionally, our success in navigating this crisis to date has been aided by using data and technology to leverage the breadth of our portfolio and the unique reach of our distribution network to effectively manage portfolio and channel mix. In 2020, we delivered at or above the high end of the annual guidance we established at the beginning of the year. And the 2021 guidance we are providing today points to our confidence in achieving the 3-year merger commitments communicated in 2018, despite the macro environment becoming significantly more challenging since that time.  As you saw from our earlier announcement, we are increasing our dividend rate by 25%, starting in the second quarter of this year. This reflects the line of sight we have to continued strong free cash flow, which enables us to simultaneously increase our return of value to shareholders, reach our deleveraging target by year-end and invest in expanded production capacity, innovation and technology. In fact, our dividend payout ratio, even after the 25% increase announced today, remains below 50% of free cash flow.  Finally, we're fully committed to deliver both TSR and ESG. In 2020, we achieved nearly all of our aggressive sustainability goals. And in 2021, we have signed up for new and expanded ESG goals, including health and well-being and diversity and inclusion. We will publish specifics for each in our corporate responsibility report in June.  All of this underpins our journey from 2 separate companies to a combined new challenger in the beverage industry to a Modern Beverage Company with an exciting future. We look forward to sharing our long-term vision and plans for KDP when we conduct an Investor Day in the second half of this year.  Let me take a few minutes to step back and provide key highlights of our 2020 performance. We delivered accelerated constant currency net sales growth of 5% in 2020, with strong momentum exiting the year. Driving that revenue growth were exceptionally strong in-market results across the business.  In cold beverages, we gained market share in more than 90% of our retail base, including market share growth in excess of 1 full point in CSDs. This was driven by double-digit consumption growth of Dr Pepper and Canada Dry, our largest CSD brands, as well as A&W, 7UP, Sunkist and Squirt. Dr Pepper & Cream Soda became the #1 new flavor in the CSD category in 2020, while Canada Dry Bold also performed exceptionally well. Canada Dry is now the only CSD brand to achieve volume and dollar growth for the past 14 consecutive years. Strength in cold beverages extended well beyond CSDs, with KDP share growth in premium water, ready-to-drink tea, shelf-stable fruit drinks and Mott's apple juice and sauce.  As we discussed on previous earnings calls, the pandemic required us to manage mix across channels, beverage segments and even pack types to react to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping and consumption patterns. This is driving growth in multipacks and cans sold in large outlets and e-commerce to offset slowdowns in fountain foodservice, convenience and gas channels and as a result, impulse packs. Our speed in pivoting to these changes was enabled by new uses of data and technology, consistently strong in-market execution, leveraging our highly developed e-commerce capability and a flexible and resilient supply chain team.  Our coffee business also had a strong year. Consumer purchases of Keurig manufactured K-Cup pods registered double-digit growth, while brewer shipments grew 21%, which reflects a combination of new households entering the system as well as existing households upgrading their brewers. Household expansion of the Keurig system was very strong this year with approximately 3 million new households entering the system. That translates to 10% household growth, nicely above our longer-term pre-pandemic trend of approximately 7% growth per year.  Not surprisingly, the consumer shift to work-from-home meant at-home consumption of K-Cup pods was strong throughout the year, while the away-from-home channel, which is focused on offices, remained a significant headwind. And while we expect the away-from-home business to improve slowly over the course of 2021, we will begin to lap the 2020 declines in the second quarter of this year. In addition to our strong top line results, our bottom line performance was also strong for the year, with adjusted diluted EPS growing 15% to $1.40, which represents the high end of our 2020 guidance. This was achieved by offsetting significant mix headwinds and operating cost pressures with revenue growth that was above our targets, continued strong productivity and merger synergies and reductions in discretionary spending.  We also drove strong free cash flow, which enabled us to reduce our indebtedness and improve our management leverage ratio to 3.6x, while also making significant capital investments, specifically: our new Spartanburg, South Carolina coffee pod facility, which will be the largest LEED-certified manufacturing facility in North America; our Allentown, Pennsylvania cold beverages facility, which was recognized as Plant of the Year by Food Engineering magazine; and our Newbridge, Ireland facility, which represents our second manufacturing location for our important Beverage Concentrates business. In 2020, we also invested in the expansion of our portfolio and DSD network through multiple transactions, including a long-term agreement we announced with the Honickman Companies that provides KDP with sales and distribution for key brands in the metro New York area, national franchise agreement with Polar Beverages and other numerous transactions with smaller but strategic independent bottlers to ensure competitive distribution scale for our brands. Consistent with our focus on improving the effectiveness of our distribution system, we exited some nonstrategic SKUs during the year, enabling us to keep our high-volume brands in stock and creating space for new partnerships and 2021 innovation.  In 2020, we also made great progress on our sustainability initiatives. We now responsibly source 100% of our coffee and 85% of our brewers and have improved the livelihoods of over 1 million people in our supply chain.  We also completed our multiyear conversion to 100% recyclable K-Cup pods. And during the year, we co-founded 2 industry coalitions focused on enhancing U.S. recycling infrastructure. We launched our first post-consumer recycled, or PCR, packaging in cold beverages, putting us on track to deliver our goal of using 30% PCR in our packaging across the business by 2025.  This long list of accomplishments would be impressive in any year, but it is even more so against the backdrop of the challenges and uncertainty we faced in 2020. I'm proud of and grateful for the nearly 27,000 team members across KDP who have proven to be our underlying competitive advantage.  Turning now to our outlook for 2021. The guidance we're providing today is consistent with the commitments we laid out at the time of the merger announcement and position us to meet our 3-year merger targets. Specifically, for 2021, we expect constant currency net sales in the range of 3% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of 13% to 15%. On a 2-year stack basis, which eliminates any noise from COVID impact, this translates into net sales growth of over 8% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of nearly 29%, both at the midpoint of the ranges.  Our confidence in 2021 growth is supported by both innovation and renovation, both of which will be backed by increased marketing investment. Ongoing productivity savings and our final year of merger synergies will help offset increased inflation. We expect our management leverage ratio to improve by 3x by year-end, driven primarily by our continued strong free cash flow generation. In 2021, we are rolling out zero-sugar varieties across our CSD portfolio. For most brands, the new zero offerings represent a rebranding of our existing diet SKUs to more clearly articulate the zero-sugar benefit to consumers. For Dr Pepper, the introduction of a zero-sugar variety will be in addition to original Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper. We are also introducing Bai Boost a new platform with caffeine; and Mott's Mighty, a line of juices and sauces fortified with vitamins and fiber. In addition, we will be launching new flavor varieties across many of our brands.  We've begun the staged rollout of our new Snapple bottles made with 100% recycled PET and featuring new graphics. Also, we are now producing all CORE hydration bottles with 100% of rPET.  In coffee, we have another strong lineup of new brewers planned for this year, including our first connected brewer for the broader consumer market. We'll share additional information on this exciting new brewer and other brewers planned as we get closer to launch. In 2021, we expect continued strength in owned and licensed coffee. Last year, we reversed long-term trends by expanding sales and consumption of our owned and licensed brand portfolio. Within that portfolio, we have been able to improve the sales trajectory for the McCaf\u00e9 brand, in partnership with McDonald's, which became a licensed brand for us in the second half of 2020.  In 2021, we will launch Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Brew Over Ice pods, which taps into the growth of cold coffee. The majority of our brewers launched since 2018 also have a Brew Over Ice option. We are expanding our highly successful Original Donut Shop One Step Lattes introduced in 2020 into One Step cappuccinos. Last year, The Original Donut Shop brand registered double-digit consumption growth and market share expansion on the strength of the new One Step offerings and a new marketing platform.  Before turning it over to Ozan, I'd like to recognize the entire KDP organization for their tireless efforts in delivering such strong and well-balanced results. Because of their success, we have confidence in our 2021 goals, and we look forward to sharing our longer-term outlook at an Investor Day later this year. I'll now hand it over to Ozan to take you through the specifics of our financial results.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Continuing, on an adjusted basis, I will briefly review our performance for the fourth quarter, which our press release discusses in significant detail, and then turning to our full year 2020 performance and our 2021 guidance. In the fourth quarter, constant currency net sales increased 6.6%, fueled by higher volume/mix of 6.3% and favorable net price realization of 0.3%, with our Coffee Systems, Packaged Beverages and Latin America Beverages segments, all posting growth.  Adjusted operating income increased 5.5% in the quarter, driven by strong net sales growth, continued productivity, merger synergies and lower discretionary spending, which includes marketing. These drivers were partially offset by the unfavorable comparison to a $30 million gain in the prior year on the sale-leaseback of 3 manufacturing facilities, higher operating costs in the current year associated with increased consumer demand and inflation in logistics. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew 5.7%. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 11.4% in the fourth quarter, driven by the growth in adjusted operating income and lower interest expense and lower effective tax rate.  Let me turn now to our full year results for 2020. Constant currency net sales increased 5%, driven by higher volume/mix of 5.6%, partially offset by lower net price realization of 0.6%. Adjusted operating income increased 10.4%, and adjusted operating income margin expanded 150 basis points to 27.5%. This performance was driven by strong revenue growth, continued productivity, merger synergies and lower discretionary expenses. These drivers were partially offset by higher operating costs associated with increased consumer demand for our products, inflation in logistics and certain other COVID-19-related costs.  On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew nearly 11%. For the year, pretax operating costs directly related to COVID-19 totaled $150 million, of which $128 million were recognized as items affecting comparability. These costs consisted of temporary and unusual compensation increases, incentives for frontline employees, incremental health and safety measures across our employee base and enhanced sanitation expenses for our facilities. The remaining $22 million of costs represented inventory write-downs and bad debt expense that were incurred in the first half of 2020 and included in adjusted results.  Adjusted diluted EPS advanced 15% to $1.40 for the year. This strong performance was fueled by the growth in adjusted operating income, lower interest expense as a result of continued deleveraging and the lower effective tax rate. Turning to our segment performance for the year. Coffee Systems constant currency net sales increased 4.8%, driven by higher volume/mix of 7.2%, partially offset by lower net price realization of 2.4%. The volume/mix performance reflected pod volume growth of 6.3%, driven by double-digit at-home consumption, partially offset by the significant decline in the away-from-home coffee businesses. The strong 21% increase in brewer shipments for the year was fueled by continued expansion of households coming into the system and existing households upgrading their brewers, continued brewer innovation, marketing investments to grow household penetration and a very successful holiday season.  Adjusted operating income for Coffee Systems increased 7.9%, and adjusted operating margin grew 110 basis points to 34.2%. This performance was fueled by the net sales growth, continued productivity and merger synergies and lower discretionary spending. These drivers were partially offset by the unfavorable margin mix related to the very strong brewer shipment growth for the year. Packaged Beverages constant currency net sales grew 8.5% for the year, driven by strong volume/mix of 8.2% and higher net pricing of 0.3%. This performance reflected particularly strong growth in our company-owned DSD operations and our warehouse direct business, driven by very strong execution that drove market share expansion across the portfolio, including carbonated soft drinks, premium unflavored water, ready-to-drink tea, shelf-stable juice drinks, apple juice and apple sauce.  Adjusted operating income for the segment increased 30%, and adjusted operating margin expanded 320 basis points to 19%. This performance reflected the strong net sales growth, continued productivity and merger synergies and lower discretionary expenses, partially offset by higher operating costs to meet strong consumer demand and inflation in logistics. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 31%. Beverage Concentrates constant currency net sales declined 6% due to unfavorable volume/mix of 5.8% and lower net pricing of 0.4%. This performance reflected the impact of COVID-19 on the fountain foodservice business, which primarily serves the restaurant and hospitality sector. Adjusted operating income for Beverage Concentrates decreased 2% due to lower net sales, partially offset by lower discretionary expenses, while adjusted operating margin advanced 310 basis points to 70.8%. And finally, Latin America Beverages constant currency net sales grew 3.8%, reflecting strong net pricing of 5.8%, partially offset by lower volume/mix of 2%, due primarily to the impact of COVID-19 in Mexico. Adjusted operating income increased 32%, driven by continued productivity and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency transaction expense and inflation in logistics. Adjusted operating margin increased 620 basis points to 21.7%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew nearly 43%. Turning to synergies. We delivered approximately $200 million in 2020, bringing total merger synergies to approximating $400 million over the past 2 years. Free cash flow in 2020 was again exceptionally strong at approximately $2.2 billion. This translated into an adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio in excess of 110%. We also ended the year with $240 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Our strong free cash flow performance enabled us to reduce outstanding bank debt by more than $950 million and structured payables by $170 million, for a total reduction in financial obligations of $1.1 billion in 2020.  Due to our reduction in bank debt, growth in adjusted earnings and cash on hand, we improved our management leverage ratio by nearly a full turn to 3.6x in 2020. Since the merger closed in July 2018, we have reduced our management leverage ratio by an impressive 2.4 turns. As Bob discussed earlier, the KDP Board of Directors has approved a 25% increase in our annualized dividend rate from $0.60 per share to $0.75 per share beginning with the second quarter dividend, which is paid in the third quarter and subject to the Board's official declaration. This new rate will drive a 12.5% increase in dividends per share in 2021 and another 11.1% increase in 2022.  Importantly, despite the sizable increase, our dividend payout ratio remains below 50% of free cash flow. Highly cash-generative nature of our business as well as our strong profit growth is expected to enable us to continue to delever to 3x or below by the end of 2021. Let me now move on to our outlook for 2021. We expect 2021 to be another good year for KDP, which, as Bob mentioned, will drive exceptional results on a 2-year stack basis. Before jumping into the full year outlook, let me provide some context for quarter 1.  As indicated previously, we exited 2020 with a strong top line momentum, and we expect to benefit from that in the first quarter. On the cost side, you will recall that we will be comping a $42 million gain in the first quarter of 2020 on sale-leaseback transactions and another $20 million gain in the year ago quarter from unwinding interest rate swaps. We believe this context will be useful to you as you build your models for 2021.  The specifics of our 2021 outlook include: on a constant currency basis, we expect net sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 4% for the year, which continues to be above our 3-year merger target of 2% to 3%. This strong growth is expected to be driven by higher year-over-year investments in innovation and marketing, the benefit of recent partnerships and ongoing in-market executional strength. Adjusted diluted EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 13% to 15%, representing $1.58 to $1.61 per diluted share. Importantly, over the 3-year period ending 2021, this performance will position us to achieve our merger target for average annual growth of 15% to 17%.  We again expect merger synergies of approximately $200 million in 2021, delivering on our 3-year target of $600 million. Adjusted interest expense is expected to be in the range of $505 million to $515 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24% for the year. We expect our management leverage ratio to be at or below 3x at the end of 2021. With that, I will hand it back over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: I had a couple of questions on your pod business this morning. First, wondering how we should think about attach rates this year and then into the future. When I look at your brewer household penetration and how much it increased in 2020, but then I compare that to the pod attach rates, they seem to lag a bit. So I'm just trying to understand if there's some type of timing effect we should be aware of. Or should we assume that attach rates will be slightly below historical levels going forward, especially at this higher base of brewers? And then could you please confirm if your new pod manufacturing facility is already up and running? Or if not, when it will be? And really how we should think about the potential margin lift on your pod business from this new facility?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. Okay. I'm going to take the first one, and then I'm going to turn it over to Ozan to talk about Spartanburg. Coffee attachment rates have been very steady for years. And in the past, we've talked about the best proxy for household penetration growth is actually pod volume growth because of attachment rate being so stable.  In the early part of the shelter-in-place, we saw an increase in attachment rates, as you would expect. Obviously, we got some benefit from that in the early part of this, but we've seen it normalize over time. And our expectations going forward is that it does normalize over time. So we did get a short-term benefit from that, but remember, that was offsetting a significant hit that we were getting to our office coffee business. So all of the guidance that we put out there for 2021 does anticipate a more normalized attachment rate.  Ozan, you want to talk about Spartanburg.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Absolutely, absolutely. We already started our test runs at our Spartanburg facility. And obviously, it's a multiyear ramping up the production facility given the huge size and the volume that will come out. But all we can say at this point in time, we are 100% on track in terms of continuing month-in, month-out ramping up of our facility. And as we do, as you said, we do expect to further lower our cost of production in the pods. As we communicated previously, Spartanburg facility, as we go into the year, especially second half of '21 and beyond, will be one of the base productivity sources to improve our efficiency in our manufacturing facility with regards to the pods. But not only that, we also have several other programs that will continue to help us to deal with the management of our overall per pod cost going forward at the same time. So the things are on track.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Just a couple of quick ones for me. First, maybe if, Ozan, can you give us a little bit more color and insight in terms of just how we're thinking about inflation in total for KDP this year and maybe more specifically in Packaged Beverages, with fuel costs likely to go higher? Maybe packaging -- just specifically in Packaged Beverages, how you're thinking about managing inflation? And then maybe just one last one. If we've done the math right, it looks like you undershipped -- Beverage Concentrates shipments lagged consumption for the full year in 2020. So as we're kind of thinking about modeling '21, will there be any sort of disconnect the other way? Will concentrate shipments maybe exceed consumption in '21?\nOzan Dokmecioglu: So on the inflation point, yes, we expect 2021 to face higher inflationary pressure than 2020. And we have built that into our guidance for the year, obviously. And we are very confident that we can manage the exposure. Primary areas of inflation in 2021, as you also alluded, Bryan, would be in the logistics as well as corn-related products. While other areas, such as coffee, for example, that we contract for yearly, not months, will also serve as a partial offset.  It's basically the umbrella of the commodity and the input cost management that we always do. And when the opportunity presents itself, we also hedge ourselves in order to manage our cost profile. Therefore, we believe we have a good balance right now. It is true. We are seeing, as I said, on a couple of line items, cost pressures increasing in '21 versus '20. At the same time, second point is -- the answer for your question with regards to the Beverage Concentrates. It is true, when we look in a closing, like a month or 2, we may see some lagging with regards to the -- our concentrate shipments in Beverage Concentrates as well as the finished product shipments from our bottlers or the distributors. But when we take a medium to a little longer-term perspective, they always catch up, and that's what we are going to see in 2021 as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. And congratulations on a strong year, particularly in this environment. Just to stick with the guidance and the outlook for both of you. So guiding to 13% to 15%, which is great, but [indiscernible]. And just to pick through some of the items, the revenue outlook is better, which is encouraging, right, particularly given the inflection of the coffee business. You're getting 1 to 2 points of help from a lower tax rate. Synergy, you're wrapping that up this year. That's a major contributor. The financial pacing with respect to the balance sheet deleverage is in line with expectations. To Bryan's question a moment ago, commodity is more of a pressure point than I'd imagine you expected.  What else is that? Is advertising and marketing moving up? Maybe you could comment on that. What are some of the other pressure points that are driving a below algorithm year, at least for the 3-year target for EPS growth with the top line outlook so strong?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. I mean a couple of things. I mean when we put our algorithm out there, we didn't say we were going to achieve 15% to 17% every year and the guidance we just put out there puts it nicely within that range, in that 15% to 17% despite what we all agree is a world that is very different than it was in 2018.  The one comment I would put is we are restoring marketing in 2021. We've said all along that any opportunity to restore marketing to drive growth, we would do so. In fact, on our Q3 earnings call, I think we were really clear on our intentions. And when we provided our guidance, and we said that we would be in the 13% to 15% range for 2020, we also said any opportunity to over-deliver would be reinvested back in our business for growth, which is exactly what we did. We came in right at the high end of our guidance. We reinvested back into growth, and we achieved 6.6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter.  So we look at our outlook for 2021 to be incredibly strong and, more importantly, well balanced. Because the results that we've delivered are not driven by anything that would hurt us in the long term by driving the short term. In fact, quite the opposite. We've invested in brand growth and innovation, in new plant capacity. We've invested in technology. And that's why we're able to do things like grow share on 90% of our portfolio and add an extra 1 million households into the Keurig system.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. I was curious -- I guess, two things. One is the dividend increase is sizable and, I think, unexpected, which is great. But I was also curious how that fits into your thoughts about overall capital allocation and the outlook for acquiring brands outright or continuing to make investments in new brands. So that was one question. And then the second is, you've had tremendous market share gains all year in the cold side of the business, as you've talked about. We've also made all these route-to-market changes. And so I was just curious, kind of at a very high level even, what you're hoping to get out of those changes, right? Is it accelerated growth? Is it better efficiency? Again, because the share performance in the existing footprint, if you will, had already been as strong as it was, particularly in 2020.\nRobert Gamgort: On the dividend side, we know that dividends are an important part of shareholder return in this space. And we saw an opportunity to provide more return to our shareholders by increasing the dividend 25%. We do that while simultaneously sticking to our deleveraging target and also investing heavily in the business. And all I would say on that one is it's reflective of the very strong confidence that we have and line of sight to continued strong earnings and strong free cash flow. And even with that substantial increase in dividend rate, our payout ratio is still below 50%, which is well below just about anyone else in this space.  It doesn't change our outlook at all on our ability to participate in M&A. We've said all along that, even with our commitment to rapidly delever, we would be able to participate in the M&A space in a number of different ways. With CORE, for example, we used shares to make that acquisition, and that acquisition has been very value-accretive to us in terms of being able to drive growth both on the top line and earnings. We acquired Big Red with cash. We had a very unique transaction with the Honickman Companies to be able to secure our brands in the metro New York area. We've entered into other deals that are more partnership. And then I'm going to segue into your next question because it's related. If you take a look since 2019, we've done about a dozen transactions in the route-to-market space, and nearly all of those were paid for right out of our cash flow. So it just tells you that we have incredible cash flow visibility that allows us to do all of this activity while delevering, while increasing our dividend payment and also investing in plant infrastructure and technology. So it's just another opportunity to reward our shareholders. With regard to the route-to-market space, you asked what our goal is. It's all of the above. So we look at our business market by market and as we've joked with you sometimes, but it's not far off, ZIP code by ZIP code. Our situation is very different across the market. In aggregate, we control the distribution or we have DSD coverage that covers somewhere slightly north of 75% of the U.S. population. But for those of you that know the business intimately, you know that it's very different brand by brand.  So it's a two pronged approach. We invest heavily in our brands through marketing and innovation and renovation. And then we need to make sure that market by market, we have the most competitive distribution system for those brands. And that has led to all of the transactions that I just talked about and the couple that you highlighted. And what does that do for us? It's a long-term play, not a short-term play. It gives us access to both growth through better execution and also gives us access to efficiency through consolidation of inefficient retail distribution.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So the 28% brewer growth in Q4 was very striking. It even came a few quarters into COVID when, theoretically, a lot of new households had already purchased brewers in response to COVID. So I was just hoping you could be a bit more specific on the key drivers behind the Q4 brewer strength. How sustainable that might be as we look forward into 2021? And then also, just taking a step back and looking more at the full year. Clearly, the 3 million household penetration increases above that typical 2 million pace. So just how do you think about that incremental 1 million households? Does a lot of that sort of come out in 2021? Or do you think that 2021 household increase could be similar to the historical range pre-COVID-driven 2020, in theory?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. Those are good -- great questions. Let me start with the last one, which is household penetration and then talk about brewer growth. Because as we said all along, brewer growth is not a great predictor of household penetration. And while there is a correlation between the 2, not necessarily year in and year out. So let me start with household penetration. You're correct that our most recent run rate has been about 2 million net new households per year. That increased to 3 million households. We don't believe that's a pull forward from '21. We don't believe that that's actually material in the grand scheme of things.  Because the best way to look at this business is to look at it over a longer period of time. Definitely not quarter-to-quarter, and even year-to-year isn't particularly helpful. And why I say that is, in the past 5 years, so if you take a look at the 5 years since Keurig was taken private and then merged with KDP, that's a good time frame. We've increased households from 21 million to 33 million. That's an increase of about 9% per year. It's a compound growth of 9% per year. It's 12 million new households. And if you recall back in 2015, 2016, the word on -- out there was that household penetration had flattened and the market was saturated, and we've increased our household base by more than 50% since then.  With all that growth, if you go back to the Investor Day presentation that we laid out in great detail in 2018, and with the remaining universes of households, there's still another 60 million households that ultimately should be converted from brewing coffee by the pot to brewing it by the cup. And Keurig, obviously, has the lion's share of that. And so we've got years and years of runway ahead of us at the growth rate that we're at. So when you look at 2 million to 3 million year-over-year, it looks material. When you look at going from 21 million to 33 million in 5 years with 60 million households a go, 1 million is a blip in all of that.  Having said that, let's be careful on the year-over-year comparisons, which everyone will report on. So if we went back to our normal 2 million household penetration growth, that would look like 6% growth in 2021. I'm not projecting. I'm just keep going through the illustration. And people will write that there's a deceleration in household penetration, which would actually be a real misleading conclusion. Let's talk about brewer sales. Brewer sales are a combination of things. They're a combination of new households entering the system, people upgrading their brewers as we introduce new models with benefits and features that didn't exist before. We're seeing more upgrades. And also, we see replacements of brewers that over time fail. So we shipped 11 million brewers last year. That was a record number.  In addition to the strong household penetration growth, we saw a record number of upgrades. People were investing in their work-from-home situation. We've got all these great brewers that were just introduced in the past couple of years, and so we saw people lean in and upgrade. And as I always point out, while that doesn't have a material impact in the year, that's yet another household recommitting to the Keurig system for the next 3, 4, 5 years. So it's all incredibly bullish.  Going into this year, we wouldn't expect to see that number in 2021. We don't need that -- we don't need 11 million brewers to support a 2 million or even a 3 million household penetration growth. We have no idea how many people are going to upgrade. That's something that we can't predict.  So I think as you look at 2021, a flat number on brewer growth would be extraordinary. A decline in brewer growth would be very normal and would support great household penetration growth. But again, watch for the headlines that are going to say how brewer sales are down and it's a concern about the Keurig system in the future. My last -- because it's a good point of time for me to say this. I think my last point is, as we think about '20 to '21, you guys are going to have to do this across the board. Just make sure you take a look at 2-year stack numbers, not just year-to-year numbers. So as I put in my script, when you took -- look at the total KDP basis, a 2-year stack basis, which takes out all that noise, in 2021, if we hit the midpoint of our guidance, we're going to be 8% revenue growth over 2 years and 29% EPS. So I think that's the way we're going to have to look at the world in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.\nSunil Modi: I was looking at some of this numerator data, and it's showing how more and more of the pods are being sold online, regardless of the brewers, bought online or in a brick-and-mortar environment. So I was just hoping you can share with us the implications of that from a P&L perspective margin-wise, consumer insight, visibility, right, because it's not as easy to track just from a retail consumption standpoint. So any clarity around that would be helpful.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. So it's -- that's a great insight. We've been really proud of the development that we have in e-commerce. When we launched the company in 2018, we talked about 1 of the 7 routes to market being e-commerce, and that we believe that we were the most developed food and beverage company in that. 2018, I don't think anyone really cared much about e-commerce and beverage. But today, we all care. And we talked last year about more than 10% of our total company sales going through e-commerce. And obviously, that's an area that's accelerating dramatically. On coffee, in particular, coffee pods, we go -- we get to the consumer through e-commerce 2 ways: We go through retailer.com and amazon.com, but we also go through Keurig.com. I know it's more challenging for you guys to have visibility of that. We've talked about that, on pods, in particular, that an increasing percentage of our pod sales are not visible through traditional syndicated data, but we have a really good handle on what goes on in e-commerce. And to your point before, we also, in many cases, are able track it down to the individual consumer who's buying this. So we have a much more targeted marketing program as a result of all of that. As far as margins and all of that go, it's great. There's not a concern here. It's more challenging, as you can imagine, to ship liquids. I think the future of e-commerce and liquids is much more in the click-and-collect mode or home-delivery mode, not shipping it through traditional FedEx and UPS. But Keurig pods are high value, lightweight, long shelf life, don't damage. It's almost an ideal item to ship through traditional e-commerce channels, and that's why it's been really attractive. So it's going to be an increasing part of growth in our business. And one of the things we'll talk about in 2021 is the launch of the first consumer -- excuse me, the first connected brewer for broad-scale consumer use. We're excited about that. We'll talk to you about that in the future. And I think that's going to accelerate more of the e-commerce attractiveness for the Keurig business going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: So my question is on the competitive environment. And Bob, you mentioned the investments and also innovation that you're putting for both Packaged Beverages and coffee. So are you seeing the need to increase A&P investments in light of what some of your competitors have announced, particularly in flavors? And the second part of this question, if you can also talk about pricing for Packaged Beverages and the coffee pods in the context of your outlook for 2021?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. Our reason for restoring marketing is because we have an objective to increase our marketing as a percentage of sales over time. And we know what happened in COVID across the board. We're really proud of the fact that despite the fact that we had to pull some of that marketing -- and some of it, it was just a bad environment to invest in advertising. And they're certainly in the early and mid parts of the year. And other parts of it was because of the great mix headwind that everybody in the industry faced.  We were proud of the fact that we did that, but we got really efficient in where and how we spend our marketing. And my best evidence of that is the market share gains across our portfolio that suggest that we were able to still balance brand growth, investments in innovation, with a more restricted marketing budget. Every opportunity that we get, we will invest in marketing and innovation. That's what we're doing in 2021. It's not a reaction to competition at all. It's an investment in the great pipeline of brand ideas that we have. And as you can tell from all of our conversation here, we are building this business for the long haul.  As I referenced before, when we looked at the fourth quarter, and we knew that we were trending very strong for 2020, we were very explicit in saying any over-delivery would be reinvested back into brand growth, and that's exactly what we achieved in Q4. So that's our ambition, is to build a very healthy brand portfolio for the long haul. With regard to pricing, I think this industry is incredibly rational in pricing. And we don't discuss what our specific outlook is for pricing in a given year, but we're -- we have our eye on inflation, as does everyone. And I think that the beverage industry has shown that it's been able to recover inflation through a combination of productivity and pricing, and I wouldn't expect that would change going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. And again, congratulations on a terrific year in very challenging circumstances. So as you look out on 2021, I think a lot of the shelf changes were postponed or didn't happen in 2020. What are the shelf sets look like for the spring reset? Do you get a sense that you're gaining shelf space? And maybe give us an update on some of the new brand initiatives: Don't Quit, A Shoc, Polar. So that would be the first question. And just the second question, just a detail, if you could give us a reminder of your investment in BODYARMOR and if, in fact, that gets sold, what -- how to look at proceeds to KDP?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, sure. I think -- let me start with the shelf changes. A more normal year in 2021 than 2020 when innovation was more challenging to get on the shelf. We got a good head start with Dr Pepper & Cream and also with Canada Dry Bold. And as you know, we have a long list of innovation and renovation that we launch every year, so I'm not going to mention them all.  I think 2021 is -- it looks more normal in access to the shelf. We've got a really strong lineup of innovation across the board. We talked about some of it in the prepared remarks, but we -- again, we have much more than that. And so we stand in a really good position to get that strong innovation and renovation on the shelf quickly.  And our speed to market as a company has improved every single year. And it's -- we're very proud of the distribution system that we're building, a combination of our company-owned DSD as well as our independent partners. And through a combination of strength of ideas, better joint planning with our partners and our customers, we've been able to improve our reach to shelf. And so that's going to continue. You mentioned some of the seed investments that we have in brands like Don't Quit and A Shoc. All in early stages, all very promising, too small at this stage for us to report. But I would expect that when we do our Investor Day midyear, we'll give a more comprehensive update on all of the start-up investments.  And that's just one of many tools that we employ, where we've said before that we can launch something on our own. We can partner with somebody in a joint distribution manner as we've done with things -- brands like evian. We can make seed investments as we did with Don't Quit and A Shoc, and we can acquire things outright, as we did with CORE.  Polar is off to a great start. It's a terrific brand and really our play in the sparkling water, flavored sparkling water segment. We're ramping that up right now. The ACV for Polar has already improved by about 20 ACV points nationally. So it shows the strength of our partnership with them. And obviously, you can tell by the comments here that we're very bullish on driving that brand to a national leader in the not-too-distant future.  And then the last one, BODYARMOR. It's publicly available. We have 12.5% ownership stake in BODYARMOR. If and when that business is sold, then we would receive payment just like any other investor would receive payment at that time. And we don't know anything more than what's been publicly reported to date. So I think I covered all of your territory there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean King with UBS.\nSean King: When we think about your three year synergies coming to an end this year, have you identified savings opportunities amidst the pandemic, like some of your large U.S. peers, that can carry the margin expansion story into -- beyond the 3-year guidance?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, I'm going to turn this over to Ozan for more specifics. Our initial focus is to make sure we deliver those synergies because there were some questions on day 1. Could we really achieve those? And obviously, we have a line of sight to do that. But we also know that, that's a -- synergies are always a short-term situation. And we made sure that we had line of sight to productivity beyond. But also we used it not just to drop to the bottom line, but to invest heavily in our business during this mode.  But Ozan, do you want to pick up from there and think -- and talk about how we think about productivity beyond synergies?\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Absolutely. So let me step back and look at it. As you said, three years ago, 2.5 years ago, to be precise, we said that we expect to deliver $600 million of deal synergies, starting 2019 through 2021, $200 million every year. And as we just spoke, during our script, we are very happy to share with everyone that, after two years, we have delivered successfully $400 million of synergies, and we expect to deliver another $200 million in 2021. That would complete the 3-year cycle of the merger synergies that we put out there. Now we also said and shared publicly that overall efficiencies, we look at it in 2 big buckets: One is the merger synergies that I just spoke. And the second one, as we define and call it, base productivity programs, which obviously, base productivity programs will continue, including 2021 and beyond.  When we step back and look at it holistically, we have several programs and initiatives that actually either we are executing now or we will be starting to execute to continue to fuel the base productivity programs that we have. For example, when you look to what's happening in the Coffee Systems, we are building a state-of-the-art K-Cup facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina. As I said, I think, 10 minutes ago, we are at the early phase of having, let's say, test runs over there. And we expect to ramp up the facility for the remainder of the 2021 and beyond 2022. That will be a good source of base productivity programs for us. When we look to Packaged Beverages, for example, at this year, we are also building and will be put into service and Allentown, Pennsylvania and again, in a state-of-the-art aseptic systems lines, for example. That will continue to drive down our costs.  On the Beverage Concentrates side, for example, we are building the second concentrate plant in Ireland. And besides the continuity of our business will be secured, given we only have one facility now in St. Louis, we'll also have some financial benefits at the same time. And these are, for example, the 3 big programs that we have. But on top of this, we always look for efficiencies, and we have several other programs that we are implementing as we speak. Therefore, we feel very confident that beyond 2021 that our overall efficiency programs will be intact and will help us to drive further profit growth and margin enhancement.\nOperator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Tyson Seely.\nTyson Seely: Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I know it's a busy day for many of you. But as usual, the IR team, myself and Steve, are around for any follow-up calls, so please feel free to reach out to us. Stay well, and be safe. Thank you, everyone.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, presenters, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining Keurig Dr Pepper Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ozan Dokmecioglu",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Continuing, on an adjusted basis, I will briefly review our performance for the fourth quarter, which our press release discusses in significant detail, and then turning to our full year 2020 performance and our 2021 guidance. In the fourth quarter, constant currency net sales increased 6.6%, fueled by higher volume/mix of 6.3% and favorable net price realization of 0.3%, with our Coffee Systems, Packaged Beverages and Latin America Beverages segments, all posting growth.  Adjusted operating income increased 5.5% in the quarter, driven by strong net sales growth, continued productivity, merger synergies and lower discretionary spending, which includes marketing. These drivers were partially offset by the unfavorable comparison to a $30 million gain in the prior year on the sale-leaseback of 3 manufacturing facilities, higher operating costs in the current year associated with increased consumer demand and inflation in logistics. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew 5.7%. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 11.4% in the fourth quarter, driven by the growth in adjusted operating income and lower interest expense and lower effective tax rate.  Let me turn now to our full year results for 2020. Constant currency net sales increased 5%, driven by higher volume/mix of 5.6%, partially offset by lower net price realization of 0.6%. Adjusted operating income increased 10.4%, and adjusted operating income margin expanded 150 basis points to 27.5%. This performance was driven by strong revenue growth, continued productivity, merger synergies and lower discretionary expenses. These drivers were partially offset by higher operating costs associated with increased consumer demand for our products, inflation in logistics and certain other COVID-19-related costs.  On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew nearly 11%. For the year, pretax operating costs directly related to COVID-19 totaled $150 million, of which $128 million were recognized as items affecting comparability. These costs consisted of temporary and unusual compensation increases, incentives for frontline employees, incremental health and safety measures across our employee base and enhanced sanitation expenses for our facilities. The remaining $22 million of costs represented inventory write-downs and bad debt expense that were incurred in the first half of 2020 and included in adjusted results.  Adjusted diluted EPS advanced 15% to $1.40 for the year. This strong performance was fueled by the growth in adjusted operating income, lower interest expense as a result of continued deleveraging and the lower effective tax rate. Turning to our segment performance for the year. Coffee Systems constant currency net sales increased 4.8%, driven by higher volume/mix of 7.2%, partially offset by lower net price realization of 2.4%. The volume/mix performance reflected pod volume growth of 6.3%, driven by double-digit at-home consumption, partially offset by the significant decline in the away-from-home coffee businesses. The strong 21% increase in brewer shipments for the year was fueled by continued expansion of households coming into the system and existing households upgrading their brewers, continued brewer innovation, marketing investments to grow household penetration and a very successful holiday season.  Adjusted operating income for Coffee Systems increased 7.9%, and adjusted operating margin grew 110 basis points to 34.2%. This performance was fueled by the net sales growth, continued productivity and merger synergies and lower discretionary spending. These drivers were partially offset by the unfavorable margin mix related to the very strong brewer shipment growth for the year. Packaged Beverages constant currency net sales grew 8.5% for the year, driven by strong volume/mix of 8.2% and higher net pricing of 0.3%. This performance reflected particularly strong growth in our company-owned DSD operations and our warehouse direct business, driven by very strong execution that drove market share expansion across the portfolio, including carbonated soft drinks, premium unflavored water, ready-to-drink tea, shelf-stable juice drinks, apple juice and apple sauce.  Adjusted operating income for the segment increased 30%, and adjusted operating margin expanded 320 basis points to 19%. This performance reflected the strong net sales growth, continued productivity and merger synergies and lower discretionary expenses, partially offset by higher operating costs to meet strong consumer demand and inflation in logistics. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 31%. Beverage Concentrates constant currency net sales declined 6% due to unfavorable volume/mix of 5.8% and lower net pricing of 0.4%. This performance reflected the impact of COVID-19 on the fountain foodservice business, which primarily serves the restaurant and hospitality sector. Adjusted operating income for Beverage Concentrates decreased 2% due to lower net sales, partially offset by lower discretionary expenses, while adjusted operating margin advanced 310 basis points to 70.8%. And finally, Latin America Beverages constant currency net sales grew 3.8%, reflecting strong net pricing of 5.8%, partially offset by lower volume/mix of 2%, due primarily to the impact of COVID-19 in Mexico. Adjusted operating income increased 32%, driven by continued productivity and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency transaction expense and inflation in logistics. Adjusted operating margin increased 620 basis points to 21.7%. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income grew nearly 43%. Turning to synergies. We delivered approximately $200 million in 2020, bringing total merger synergies to approximating $400 million over the past 2 years. Free cash flow in 2020 was again exceptionally strong at approximately $2.2 billion. This translated into an adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio in excess of 110%. We also ended the year with $240 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Our strong free cash flow performance enabled us to reduce outstanding bank debt by more than $950 million and structured payables by $170 million, for a total reduction in financial obligations of $1.1 billion in 2020.  Due to our reduction in bank debt, growth in adjusted earnings and cash on hand, we improved our management leverage ratio by nearly a full turn to 3.6x in 2020. Since the merger closed in July 2018, we have reduced our management leverage ratio by an impressive 2.4 turns. As Bob discussed earlier, the KDP Board of Directors has approved a 25% increase in our annualized dividend rate from $0.60 per share to $0.75 per share beginning with the second quarter dividend, which is paid in the third quarter and subject to the Board's official declaration. This new rate will drive a 12.5% increase in dividends per share in 2021 and another 11.1% increase in 2022.  Importantly, despite the sizable increase, our dividend payout ratio remains below 50% of free cash flow. Highly cash-generative nature of our business as well as our strong profit growth is expected to enable us to continue to delever to 3x or below by the end of 2021. Let me now move on to our outlook for 2021. We expect 2021 to be another good year for KDP, which, as Bob mentioned, will drive exceptional results on a 2-year stack basis. Before jumping into the full year outlook, let me provide some context for quarter 1.  As indicated previously, we exited 2020 with a strong top line momentum, and we expect to benefit from that in the first quarter. On the cost side, you will recall that we will be comping a $42 million gain in the first quarter of 2020 on sale-leaseback transactions and another $20 million gain in the year ago quarter from unwinding interest rate swaps. We believe this context will be useful to you as you build your models for 2021.  The specifics of our 2021 outlook include: on a constant currency basis, we expect net sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 4% for the year, which continues to be above our 3-year merger target of 2% to 3%. This strong growth is expected to be driven by higher year-over-year investments in innovation and marketing, the benefit of recent partnerships and ongoing in-market executional strength. Adjusted diluted EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 13% to 15%, representing $1.58 to $1.61 per diluted share. Importantly, over the 3-year period ending 2021, this performance will position us to achieve our merger target for average annual growth of 15% to 17%.  We again expect merger synergies of approximately $200 million in 2021, delivering on our 3-year target of $600 million. Adjusted interest expense is expected to be in the range of $505 million to $515 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24% for the year. We expect our management leverage ratio to be at or below 3x at the end of 2021. With that, I will hand it back over to the operator for your questions. Absolutely, absolutely. We already started our test runs at our Spartanburg facility. And obviously, it's a multiyear ramping up the production facility given the huge size and the volume that will come out. But all we can say at this point in time, we are 100% on track in terms of continuing month-in, month-out ramping up of our facility. And as we do, as you said, we do expect to further lower our cost of production in the pods. As we communicated previously, Spartanburg facility, as we go into the year, especially second half of '21 and beyond, will be one of the base productivity sources to improve our efficiency in our manufacturing facility with regards to the pods. But not only that, we also have several other programs that will continue to help us to deal with the management of our overall per pod cost going forward at the same time. So the things are on track. So on the inflation point, yes, we expect 2021 to face higher inflationary pressure than 2020. And we have built that into our guidance for the year, obviously. And we are very confident that we can manage the exposure. Primary areas of inflation in 2021, as you also alluded, Bryan, would be in the logistics as well as corn-related products. While other areas, such as coffee, for example, that we contract for yearly, not months, will also serve as a partial offset.  It's basically the umbrella of the commodity and the input cost management that we always do. And when the opportunity presents itself, we also hedge ourselves in order to manage our cost profile. Therefore, we believe we have a good balance right now. It is true. We are seeing, as I said, on a couple of line items, cost pressures increasing in '21 versus '20. At the same time, second point is -- the answer for your question with regards to the Beverage Concentrates. It is true, when we look in a closing, like a month or 2, we may see some lagging with regards to the -- our concentrate shipments in Beverage Concentrates as well as the finished product shipments from our bottlers or the distributors. But when we take a medium to a little longer-term perspective, they always catch up, and that's what we are going to see in 2021 as well. Absolutely. So let me step back and look at it. As you said, three years ago, 2.5 years ago, to be precise, we said that we expect to deliver $600 million of deal synergies, starting 2019 through 2021, $200 million every year. And as we just spoke, during our script, we are very happy to share with everyone that, after two years, we have delivered successfully $400 million of synergies, and we expect to deliver another $200 million in 2021. That would complete the 3-year cycle of the merger synergies that we put out there. Now we also said and shared publicly that overall efficiencies, we look at it in 2 big buckets: One is the merger synergies that I just spoke. And the second one, as we define and call it, base productivity programs, which obviously, base productivity programs will continue, including 2021 and beyond.  When we step back and look at it holistically, we have several programs and initiatives that actually either we are executing now or we will be starting to execute to continue to fuel the base productivity programs that we have. For example, when you look to what's happening in the Coffee Systems, we are building a state-of-the-art K-Cup facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina. As I said, I think, 10 minutes ago, we are at the early phase of having, let's say, test runs over there. And we expect to ramp up the facility for the remainder of the 2021 and beyond 2022. That will be a good source of base productivity programs for us. When we look to Packaged Beverages, for example, at this year, we are also building and will be put into service and Allentown, Pennsylvania and again, in a state-of-the-art aseptic systems lines, for example. That will continue to drive down our costs.  On the Beverage Concentrates side, for example, we are building the second concentrate plant in Ireland. And besides the continuity of our business will be secured, given we only have one facility now in St. Louis, we'll also have some financial benefits at the same time. And these are, for example, the 3 big programs that we have. But on top of this, we always look for efficiencies, and we have several other programs that we are implementing as we speak. Therefore, we feel very confident that beyond 2021 that our overall efficiency programs will be intact and will help us to drive further profit growth and margin enhancement. Thanks."

            "name": "Robert Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks, Tyson, and good morning. Before getting started, I'd like to express my best wishes to everyone that you and your families are well. It's hard to believe that we've all been operating under the pandemic for almost a year. And while vaccines are providing hope for a return to normalcy later this year, the spike in COVID cases in January, followed by extreme weather in February suggest that 2021 will be another unpredictable year.  At the start of the pandemic, we put in place our ONE KDP plan, which prioritize keeping our employees safe and healthy, delivering for our customers and consumers and providing for our communities. These priorities have served us well. Additionally, our success in navigating this crisis to date has been aided by using data and technology to leverage the breadth of our portfolio and the unique reach of our distribution network to effectively manage portfolio and channel mix. In 2020, we delivered at or above the high end of the annual guidance we established at the beginning of the year. And the 2021 guidance we are providing today points to our confidence in achieving the 3-year merger commitments communicated in 2018, despite the macro environment becoming significantly more challenging since that time.  As you saw from our earlier announcement, we are increasing our dividend rate by 25%, starting in the second quarter of this year. This reflects the line of sight we have to continued strong free cash flow, which enables us to simultaneously increase our return of value to shareholders, reach our deleveraging target by year-end and invest in expanded production capacity, innovation and technology. In fact, our dividend payout ratio, even after the 25% increase announced today, remains below 50% of free cash flow.  Finally, we're fully committed to deliver both TSR and ESG. In 2020, we achieved nearly all of our aggressive sustainability goals. And in 2021, we have signed up for new and expanded ESG goals, including health and well-being and diversity and inclusion. We will publish specifics for each in our corporate responsibility report in June.  All of this underpins our journey from 2 separate companies to a combined new challenger in the beverage industry to a Modern Beverage Company with an exciting future. We look forward to sharing our long-term vision and plans for KDP when we conduct an Investor Day in the second half of this year.  Let me take a few minutes to step back and provide key highlights of our 2020 performance. We delivered accelerated constant currency net sales growth of 5% in 2020, with strong momentum exiting the year. Driving that revenue growth were exceptionally strong in-market results across the business.  In cold beverages, we gained market share in more than 90% of our retail base, including market share growth in excess of 1 full point in CSDs. This was driven by double-digit consumption growth of Dr Pepper and Canada Dry, our largest CSD brands, as well as A&W, 7UP, Sunkist and Squirt. Dr Pepper & Cream Soda became the #1 new flavor in the CSD category in 2020, while Canada Dry Bold also performed exceptionally well. Canada Dry is now the only CSD brand to achieve volume and dollar growth for the past 14 consecutive years. Strength in cold beverages extended well beyond CSDs, with KDP share growth in premium water, ready-to-drink tea, shelf-stable fruit drinks and Mott's apple juice and sauce.  As we discussed on previous earnings calls, the pandemic required us to manage mix across channels, beverage segments and even pack types to react to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping and consumption patterns. This is driving growth in multipacks and cans sold in large outlets and e-commerce to offset slowdowns in fountain foodservice, convenience and gas channels and as a result, impulse packs. Our speed in pivoting to these changes was enabled by new uses of data and technology, consistently strong in-market execution, leveraging our highly developed e-commerce capability and a flexible and resilient supply chain team.  Our coffee business also had a strong year. Consumer purchases of Keurig manufactured K-Cup pods registered double-digit growth, while brewer shipments grew 21%, which reflects a combination of new households entering the system as well as existing households upgrading their brewers. Household expansion of the Keurig system was very strong this year with approximately 3 million new households entering the system. That translates to 10% household growth, nicely above our longer-term pre-pandemic trend of approximately 7% growth per year.  Not surprisingly, the consumer shift to work-from-home meant at-home consumption of K-Cup pods was strong throughout the year, while the away-from-home channel, which is focused on offices, remained a significant headwind. And while we expect the away-from-home business to improve slowly over the course of 2021, we will begin to lap the 2020 declines in the second quarter of this year. In addition to our strong top line results, our bottom line performance was also strong for the year, with adjusted diluted EPS growing 15% to $1.40, which represents the high end of our 2020 guidance. This was achieved by offsetting significant mix headwinds and operating cost pressures with revenue growth that was above our targets, continued strong productivity and merger synergies and reductions in discretionary spending.  We also drove strong free cash flow, which enabled us to reduce our indebtedness and improve our management leverage ratio to 3.6x, while also making significant capital investments, specifically: our new Spartanburg, South Carolina coffee pod facility, which will be the largest LEED-certified manufacturing facility in North America; our Allentown, Pennsylvania cold beverages facility, which was recognized as Plant of the Year by Food Engineering magazine; and our Newbridge, Ireland facility, which represents our second manufacturing location for our important Beverage Concentrates business. In 2020, we also invested in the expansion of our portfolio and DSD network through multiple transactions, including a long-term agreement we announced with the Honickman Companies that provides KDP with sales and distribution for key brands in the metro New York area, national franchise agreement with Polar Beverages and other numerous transactions with smaller but strategic independent bottlers to ensure competitive distribution scale for our brands. Consistent with our focus on improving the effectiveness of our distribution system, we exited some nonstrategic SKUs during the year, enabling us to keep our high-volume brands in stock and creating space for new partnerships and 2021 innovation.  In 2020, we also made great progress on our sustainability initiatives. We now responsibly source 100% of our coffee and 85% of our brewers and have improved the livelihoods of over 1 million people in our supply chain.  We also completed our multiyear conversion to 100% recyclable K-Cup pods. And during the year, we co-founded 2 industry coalitions focused on enhancing U.S. recycling infrastructure. We launched our first post-consumer recycled, or PCR, packaging in cold beverages, putting us on track to deliver our goal of using 30% PCR in our packaging across the business by 2025.  This long list of accomplishments would be impressive in any year, but it is even more so against the backdrop of the challenges and uncertainty we faced in 2020. I'm proud of and grateful for the nearly 27,000 team members across KDP who have proven to be our underlying competitive advantage.  Turning now to our outlook for 2021. The guidance we're providing today is consistent with the commitments we laid out at the time of the merger announcement and position us to meet our 3-year merger targets. Specifically, for 2021, we expect constant currency net sales in the range of 3% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of 13% to 15%. On a 2-year stack basis, which eliminates any noise from COVID impact, this translates into net sales growth of over 8% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of nearly 29%, both at the midpoint of the ranges.  Our confidence in 2021 growth is supported by both innovation and renovation, both of which will be backed by increased marketing investment. Ongoing productivity savings and our final year of merger synergies will help offset increased inflation. We expect our management leverage ratio to improve by 3x by year-end, driven primarily by our continued strong free cash flow generation. In 2021, we are rolling out zero-sugar varieties across our CSD portfolio. For most brands, the new zero offerings represent a rebranding of our existing diet SKUs to more clearly articulate the zero-sugar benefit to consumers. For Dr Pepper, the introduction of a zero-sugar variety will be in addition to original Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper. We are also introducing Bai Boost a new platform with caffeine; and Mott's Mighty, a line of juices and sauces fortified with vitamins and fiber. In addition, we will be launching new flavor varieties across many of our brands.  We've begun the staged rollout of our new Snapple bottles made with 100% recycled PET and featuring new graphics. Also, we are now producing all CORE hydration bottles with 100% of rPET.  In coffee, we have another strong lineup of new brewers planned for this year, including our first connected brewer for the broader consumer market. We'll share additional information on this exciting new brewer and other brewers planned as we get closer to launch. In 2021, we expect continued strength in owned and licensed coffee. Last year, we reversed long-term trends by expanding sales and consumption of our owned and licensed brand portfolio. Within that portfolio, we have been able to improve the sales trajectory for the McCafe\u0301 brand, in partnership with McDonald's, which became a licensed brand for us in the second half of 2020.  In 2021, we will launch Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Brew Over Ice pods, which taps into the growth of cold coffee. The majority of our brewers launched since 2018 also have a Brew Over Ice option. We are expanding our highly successful Original Donut Shop One Step Lattes introduced in 2020 into One Step cappuccinos. Last year, The Original Donut Shop brand registered double-digit consumption growth and market share expansion on the strength of the new One Step offerings and a new marketing platform.  Before turning it over to Ozan, I'd like to recognize the entire KDP organization for their tireless efforts in delivering such strong and well-balanced results. Because of their success, we have confidence in our 2021 goals, and we look forward to sharing our longer-term outlook at an Investor Day later this year. I'll now hand it over to Ozan to take you through the specifics of our financial results. Yes. Okay. I'm going to take the first one, and then I'm going to turn it over to Ozan to talk about Spartanburg. Coffee attachment rates have been very steady for years. And in the past, we've talked about the best proxy for household penetration growth is actually pod volume growth because of attachment rate being so stable.  In the early part of the shelter-in-place, we saw an increase in attachment rates, as you would expect. Obviously, we got some benefit from that in the early part of this, but we've seen it normalize over time. And our expectations going forward is that it does normalize over time. So we did get a short-term benefit from that, but remember, that was offsetting a significant hit that we were getting to our office coffee business. So all of the guidance that we put out there for 2021 does anticipate a more normalized attachment rate.  Ozan, you want to talk about Spartanburg. Yes. I mean a couple of things. I mean when we put our algorithm out there, we didn't say we were going to achieve 15% to 17% every year and the guidance we just put out there puts it nicely within that range, in that 15% to 17% despite what we all agree is a world that is very different than it was in 2018.  The one comment I would put is we are restoring marketing in 2021. We've said all along that any opportunity to restore marketing to drive growth, we would do so. In fact, on our Q3 earnings call, I think we were really clear on our intentions. And when we provided our guidance, and we said that we would be in the 13% to 15% range for 2020, we also said any opportunity to over-deliver would be reinvested back in our business for growth, which is exactly what we did. We came in right at the high end of our guidance. We reinvested back into growth, and we achieved 6.6% revenue growth in the fourth quarter.  So we look at our outlook for 2021 to be incredibly strong and, more importantly, well balanced. Because the results that we've delivered are not driven by anything that would hurt us in the long term by driving the short term. In fact, quite the opposite. We've invested in brand growth and innovation, in new plant capacity. We've invested in technology. And that's why we're able to do things like grow share on 90% of our portfolio and add an extra 1 million households into the Keurig system. On the dividend side, we know that dividends are an important part of shareholder return in this space. And we saw an opportunity to provide more return to our shareholders by increasing the dividend 25%. We do that while simultaneously sticking to our deleveraging target and also investing heavily in the business. And all I would say on that one is it's reflective of the very strong confidence that we have and line of sight to continued strong earnings and strong free cash flow. And even with that substantial increase in dividend rate, our payout ratio is still below 50%, which is well below just about anyone else in this space.  It doesn't change our outlook at all on our ability to participate in M&A. We've said all along that, even with our commitment to rapidly delever, we would be able to participate in the M&A space in a number of different ways. With CORE, for example, we used shares to make that acquisition, and that acquisition has been very value-accretive to us in terms of being able to drive growth both on the top line and earnings. We acquired Big Red with cash. We had a very unique transaction with the Honickman Companies to be able to secure our brands in the metro New York area. We've entered into other deals that are more partnership. And then I'm going to segue into your next question because it's related. If you take a look since 2019, we've done about a dozen transactions in the route-to-market space, and nearly all of those were paid for right out of our cash flow. So it just tells you that we have incredible cash flow visibility that allows us to do all of this activity while delevering, while increasing our dividend payment and also investing in plant infrastructure and technology. So it's just another opportunity to reward our shareholders. With regard to the route-to-market space, you asked what our goal is. It's all of the above. So we look at our business market by market and as we've joked with you sometimes, but it's not far off, ZIP code by ZIP code. Our situation is very different across the market. In aggregate, we control the distribution or we have DSD coverage that covers somewhere slightly north of 75% of the U.S. population. But for those of you that know the business intimately, you know that it's very different brand by brand.  So it's a two pronged approach. We invest heavily in our brands through marketing and innovation and renovation. And then we need to make sure that market by market, we have the most competitive distribution system for those brands. And that has led to all of the transactions that I just talked about and the couple that you highlighted. And what does that do for us? It's a long-term play, not a short-term play. It gives us access to both growth through better execution and also gives us access to efficiency through consolidation of inefficient retail distribution. Yes. Those are good -- great questions. Let me start with the last one, which is household penetration and then talk about brewer growth. Because as we said all along, brewer growth is not a great predictor of household penetration. And while there is a correlation between the 2, not necessarily year in and year out. So let me start with household penetration. You're correct that our most recent run rate has been about 2 million net new households per year. That increased to 3 million households. We don't believe that's a pull forward from '21. We don't believe that that's actually material in the grand scheme of things.  Because the best way to look at this business is to look at it over a longer period of time. Definitely not quarter-to-quarter, and even year-to-year isn't particularly helpful. And why I say that is, in the past 5 years, so if you take a look at the 5 years since Keurig was taken private and then merged with KDP, that's a good time frame. We've increased households from 21 million to 33 million. That's an increase of about 9% per year. It's a compound growth of 9% per year. It's 12 million new households. And if you recall back in 2015, 2016, the word on -- out there was that household penetration had flattened and the market was saturated, and we've increased our household base by more than 50% since then.  With all that growth, if you go back to the Investor Day presentation that we laid out in great detail in 2018, and with the remaining universes of households, there's still another 60 million households that ultimately should be converted from brewing coffee by the pot to brewing it by the cup. And Keurig, obviously, has the lion's share of that. And so we've got years and years of runway ahead of us at the growth rate that we're at. So when you look at 2 million to 3 million year-over-year, it looks material. When you look at going from 21 million to 33 million in 5 years with 60 million households a go, 1 million is a blip in all of that.  Having said that, let's be careful on the year-over-year comparisons, which everyone will report on. So if we went back to our normal 2 million household penetration growth, that would look like 6% growth in 2021. I'm not projecting. I'm just keep going through the illustration. And people will write that there's a deceleration in household penetration, which would actually be a real misleading conclusion. Let's talk about brewer sales. Brewer sales are a combination of things. They're a combination of new households entering the system, people upgrading their brewers as we introduce new models with benefits and features that didn't exist before. We're seeing more upgrades. And also, we see replacements of brewers that over time fail. So we shipped 11 million brewers last year. That was a record number.  In addition to the strong household penetration growth, we saw a record number of upgrades. People were investing in their work-from-home situation. We've got all these great brewers that were just introduced in the past couple of years, and so we saw people lean in and upgrade. And as I always point out, while that doesn't have a material impact in the year, that's yet another household recommitting to the Keurig system for the next 3, 4, 5 years. So it's all incredibly bullish.  Going into this year, we wouldn't expect to see that number in 2021. We don't need that -- we don't need 11 million brewers to support a 2 million or even a 3 million household penetration growth. We have no idea how many people are going to upgrade. That's something that we can't predict.  So I think as you look at 2021, a flat number on brewer growth would be extraordinary. A decline in brewer growth would be very normal and would support great household penetration growth. But again, watch for the headlines that are going to say how brewer sales are down and it's a concern about the Keurig system in the future. My last -- because it's a good point of time for me to say this. I think my last point is, as we think about '20 to '21, you guys are going to have to do this across the board. Just make sure you take a look at 2-year stack numbers, not just year-to-year numbers. So as I put in my script, when you took -- look at the total KDP basis, a 2-year stack basis, which takes out all that noise, in 2021, if we hit the midpoint of our guidance, we're going to be 8% revenue growth over 2 years and 29% EPS. So I think that's the way we're going to have to look at the world in 2021. Yes. So it's -- that's a great insight. We've been really proud of the development that we have in e-commerce. When we launched the company in 2018, we talked about 1 of the 7 routes to market being e-commerce, and that we believe that we were the most developed food and beverage company in that. 2018, I don't think anyone really cared much about e-commerce and beverage. But today, we all care. And we talked last year about more than 10% of our total company sales going through e-commerce. And obviously, that's an area that's accelerating dramatically. On coffee, in particular, coffee pods, we go -- we get to the consumer through e-commerce 2 ways: We go through retailer.com and amazon.com, but we also go through Keurig.com. I know it's more challenging for you guys to have visibility of that. We've talked about that, on pods, in particular, that an increasing percentage of our pod sales are not visible through traditional syndicated data, but we have a really good handle on what goes on in e-commerce. And to your point before, we also, in many cases, are able track it down to the individual consumer who's buying this. So we have a much more targeted marketing program as a result of all of that. As far as margins and all of that go, it's great. There's not a concern here. It's more challenging, as you can imagine, to ship liquids. I think the future of e-commerce and liquids is much more in the click-and-collect mode or home-delivery mode, not shipping it through traditional FedEx and UPS. But Keurig pods are high value, lightweight, long shelf life, don't damage. It's almost an ideal item to ship through traditional e-commerce channels, and that's why it's been really attractive. So it's going to be an increasing part of growth in our business. And one of the things we'll talk about in 2021 is the launch of the first consumer -- excuse me, the first connected brewer for broad-scale consumer use. We're excited about that. We'll talk to you about that in the future. And I think that's going to accelerate more of the e-commerce attractiveness for the Keurig business going forward. Yes. Our reason for restoring marketing is because we have an objective to increase our marketing as a percentage of sales over time. And we know what happened in COVID across the board. We're really proud of the fact that despite the fact that we had to pull some of that marketing -- and some of it, it was just a bad environment to invest in advertising. And they're certainly in the early and mid parts of the year. And other parts of it was because of the great mix headwind that everybody in the industry faced.  We were proud of the fact that we did that, but we got really efficient in where and how we spend our marketing. And my best evidence of that is the market share gains across our portfolio that suggest that we were able to still balance brand growth, investments in innovation, with a more restricted marketing budget. Every opportunity that we get, we will invest in marketing and innovation. That's what we're doing in 2021. It's not a reaction to competition at all. It's an investment in the great pipeline of brand ideas that we have. And as you can tell from all of our conversation here, we are building this business for the long haul.  As I referenced before, when we looked at the fourth quarter, and we knew that we were trending very strong for 2020, we were very explicit in saying any over-delivery would be reinvested back into brand growth, and that's exactly what we achieved in Q4. So that's our ambition, is to build a very healthy brand portfolio for the long haul. With regard to pricing, I think this industry is incredibly rational in pricing. And we don't discuss what our specific outlook is for pricing in a given year, but we're -- we have our eye on inflation, as does everyone. And I think that the beverage industry has shown that it's been able to recover inflation through a combination of productivity and pricing, and I wouldn't expect that would change going forward. Yes, sure. I think -- let me start with the shelf changes. A more normal year in 2021 than 2020 when innovation was more challenging to get on the shelf. We got a good head start with Dr Pepper & Cream and also with Canada Dry Bold. And as you know, we have a long list of innovation and renovation that we launch every year, so I'm not going to mention them all.  I think 2021 is -- it looks more normal in access to the shelf. We've got a really strong lineup of innovation across the board. We talked about some of it in the prepared remarks, but we -- again, we have much more than that. And so we stand in a really good position to get that strong innovation and renovation on the shelf quickly.  And our speed to market as a company has improved every single year. And it's -- we're very proud of the distribution system that we're building, a combination of our company-owned DSD as well as our independent partners. And through a combination of strength of ideas, better joint planning with our partners and our customers, we've been able to improve our reach to shelf. And so that's going to continue. You mentioned some of the seed investments that we have in brands like Don't Quit and A Shoc. All in early stages, all very promising, too small at this stage for us to report. But I would expect that when we do our Investor Day midyear, we'll give a more comprehensive update on all of the start-up investments.  And that's just one of many tools that we employ, where we've said before that we can launch something on our own. We can partner with somebody in a joint distribution manner as we've done with things -- brands like evian. We can make seed investments as we did with Don't Quit and A Shoc, and we can acquire things outright, as we did with CORE.  Polar is off to a great start. It's a terrific brand and really our play in the sparkling water, flavored sparkling water segment. We're ramping that up right now. The ACV for Polar has already improved by about 20 ACV points nationally. So it shows the strength of our partnership with them. And obviously, you can tell by the comments here that we're very bullish on driving that brand to a national leader in the not-too-distant future.  And then the last one, BODYARMOR. It's publicly available. We have 12.5% ownership stake in BODYARMOR. If and when that business is sold, then we would receive payment just like any other investor would receive payment at that time. And we don't know anything more than what's been publicly reported to date. So I think I covered all of your territory there. Yes, I'm going to turn this over to Ozan for more specifics. Our initial focus is to make sure we deliver those synergies because there were some questions on day 1. Could we really achieve those? And obviously, we have a line of sight to do that. But we also know that, that's a -- synergies are always a short-term situation. And we made sure that we had line of sight to productivity beyond. But also we used it not just to drop to the bottom line, but to invest heavily in our business during this mode.  But Ozan, do you want to pick up from there and think -- and talk about how we think about productivity beyond synergies?"

This conference call is being recorded and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tyson Seely. Mr. Seely, please go ahead.\nTyson Seely: Thank you. And hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued our press release for the third quarter of 2020. If you need a copy, you can get one on our website at keurigdrpepper.com in the Investors section. Consistent with previous quarters, today we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis excluding items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted pro forma basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are included in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company\u2019s control, we do not reconcile our guidance.  Joining me virtually today to discuss our third quarter 2020 results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Bob. \nBob Gamgort : Thanks, Tyson. And good morning, everyone. I hope everyone participating on this call continues to be well. In the last few -- the last few months have been extremely volatile, given the COVID crisis. While consumer mobility has increased and the economy has opened up somewhat, the coming months are likely to remain unpredictable, as rates of infection in North America appear to be on the rise. As we'll discuss today, KDP continues to navigate well through the pandemic by anticipating and adjusting to trends in consumer behavior, driving brands, categories and channels with growth potential in order to offset other areas that are challenged.  As we said over the past seven months, the pandemic does not represent a short-term windfall for us. Instead, this is a day-to-day mixed management effort across both channels and products, which is enabled by the flexibility of our business model, and the outstanding executional capabilities of our team. We monitor consumer mobility trends on a near daily basis to adjust our product mix, channel focus and production planning, and continue to view this metric as a reliable leading indicator for running our business. Most of all, we continue to be thankful to our team members who have driven the results we reported today and the work our organization has done to give back to our communities when they are in need.  Ozan will take you through the specifics of our third quarter results in a few minutes. However, I will tell you that in summary, they were outstanding, nearly 6% revenue growth, 16% adjusted operating income growth and 22% adjusted diluted EPS growth, with continued deleveraging. We gained market share of total liquid refreshment beverages in over 90% of our retail base, driven by gains in the majority of category segments in which we compete, with a number of highlights worth mentioning, such as the 1.4 share point increase in CSDs, driven by growth in the great majority of our CSD brands, strength in the Snapple brand, which delivered a 1.5 share point increase in ready-to-drink tea, and nearly a 1 share point increase in juice drinks. And CORE being the fastest growing premium water brand over the quarter. Our Beverage Concentrates segment saw substantial quarter-over-quarter improvement as restaurants experienced improved traffic. In single-serve coffee we delivered 10% growth in at-home consumption driven by increases in both household penetration and an elevated attachment rate, which was partially offset during the quarter by our away-from-home coffee business, which continues to be negatively impacted by persistently low return to work trends in large offices, which is our area of strength, and the timing of some partner shipments. In the fourth quarter, we expect total pod shipments to return to their more normalized mid to high single-digit growth rates despite our expectations that weakness in the away-from-home channel will continue.  Finally, the exceptional growth in brewer sales in advance of the fourth quarter speaks to the enthusiasm retailers have for Keurig in the holiday season, which is upcoming. So with one quarter to go, our guidance for this year remains intact. Now at the high end of what we said we would accomplish in 2020, which means that we continue to meet or exceed the long-term merger targets we communicated over two years ago. Before I turn it over to Ozan, I'd like to take a few minutes to put our quarterly results and several pieces of news that we communicated this week into a longer-term strategic context, all supporting the evolution of KDP to a modern beverage company. We focused much of our past earnings call content on how we are expanding the consumer reach of our brand portfolio, which is a critical driver of long-term profitable growth. That conversation typically focuses on new brands and M&A. But it's very important to point out that the broad share growth we've experienced on existing brands, both before and during the pandemic, has been driven by increased household penetration in both our hot and cold portfolios, which we expect will stick going forward. This is the result of impactful innovation and renovation as well as strong marketing programming that's attracting new consumers into our brands.  Growth in existing brands provides the foundation upon which to add new ones. We continue to pursue opportunities to fill whitespace in our portfolio through national partnerships, such as our recent agreement with Polar and smaller bets, such as investments that we made last year in A Shoc energy drink with Lance Collins, a recently announced Don't Quit! adult nutrition protein drink with Jake Steinfeld and a recent investment in Revive, a kombucha drink with Peet's Coffee.  With regard to the Keurig brand, we consistently expanded household penetration year-in and out. And 2020 is turning out to be an especially strong year for system adoption. Rather than growing household penetration by 2 million households, which is consistent with our recent run rates, we now expect to add approximately 3 million new households in 2020. While attachment rates may move up and down and potentially back up again during another wave of the pandemic, converting new households into the Keurig system represents a long-term annuity stream that endures well into the future. While portfolio expansion has taken center stage since the merger, we've also been building our unique and valuable distribution platforms, although we haven't discussed them until recently. On our last earnings call, we quantified how important e-commerce has become for us, representing more than 10% of total KDP sales and a larger portion of coffee sales. Yesterday, we announced news regarding our Direct Store Delivery system that is worth placing into a broader strategic context. Since our merger, we have invested in people, technology and assets to improve the effectiveness of our DSD network. We've also focused on consolidating key independent distributor systems into our company-owned DSD operations, where territories overlap in order to drive scale and efficiency. Yesterday we jointly announced with The Honickman Companies an agreement that provides KDP with long-term sales and distribution for key brands, including Canada Dry, Sunkist, 7UP and A&W across 18 counties in New York and New Jersey, reaching 17 million consumers. This follows a string of DSD territory moves and acquisitions across the country over the past two years, including California, New York, and the Midwest. To be clear, our objective is not to control every market with our trucks, but rather to ensure that each market in which we sell our brands has a competitive route to market, regardless of who owns the territory. For example, in late 2019, we partnered with Honickman to facilitate their acquisition of a subscale independent distributor in Virginia. In Alabama, we agreed with our partner Buffalo Rock, to allow our brands to ride on the same truck with competitive brands in order to improve frequency and drop size across their system. Whether we operate our trucks in the market, or we partner with a local player of scale, every one of these moves ensures better reach, in stocks, and merchandising for our brand portfolio, which builds our platform for long-term growth. Our strong in-market performance this year demonstrates the value of these system improvements and we believe we have significant opportunity remaining. Important to a modern beverage company is a strong sustainability culture, and continuously pushing forward to meet new and more aspirational goals. Earlier this week, we announced that we have begun the transition of our Snapple and CORE bottles to 100% recycled PET or rPET as is commonly called. We will continue to expand rPET across our portfolio going forward. Finally, consistent with our goal to build KDP for the long-term, we also announced changes earlier this week to our senior leadership team designed to further improve speed to market and place decision-making closer to our consumers and our customers. 2.5 years into our merger and with the benefit of learning what has worked so well during the pandemic, this is a decision made from strength. And we're fortunate to have the talent on our leadership team to assume broader operating roles with increased levels of responsibility. Let me now hand it over to Ozan for more details on the quarter.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on an adjusted basis, I will briefly review our performance for the third quarter, which our press release discusses in significant detail. The third quarter was another good one for us.  As Bob discussed, we believe that this strikes the right balance of continuing to invest in areas such as innovation, technology and sustainability that provides competitive advantage, while continuing to deliver our financial commitments.  Constant currency net sales increased 5.8% with growth in three of our four segments, led by Packaged Beverages and Coffee Systems, combined with sequential improvement in Beverage Concentrates.  On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 16.3% in the quarter, driven by strong revenue growth, productivity, and merger synergies, as well as a reduction in discretionary overhead expenses, including marketing. These drivers were partially offset by higher operating costs associated with increased consumer demand for our products and inflation in logistics.  In the third quarter, pre-tax operating expenses directly related to COVID-19 totaled $49 million, and consistent with previous quarters, were recognized as items affecting comparability. These expenses consisted of temporary and unusual compensation increases and incentives for frontline employees, as well as incremental safety and sanitation expenses across our business.  Adjusted diluted EPS advanced 22% in the quarter, fueled by the growth in adjusted operating income, lower interest expense as a result of continuously leveraging and the lower effective tax rate. Turning to our segment performance for the quarter. In Coffee Systems, constant currency net sales growth of 3.2% was driven by strong volume mix growth of 6% partially offset by lower net pricing of 2.8%. The volume mix performance reflected a 34% increase in brewer shipments, incremental net sales from McCaf\u00e9 and higher shipments of K-Cup pods for at-home consumption. Significantly offsetting these growth drivers were the continued drop off in the office coffee and hospitality businesses. While the segment\u2019s operating margin declined slightly in the quarter due to primarily to mix, which includes the stronger brewer performance, constant currency adjusted operating income increased 1.6% to $373 million. As mentioned on our second quarter call, we are excited about the upcoming launch of our first Connected Brewer. Demand for Keurig brewers remains extremely strong heading into the holiday season, in part driven by our new K-Supreme platform. We have decided to wait until 2021 to launch the new Connected Brewer to enable us to focus our marketing efforts in the balance of the year behind K-Supreme and our existing brewer line, given the unprecedented demand we are experiencing. In Packaged Beverages, constant currency net sales grew 10.7% due to strong volume mix growth of 11.4%, partially offset by slightly lower net pricing of 0.7%. This performance reflected strong growth in both our company-owned DSD and warehouse direct businesses. In the quarter, we grew both our carbonated and non-carbonated brand portfolios due to increased at-home consumption and continued market share growth, resulting from strong in-market execution. This growth was partially offset by a decline in the convenience and gas channels. But the decline moderated as compared to the second quarter of this year as consumer mobility improved. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 51.2% in the quarter to $304 million, primarily reflecting the sales growth and discretionary spending reductions. As Bob mentioned earlier, we are thrilled with the agreement announced yesterday with Honickman, which will drive significant value creation for KDP over time. Long-term sales and distribution access for our key brands that we are gaining through this transaction is being done through a unique asset-light structure. Specifically, Honickman is selling these rights to a third-party funded by Prudential Capital and KDP entered into a simultaneous transaction with the third-party to gain long-term access to the rights. There were various ways that we could have structured this deal, including a straight-up acquisition. Instead, we chose to use a third-party and pay a small annual fee given that we already have a sales and distribution presence in the area and didn't need any of other assets from the transaction. The arrangement provides us with control of our brands for which we can maximize the economics and it also provides the scale to our existing brands currently being distributed in the area through our company-owned DSD network and dedicated independent operators. In Beverage Concentrates, we experienced a meaningful sequential quarterly improvement. Specifically, constant currency net sales versus year ago declined a modest 2.2% versus the double-digit decline during the height of the shelter-in-place directives in quarter two. This modest decline in quarter three was due to lower volume mix of 4.8% partially offset by higher net price realization of 2.6%. This sequential improvement reflected a moderating decline in the fountain foodservice business as consumer mobility increased and restaurant traffic picked up. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 8.6% in the quarter to $265 million, primarily reflecting lower discretionary spending.  And finally, in Latin America Beverages, constant currency net sales grew 0.7% reflecting strong pricing of 5.2% partially offset by lower volume mix of 4.5% due to limited consumer mobility in Mexico. Operating income was flat to the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, operating income increased 12% to $25 million in the quarter, due to the strong net sales growth, as well as continued productivity and lower marketing expense. The drivers were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency transaction expense.  While the current environment has proven the power of our brands, it has also made evident the importance of simplification. To meet heightened demand and drive efficiency, we have continued to focus our production and delivery on the highest priority brands and products with great success. Through this process, we have performed a detailed review of the offerings in our system to ensure we deliver on our customers' needs, while also ensuring we are efficient. This will continue to be a focus of ours going forward. In terms of our ongoing productivity and merger synergies, we continue to focus and execute on these opportunities. We remain committed to delivering our value capture commitments through both productivity and merger synergies, and fully expect to deliver our current merger synergies of $600 million by the end of 2021. Now moving to cash flow and liquidity. Free cash flow in the quarter was again strong at $525 million, and our year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate was approximately 105%. In the quarter, we reduced bank debt by $225 million and structured payables by $21 million. And we ended the quarter with over $190 million of unrestricted cash on hand. In terms of leverage, our bank debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which we refer to as our management leverage ratio, improved to 3.8 times compared to 4.8 times at the end of the third quarter of 2019. This improvement was driven by continued reductions in outstanding debt balances, and continued growth in adjusted EBITDA. Since the merger close, we have reduced our leverage ratio by over 2 full terms. Turning now to CapEx. We continue to support the business with necessary CapEx investment to drive future growth and efficiency. As we discussed last quarter, our new Spartanburg pod production facility has been delayed approximately 6 months resulting from equipment supplier delays, and our new cold beverages production facility in Allentown is also delayed about three months for similar reasons. We have always expected most of these facilities to primarily be contributors to our business in 2021. And our expectations regarding these minor delays have not changed.  Which brings us to our guidance. We continue to have confidence in our ability to manage through what is likely to be a bumpy road in the balance of the year, much as we have done to-date. Our outlook for the full year adjusted diluted EPS growth remains unchanged at 13% to 15%. With delivery likely at the high end of this range, this outlook reflects our expectation for: constant currency net sales growth at the high end of the range of 3% to 4%; continued strong management of discretionary costs across the business, while maintaining investments in innovation, technology and sustainability; expected higher marketing investment in the fourth quarter of the year, relative to the third quarter, given the expectation for an environment in which consumer receptivity to marketing and marketing return on investment continues to improve.  It is important to note that we plan to reinvest any order delivery we may generate in the fourth quarter into incremental brand investment to further drive top-line growth, while still delivering our adjusted EPS guidance for 2020. We also have confidence in our deleveraging targets. And now we expect our management leverage ratio to be in the middle of our 3.5 times to 3.8 times range at the end of the year. With that, let me now turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. \nBonnie Herzog: My question this morning is, I guess I wanted to drill down a little bit more on your brewer shipment volumes, which were obviously much better than anyone would have expected in the quarter. So I was trying to understand, how much of that will be reversed next quarter, and essentially, how much of your brewer volumes in Q3 really reflected a pull forward in demand from Q4? Bob, maybe you could touch on this. But for instance, are you already seeing a step down in brewer orders during October versus the year ago period? And then in terms of innovation, you did call out that you're now shifting some of this to next year. But I just really wanted to verify that there are no plans for any more brewer innovation in 2020. Thank you. \nBob Gamgort: Good morning, Bonnie. First is on brewer shipments. As we've talked about over the past couple of years, brewer shipments especially quarter-to-quarter are a great measurement of what's going on with household penetration. What I would suggest is that every third quarter has shipments built into it that are for the holiday season. And what you're seeing is a little bit of a pull forward this year meaning some of those holiday shipments that would have gone in October, November are going into the third quarter because of the pandemic retailers are trying to get ahead of everything. The most important thing to take away from that is the confidence that retailers have in Keurig for holiday gifting, in part driven by the innovation and the strong marketing support that we have in place and the feedback that we're getting on all of the brewers that we've introduced in the past year or so but especially the K-Supreme and the K-Supreme Plus which is really the featured item for this holiday has been leaning forward and really in a position to push Keurig for the holidays.  The single most important metric we gave you on this call, though, is our outlook on household penetration. Because as we've said before, shipments can be up and down in a quarter, they're somewhat useful to look over a longer period of time. But the most important metric we talked about today was the fact that we believe that instead of our typical run rate of 2 million households being added into the Keurig system in the year, we expect that now to be 3 million. And as we said before, attachment rates move up and down, shipments move from quarter-to-quarter. It's kind of interesting during the quarter, but it really doesn't mean much over the long haul. But an additional 1 million households is something that stays in the system for a very long time.  The question about the balance of the quarter, and what we're seeing here, I think we're in a position where we've now given visibility on household penetration. We gave you an indication of how we see pod volume growth delivering in the fourth quarter, which shows that, that is now smoothing out. And we've also been really clear that our guidance is at the high end or our latest estimates are at the high end of our guidance for the year and that we're going to reinvest everything else back into marketing and innovation.  And so, there's no new innovation being launched in the fourth quarter, because we have a huge line-up on our cold side as well as our hot side that we're now implementing in the fourth quarter. But the investments that we can make to get a head start on 2021 are just -- I would think are the right thing to do to ensure that we get off to a good start next year as well. And remember, we've committed to a three year target of total shareholder return that goes all the way back to 2018 and ends in 2021. And so, as we're confident in finishing our 2020 strong, we are shifting our sights to 2021 to make sure that's a good year as well. So, thanks for those questions. \nOperator: Thank you. And you next question will come from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is open. \nKevin Grundy : So I was hoping we could drill down a little bit on margins, remarkably good for Beverage Concentrate and Packaged Beverages, both multi-year highs. Of course I understand that synergies contributed there. Can you talk about marketing levels in the quarter, how that stood year-over-year, and the other key drivers that drove the strong margin performance? And then longer term you kind of touched on this a little bit, but the company has done a fantastic job in terms of synergy realization, which you'll complete by the end of next year. Maybe talk a little bit about productivity longer term. And if that's something you will kind of formalize and put out a new program at the appropriate time for The Street? So, thanks for that. \nOzan Dokmecioglu: Good morning, Kevin. First of all, let me touch to two margin lines that we have. One is the gross margin. As we have just spoken on the call, there was a small 120 bps of decline in our gross margin, while at the same time our OI margin has expanded 260 bps. So, on the gross margin, while the third quarter was strong as we spoke, it's 5.8% constant currency net sales growth and 22% EPS growth. It was by no means a windfall for us. It required extraordinary effort to deliver these results in the midst of the crisis. So the gross margin, small decline is a challenge due to a long and complex list of puts and takes. But clearly, unfavorable mix was one of them, or the bigger picks, which included the brewers, given that brewers don\u2019t make much money, yet the volume was extraordinarily high. So we also had a little bit higher operating costs with the increased consumer -- in order to meet the increased consumer demand and some inflation that we have experienced in our logistics expenses. Yet, we also delivered a substantial reduction in our overhead base that includes overall sales, marketing and general administrative overheads via a series of the base productivity programs and merger synergies that came in a very substantial manner that helped us to reduce our overall cost structure. In that SG&A number, we also include and categorize our advertisement and promotion investments. So whenever the return on investment in advertisement and promotion didn't make sense, we also reduced that spend due to the COVID-19 environment. So you see it's a combination of the factors and the things and mostly on the positive side that helped us to drive and further expand our OI margin by 260 basis points, which is quite substantial. So on the productivities, as we just spoke as well, we affirmed our merger synergy target of $600 million to be delivered by end of 2021, and we are exactly on that trajectory. We also have our base productivity programs that we have been running and executing very successfully. So the productivity programs and our laser focus and strong delivery has not changed, and we are seeing quite benefits of improving our margins as well as profitability in the third quarter as well. And as we spoke previously, our base productivity programs and the merger synergies will continue into 2021. We have several programs still focusing on our manufacturing footprint, our logistics footprint and including further improvement in our overall cost reductions. And we have several facilities that we have been building, for example, the Spartanburg, the state-of-the-art K-Cup pod facility in South Carolina that will be operational mostly in 2021, and it will give us continued productivity as well as the volume in coffee. And we are building the Packaged Beverage plants in Allentown that will contribute to our productivity programs, including at the end of the year, the facility, the Beverage Concentrate facility that we have been building in Ireland. Therefore, we are very pleased with all of our either base productivity or the merger synergy programs that have been working very nicely.\nBob Gamgort: Kevin, just to add to that, I mean, you could tell from Ozan's answer here that we are very focused on making sure that we run a highly efficient business, and we have a lot of programming going on for that. In terms of your question about beyond 2021, our focus has been, first of all, navigating through this crisis, which continues. I don't ever want to talk about it as if it's over because it's far from that; delivering 2020, setting ourselves up for 2021. At the right time in 2021, we will have a conversation with you guys about what does the post-2021 world look like for KDP and part of that will clearly be strong productivity and efficiency program, which will take you through at that time.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nNik Modi : Just 2 quick questions, if I could. Just on the -- Ozan, maybe on the COVID-related costs. I'm just starting to think -- and of course, I'm not asking for 2021 guidance or anything, but just wanted to understand how much -- what you've spent this year -- what you expect to spend this year, do you think will be permanent? That's kind of the first question. And the second question, I guess for you, Bob, is it's becoming increasing clear at least in this environment, and I suspect even as we move forward that the purchase decision is going to increasingly migrate away from the traditional kind of brick-and-mortar and into the home, right, whether it be e-commerce or people bringing more stuff at home because they're staying at home longer. I mean that was certainly a trend we've even seen before COVID start. So you at KDP have created a very advantaged business model with your go-to-market portfolio. And so I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking of building on that competitive advantage as you -- as we move forward and what I would characterize as a more stay-at-home environment?\nBob Gamgort : Sure. Ozan, you want to kick this off?\nOzan Dokmecioglu : Yes. Yes, I will. Good morning, Nik, and thanks for the question. First of all, let me give a little bit further context with regards to the COVID-19 expenses that we have been adding back. In fact, we have been consistent in Q1, quarter 2 as well as quarter 3. So the costs we excluded from adjusted results are unique and temporary impacts resulting from the crisis. So they are not normal ongoing cost of business. This is consistent with our long-term -- longstanding treatment of the extraordinary and one-time costs here. And these costs are clearly and not only defined as the significant expenses to provide temporary financial incentives through our frontline employees, which represented more than 80% of the costs that we have been adding back. And the balance for the extraordinary measures we undertook to protect employee health and safety, including enhanced benefits for them and their families. So as you have noted, our run rate in Q3 was lower than Q2, and we do expect our quarter 4 run rate to be substantially lower than quarter 3 as well. Therefore, by nature of this, Nik, we never said these are sustained costs or increased cost base in our profit and loss statement, it's the contrary. And I think our quarterly trend is proving. And again, in Q4, we expect to see a substantially lower number.\nBob Gamgort : Nik, with regard to your point about at-home and how we're thinking about our portfolio and our go-to-market strategy on here, I mean, we\u2019ve referenced mobility data, and it's something that we look at very carefully, and we can get it down to a very granular level. But at the highest level, we think about people spending time at home, people spending time at work and then other. And other is a whole host of recreation activities, et cetera, and we can get more details on that. We have really built a portfolio that has the optionality to drive that at-home business. It's not like we are 100% at-home business, far from it. You see the negative impacts on our fountain foodservice business, you see the negative impacts on our away-from-home business. So we keep saying it's not like this was a windfall for us, but we do have the options to pivot towards that changing consumer behavior. And if it shifts, to pivot back. And I would point out, before I get on to coffee, which is an obvious answer. Even on our cold portfolio, we have made significant shifts in where we focus our selling efforts and what we're selling. And what you're seeing more is large outlets, planned purchase and stock ups are continuing to grow. Impulse, while improving sequentially is still down versus where it was before. And we focus a lot of our effort on the cold side of our portfolio on multi-pack, take-home packs, larger pack sizes, for example. And some of the growth that you're seeing in and outside of our CSD business is because we've been able to shift over the past couple of months from businesses that were more heavily focused on single bottles into multi-packs, and it's helping drive growth in our business.  I mean, obviously, when I shift over to the coffee side, the Keurig system was designed for at-home consumption. And we said year in and year out that don't worry about attachment rate, all we're focused on is household penetration. While we're seeing improvement in attachment rate as people spend more time at home, but more importantly, we're seeing an acceleration in household penetration. As I said a couple of times, it's really a lasting benefit. And as people think about their homes differently, both living at home as well as working from home, they're upgrading across the board, and we're seeing a combination of new people coming into our system at a higher rate. And we're also seeing upgrades in brewers of existing consumers, and that may not drive growth in the short-term, but it's a reconfirmation or a recommitment that they're in the system for the long-term. The away-from-home business, which is offices, has been a negative, and I want to offer 2 points of perspective. If you look at traffic in large offices, it's down 60%. So we've never quantified the size of our away-from-home business. But even if it was very small, a negative 60% trend on even a modest business has a major impact on us. Here's the good news. That really can only impact us now through, call it, February, and then it becomes actually a tailwind instead of a headwind. So the risk of that, which I know some people are focused on, is pretty well capped, and we've already given you some visibility in the fourth quarter anyway. And that really sets us up for strong at-home. And then the last point I would make on your overall conclusion, which is 100% right about where consumers are going is, our investment in e-com and our capabilities in e-com are paying off really well. When we launched this new company in 2018, and we talked about e-com and the legacy Keurig business and how we can apply it across the portfolio, I think most people were skeptical at best about what would e-com and beverage look like. Nobody is skeptical about it anymore, and it's an area that we're really focused. And if you saw the management changes that we made this week, embedded in that at a level below that, is also an increased focus and commitment to e-com because we think that's really the future.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Peter Grom from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPeter Grom : I think there's kind of been a view in the investment community that this step up in households was going to quickly drive an acceleration in organic revenue growth. And when I look at the year-to-date performance in coffee, it's pretty similar to last year, and there seems to be kind of a disconnect between that and the penetration you mentioned. And I know you just mentioned that a lot of this is being -- is a result of away-from-home business and then you will cycle that in February. So is that kind of the right timeframe where we should think about this higher penetration driving stronger organic revenue growth in coffee? And then how does the step up in households frame your view of what the business can grow longer term?\nBob Gamgort : Yes. I think the longer-term view is always the best way to view this business. We talked about the year in and year out household penetration increases the system has seen, and there's been a lot of debate and a lot of analysis quarter-by-quarter. And sometimes when you look at the IRi data month-by-month, and it doesn't serve anybody really well. But when you step back and look at it, you see this nice, steady increase. And one of the comments that we made on an investor conference that we attended fairly recently was, we do expect household penetration to accelerate, and that's why we quantified that for you today to give you some perspective. But you have to always remember that we're operating off of an installed base of already 30 million households in the U.S. and 3 million households in Canada. So even an additional 1 million households, which is significant growth and profit generator for the long-term, you're putting them on top of an installed base of 30 million. And so it's such a solid business right now that it's not one that can be moved up or down quickly by any type of action, but it just speaks to the longer term potential. When we launched the business or the combined company in 2018, we put some information on our Investor Day that is 100% relevant today as it was then, and that is, we believe that household penetration for the Keurig system would go north of 50% over time. At the rate that we're growing, that's 10 years out before we even have a conversation of what happens beyond 50%. So you're looking at 10 years of solid growth. And all that this proves is that, as people think about spending time at home, they just step up their interest in the Keurig system, increased household penetration. And the dividends or the growth that you get of that plays out over the next couple of years, it's not an instant boost that you see. And then my last point is, you can look at the IRi data and see that we have been growing at-home consumption by north of 10% over the past 6 months or so. And on the latest period, it was plus 10%. And that tells you what's going on in-home. So if you look at that number and then you compare it to what you're seeing on some of the shipment numbers as we've been totally transparent, that is 100% driven by an away-from-home business, which is primarily large offices, where we're seeing, traffic attendance might be the better word in large offices, down [16%]. So again, that's been a significant drain on us, but there's a limit to that. Because as soon as we start hitting the month of March and we go into April, that becomes all opportunity and not risk, and it's really that simple to explain the disconnect between what you're seeing at-home versus what you're seeing in total.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Peter Galbo. Your line is open.\nPeter Galbo : Just 2 quick kind of clarifying questions on Beverage Concentrate. It looks like, just given the shipment volume versus bottler case volume you guys reported, it's been running -- the shipment volume has been running 250 basis points to 350 basis points below kind of the bottler case volume and then understanding that there's obviously a foodservice component there. But just over time, how should we think about the cadence of that kind of correcting maybe into fiscal '21? And then just the second part, for Beverage Concentrate, has your guidance taken into account some of the renewed lockdowns in some major U.S. cities that have come out in the past couple of days?\nBob Gamgort : Yes. Peter, your comment is right about the disconnect sometimes and the timing of it, and it's really hard to forecast when they get aligned. But your statement that over time they align is 100% correct. And so that's some of the nuances we get quarter-to-quarter on Beverage Concentrates, but we don't spend a lot of energy on that because we know, over time, they align, and it's just difficult to try to predict that. The biggest takeaway from the Beverage Concentrates segment is the fact that we've seen sequential improvement in restaurants. And I would point out that when you look at the KDP businesses in fountain and foodservice, that's our business that we talked about that services restaurants and hospitality, it is heavily concentrated towards quick-serve restaurants. As we've talked about a number of times, Dr Pepper brand is the most available brand in quick-serve restaurants, and they have done a really good job of navigating towards drive-through and take out. And so even if there is a resurgence and as we look at what may happen in the next couple of months, we're really confident that, that segment, in particular, will not only hang in there, but may actually do better -- although that's not in our forecast, but it may actually do better as traditional sit down restaurants could become more challenged and people shift even more towards takeaway and drive-through. And so that's the way that we're thinking about it going forward, but we were encouraged to see the -- at least a sequential rebound in that business, and we're watching and partnering with those restaurant partners to try to help them grow their business, and they're doing an excellent job of navigating to the new world.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Lauren Lieberman. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman : I want to talk a little bit about Packaged Beverages and the share gains that you've seen. I know in the script you talked about conviction in some of these household penetration gains, in particular, for these brands sticking. But I was also curious about the degree to which some of the performance has benefited from some of your competitors narrowing SKU counts. While in crisis mode, particularly in flavors, flavors aren't really core to the other players. So I was just wondering to what degree you think that and kind of can shortages may be benefiting you guys? And then what you're doing beyond the innovation to try to hold on to those gains when the situation does ultimately normalize?\nBob Gamgort : Sure. Yes. Thanks for your question, Lauren. Good morning. I think there are a number of factors that are driving our performance, and we've dug into that and we\u2019ve pulled it apart to make sure that we understand that we can continue to drive those things that are working. It is primarily driven by a combination of marketing, strength, innovation, which on -- across our portfolio, not just on our CSD brands with Dr Pepper and Cream and Canada Dry Bold, but we've introduced new buy items and a whole host of item across the board in Snapple, for example. They're playing out really well. And as I talked about on an earlier -- one of the earlier questions, we've also shifted our brands into the right pack sizes and formats and into the right channels. And that's not underperformance by anyone else, that's just us moving quickly towards the consumer, and I have every confidence that if the consumer were to shift again, we'd get ahead of it and we'd move back over there. So the household penetration gains that we're seeing, the great majority of it are driven by marketing innovation and good execution on our part, and it's not really driven by the thoughts about can shortages or executional missteps by anyone else. And so therefore, it's driving household penetration, which we believe will stick. The other subtle point that I would point out is, a number of our brands, the Dr Pepper brand, in particular, but other brands as well, a good portion of those are actually distributed -- manufactured and distributed by other independent companies and some of our peers. I know that gets confusing when we talk about it, but those who really dig into the business understand that. And just as we're gaining from good execution on our end, we actually get hurt by performance on the other end when there are can shortages or difficulty getting the product out there.  And so as strong as our results are, there are actually positives from our system being offset in some cases by negatives in other systems. And so it's not all windfalls, I keep saying, this is -- the results you're seeing are the net of positives and negatives, and we've been able to move through it really quickly, but it's not all positive that then become a headwind as you think about next year.\nLauren Lieberman: Right. So Bob, I feel like I do understand the distribution network.\nBob Gamgort : No, I know you do. I'm talking about the broader audience.\nLauren Lieberman : Okay. And so I just actually had thought that, contractually, there might be some element of Dr Pepper needing to be brand, needing to be prioritized when it's -- when the distribution and manufacturing is through large companies, not independent, so that was sort of what you're referring to. But separately, I'm also curious, the -- it was great in the script when you guys shared detail on a lot of the optimization work that you've -- that's been underway for some time, right? This doesn't just start with The Honickman or the Buffalo Rock announcements. To what degree is that already starting to show up and that we're seeing it in terms of operating leverage? I know there's so many moving parts right now because of COVID. But yes, I was just wondering how immediate those benefits can be in terms of the better scale on your distribution assets?\nBob Gamgort : Yes. Let me go back -- before I answer, I want to go back to your point, though, about the contractual pieces or whatever. If you look at social media and you look at some of the new stories that were popping up about shortages of some of our brands, that's all you need to know is what's actually happening out in the marketplace. And that's not coming from -- if you take a look at where that's coming from, it speaks to the broader challenge in the industry that has been well documented. So my point again is this is not a -- we're not -- there's no complaints. We never brought it up as an excuse. But if you really think about now flipping it to next year, I don't want anyone to take away from this is, we got all positives next year that will become negative this year, that will become negative next year. It's a mix. There are some things that will be more challenging to lap in 2021, but I have a long list of things that are negative this year that flip to the positive as well. And so it's really important to understand this is a balance between the two. And it's -- we're not just -- this isn't a weather report, we actually control the outcome in many cases. And so a lot of the positives are driven by the fact that we got ahead of things quickly, and we were able to pivot our business to do so. And it's a flexible business model, we can pivot again next year. To your point about the distribution pieces, as we talked about in the script, this partnership with Honickman that we talked about today is by far the single biggest move that we've made in this optimization. But we also talked about, there has been a string of smaller but very important moves that we've been putting in place over the past 2 years. And so you're starting to see some of that effect in the strong performance in the marketplace in 2020, but big moves like the one that we just talked about today as well as other partnerships with our independent distributors like the Polar deal, those are mainly 2021 and beyond. And I would suggest that the investments that we're making in our distribution infrastructure is part of the conversation we'll have about what does KDP look like beyond 2021. And you can see, clearly, we believe distribution is a critical asset with a lot of upside.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Bill Chappell. Your line is open.\nBill Chappell : Bob, just help us understand the -- I guess -- or just respond to the thought of on the brewer side, the thought that anybody who ever thought about getting a brewer now owns 1 because they've been working from home or staying from home and if they've even considered it, they\u2019ve bought it. And so while it's great that you've had a jump from, of a normal 2 million to 3 million households, that's a big pull forward and it's going to be much less in future years and more -- less and less people. So help us understand how you grow household penetration after such a big jump this year and why that wouldn't be the case?\nBob Gamgort : Sure. Bill, good morning. And good to hear from you this morning. I'm smiling, you can't see that in-person because we remember when we took KGM private. We actually had some dinners and some meetings at that time with previous KGM investors and analysts and just to talk about the business and what we were thinking about doing over time because we knew at some point, we would be public again. And household penetration at that point was round numbers, 15%. And that was the exact same question, we got a 15% household penetration, and people were using the words like saturation. And we talked at that time about we have every indication the household penetration over time will be north of 50%. There is no sign of slowing down or saturation. And we talked about what were the barriers to entry. So if we really believe the number is that big, why isn't it happening now and doesn't everybody know about Keurig already, and our answer to that point was we still have a lot of work to do in terms of marketing, innovation, price points, features, improving sustainability. It's a long list of things that we have benefit of working on every single day. And then sometimes, it just takes time. And the number one reason why somebody moves to a Keurig machine is when they replace their coffee maker that breaks, and that just takes time. And so I understand the concept. We get this all the time, but we got that question, millions and millions of households to go, and I expect we'll continue to get that question going forward. But again, every indication is that we'll be north of 50% if we keep going on our game. That's 10 years out of strong growth, and I think that this latest quarter is just yet one more quarter on top of many that preceded it, that showed that that's the right way to think about our business.\nBill Chappell: Okay. So you don't worry about, I guess, a meaningful in-line household penetration increase next year?\nBob Gamgort : I think it's the same trend going on year after year. I mean if we -- we'll look at it in absolute numbers and how may that compare to 2020, I don't know yet because I don't know what the world is going to look like in 2021, but the best way to look at this business is over time. And every time you lengthen the time period from a quarter to 6 months to a year beyond that, the business makes total sense, and it does exactly what we just described. There are some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and month-to-month. But as we look at 2021, solid innovation, lots of interest in the business, great marketing plans still in front of us, we're not worried about lapping 2020. We just think this is all part of the long-term growth in the system.\nBill Chappell : Got it. And then on the pod side, 1 quick question. What's the current promotional environment, both from you and kind of the competitors? And kind of what are you expecting? And I would think with such strong demand, people could kind of dial back some of the price cuts or discounting and couponing, but I didn't know if you're seeing that or expect to see that?\nBob Gamgort : Yes, you see it in the IRi numbers where you see the average price going up, and that's been a combination of some reduction in promotion as well as a shift interestingly, a shift towards more premium brands and we talked about before I think as people move from coffee out of the home and in home they take their favorite coffee shop brands with them, which tend to be priced higher. Hard to say what it's going to be in the fourth quarter. It really depends on what the consumer dynamics are and behaviors are. But I would expect, over time, promotional levels will return more towards normal. That's not something that we have -- we don't have lack of promotion baked into any of our plans. But in the short-term, if there's strong demand and there's some supply or stock issues at retail, if there's another stay-at-home type behavior, I think they\u2019ll pull back on promotions across the board. That's potential to happen.\nOperator: This brings us to the end of our Q&A session today. I'll turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nTyson Seely : Thank you, and thank you, everyone. This is Tyson. Thanks for dialing in today. I know it's a very busy day for many of you. The IR team is around, so please feel free to reach out to myself or Steve for any follow-ups. Thanks, everyone. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ozan Dokmecioglu",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on an adjusted basis, I will briefly review our performance for the third quarter, which our press release discusses in significant detail. The third quarter was another good one for us.  As Bob discussed, we believe that this strikes the right balance of continuing to invest in areas such as innovation, technology and sustainability that provides competitive advantage, while continuing to deliver our financial commitments.  Constant currency net sales increased 5.8% with growth in three of our four segments, led by Packaged Beverages and Coffee Systems, combined with sequential improvement in Beverage Concentrates.  On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 16.3% in the quarter, driven by strong revenue growth, productivity, and merger synergies, as well as a reduction in discretionary overhead expenses, including marketing. These drivers were partially offset by higher operating costs associated with increased consumer demand for our products and inflation in logistics.  In the third quarter, pre-tax operating expenses directly related to COVID-19 totaled $49 million, and consistent with previous quarters, were recognized as items affecting comparability. These expenses consisted of temporary and unusual compensation increases and incentives for frontline employees, as well as incremental safety and sanitation expenses across our business.  Adjusted diluted EPS advanced 22% in the quarter, fueled by the growth in adjusted operating income, lower interest expense as a result of continuously leveraging and the lower effective tax rate. Turning to our segment performance for the quarter. In Coffee Systems, constant currency net sales growth of 3.2% was driven by strong volume mix growth of 6% partially offset by lower net pricing of 2.8%. The volume mix performance reflected a 34% increase in brewer shipments, incremental net sales from McCafe\u0301 and higher shipments of K-Cup pods for at-home consumption. Significantly offsetting these growth drivers were the continued drop off in the office coffee and hospitality businesses. While the segment's operating margin declined slightly in the quarter due to primarily to mix, which includes the stronger brewer performance, constant currency adjusted operating income increased 1.6% to $373 million. As mentioned on our second quarter call, we are excited about the upcoming launch of our first Connected Brewer. Demand for Keurig brewers remains extremely strong heading into the holiday season, in part driven by our new K-Supreme platform. We have decided to wait until 2021 to launch the new Connected Brewer to enable us to focus our marketing efforts in the balance of the year behind K-Supreme and our existing brewer line, given the unprecedented demand we are experiencing. In Packaged Beverages, constant currency net sales grew 10.7% due to strong volume mix growth of 11.4%, partially offset by slightly lower net pricing of 0.7%. This performance reflected strong growth in both our company-owned DSD and warehouse direct businesses. In the quarter, we grew both our carbonated and non-carbonated brand portfolios due to increased at-home consumption and continued market share growth, resulting from strong in-market execution. This growth was partially offset by a decline in the convenience and gas channels. But the decline moderated as compared to the second quarter of this year as consumer mobility improved. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 51.2% in the quarter to $304 million, primarily reflecting the sales growth and discretionary spending reductions. As Bob mentioned earlier, we are thrilled with the agreement announced yesterday with Honickman, which will drive significant value creation for KDP over time. Long-term sales and distribution access for our key brands that we are gaining through this transaction is being done through a unique asset-light structure. Specifically, Honickman is selling these rights to a third-party funded by Prudential Capital and KDP entered into a simultaneous transaction with the third-party to gain long-term access to the rights. There were various ways that we could have structured this deal, including a straight-up acquisition. Instead, we chose to use a third-party and pay a small annual fee given that we already have a sales and distribution presence in the area and didn't need any of other assets from the transaction. The arrangement provides us with control of our brands for which we can maximize the economics and it also provides the scale to our existing brands currently being distributed in the area through our company-owned DSD network and dedicated independent operators. In Beverage Concentrates, we experienced a meaningful sequential quarterly improvement. Specifically, constant currency net sales versus year ago declined a modest 2.2% versus the double-digit decline during the height of the shelter-in-place directives in quarter two. This modest decline in quarter three was due to lower volume mix of 4.8% partially offset by higher net price realization of 2.6%. This sequential improvement reflected a moderating decline in the fountain foodservice business as consumer mobility increased and restaurant traffic picked up. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 8.6% in the quarter to $265 million, primarily reflecting lower discretionary spending.  And finally, in Latin America Beverages, constant currency net sales grew 0.7% reflecting strong pricing of 5.2% partially offset by lower volume mix of 4.5% due to limited consumer mobility in Mexico. Operating income was flat to the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, operating income increased 12% to $25 million in the quarter, due to the strong net sales growth, as well as continued productivity and lower marketing expense. The drivers were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency transaction expense.  While the current environment has proven the power of our brands, it has also made evident the importance of simplification. To meet heightened demand and drive efficiency, we have continued to focus our production and delivery on the highest priority brands and products with great success. Through this process, we have performed a detailed review of the offerings in our system to ensure we deliver on our customers' needs, while also ensuring we are efficient. This will continue to be a focus of ours going forward. In terms of our ongoing productivity and merger synergies, we continue to focus and execute on these opportunities. We remain committed to delivering our value capture commitments through both productivity and merger synergies, and fully expect to deliver our current merger synergies of $600 million by the end of 2021. Now moving to cash flow and liquidity. Free cash flow in the quarter was again strong at $525 million, and our year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate was approximately 105%. In the quarter, we reduced bank debt by $225 million and structured payables by $21 million. And we ended the quarter with over $190 million of unrestricted cash on hand. In terms of leverage, our bank debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which we refer to as our management leverage ratio, improved to 3.8 times compared to 4.8 times at the end of the third quarter of 2019. This improvement was driven by continued reductions in outstanding debt balances, and continued growth in adjusted EBITDA. Since the merger close, we have reduced our leverage ratio by over 2 full terms. Turning now to CapEx. We continue to support the business with necessary CapEx investment to drive future growth and efficiency. As we discussed last quarter, our new Spartanburg pod production facility has been delayed approximately 6 months resulting from equipment supplier delays, and our new cold beverages production facility in Allentown is also delayed about three months for similar reasons. We have always expected most of these facilities to primarily be contributors to our business in 2021. And our expectations regarding these minor delays have not changed.  Which brings us to our guidance. We continue to have confidence in our ability to manage through what is likely to be a bumpy road in the balance of the year, much as we have done to-date. Our outlook for the full year adjusted diluted EPS growth remains unchanged at 13% to 15%. With delivery likely at the high end of this range, this outlook reflects our expectation for: constant currency net sales growth at the high end of the range of 3% to 4%; continued strong management of discretionary costs across the business, while maintaining investments in innovation, technology and sustainability; expected higher marketing investment in the fourth quarter of the year, relative to the third quarter, given the expectation for an environment in which consumer receptivity to marketing and marketing return on investment continues to improve.  It is important to note that we plan to reinvest any order delivery we may generate in the fourth quarter into incremental brand investment to further drive top-line growth, while still delivering our adjusted EPS guidance for 2020. We also have confidence in our deleveraging targets. And now we expect our management leverage ratio to be in the middle of our 3.5 times to 3.8 times range at the end of the year. With that, let me now turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Kevin. First of all, let me touch to two margin lines that we have. One is the gross margin. As we have just spoken on the call, there was a small 120 bps of decline in our gross margin, while at the same time our OI margin has expanded 260 bps. So, on the gross margin, while the third quarter was strong as we spoke, it's 5.8% constant currency net sales growth and 22% EPS growth. It was by no means a windfall for us. It required extraordinary effort to deliver these results in the midst of the crisis. So the gross margin, small decline is a challenge due to a long and complex list of puts and takes. But clearly, unfavorable mix was one of them, or the bigger picks, which included the brewers, given that brewers don't make much money, yet the volume was extraordinarily high. So we also had a little bit higher operating costs with the increased consumer -- in order to meet the increased consumer demand and some inflation that we have experienced in our logistics expenses. Yet, we also delivered a substantial reduction in our overhead base that includes overall sales, marketing and general administrative overheads via a series of the base productivity programs and merger synergies that came in a very substantial manner that helped us to reduce our overall cost structure. In that SG&A number, we also include and categorize our advertisement and promotion investments. So whenever the return on investment in advertisement and promotion didn't make sense, we also reduced that spend due to the COVID-19 environment. So you see it's a combination of the factors and the things and mostly on the positive side that helped us to drive and further expand our OI margin by 260 basis points, which is quite substantial. So on the productivities, as we just spoke as well, we affirmed our merger synergy target of $600 million to be delivered by end of 2021, and we are exactly on that trajectory. We also have our base productivity programs that we have been running and executing very successfully. So the productivity programs and our laser focus and strong delivery has not changed, and we are seeing quite benefits of improving our margins as well as profitability in the third quarter as well. And as we spoke previously, our base productivity programs and the merger synergies will continue into 2021. We have several programs still focusing on our manufacturing footprint, our logistics footprint and including further improvement in our overall cost reductions. And we have several facilities that we have been building, for example, the Spartanburg, the state-of-the-art K-Cup pod facility in South Carolina that will be operational mostly in 2021, and it will give us continued productivity as well as the volume in coffee. And we are building the Packaged Beverage plants in Allentown that will contribute to our productivity programs, including at the end of the year, the facility, the Beverage Concentrate facility that we have been building in Ireland. Therefore, we are very pleased with all of our either base productivity or the merger synergy programs that have been working very nicely. Yes. Yes, I will. Good morning, Nik, and thanks for the question. First of all, let me give a little bit further context with regards to the COVID-19 expenses that we have been adding back. In fact, we have been consistent in Q1, quarter 2 as well as quarter 3. So the costs we excluded from adjusted results are unique and temporary impacts resulting from the crisis. So they are not normal ongoing cost of business. This is consistent with our long-term -- longstanding treatment of the extraordinary and one-time costs here. And these costs are clearly and not only defined as the significant expenses to provide temporary financial incentives through our frontline employees, which represented more than 80% of the costs that we have been adding back. And the balance for the extraordinary measures we undertook to protect employee health and safety, including enhanced benefits for them and their families. So as you have noted, our run rate in Q3 was lower than Q2, and we do expect our quarter 4 run rate to be substantially lower than quarter 3 as well. Therefore, by nature of this, Nik, we never said these are sustained costs or increased cost base in our profit and loss statement, it's the contrary. And I think our quarterly trend is proving. And again, in Q4, we expect to see a substantially lower number."

            "name": "Bob Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks, Tyson. And good morning, everyone. I hope everyone participating on this call continues to be well. In the last few -- the last few months have been extremely volatile, given the COVID crisis. While consumer mobility has increased and the economy has opened up somewhat, the coming months are likely to remain unpredictable, as rates of infection in North America appear to be on the rise. As we'll discuss today, KDP continues to navigate well through the pandemic by anticipating and adjusting to trends in consumer behavior, driving brands, categories and channels with growth potential in order to offset other areas that are challenged.  As we said over the past seven months, the pandemic does not represent a short-term windfall for us. Instead, this is a day-to-day mixed management effort across both channels and products, which is enabled by the flexibility of our business model, and the outstanding executional capabilities of our team. We monitor consumer mobility trends on a near daily basis to adjust our product mix, channel focus and production planning, and continue to view this metric as a reliable leading indicator for running our business. Most of all, we continue to be thankful to our team members who have driven the results we reported today and the work our organization has done to give back to our communities when they are in need.  Ozan will take you through the specifics of our third quarter results in a few minutes. However, I will tell you that in summary, they were outstanding, nearly 6% revenue growth, 16% adjusted operating income growth and 22% adjusted diluted EPS growth, with continued deleveraging. We gained market share of total liquid refreshment beverages in over 90% of our retail base, driven by gains in the majority of category segments in which we compete, with a number of highlights worth mentioning, such as the 1.4 share point increase in CSDs, driven by growth in the great majority of our CSD brands, strength in the Snapple brand, which delivered a 1.5 share point increase in ready-to-drink tea, and nearly a 1 share point increase in juice drinks. And CORE being the fastest growing premium water brand over the quarter. Our Beverage Concentrates segment saw substantial quarter-over-quarter improvement as restaurants experienced improved traffic. In single-serve coffee we delivered 10% growth in at-home consumption driven by increases in both household penetration and an elevated attachment rate, which was partially offset during the quarter by our away-from-home coffee business, which continues to be negatively impacted by persistently low return to work trends in large offices, which is our area of strength, and the timing of some partner shipments. In the fourth quarter, we expect total pod shipments to return to their more normalized mid to high single-digit growth rates despite our expectations that weakness in the away-from-home channel will continue.  Finally, the exceptional growth in brewer sales in advance of the fourth quarter speaks to the enthusiasm retailers have for Keurig in the holiday season, which is upcoming. So with one quarter to go, our guidance for this year remains intact. Now at the high end of what we said we would accomplish in 2020, which means that we continue to meet or exceed the long-term merger targets we communicated over two years ago. Before I turn it over to Ozan, I'd like to take a few minutes to put our quarterly results and several pieces of news that we communicated this week into a longer-term strategic context, all supporting the evolution of KDP to a modern beverage company. We focused much of our past earnings call content on how we are expanding the consumer reach of our brand portfolio, which is a critical driver of long-term profitable growth. That conversation typically focuses on new brands and M&A. But it's very important to point out that the broad share growth we've experienced on existing brands, both before and during the pandemic, has been driven by increased household penetration in both our hot and cold portfolios, which we expect will stick going forward. This is the result of impactful innovation and renovation as well as strong marketing programming that's attracting new consumers into our brands.  Growth in existing brands provides the foundation upon which to add new ones. We continue to pursue opportunities to fill whitespace in our portfolio through national partnerships, such as our recent agreement with Polar and smaller bets, such as investments that we made last year in A Shoc energy drink with Lance Collins, a recently announced Don't Quit! adult nutrition protein drink with Jake Steinfeld and a recent investment in Revive, a kombucha drink with Peet's Coffee.  With regard to the Keurig brand, we consistently expanded household penetration year-in and out. And 2020 is turning out to be an especially strong year for system adoption. Rather than growing household penetration by 2 million households, which is consistent with our recent run rates, we now expect to add approximately 3 million new households in 2020. While attachment rates may move up and down and potentially back up again during another wave of the pandemic, converting new households into the Keurig system represents a long-term annuity stream that endures well into the future. While portfolio expansion has taken center stage since the merger, we've also been building our unique and valuable distribution platforms, although we haven't discussed them until recently. On our last earnings call, we quantified how important e-commerce has become for us, representing more than 10% of total KDP sales and a larger portion of coffee sales. Yesterday, we announced news regarding our Direct Store Delivery system that is worth placing into a broader strategic context. Since our merger, we have invested in people, technology and assets to improve the effectiveness of our DSD network. We've also focused on consolidating key independent distributor systems into our company-owned DSD operations, where territories overlap in order to drive scale and efficiency. Yesterday we jointly announced with The Honickman Companies an agreement that provides KDP with long-term sales and distribution for key brands, including Canada Dry, Sunkist, 7UP and A&W across 18 counties in New York and New Jersey, reaching 17 million consumers. This follows a string of DSD territory moves and acquisitions across the country over the past two years, including California, New York, and the Midwest. To be clear, our objective is not to control every market with our trucks, but rather to ensure that each market in which we sell our brands has a competitive route to market, regardless of who owns the territory. For example, in late 2019, we partnered with Honickman to facilitate their acquisition of a subscale independent distributor in Virginia. In Alabama, we agreed with our partner Buffalo Rock, to allow our brands to ride on the same truck with competitive brands in order to improve frequency and drop size across their system. Whether we operate our trucks in the market, or we partner with a local player of scale, every one of these moves ensures better reach, in stocks, and merchandising for our brand portfolio, which builds our platform for long-term growth. Our strong in-market performance this year demonstrates the value of these system improvements and we believe we have significant opportunity remaining. Important to a modern beverage company is a strong sustainability culture, and continuously pushing forward to meet new and more aspirational goals. Earlier this week, we announced that we have begun the transition of our Snapple and CORE bottles to 100% recycled PET or rPET as is commonly called. We will continue to expand rPET across our portfolio going forward. Finally, consistent with our goal to build KDP for the long-term, we also announced changes earlier this week to our senior leadership team designed to further improve speed to market and place decision-making closer to our consumers and our customers. 2.5 years into our merger and with the benefit of learning what has worked so well during the pandemic, this is a decision made from strength. And we're fortunate to have the talent on our leadership team to assume broader operating roles with increased levels of responsibility. Let me now hand it over to Ozan for more details on the quarter. Good morning, Bonnie. First is on brewer shipments. As we've talked about over the past couple of years, brewer shipments especially quarter-to-quarter are a great measurement of what's going on with household penetration. What I would suggest is that every third quarter has shipments built into it that are for the holiday season. And what you're seeing is a little bit of a pull forward this year meaning some of those holiday shipments that would have gone in October, November are going into the third quarter because of the pandemic retailers are trying to get ahead of everything. The most important thing to take away from that is the confidence that retailers have in Keurig for holiday gifting, in part driven by the innovation and the strong marketing support that we have in place and the feedback that we're getting on all of the brewers that we've introduced in the past year or so but especially the K-Supreme and the K-Supreme Plus which is really the featured item for this holiday has been leaning forward and really in a position to push Keurig for the holidays.  The single most important metric we gave you on this call, though, is our outlook on household penetration. Because as we've said before, shipments can be up and down in a quarter, they're somewhat useful to look over a longer period of time. But the most important metric we talked about today was the fact that we believe that instead of our typical run rate of 2 million households being added into the Keurig system in the year, we expect that now to be 3 million. And as we said before, attachment rates move up and down, shipments move from quarter-to-quarter. It's kind of interesting during the quarter, but it really doesn't mean much over the long haul. But an additional 1 million households is something that stays in the system for a very long time.  The question about the balance of the quarter, and what we're seeing here, I think we're in a position where we've now given visibility on household penetration. We gave you an indication of how we see pod volume growth delivering in the fourth quarter, which shows that, that is now smoothing out. And we've also been really clear that our guidance is at the high end or our latest estimates are at the high end of our guidance for the year and that we're going to reinvest everything else back into marketing and innovation.  And so, there's no new innovation being launched in the fourth quarter, because we have a huge line-up on our cold side as well as our hot side that we're now implementing in the fourth quarter. But the investments that we can make to get a head start on 2021 are just -- I would think are the right thing to do to ensure that we get off to a good start next year as well. And remember, we've committed to a three year target of total shareholder return that goes all the way back to 2018 and ends in 2021. And so, as we're confident in finishing our 2020 strong, we are shifting our sights to 2021 to make sure that's a good year as well. So, thanks for those questions. Kevin, just to add to that, I mean, you could tell from Ozan's answer here that we are very focused on making sure that we run a highly efficient business, and we have a lot of programming going on for that. In terms of your question about beyond 2021, our focus has been, first of all, navigating through this crisis, which continues. I don't ever want to talk about it as if it's over because it's far from that; delivering 2020, setting ourselves up for 2021. At the right time in 2021, we will have a conversation with you guys about what does the post-2021 world look like for KDP and part of that will clearly be strong productivity and efficiency program, which will take you through at that time. Sure. Ozan, you want to kick this off? Nik, with regard to your point about at-home and how we're thinking about our portfolio and our go-to-market strategy on here, I mean, we've referenced mobility data, and it's something that we look at very carefully, and we can get it down to a very granular level. But at the highest level, we think about people spending time at home, people spending time at work and then other. And other is a whole host of recreation activities, et cetera, and we can get more details on that. We have really built a portfolio that has the optionality to drive that at-home business. It's not like we are 100% at-home business, far from it. You see the negative impacts on our fountain foodservice business, you see the negative impacts on our away-from-home business. So we keep saying it's not like this was a windfall for us, but we do have the options to pivot towards that changing consumer behavior. And if it shifts, to pivot back. And I would point out, before I get on to coffee, which is an obvious answer. Even on our cold portfolio, we have made significant shifts in where we focus our selling efforts and what we're selling. And what you're seeing more is large outlets, planned purchase and stock ups are continuing to grow. Impulse, while improving sequentially is still down versus where it was before. And we focus a lot of our effort on the cold side of our portfolio on multi-pack, take-home packs, larger pack sizes, for example. And some of the growth that you're seeing in and outside of our CSD business is because we've been able to shift over the past couple of months from businesses that were more heavily focused on single bottles into multi-packs, and it's helping drive growth in our business.  I mean, obviously, when I shift over to the coffee side, the Keurig system was designed for at-home consumption. And we said year in and year out that don't worry about attachment rate, all we're focused on is household penetration. While we're seeing improvement in attachment rate as people spend more time at home, but more importantly, we're seeing an acceleration in household penetration. As I said a couple of times, it's really a lasting benefit. And as people think about their homes differently, both living at home as well as working from home, they're upgrading across the board, and we're seeing a combination of new people coming into our system at a higher rate. And we're also seeing upgrades in brewers of existing consumers, and that may not drive growth in the short-term, but it's a reconfirmation or a recommitment that they're in the system for the long-term. The away-from-home business, which is offices, has been a negative, and I want to offer 2 points of perspective. If you look at traffic in large offices, it's down 60%. So we've never quantified the size of our away-from-home business. But even if it was very small, a negative 60% trend on even a modest business has a major impact on us. Here's the good news. That really can only impact us now through, call it, February, and then it becomes actually a tailwind instead of a headwind. So the risk of that, which I know some people are focused on, is pretty well capped, and we've already given you some visibility in the fourth quarter anyway. And that really sets us up for strong at-home. And then the last point I would make on your overall conclusion, which is 100% right about where consumers are going is, our investment in e-com and our capabilities in e-com are paying off really well. When we launched this new company in 2018, and we talked about e-com and the legacy Keurig business and how we can apply it across the portfolio, I think most people were skeptical at best about what would e-com and beverage look like. Nobody is skeptical about it anymore, and it's an area that we're really focused. And if you saw the management changes that we made this week, embedded in that at a level below that, is also an increased focus and commitment to e-com because we think that's really the future. Yes. I think the longer-term view is always the best way to view this business. We talked about the year in and year out household penetration increases the system has seen, and there's been a lot of debate and a lot of analysis quarter-by-quarter. And sometimes when you look at the IRi data month-by-month, and it doesn't serve anybody really well. But when you step back and look at it, you see this nice, steady increase. And one of the comments that we made on an investor conference that we attended fairly recently was, we do expect household penetration to accelerate, and that's why we quantified that for you today to give you some perspective. But you have to always remember that we're operating off of an installed base of already 30 million households in the U.S. and 3 million households in Canada. So even an additional 1 million households, which is significant growth and profit generator for the long-term, you're putting them on top of an installed base of 30 million. And so it's such a solid business right now that it's not one that can be moved up or down quickly by any type of action, but it just speaks to the longer term potential. When we launched the business or the combined company in 2018, we put some information on our Investor Day that is 100% relevant today as it was then, and that is, we believe that household penetration for the Keurig system would go north of 50% over time. At the rate that we're growing, that's 10 years out before we even have a conversation of what happens beyond 50%. So you're looking at 10 years of solid growth. And all that this proves is that, as people think about spending time at home, they just step up their interest in the Keurig system, increased household penetration. And the dividends or the growth that you get of that plays out over the next couple of years, it's not an instant boost that you see. And then my last point is, you can look at the IRi data and see that we have been growing at-home consumption by north of 10% over the past 6 months or so. And on the latest period, it was plus 10%. And that tells you what's going on in-home. So if you look at that number and then you compare it to what you're seeing on some of the shipment numbers as we've been totally transparent, that is 100% driven by an away-from-home business, which is primarily large offices, where we're seeing, traffic attendance might be the better word in large offices, down [16%]. So again, that's been a significant drain on us, but there's a limit to that. Because as soon as we start hitting the month of March and we go into April, that becomes all opportunity and not risk, and it's really that simple to explain the disconnect between what you're seeing at-home versus what you're seeing in total. Yes. Peter, your comment is right about the disconnect sometimes and the timing of it, and it's really hard to forecast when they get aligned. But your statement that over time they align is 100% correct. And so that's some of the nuances we get quarter-to-quarter on Beverage Concentrates, but we don't spend a lot of energy on that because we know, over time, they align, and it's just difficult to try to predict that. The biggest takeaway from the Beverage Concentrates segment is the fact that we've seen sequential improvement in restaurants. And I would point out that when you look at the KDP businesses in fountain and foodservice, that's our business that we talked about that services restaurants and hospitality, it is heavily concentrated towards quick-serve restaurants. As we've talked about a number of times, Dr Pepper brand is the most available brand in quick-serve restaurants, and they have done a really good job of navigating towards drive-through and take out. And so even if there is a resurgence and as we look at what may happen in the next couple of months, we're really confident that, that segment, in particular, will not only hang in there, but may actually do better -- although that's not in our forecast, but it may actually do better as traditional sit down restaurants could become more challenged and people shift even more towards takeaway and drive-through. And so that's the way that we're thinking about it going forward, but we were encouraged to see the -- at least a sequential rebound in that business, and we're watching and partnering with those restaurant partners to try to help them grow their business, and they're doing an excellent job of navigating to the new world. Sure. Yes. Thanks for your question, Lauren. Good morning. I think there are a number of factors that are driving our performance, and we've dug into that and we've pulled it apart to make sure that we understand that we can continue to drive those things that are working. It is primarily driven by a combination of marketing, strength, innovation, which on -- across our portfolio, not just on our CSD brands with Dr Pepper and Cream and Canada Dry Bold, but we've introduced new buy items and a whole host of item across the board in Snapple, for example. They're playing out really well. And as I talked about on an earlier -- one of the earlier questions, we've also shifted our brands into the right pack sizes and formats and into the right channels. And that's not underperformance by anyone else, that's just us moving quickly towards the consumer, and I have every confidence that if the consumer were to shift again, we'd get ahead of it and we'd move back over there. So the household penetration gains that we're seeing, the great majority of it are driven by marketing innovation and good execution on our part, and it's not really driven by the thoughts about can shortages or executional missteps by anyone else. And so therefore, it's driving household penetration, which we believe will stick. The other subtle point that I would point out is, a number of our brands, the Dr Pepper brand, in particular, but other brands as well, a good portion of those are actually distributed -- manufactured and distributed by other independent companies and some of our peers. I know that gets confusing when we talk about it, but those who really dig into the business understand that. And just as we're gaining from good execution on our end, we actually get hurt by performance on the other end when there are can shortages or difficulty getting the product out there.  And so as strong as our results are, there are actually positives from our system being offset in some cases by negatives in other systems. And so it's not all windfalls, I keep saying, this is -- the results you're seeing are the net of positives and negatives, and we've been able to move through it really quickly, but it's not all positive that then become a headwind as you think about next year. No, I know you do. I'm talking about the broader audience. Yes. Let me go back -- before I answer, I want to go back to your point, though, about the contractual pieces or whatever. If you look at social media and you look at some of the new stories that were popping up about shortages of some of our brands, that's all you need to know is what's actually happening out in the marketplace. And that's not coming from -- if you take a look at where that's coming from, it speaks to the broader challenge in the industry that has been well documented. So my point again is this is not a -- we're not -- there's no complaints. We never brought it up as an excuse. But if you really think about now flipping it to next year, I don't want anyone to take away from this is, we got all positives next year that will become negative this year, that will become negative next year. It's a mix. There are some things that will be more challenging to lap in 2021, but I have a long list of things that are negative this year that flip to the positive as well. And so it's really important to understand this is a balance between the two. And it's -- we're not just -- this isn't a weather report, we actually control the outcome in many cases. And so a lot of the positives are driven by the fact that we got ahead of things quickly, and we were able to pivot our business to do so. And it's a flexible business model, we can pivot again next year. To your point about the distribution pieces, as we talked about in the script, this partnership with Honickman that we talked about today is by far the single biggest move that we've made in this optimization. But we also talked about, there has been a string of smaller but very important moves that we've been putting in place over the past 2 years. And so you're starting to see some of that effect in the strong performance in the marketplace in 2020, but big moves like the one that we just talked about today as well as other partnerships with our independent distributors like the Polar deal, those are mainly 2021 and beyond. And I would suggest that the investments that we're making in our distribution infrastructure is part of the conversation we'll have about what does KDP look like beyond 2021. And you can see, clearly, we believe distribution is a critical asset with a lot of upside. Sure. Bill, good morning. And good to hear from you this morning. I'm smiling, you can't see that in-person because we remember when we took KGM private. We actually had some dinners and some meetings at that time with previous KGM investors and analysts and just to talk about the business and what we were thinking about doing over time because we knew at some point, we would be public again. And household penetration at that point was round numbers, 15%. And that was the exact same question, we got a 15% household penetration, and people were using the words like saturation. And we talked at that time about we have every indication the household penetration over time will be north of 50%. There is no sign of slowing down or saturation. And we talked about what were the barriers to entry. So if we really believe the number is that big, why isn't it happening now and doesn't everybody know about Keurig already, and our answer to that point was we still have a lot of work to do in terms of marketing, innovation, price points, features, improving sustainability. It's a long list of things that we have benefit of working on every single day. And then sometimes, it just takes time. And the number one reason why somebody moves to a Keurig machine is when they replace their coffee maker that breaks, and that just takes time. And so I understand the concept. We get this all the time, but we got that question, millions and millions of households to go, and I expect we'll continue to get that question going forward. But again, every indication is that we'll be north of 50% if we keep going on our game. That's 10 years out of strong growth, and I think that this latest quarter is just yet one more quarter on top of many that preceded it, that showed that that's the right way to think about our business. I think it's the same trend going on year after year. I mean if we -- we'll look at it in absolute numbers and how may that compare to 2020, I don't know yet because I don't know what the world is going to look like in 2021, but the best way to look at this business is over time. And every time you lengthen the time period from a quarter to 6 months to a year beyond that, the business makes total sense, and it does exactly what we just described. There are some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and month-to-month. But as we look at 2021, solid innovation, lots of interest in the business, great marketing plans still in front of us, we're not worried about lapping 2020. We just think this is all part of the long-term growth in the system. Yes, you see it in the IRi numbers where you see the average price going up, and that's been a combination of some reduction in promotion as well as a shift interestingly, a shift towards more premium brands and we talked about before I think as people move from coffee out of the home and in home they take their favorite coffee shop brands with them, which tend to be priced higher. Hard to say what it's going to be in the fourth quarter. It really depends on what the consumer dynamics are and behaviors are. But I would expect, over time, promotional levels will return more towards normal. That's not something that we have -- we don't have lack of promotion baked into any of our plans. But in the short-term, if there's strong demand and there's some supply or stock issues at retail, if there's another stay-at-home type behavior, I think they'll pull back on promotions across the board. That's potential to happen."

This conference call is being recorded and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Ms. Maria Sceppaguercio. Ms. Sceppaguercio, please go ahead.\nMaria Sceppaguercio: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Here with me today to discuss our second quarter 2020 results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and Senior Director of Investor Relations, Steve Alexander. Steve is sitting in today for Tyson Seely our Vice President of Investor Relations, who is home on baby duty as he and his wife just welcomed a second daughter into the family earlier this week. Our best wishes go out to all of them. I will now hand it over to Steve to cover a few comments.\nSteve Alexander: Thanks, Maria and hello everyone. Earlier this afternoon, we issued two press releases, the first announced that we have entered into a long-term franchise agreement with Polar Seltzer and the second was our Q2 press release. If you need a copy of either release, you can get one on our website at keurigdrpepper.com in the Investor section. Consistent with previous quarters, today we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, excluding items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are included in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later this week. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company\u2019s control, we do not reconcile our guidance. Finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Steve and good morning everyone. Let me start by expressing my sincere hope that everyone dialed in continues to be safe and healthy, and that your families are well. At KDP we have worked extraordinarily hard since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis to protect the health and safety of our employees, particularly those front line employees in our supply chain and out in the trade who play an essential role in ensuring our products are available for our consumers, customers and communities that rely on them. The results we've reported this morning are a testament to the dedication and commitment of our team, and I can't thank KDP employees enough for all that they are doing day in and day out. As you know, the environment in which we are operating continues to be extremely volatile with covert cases spiking again forcing some regions into a second phase of shutdown, all of which impacts consumer mobility and beverage consumption behavior. TDP was performing exceptionally well before the crisis. We delivered well for all stakeholders during the crisis as evidenced by the results we're discussing today, and we fully expect to emerge as an even stronger company when we get to the other side. Until there is a widely available vaccine or treatment, we believe the macro environment will be bumpy and uncertain, requiring us to continue to be focused, flexible and responsive. Two years ago this month we completed the merger that created Keurig Dr Pepper, which at that time we described as the new challenger in the beverage industry. With the integration complete, we believe we have created a modern beverage company, with a broad reaching portfolio of hot and cold beverages delivered by a diversified route to market network that provides unmatched reach and efficiency, and with highly unique ecosystems in our coffee business and DSD network that leverage partnerships and technology to create value. Equally important, we have built a culture that emphasizes excellence in execution and delivery. The covert crisis is by no means a windfall for TDP. We have been required to focus resources on the areas of our business that are aligned with changing consumer trends, such as at-home coffee, multipack cold beverages, large-format retail, and e-commerce to offset significant weakness in away from home coffee, on premise beverage consumption and convenience stores. The impact of these mixed changes on margin are significant, which has required us to deliver volume and revenue growth while tightly controlling the cost side of our P&L, and still investing in our future. Our executional capabilities have certainly been tested by the crisis and we're proud of how we've performed to date. In the two years since the merger, we have exceeded our merger commitments for net sales growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15% to 17%. In fact, in the eight quarters since our merger close, adjusted diluted EPS has grown at an average annual rate of 20%. In the second quarter, which we believe will be the most challenging environment we face this year, constant currency net sales advanced nearly 3%. Constant currency adjusted operating income grew 11%, and adjusted diluted EPS was up 10%. Further, we have reduced our management leverage ratio to 4x as compared to the 6x ratio at the time of the merger. Ozan will take you through a more detailed review of our financial results by segment in a few minutes. To bring the concept of a modern beverage company to life, let me use several performance highlights from the latest quarter. The strength of our differentiated portfolio is unprecedented. We were the first company to combine hot and cold beverages at scale, including leading positions in single serve coffee, flavored CSDs, premium water, juices and mixers. Our core portfolio was very strong in the quarter as we gain market share of total liquid refreshment beverages with gains in the majority of the categories segments in which we compete. Specifically in CSDs we gained 1.2 share points and moved to the #2 CSD player in a number of key grocery customers, driven by broad-based core brand strength, strong in market execution and innovations such as Dr Pepper & Cream Soda and Canada Dry Bold. In fact, Dr Pepper & Cream Soda is the best performing innovation in the CSD category so far this year. The Dr Pepper brand has now delivered 17 consecutive quarters of growth at retail, while Canada Dry has done the same for 13 consecutive years. What's important for our longer-term outlook however, is the fact that our sheer [ph] mention of CSDs has been heavily driven by a double-digit increase in new households purchasing many of our brands. And we confident that we will be able to retain a portion of the these new households once we emerge from this crisis. In the hot portfolio, we have a commanding leadership position of single serve coffee with a combination of owned, licensed and partner brands and the Keurig brand is ranked by consumers as one of the most relevant brands in the country, not just in CPG, but among all brands. In the second quarter, our coffee systems segment grew pod volume 9.5% and brewer volume 11.6% and that's on top of 19% growth in the year ago period, primarily reflecting new households entering the system. These results reflect significant growth in coffee consumption at home, partially offset by the away from home channel, particularly our large office coffee business and to a lesser extent our hospitality business, which were down significantly in the quarter. Our share of K-Cup Pods manufactured by KDP held steady at 82% and retail pricing for the category increased by 2%, as promotional activity lessened and mix shifted towards premium brands. Further, share trends for our portfolio of owned and license brands also improved. We've previously discussed our seven distinct routes to market at some length and today I think it is relevant to highlight DSD and e-commerce, using examples of their contributions in the second quarter to also illustrate our long-term strategy. Our DSD network has served us very well during this crisis by enabling the highest levels of flexibility, speed and delivery. We have been able to pivot on a granular basis at both the products skew and local marketplace level to react to changes in demand, using near real-time data that's simply not available in other distribution systems. We see opportunity to continue to invest to improve our DSD system and look forward to sharing more with you on this topic in the future. As you've seen across many categories, e-commerce has been the real star this year. The COVID crisis has accelerated consumer adoption of e-commerce for food and beverage and we see no evidence of this trend slowing when the crisis abates. If you recall at the time of the merger, we emphasized Keurig's first mover advantage in this space. Dating back to the launch of keurig.com 16 years ago and how we plan to leverage that competency across our full portfolio. Today, we believe we are the leader in e-commerce in food and beverage if not FMCG. E-commerce now represents more than 10% of KDP total retail sales and it continues to expand rapidly. While our online business is weighted towards brewers and K-Cup Pods, we also have a strong presence on the cold side, especially with Bai, CORE, Mott's and Dr Pepper. Upfront, I mentioned the concept of ecosystems in our DSD and coffee business. Let me explain that important concept further demonstrated power in the most recent quarter and for the future and announced several exciting developments. Our DSD networks which gives us national reach and the ability to be in retail on a daily basis is an attractive asset to startup or expanding beverage companies. While we have stated that we have no interest in renting our system as a distributor, we are willing to partner with beverage brands that fill whitespace in our portfolio through a range of structures. Recent examples include our long-term partnership with Danone for the Evian brand, our investment with a path to ownership in A-Shoc Smart Energy, and our licensing agreement with Peet's Coffee for ready-to-drink beverages. This morning we announced a long-term franchise agreement with Polar Beverages for their Polar Seltzer brand. Polar Seltzer is the third-largest branded flavored sparkling water in the U.S. despite being available in less than 35% of the country. The brand is also the highest velocity sparkling water where distributed. We currently have a long-standing and successful franchise agreement with Polar Beverages to distribute key KDP brands throughout their network in New England. And we are excited to announce a similar arrangement for their flagship brand to be in our system and expanded geographies. We look forward to rapidly scaling Polar to national distribution. We've also made a seed investment with a path to ownership in Don't Quit!, a clean label meal replacement protein drink line created by Jake Steinfeld of Body by Jake. You'll hear more about this partnership and Don't Quit!, as the brand launches in a couple of weeks. Our coffee ecosystem is built on innovation, technology and partnership. While common in the technology space, this structure doesn't exist anywhere else in CPG. That means, when a consumer makes the conversion from brewing coffee by the pot, to coffee by the cup, our brand of partners, our retail partners, and we, all benefit, which puts us all on the same page with regard to ensuring the Keurig ecosystem remains healthy and growing. In March we were scheduled to unveil our Keurig innovation pipeline and latest growth strategy during an investor meeting in Texas. While COVID required that meeting to be cancelled, and the conversation since then has been dominated by the crisis, we have maintained internal focus on progressing our pipeline for launches in the third and fourth quarters, and strengthening the Keurig ecosystem to the benefit of all stakeholders. Our lineup of K-Duo Brewers launched in late 2019 performed exceptionally well in the quarter and our K-Slim Brewer introduced earlier this year is off to a good start. In August we are launching the K-Supreme and K-Supreme Plus, filling out product range at the mid-to-higher end of our portfolio. These new brewers price from $139 to $189 feature our new industrial design and most importantly, are the first of our next generation of brewers to include multi-stream technology, which increases coffee extraction by using a new five pronged needle system to deliver a more flavorful and aromatic cup. These brewers also offer greater consumer truck control [ph] over strength, and temperature. We intend to cascade this technology to more of our brewer lineup over time. Additionally, in the third quarter, we are introducing a limited edition K-Mini brewer created by the renowned home furnishings designer Jonathan Adler. This brewer represents the first step into a new platform for Keurig, with limited edition and/or custom design brewers, targeting consumers who are attracted by kitchen style and aesthetics. Look for more to come on this topic in the near future. Retailer interest for these new brewers and across the entire Keurig Brewer lineup for their upcoming holiday season is strong, and follows a very successful Mother's Day, which experienced a noticeable e-commerce retail shift. In our last earnings call, we discussed how we were using real-time points of consumption data through our Keurig connected panel of 10,000 households to guide our decisions during the crisis. Harnessing what is one of a kind technology in CPG, we've been able to navigate the volatility caused by COVID, making near real time decisions to drive strong in-market execution. We also make connected panel data available to all Keurig partners. Today I'm pleased to report that our first smart brewer will be available for sale to consumers on keurig.com between now and our next earnings call. The K-Custom Smart will deliver our most personalized flavorful coffee experience ever, powered by our smartest technology. This brewer represents the next step toward having connected and intelligent brewers across our line. The K-Custom Smart is compatible with existing K-Cup Pods, and has the capability to recognize the specific brand, variety and roast for any owned, license or partner brand made by Keurig and brew to the specification of its master roaster to bring out the full flavor.  The K-Custom Smart can be controlled from a smartphone, set to turn on with your morning alarm and brew your favorite cup of coffee from bed. It can also be customized through consumers' favorite temperature and brew preferences, and can automatically reorder pods, having tracked how many the consumer has brewed since their last order. More specifics will be available in the press release at the time of its official launch.  Finally, earlier this month, we began selling McCaf\u00e9 as a Keurig licensed brand in the U.S., across K-Cup Pods, bags and canisters, further emphasizing our ability to create win-win partnerships across the portfolio. We look forward to working with McDonald's to drive growth for the brand in the U.S., as we've done in our partnership with McCaf\u00e9 in Canada, which began earlier this year. Before I turn it over to Ozan, I want to mention three important points regarding sustainability. Again, while most of our conversation over the past four months has focused on the COVID crisis, we've also continued our progress toward delivering our sustainability commitments. First, we are fully on track to convert 100% of our K-Cup Pods, to be recyclable by year end. As of today, approximately 95% of the K-Cup Pods being produced are recyclable. Second, in the next quarter, we are targeting to introduce our first PET bottles made with 100% Post Consumer Resin. As you'll recall, we are committed to using 30% post consumer recycled material by the end of 2025, and this is an important first step toward realizing that goal. We also recently announced our founding sponsorship and position as the largest funder of the Recycling Partnerships Polypropylene Coalition. This industry collaboration is designed to increase and improve the recovery and recycling of polypropylene, the plastic used in K-Cup Pods, and many other food and consumer products. We have already begun using Post Consumer Resin in the production of our Keurig brewers. Finally we have received the good news that our Spartanburg, South Carolina production facility for K-Cup Pods will be LEED certified, making it the largest LEED certified production facility in North America, and the second largest LEED facility of any kind. With that, let me hand it over Ozon.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks Bob, and good morning everyone. I will briefly review our performance for the second quarter, which our press release provides in significant detail. The second quarter was another good one for us. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2.9%. This growth in three of our four segments. Packaged beverages and coffee systems were particularly strong in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 11.1% in the quarter, driven by revenue growth, productivity and merger synergies, as well as a significant reduction in discretionary spending. As Bob noted, we believe that we have struck the right balance of continuing to invest in areas such as innovation, technology, and sustainability that provide competitive advantage, funded in part by reduced marketing, giving the low return on investments in the quarter, and dramatically lower travel and entertaining expenses, given the limitations in travel. These drivers were partially offset by negative segment mix, inflation, higher operating costs associated with increased consumer demands, and certain costs related to COVID-19 that were not treated as items affecting comparability.  Let me pause here for a moment to discuss these COVID-19 costs. In the second quarter pre-tax operating expenses directly related to COVID-19 totaled $75 million. Of these, $63 million were recognized as items affecting comparability and consistent of temporary and unusual compensation increases, and incentives for frontline employees, as well as incremental safety and sanitation expenses across our business. The balance of the COVID-19 related costs in the quarter, which totaled $12 million consisted of inventory write-downs, and bad debt expense, and have not been treated as items affecting comparability. Therefore, they are included in our adjusted results. Adjusted diluted EPS advanced 10% in the quarter, sealed by the growth in adjusted operating income and an increase in non-operating income in the quarter. These growth drivers were partially offset by increased interest expense due to lapping the benefits of an interest rate swap in the year ago period, and the higher the effective tax rate due to lapping favorable discrete tax items in the year ago period. Turning to our segment performance for the quarter. In coffee systems, constant currency net sales growth of 5.8% was driven by strong volume mix growth of 8.3%, partially offset by lower net pricing of 2.5%. The volume mix performance reflected higher purchases of K-Cup pots and brewers for at-home consumption, partially offset by a significant drop off in the office coffee and hospitality businesses. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 10% in the quarter to $363 million. In Packaged Beverages constant currency net sales grew 6.3% due to strong volume mix growth of 6.6%, partially offset by modestly lower pricing of 0.3%. This performance reflected increased at-home consumption and market share growth, due to strong in-market execution, enabled by excellent supply chain management and exceptional collaboration across our front line teams during the crisis. This growth was partially offset by a decline in the convenience and gas channels due to limited consumer mobility. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 41.6% in the quarter to $269 million. In Beverage Concentrates constant currency net sales declined 16.2% due to a significant drop off in the fountain and foodservice business, which serves restaurants and hospitality and lower net price realization of 4.8%. The lower pricing related annual adjustments to prior year customer incentives, partially offset by customer concentrate pricing, that we took in January. Importantly, as the second quarter progressed, we saw improving month-over-month trends in this business, and those trends have continued into July. Constant currency adjusted operating income decreased 9.3% in the quarter to $222 million. And finally, in Latin America Beverages constant currency net sales grew 1.4%, reflecting the strong pricing of 63%, partially offset by lower volume mix of 4.7% due to limited consumer mobility in Mexico. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 30% to $23 million in the quarter, due to continued productivity and lower marketing expense. While the current environment has proven the power of our brands, it has also made evident the importance of simplification. To meet heightened demand and drive efficiency during the crisis, we focused our production and delivery on the highest priority products with great success. Through this process, we had performed a detailed review of the offerings in our system to ensure we deliver on our customers' needs, while ensuring we were efficient. We will continue to focus on this as a best practice coming out of this crisis and going forward. In terms of our ongoing productivity and merger synergies, we continue to execute on these opportunities accretively. In the current environment, we are delaying certain planned value capture projects, due to COVID-19 related safety concerns, and in other cases, we are accelerating certain projects to offset delays. We remain committed to delivering our value capture commitments through both productivity and merger synergies, and fully expect to deliver our planned merger synergies of $600 million by the end of 2021. Now moving to cash flow and liquidity. Free cash flow in the quarter was strong at $524 million translating into an adjusted free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 112%. In the quarter, we reduced bank debt by $274 million, and structured payables by $78 million, and we end of the quarter with almost $160 million of unrestricted cash on hand. In terms of leverage, our bank debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which we refer to as our management leverage ratio, improved to 4 times, compared to 4.5 times at the end of 2019. This improvement was driven by continued reductions in outstanding debt balances and continued growth in adjusted EBITDA. Since the merger close, we have reduced our leverage ratio by two full terms. Turning now to CapEx. We continue to support the business with necessary CapEx investment, but some projects will be delayed, primarily due to COVID-19. For example, our new Spartanburg pot production facility is delayed approximately six months, resulting from equipment supplier delays and our new cold beverages facility in Allentown is also delayed about three months for similar reasons. We have always expected both of these facilities to primarily [ph] be contributors to our business in 2021. And these minor delays do not significantly change our expectations, which brings us to our guidance. In terms of full year, we continue to have confidence in our ability to manage through what is likely to be a bumpy road in the second half, much as we have done to date. Our outlook for adjusted diluted EPS growth remains unchanged at 13%, to 15%. This outlook reflects our expectation for constant currency net sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%, continued strong management of discretionary costs across the business, while maintaining investment in innovation, technology, and sustainability. Expected higher marketing investment in the second half of the year, relative to the second quarter, giving the expectation for an environment in which consumer receptivity to marketing and marketing return on investment improves. It is Important to note that if we experience accelerating growth in our categories in the second half, we would likely increase our brand investment to drive mid-to-long-term growth, while still delivering our adjusted EPS guidance for 2020. We also have confidence in our deleveraging targets and continue to expect our management leverage ratio to be between 3.5 times and 3.8 times at the end of the year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the lineup, Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBonnie Herzog: All right, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRobert Gamgort: Hi, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi, I kind of want to just ask overall, your business has done quite well in the at-home economy, that we're all experiencing right now. So, just hoping you could talk a little bit more about how you expect your business will perform maybe in a more normalized environment. Yes, I guess I'm wondering if you see any risk at all in possible pullback in demand for your products, maybe as consumers return to some of their pre-COVID routines, just really how do you think about this and how sticky do you expect your business to be as maybe things return to normal? Thanks.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, sure, Bonnie it is a great question, something we think about a lot. I think if we step back at 100,000 feet, and then I'll drill down deeper into your points. We look at - there are companies that fall into roughly three buckets. There were those that may not have been done doing well prior to the pandemic and they're doing really well during the pandemic because suddenly something was off trend became on trend. And it would cause you to say, well what's going to happen when things turn to normal, which is where you're going. There's another set of companies that were doing really well prior to and are struggling in this environment. And in that case, you kind of have to hope for a return to a future that looks a lot like the past. We're in a very unique situation here, and I think there are very few companies in this situation. That is, we were performing very, very well prior to the crisis. So we said a number of times, we don't see this at all as a windfall for us. We've been able to perform very well since the crisis, but we've had to work really hard to do that. And I think you'll see from the comments that we made earlier, that it is quite a mixed management exercise, we've had to push some areas of our business really hard. But I'll remind you, there are areas of our business that are large and profitable, that have taken a significant hit in this crisis that we've had to offset. And if things were to return more to normal, we'll get the bounce back on those immediately. But we don't expect into the future, we don't expect it to continue the way it is indefinitely, but we also don't think that the future is going to look exactly like the past. And so, we have the tools and the levers to pull, to be able to create a company that does even better in the future. And that's reflective of all of the innovation that we're continuing to invest in, and we're continuing to launch. And we're getting great retailer receptivity on all of that as well, because they're bullish about that future as well. So we're confident where we are and we continue to be confident in how we will deliver to the end of the year, as we talked about in our guidance and our commentary, but we're not planning on a future that returns back to normal. If it did, it would actually be good for us. We're planning on a future that's going to look quite different and we're navigating the company to be even stronger and stay ahead of the game.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you very much.\nRobert Gamgort: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning.\nRobert Gamgort: Hi Bill.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Good morning.\nBill Chappell: Just looking at the kind of the brewer household penetration and is there any way to kind of gauge how much this sticks? And then I know we don't talk about attachment rate anymore, but certainly the attachment rate is going to a new higher level, any kind of idea where that is and where that's a sustainable level? I mean, I imagine a lot of us are dusting off our Keurig machines and using them all the time, but a certain amount of people have never used them before and will start using them on a regular basis. So just kind of any sense on how the whole platform has changed over the past three, four months?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, and remember, we have really good insight into this internally, because we have this household panel of 10,000 homes. We can see minute-by-minute consumption. And so we've been able to track the attachment rate change from the very beginning of the crisis. And we don't, we haven't talked about attachment rate in the past because as we said, when you guys have tried to model that, it's really steady. So the whole game is really about household penetration. And we've also said that volume growth in the category is a good proxy for household penetration because attachment rate is even. We're getting two benefits right now. We're getting new people coming into the system and to answer your question that sticks. And we've seen that for years now that when somebody decides to move from brewing coffee by the pot to brewing coffee by the cup, or in the case that we have right now, people who weren't making coffee at home, making it at home now using a Keurig machine, that's incredibly sticky with a dropout rate from the system is very, very low. The attachment rate, as we look forward, our belief is we'll capture some of that increased attachment rate going forward because people who weren't making coffee at home or were making it at a lower frequency, recognize that A, it's easy to do, that the quality has improved dramatically over the past couple of years. So for those that had a perception of quality, they're now getting a firsthand experience that the quality is better. And you heard from our innovation pipeline that will continue to go up. And I think the third part is, significant cost benefit to making coffee at home. And I think a lot of people, if you look at the research that we do, but also social media and articles that are written there are lot of people saying, I really like this, this is easier than I thought and I'm saving a lot of money on top of it. So we don't model going forward that we're going to keep all of that attachment rate, but we know we'll keep some of it. But the household penetration gains, we're very confident we keep the great, great majority of that.\nBill Chappell: That's great and just one follow-up on that. Have you seen any real change to, or trading on the private label or lower price brands as we've been in a call that recession or is it just kind of too early to tell or see?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, I'll talk about both of them. The cold side of business no, we're seeing actually pricing on average up as promotion is less and we're seeing no move away from brands to private label. In fact, in many cases, you're seeing that the larger brands benefit. And clearly, we've benefited significantly from a share of total liquid refreshment beverage and then we gained as I said, in the prepared remarks, 1.2 share points in CSD. So the brands and our brands in particular are doing very well in this environment. On the coffee side of the business, you're actually seeing a skew towards more premium brands in this environment. And I believe that's because as people trade off from making or purchasing coffee outside of the home to making it at home, they want to take their brands with them and the coffee shop brands that they can get now in our system, are skewed towards the premium end, so that's very bullish. And the other point that is worth emphasizing is that the cost of pods today in general, whether it's at the premium mid price or the value or entry level price point, are all down significantly versus where they were three, four or five years ago and that's intentional. That was part of our strategy that we talked about. We set off with the ambition of lowering the price of pods to increase household penetration and attachment rate and that's exactly what we're seeing. So I would have thought actually that given the some of the financial strain, you might see some trade down, which I would emphasize, we're okay with because we produce the great majority of private label as well, but we're actually seeing the reverse right now. And although I can't predict anything in the future, it makes sense to me with the change in behavior from out of home to in-home.\nBill Chappell: Right, thank you so much for the color.\nRobert Gamgort: Okay, thanks Bill.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys, good morning. It's actually Pete Galbo on for Bryan. Thanks very much for taking the question.\nRobert Gamgort: Hi, Pete.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Good morning.\nPeter Galbo: Bob and Ozan, I just wanted to dig in a little bit on beverage concentrate. Obviously, Bob you kind of mentioned seems like you're through the worst of it or through the trough and in July, trends improving, but also just wanted to touch on, your concentrate volumes were pretty significantly behind bottle or cases in the first half. I think it's something like 350 basis points. Just how should we think about catch up there in the second half of the year? And I have a followup as well.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, let me start it and then Ozan feel free to jump in at the end if you have something you want to add to this. The BC areas where you see the fountain and food service business, that's servicing restaurants, and clearly that's been impaired, but it's improved throughout the quarter. And so, I think that the gap that you're talking about between shipments sometimes and concentrate shipments and bottle or case sales, that happens from quarter-to-quarter. So there's always a catch up. But we are seeing great improvement in the FFF business throughout the quarter due to rebound in restaurants. And I'd emphasize that we're particularly strong in QSRs. And in fact, we are the - Dr Pepper brand is the number one most available CSD in QSRs. And so, as the drive-thru business seems to be improving, in particular, that's very bullish for us going forward. But you're seeing in the BC segment, the hit that came from restaurants shutting down, especially in the early part of the quarter. Ozan, anything to add to BC?\nOzan Dokmecioglu: No, I mean, actually, you covered all the points. I mean, there is always a gap and lag between our shipments to our distributors and the bottlers and their shipments to the retailers and as Bob said, always and always within a timeframe catches up.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Now that's helpful, and maybe Ozan just a quick one. You detailed some of the COVID costs for 2Q, anything we should be expecting kind of in the back half of the year that you call out at this point?\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Well, I mean, maybe I can use this opportunity to expand a little bit on the FX as well. And as you have heard in our prepared remarks, first of all the costs were excluded from adjusted results are unique and temporary impacts resulting from the crisis. So they are not normal, ongoing cost of business. And this is consistent with our long-term standing treatment of extraordinary and one-time costs. So I mean, these costs are clearly are not only defined as the significant expenses to provide temporary financial incentives to frontline employees, which represented more than 70% of the cost and the balance for the extraordinary measures that we undertook to protect employee health and safety, including obvious enhanced benefits for them and their families. And we also said there were a portion, approximately $12 million of COVID related expenses that we did not add back and we kept in our adjusted results. Therefore, first and foremost, the health and well being safety of our employees come as number one. Therefore, depending on the crisis, and depending on how the pandemic is going to evolve, we will adjust our programs accordingly. Having said that, we also believe quarter two was the highest, in terms of us incurring the COVID expenses. Obviously, time is going to show us what will be the reality, but that's our expectations at this point in time.\nPeter Galbo: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is actually [indiscernible] on for Robert. Thanks for taking my question. \nRobert Gamgort: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good Morning. So you mentioned the new product called Don\u2019t Quit!, could you just talk about what gets you excited about that and how does retailer interest look? And how are you thinking about sales and potential?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, so we have just given you a teaser on that today and there will be appropriate press release from them, because we're investing in this business in the next couple of weeks, because it's already teed up to go for sale in August. It's going to be available on - right now it's about 2,500 retail outlets and growing traditional retailers, as you might imagine, as well as ecommerce. What's exciting for us? Big whitespace in our portfolio, protein drinks. We don't want to launch a me too protein drink out there and so this one we think is highly unique. It's targeted to a baby boomer population, which is growing and underserved in this space and we think that all the new entries are going for a much younger population. We saw this as very unique with a very unique person behind it who speaks to that group. Uniquely, the structure is unique in the marketplace, but not for us. It's very similar to the deal that we did with A-Shoc where we put a relatively modest seed investment upfront. We help them with this business, although this business won\u2019t initially go through our DSD network. It will go through warehouse direct and as it proves itself out, we will put it in our DSD network where it's appropriate. And it's got a pre-negotiated path to ownership. So we have the option to buy it at a point in time in the future if we choose at a multiple that makes sense. And so, it's the combination of all of those things that has us excited. And as we said, when we did the A-Shoc deal, we would like to do more of these. We see this as again, part of this ecosystem that we've created. We can create these win-win structures, help entrepreneurs and startup companies get up and running, and buy an option on them for the future and get rewarded for the help that we\u2019re able to provide to make them successful, so more to come on that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, perfect thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nRobert Gamgort: Hey Kevin.\nKevin Grundy: Hey, good morning Bob, and congrats on a great first half year so far.\nRobert Gamgort: Thank you.\nKevin Grundy: Yes, so Bob question on M&A, which is going to become an increasingly, I think for investors a bigger part of the story, particularly as we sort of look at to next year. Can you talk a little bit about the M&A philosophy, maybe share some of the governors around areas of interest fully understanding you don't want to front run anything that you're potentially looking at or looking out, we totally get that. But maybe put some governors around where the Board and where you're going to be looking? And maybe even just comment, there's some increasing discussion about another company in the beverage space looking in non-alcohol that is looking in the hard seltzer category. Maybe you can comment on the company's openness to moving outside of non-alcohol as well and that will do it from me? Thanks.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, we look at whitespace in our portfolio, and we could define whitespace very broadly. And again, I don't want to tip our hand in any way on that front. But just like you heard us talk about energy in the past with A-Shoc we just talked about, Don't Quit! in protein, I'm just using those examples, although they're relatively small at this point, that we're very clear as to where we have whitespace in our portfolio. And I think we're very creative in thinking through, how do we access that whitespace in a way, that's a win-win, meaning we don't want to just be a distributor, we've said that multiple times. And so, when you look at the arrangement that we have with Evian, which was a space that we couldn't access on our own, and then you look at the deal that we announced today on Polar which is very significant because it's big category, rapid growth, whitespace, we could try to invent it ourselves. We could try to acquire somebody in that space. But look Polar is a family-owned business. It\u2019s a great brand and it's not for sale. And to be able to sit down with them who we've had a long and successful relationship with and come up with this win-win scenario, says that we can move forward in these spaces without having to necessarily buy something outright and we get all the benefits from it. And then if you take a look at Polar they get the benefits of maintaining ownership of the brand and experiencing now what will be a national brand for them. And with regard to specifically M&A, just a couple more things that we've talked about before that I would emphasize. We are very wary of acquisitions of highly developed businesses or rapidly growing businesses that have reached thresholds that are at very high multiples. We've said this before. We've studied every one of these. We cannot find one that has created value in the industry. It's happened within our own house right? We've talked about it and our Bai, it's good learning for the future. We love the brand, but the multiples don't make sense. And so, we are not going to fall into that trap. And so, we look at the possibility of filling our whitespace through the arrangements that we talked about earlier, which are seed investments, long-term partnerships, franchise agreements. We also look at M&A, but I will tell you what's off the table is going out there and making a very large acquisition a huge multiple because those values always get written down in the future.\nKevin Grundy: Got it, thanks for the color, good luck.\nRobert Gamgort: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with JPMorgan.\nPeter Grom: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nRobert Gamgort: Hi Peter.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Good morning.\nPeter Grom: So just a couple questions on that sales guidance. So first maybe a bit more of housekeeping, but could you maybe break out what we should expect in terms of the benefits from McAfee, but also burn in the back half? And then second, I know the environment continues to evolve, but as you mentioned Q2 is hopefully going to be the most difficult, but so to the extent that you are willing to share kind of what are the underlying assumptions embedded in the guidance for the back half from an operating standpoint? Do you expect a continued reopening sequentially, is it kind of based on where we are now, just anything around that topic would be helpful? Thanks.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, with regard to McAfee, that was announced in the beginning of the year. So that was always part of our 2020 guidance. And I would say that everything is on track there so no new news. So that's embedded in the guidance. Polar is something that will be up and going, but it's really a benefit towards 2021 rather than 2020. Both McAfee as well as Polar, there are investments that are required in the first six months to a year. So there's almost no profit impact on either of those, and again, we've said that before on McAfee. So I look at those as much more of 2021 impact. And the story that that comes out of that is, we are managing our way through the COVID crisis really well, and holding on the guidance. And we're doing that with what we have in hand, but we're continuing to invest in innovation and new partnerships. And we talked about a lot of innovation today, as well as these new partnerships, which really set us up for continued growth. This is not a short-term phenomena, this is something that we will invest in over the long-term. Your question about back half the year is a really important one, because we're one of the few companies that has provided guidance. And we do not think for a second that we can predict the future better than anyone else. And if you look at the Fed\u2019s comments yesterday and they have better access to the economy than we do in terms of the data, they put a lot of caution out there on the second half. So I think, the important thing for you to take away from this is that we're not operating off of a single point forecast. We tested our second half plans against a number of macro scenarios and despite the fact that we think it's going to be bumpy and volatile, we feel like with that, that testing that we've been able to put out there that we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver really strong revenue and EPS growth. So it's not just a matter of holding on to guidance, I'd like to point out to people, its guidance for 13% to 15% EPS growth and 3% to 4% revenue growth for the year, in a year that is unprecedented in terms of its challenges. It's because we're working against a range and not a single point.\nPeter Grom: That's very helpful. Thank you, best of luck.\nRobert Gamgort: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen.\nVivien Azer: Hi, thank you, good morning.\nRobert Gamgort: Good morning.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Good morning.\nVivien Azer: Good morning. I was hoping if you could expand a little bit on your outlook for Polar in the sparkling water category more broadly? It's certainly been outperforming Stillwater pretty considerably for a couple of years, more than a couple of years now. So, where do you see the share today, where do you see it going forward and are there any international benchmarks that you're using to inform that thinking? Thank you.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes I don't \u2013 unfortunately in this category, there's not an international benchmark that's very helpful. I think what you're seeing is that people love carbonated soft drinks, I'll put that in the broadest category, people like bubbles, and there are full calorie versions of them. There are low or no calorie versions of them using a variety of sweeteners and then there are unsweetened flavor varieties in there. And we're seeing growth right now across all of them. But the area that's really emerged in recent years and continues to be strong through the crisis has been this unflavored \u2013 I mean excuse me, unsweetened flavored sparkling water and I don't see any signs of that slowing down because it's representative of a shift in consumer preferences towards healthier, but also just less flavor, less sweetness in general and we see that in a number of categories. I don't know how high is high, but again, when you're looking at the growth rates, Polar in the past six months grew at like 25%. You're seeing explosive growth and we, as I said before, could have come at this just by an acquisition, we could have come at it by trying to develop our own brand and we thought this was the best way to go. This is the highest velocity brand in the category. They have one challenge, and that is they're only in about a third of the country. We can help them with that challenge. And so, we think taking that brand in partnership with them and making it national is the best way for us to leapfrog in this category and end up in a leadership position. And I would also point out that we've got some other smaller positions in this category, Canada Dry and Schweppes are in there. Canada Dry by the way in the Northeast quarter is a very strong brand in unsweetened flavored sparkling water. But we really are emphasizing Canada Dry in its Ginger Ale credentials. And you see that it has had 13 years of growth, with a lot of innovation behind it. And so, that's always going to be the focus on Canada Dry. We're not going to pivot that to a sparkling water brand. And we made an acquisition last year that we didn't talk a lot about of Limitless, which is more of a functional, sparkling water and I would just say more to come on that one. We haven't really put our game plan in play on that and we'll be happy to share that with you in the future. And we think that like many large and growing categories, the best way to access them is through multiple plays. But be clear, the Polar play is our lead one and we couldn't be more excited to partner with the fastest selling brand in that category.\nVivien Azer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Sean King with UBS.\nSean King: Hi, good morning.\nRobert Gamgort: Hi Sean.\nSean King: A question for you on the, it\u2019s a strong brewer number, is there any kind of color you can provide on the cadence of that through the quarter, like by month? And could that number have actually been higher given the closure of a lot of the traditional retail channels in the quarter?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, very good question. That has been strong and steady with no signs of slowing throughout the quarter. So it's not an issue like we saw in some of the other categories like fountain and foodservice where it was incredibly weak in April, and we saw a recovery by July. This has been strong from the start and persistently strong, we're happy to report. In terms of your point, which is very true, which is a lot of the traditional brick and mortar retailers were impaired. We saw a very significant shift to e-commerce during the quarter. And that's a combination of traditional e-commerce players. The brick and mortar retailers that you refer to some of them did a fantastic job of pivoting to e-com. And then of course, we have Keurig.com and in the case of our e-commerce capabilities, which I would point out again, e-commerce now represents more than 10% of our total company retail sales. We have such strong capabilities there that we were able to step in and actually fulfill shipments for e-commerce retailers who weren't able to catch up with demand. So think about the pressure they were under in the early parts of this crisis. Our brewer sales could have been higher in the early stages if they were able to fulfill. So we actually stepped in, and in a large number of cases fulfilled on their behalf and were able to satisfy the consumer demand that that was there and continues to be there. And the last point I'd make on this is, nobody knew what Mother's Day was going to be like, it's one of those classic holidays and where we think do we play in this one. We had a very strong Mother's Day. It was an e-commerce shift. People shifted towards things that they could get through e-com and also that were predictable, reliable, they knew that they were safe in terms of people would like them. And also there was a real shift towards more functional gifting. I think you're going to see the same thing at Christmas. Whenever there's a situation like this and people are also feeling financial stress, they tend to move away from gifting that's more extravagant to that which is more known and functional and the fact that we're going to be out there with a full lineup of brewer, our best lineup we ever had and some really good innovation on top of it, is the reason why I said in my comments that retail or receptivity around our innovation pipeline and total lineup for Q3, Q4 has been remarkably strong.\nSean King: Great, thanks of the color. Best of luck.\nRobert Gamgort: All right, thank you.\nOperator: I'll now turn the call back over to management.\nSteve Alexander: Thank you very much. This is Steve. They are teams around all day. If you have any questions, please reach out to us and we'll follow up with you. Thanks so much for joining today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining in. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ozan Dokmecioglu",
            "content": "Thanks Bob, and good morning everyone. I will briefly review our performance for the second quarter, which our press release provides in significant detail. The second quarter was another good one for us. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2.9%. This growth in three of our four segments. Packaged beverages and coffee systems were particularly strong in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 11.1% in the quarter, driven by revenue growth, productivity and merger synergies, as well as a significant reduction in discretionary spending. As Bob noted, we believe that we have struck the right balance of continuing to invest in areas such as innovation, technology, and sustainability that provide competitive advantage, funded in part by reduced marketing, giving the low return on investments in the quarter, and dramatically lower travel and entertaining expenses, given the limitations in travel. These drivers were partially offset by negative segment mix, inflation, higher operating costs associated with increased consumer demands, and certain costs related to COVID-19 that were not treated as items affecting comparability.  Let me pause here for a moment to discuss these COVID-19 costs. In the second quarter pre-tax operating expenses directly related to COVID-19 totaled $75 million. Of these, $63 million were recognized as items affecting comparability and consistent of temporary and unusual compensation increases, and incentives for frontline employees, as well as incremental safety and sanitation expenses across our business. The balance of the COVID-19 related costs in the quarter, which totaled $12 million consisted of inventory write-downs, and bad debt expense, and have not been treated as items affecting comparability. Therefore, they are included in our adjusted results. Adjusted diluted EPS advanced 10% in the quarter, sealed by the growth in adjusted operating income and an increase in non-operating income in the quarter. These growth drivers were partially offset by increased interest expense due to lapping the benefits of an interest rate swap in the year ago period, and the higher the effective tax rate due to lapping favorable discrete tax items in the year ago period. Turning to our segment performance for the quarter. In coffee systems, constant currency net sales growth of 5.8% was driven by strong volume mix growth of 8.3%, partially offset by lower net pricing of 2.5%. The volume mix performance reflected higher purchases of K-Cup pots and brewers for at-home consumption, partially offset by a significant drop off in the office coffee and hospitality businesses. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 10% in the quarter to $363 million. In Packaged Beverages constant currency net sales grew 6.3% due to strong volume mix growth of 6.6%, partially offset by modestly lower pricing of 0.3%. This performance reflected increased at-home consumption and market share growth, due to strong in-market execution, enabled by excellent supply chain management and exceptional collaboration across our front line teams during the crisis. This growth was partially offset by a decline in the convenience and gas channels due to limited consumer mobility. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 41.6% in the quarter to $269 million. In Beverage Concentrates constant currency net sales declined 16.2% due to a significant drop off in the fountain and foodservice business, which serves restaurants and hospitality and lower net price realization of 4.8%. The lower pricing related annual adjustments to prior year customer incentives, partially offset by customer concentrate pricing, that we took in January. Importantly, as the second quarter progressed, we saw improving month-over-month trends in this business, and those trends have continued into July. Constant currency adjusted operating income decreased 9.3% in the quarter to $222 million. And finally, in Latin America Beverages constant currency net sales grew 1.4%, reflecting the strong pricing of 63%, partially offset by lower volume mix of 4.7% due to limited consumer mobility in Mexico. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 30% to $23 million in the quarter, due to continued productivity and lower marketing expense. While the current environment has proven the power of our brands, it has also made evident the importance of simplification. To meet heightened demand and drive efficiency during the crisis, we focused our production and delivery on the highest priority products with great success. Through this process, we had performed a detailed review of the offerings in our system to ensure we deliver on our customers' needs, while ensuring we were efficient. We will continue to focus on this as a best practice coming out of this crisis and going forward. In terms of our ongoing productivity and merger synergies, we continue to execute on these opportunities accretively. In the current environment, we are delaying certain planned value capture projects, due to COVID-19 related safety concerns, and in other cases, we are accelerating certain projects to offset delays. We remain committed to delivering our value capture commitments through both productivity and merger synergies, and fully expect to deliver our planned merger synergies of $600 million by the end of 2021. Now moving to cash flow and liquidity. Free cash flow in the quarter was strong at $524 million translating into an adjusted free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 112%. In the quarter, we reduced bank debt by $274 million, and structured payables by $78 million, and we end of the quarter with almost $160 million of unrestricted cash on hand. In terms of leverage, our bank debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which we refer to as our management leverage ratio, improved to 4 times, compared to 4.5 times at the end of 2019. This improvement was driven by continued reductions in outstanding debt balances and continued growth in adjusted EBITDA. Since the merger close, we have reduced our leverage ratio by two full terms. Turning now to CapEx. We continue to support the business with necessary CapEx investment, but some projects will be delayed, primarily due to COVID-19. For example, our new Spartanburg pot production facility is delayed approximately six months, resulting from equipment supplier delays and our new cold beverages facility in Allentown is also delayed about three months for similar reasons. We have always expected both of these facilities to primarily [ph] be contributors to our business in 2021. And these minor delays do not significantly change our expectations, which brings us to our guidance. In terms of full year, we continue to have confidence in our ability to manage through what is likely to be a bumpy road in the second half, much as we have done to date. Our outlook for adjusted diluted EPS growth remains unchanged at 13%, to 15%. This outlook reflects our expectation for constant currency net sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%, continued strong management of discretionary costs across the business, while maintaining investment in innovation, technology, and sustainability. Expected higher marketing investment in the second half of the year, relative to the second quarter, giving the expectation for an environment in which consumer receptivity to marketing and marketing return on investment improves. It is Important to note that if we experience accelerating growth in our categories in the second half, we would likely increase our brand investment to drive mid-to-long-term growth, while still delivering our adjusted EPS guidance for 2020. We also have confidence in our deleveraging targets and continue to expect our management leverage ratio to be between 3.5 times and 3.8 times at the end of the year. Good morning. Good morning. No, I mean, actually, you covered all the points. I mean, there is always a gap and lag between our shipments to our distributors and the bottlers and their shipments to the retailers and as Bob said, always and always within a timeframe catches up. Well, I mean, maybe I can use this opportunity to expand a little bit on the FX as well. And as you have heard in our prepared remarks, first of all the costs were excluded from adjusted results are unique and temporary impacts resulting from the crisis. So they are not normal, ongoing cost of business. And this is consistent with our long-term standing treatment of extraordinary and one-time costs. So I mean, these costs are clearly are not only defined as the significant expenses to provide temporary financial incentives to frontline employees, which represented more than 70% of the cost and the balance for the extraordinary measures that we undertook to protect employee health and safety, including obvious enhanced benefits for them and their families. And we also said there were a portion, approximately $12 million of COVID related expenses that we did not add back and we kept in our adjusted results. Therefore, first and foremost, the health and well being safety of our employees come as number one. Therefore, depending on the crisis, and depending on how the pandemic is going to evolve, we will adjust our programs accordingly. Having said that, we also believe quarter two was the highest, in terms of us incurring the COVID expenses. Obviously, time is going to show us what will be the reality, but that's our expectations at this point in time. Good morning. Good morning."

            "name": "Robert Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve and good morning everyone. Let me start by expressing my sincere hope that everyone dialed in continues to be safe and healthy, and that your families are well. At KDP we have worked extraordinarily hard since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis to protect the health and safety of our employees, particularly those front line employees in our supply chain and out in the trade who play an essential role in ensuring our products are available for our consumers, customers and communities that rely on them. The results we've reported this morning are a testament to the dedication and commitment of our team, and I can't thank KDP employees enough for all that they are doing day in and day out. As you know, the environment in which we are operating continues to be extremely volatile with covert cases spiking again forcing some regions into a second phase of shutdown, all of which impacts consumer mobility and beverage consumption behavior. TDP was performing exceptionally well before the crisis. We delivered well for all stakeholders during the crisis as evidenced by the results we're discussing today, and we fully expect to emerge as an even stronger company when we get to the other side. Until there is a widely available vaccine or treatment, we believe the macro environment will be bumpy and uncertain, requiring us to continue to be focused, flexible and responsive. Two years ago this month we completed the merger that created Keurig Dr Pepper, which at that time we described as the new challenger in the beverage industry. With the integration complete, we believe we have created a modern beverage company, with a broad reaching portfolio of hot and cold beverages delivered by a diversified route to market network that provides unmatched reach and efficiency, and with highly unique ecosystems in our coffee business and DSD network that leverage partnerships and technology to create value. Equally important, we have built a culture that emphasizes excellence in execution and delivery. The covert crisis is by no means a windfall for TDP. We have been required to focus resources on the areas of our business that are aligned with changing consumer trends, such as at-home coffee, multipack cold beverages, large-format retail, and e-commerce to offset significant weakness in away from home coffee, on premise beverage consumption and convenience stores. The impact of these mixed changes on margin are significant, which has required us to deliver volume and revenue growth while tightly controlling the cost side of our P&L, and still investing in our future. Our executional capabilities have certainly been tested by the crisis and we're proud of how we've performed to date. In the two years since the merger, we have exceeded our merger commitments for net sales growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15% to 17%. In fact, in the eight quarters since our merger close, adjusted diluted EPS has grown at an average annual rate of 20%. In the second quarter, which we believe will be the most challenging environment we face this year, constant currency net sales advanced nearly 3%. Constant currency adjusted operating income grew 11%, and adjusted diluted EPS was up 10%. Further, we have reduced our management leverage ratio to 4x as compared to the 6x ratio at the time of the merger. Ozan will take you through a more detailed review of our financial results by segment in a few minutes. To bring the concept of a modern beverage company to life, let me use several performance highlights from the latest quarter. The strength of our differentiated portfolio is unprecedented. We were the first company to combine hot and cold beverages at scale, including leading positions in single serve coffee, flavored CSDs, premium water, juices and mixers. Our core portfolio was very strong in the quarter as we gain market share of total liquid refreshment beverages with gains in the majority of the categories segments in which we compete. Specifically in CSDs we gained 1.2 share points and moved to the #2 CSD player in a number of key grocery customers, driven by broad-based core brand strength, strong in market execution and innovations such as Dr Pepper & Cream Soda and Canada Dry Bold. In fact, Dr Pepper & Cream Soda is the best performing innovation in the CSD category so far this year. The Dr Pepper brand has now delivered 17 consecutive quarters of growth at retail, while Canada Dry has done the same for 13 consecutive years. What's important for our longer-term outlook however, is the fact that our sheer [ph] mention of CSDs has been heavily driven by a double-digit increase in new households purchasing many of our brands. And we confident that we will be able to retain a portion of the these new households once we emerge from this crisis. In the hot portfolio, we have a commanding leadership position of single serve coffee with a combination of owned, licensed and partner brands and the Keurig brand is ranked by consumers as one of the most relevant brands in the country, not just in CPG, but among all brands. In the second quarter, our coffee systems segment grew pod volume 9.5% and brewer volume 11.6% and that's on top of 19% growth in the year ago period, primarily reflecting new households entering the system. These results reflect significant growth in coffee consumption at home, partially offset by the away from home channel, particularly our large office coffee business and to a lesser extent our hospitality business, which were down significantly in the quarter. Our share of K-Cup Pods manufactured by KDP held steady at 82% and retail pricing for the category increased by 2%, as promotional activity lessened and mix shifted towards premium brands. Further, share trends for our portfolio of owned and license brands also improved. We've previously discussed our seven distinct routes to market at some length and today I think it is relevant to highlight DSD and e-commerce, using examples of their contributions in the second quarter to also illustrate our long-term strategy. Our DSD network has served us very well during this crisis by enabling the highest levels of flexibility, speed and delivery. We have been able to pivot on a granular basis at both the products skew and local marketplace level to react to changes in demand, using near real-time data that's simply not available in other distribution systems. We see opportunity to continue to invest to improve our DSD system and look forward to sharing more with you on this topic in the future. As you've seen across many categories, e-commerce has been the real star this year. The COVID crisis has accelerated consumer adoption of e-commerce for food and beverage and we see no evidence of this trend slowing when the crisis abates. If you recall at the time of the merger, we emphasized Keurig's first mover advantage in this space. Dating back to the launch of keurig.com 16 years ago and how we plan to leverage that competency across our full portfolio. Today, we believe we are the leader in e-commerce in food and beverage if not FMCG. E-commerce now represents more than 10% of KDP total retail sales and it continues to expand rapidly. While our online business is weighted towards brewers and K-Cup Pods, we also have a strong presence on the cold side, especially with Bai, CORE, Mott's and Dr Pepper. Upfront, I mentioned the concept of ecosystems in our DSD and coffee business. Let me explain that important concept further demonstrated power in the most recent quarter and for the future and announced several exciting developments. Our DSD networks which gives us national reach and the ability to be in retail on a daily basis is an attractive asset to startup or expanding beverage companies. While we have stated that we have no interest in renting our system as a distributor, we are willing to partner with beverage brands that fill whitespace in our portfolio through a range of structures. Recent examples include our long-term partnership with Danone for the Evian brand, our investment with a path to ownership in A-Shoc Smart Energy, and our licensing agreement with Peet's Coffee for ready-to-drink beverages. This morning we announced a long-term franchise agreement with Polar Beverages for their Polar Seltzer brand. Polar Seltzer is the third-largest branded flavored sparkling water in the U.S. despite being available in less than 35% of the country. The brand is also the highest velocity sparkling water where distributed. We currently have a long-standing and successful franchise agreement with Polar Beverages to distribute key KDP brands throughout their network in New England. And we are excited to announce a similar arrangement for their flagship brand to be in our system and expanded geographies. We look forward to rapidly scaling Polar to national distribution. We've also made a seed investment with a path to ownership in Don't Quit!, a clean label meal replacement protein drink line created by Jake Steinfeld of Body by Jake. You'll hear more about this partnership and Don't Quit!, as the brand launches in a couple of weeks. Our coffee ecosystem is built on innovation, technology and partnership. While common in the technology space, this structure doesn't exist anywhere else in CPG. That means, when a consumer makes the conversion from brewing coffee by the pot, to coffee by the cup, our brand of partners, our retail partners, and we, all benefit, which puts us all on the same page with regard to ensuring the Keurig ecosystem remains healthy and growing. In March we were scheduled to unveil our Keurig innovation pipeline and latest growth strategy during an investor meeting in Texas. While COVID required that meeting to be cancelled, and the conversation since then has been dominated by the crisis, we have maintained internal focus on progressing our pipeline for launches in the third and fourth quarters, and strengthening the Keurig ecosystem to the benefit of all stakeholders. Our lineup of K-Duo Brewers launched in late 2019 performed exceptionally well in the quarter and our K-Slim Brewer introduced earlier this year is off to a good start. In August we are launching the K-Supreme and K-Supreme Plus, filling out product range at the mid-to-higher end of our portfolio. These new brewers price from $139 to $189 feature our new industrial design and most importantly, are the first of our next generation of brewers to include multi-stream technology, which increases coffee extraction by using a new five pronged needle system to deliver a more flavorful and aromatic cup. These brewers also offer greater consumer truck control [ph] over strength, and temperature. We intend to cascade this technology to more of our brewer lineup over time. Additionally, in the third quarter, we are introducing a limited edition K-Mini brewer created by the renowned home furnishings designer Jonathan Adler. This brewer represents the first step into a new platform for Keurig, with limited edition and/or custom design brewers, targeting consumers who are attracted by kitchen style and aesthetics. Look for more to come on this topic in the near future. Retailer interest for these new brewers and across the entire Keurig Brewer lineup for their upcoming holiday season is strong, and follows a very successful Mother's Day, which experienced a noticeable e-commerce retail shift. In our last earnings call, we discussed how we were using real-time points of consumption data through our Keurig connected panel of 10,000 households to guide our decisions during the crisis. Harnessing what is one of a kind technology in CPG, we've been able to navigate the volatility caused by COVID, making near real time decisions to drive strong in-market execution. We also make connected panel data available to all Keurig partners. Today I'm pleased to report that our first smart brewer will be available for sale to consumers on keurig.com between now and our next earnings call. The K-Custom Smart will deliver our most personalized flavorful coffee experience ever, powered by our smartest technology. This brewer represents the next step toward having connected and intelligent brewers across our line. The K-Custom Smart is compatible with existing K-Cup Pods, and has the capability to recognize the specific brand, variety and roast for any owned, license or partner brand made by Keurig and brew to the specification of its master roaster to bring out the full flavor.  The K-Custom Smart can be controlled from a smartphone, set to turn on with your morning alarm and brew your favorite cup of coffee from bed. It can also be customized through consumers' favorite temperature and brew preferences, and can automatically reorder pods, having tracked how many the consumer has brewed since their last order. More specifics will be available in the press release at the time of its official launch.  Finally, earlier this month, we began selling McCafe\u0301 as a Keurig licensed brand in the U.S., across K-Cup Pods, bags and canisters, further emphasizing our ability to create win-win partnerships across the portfolio. We look forward to working with McDonald's to drive growth for the brand in the U.S., as we've done in our partnership with McCafe\u0301 in Canada, which began earlier this year. Before I turn it over to Ozan, I want to mention three important points regarding sustainability. Again, while most of our conversation over the past four months has focused on the COVID crisis, we've also continued our progress toward delivering our sustainability commitments. First, we are fully on track to convert 100% of our K-Cup Pods, to be recyclable by year end. As of today, approximately 95% of the K-Cup Pods being produced are recyclable. Second, in the next quarter, we are targeting to introduce our first PET bottles made with 100% Post Consumer Resin. As you'll recall, we are committed to using 30% post consumer recycled material by the end of 2025, and this is an important first step toward realizing that goal. We also recently announced our founding sponsorship and position as the largest funder of the Recycling Partnerships Polypropylene Coalition. This industry collaboration is designed to increase and improve the recovery and recycling of polypropylene, the plastic used in K-Cup Pods, and many other food and consumer products. We have already begun using Post Consumer Resin in the production of our Keurig brewers. Finally we have received the good news that our Spartanburg, South Carolina production facility for K-Cup Pods will be LEED certified, making it the largest LEED certified production facility in North America, and the second largest LEED facility of any kind. With that, let me hand it over Ozon. Hi, Bonnie. Yes, sure, Bonnie it is a great question, something we think about a lot. I think if we step back at 100,000 feet, and then I'll drill down deeper into your points. We look at - there are companies that fall into roughly three buckets. There were those that may not have been done doing well prior to the pandemic and they're doing really well during the pandemic because suddenly something was off trend became on trend. And it would cause you to say, well what's going to happen when things turn to normal, which is where you're going. There's another set of companies that were doing really well prior to and are struggling in this environment. And in that case, you kind of have to hope for a return to a future that looks a lot like the past. We're in a very unique situation here, and I think there are very few companies in this situation. That is, we were performing very, very well prior to the crisis. So we said a number of times, we don't see this at all as a windfall for us. We've been able to perform very well since the crisis, but we've had to work really hard to do that. And I think you'll see from the comments that we made earlier, that it is quite a mixed management exercise, we've had to push some areas of our business really hard. But I'll remind you, there are areas of our business that are large and profitable, that have taken a significant hit in this crisis that we've had to offset. And if things were to return more to normal, we'll get the bounce back on those immediately. But we don't expect into the future, we don't expect it to continue the way it is indefinitely, but we also don't think that the future is going to look exactly like the past. And so, we have the tools and the levers to pull, to be able to create a company that does even better in the future. And that's reflective of all of the innovation that we're continuing to invest in, and we're continuing to launch. And we're getting great retailer receptivity on all of that as well, because they're bullish about that future as well. So we're confident where we are and we continue to be confident in how we will deliver to the end of the year, as we talked about in our guidance and our commentary, but we're not planning on a future that returns back to normal. If it did, it would actually be good for us. We're planning on a future that's going to look quite different and we're navigating the company to be even stronger and stay ahead of the game. Okay, thank you. Hi Bill. Yes, and remember, we have really good insight into this internally, because we have this household panel of 10,000 homes. We can see minute-by-minute consumption. And so we've been able to track the attachment rate change from the very beginning of the crisis. And we don't, we haven't talked about attachment rate in the past because as we said, when you guys have tried to model that, it's really steady. So the whole game is really about household penetration. And we've also said that volume growth in the category is a good proxy for household penetration because attachment rate is even. We're getting two benefits right now. We're getting new people coming into the system and to answer your question that sticks. And we've seen that for years now that when somebody decides to move from brewing coffee by the pot to brewing coffee by the cup, or in the case that we have right now, people who weren't making coffee at home, making it at home now using a Keurig machine, that's incredibly sticky with a dropout rate from the system is very, very low. The attachment rate, as we look forward, our belief is we'll capture some of that increased attachment rate going forward because people who weren't making coffee at home or were making it at a lower frequency, recognize that A, it's easy to do, that the quality has improved dramatically over the past couple of years. So for those that had a perception of quality, they're now getting a firsthand experience that the quality is better. And you heard from our innovation pipeline that will continue to go up. And I think the third part is, significant cost benefit to making coffee at home. And I think a lot of people, if you look at the research that we do, but also social media and articles that are written there are lot of people saying, I really like this, this is easier than I thought and I'm saving a lot of money on top of it. So we don't model going forward that we're going to keep all of that attachment rate, but we know we'll keep some of it. But the household penetration gains, we're very confident we keep the great, great majority of that. Yes, I'll talk about both of them. The cold side of business no, we're seeing actually pricing on average up as promotion is less and we're seeing no move away from brands to private label. In fact, in many cases, you're seeing that the larger brands benefit. And clearly, we've benefited significantly from a share of total liquid refreshment beverage and then we gained as I said, in the prepared remarks, 1.2 share points in CSD. So the brands and our brands in particular are doing very well in this environment. On the coffee side of the business, you're actually seeing a skew towards more premium brands in this environment. And I believe that's because as people trade off from making or purchasing coffee outside of the home to making it at home, they want to take their brands with them and the coffee shop brands that they can get now in our system, are skewed towards the premium end, so that's very bullish. And the other point that is worth emphasizing is that the cost of pods today in general, whether it's at the premium mid price or the value or entry level price point, are all down significantly versus where they were three, four or five years ago and that's intentional. That was part of our strategy that we talked about. We set off with the ambition of lowering the price of pods to increase household penetration and attachment rate and that's exactly what we're seeing. So I would have thought actually that given the some of the financial strain, you might see some trade down, which I would emphasize, we're okay with because we produce the great majority of private label as well, but we're actually seeing the reverse right now. And although I can't predict anything in the future, it makes sense to me with the change in behavior from out of home to in-home. Okay, thanks Bill. Hi, Pete. Yes, let me start it and then Ozan feel free to jump in at the end if you have something you want to add to this. The BC areas where you see the fountain and food service business, that's servicing restaurants, and clearly that's been impaired, but it's improved throughout the quarter. And so, I think that the gap that you're talking about between shipments sometimes and concentrate shipments and bottle or case sales, that happens from quarter-to-quarter. So there's always a catch up. But we are seeing great improvement in the FFF business throughout the quarter due to rebound in restaurants. And I'd emphasize that we're particularly strong in QSRs. And in fact, we are the - Dr Pepper brand is the number one most available CSD in QSRs. And so, as the drive-thru business seems to be improving, in particular, that's very bullish for us going forward. But you're seeing in the BC segment, the hit that came from restaurants shutting down, especially in the early part of the quarter. Ozan, anything to add to BC? Good morning. Yes, so we have just given you a teaser on that today and there will be appropriate press release from them, because we're investing in this business in the next couple of weeks, because it's already teed up to go for sale in August. It's going to be available on - right now it's about 2,500 retail outlets and growing traditional retailers, as you might imagine, as well as ecommerce. What's exciting for us? Big whitespace in our portfolio, protein drinks. We don't want to launch a me too protein drink out there and so this one we think is highly unique. It's targeted to a baby boomer population, which is growing and underserved in this space and we think that all the new entries are going for a much younger population. We saw this as very unique with a very unique person behind it who speaks to that group. Uniquely, the structure is unique in the marketplace, but not for us. It's very similar to the deal that we did with A-Shoc where we put a relatively modest seed investment upfront. We help them with this business, although this business won't initially go through our DSD network. It will go through warehouse direct and as it proves itself out, we will put it in our DSD network where it's appropriate. And it's got a pre-negotiated path to ownership. So we have the option to buy it at a point in time in the future if we choose at a multiple that makes sense. And so, it's the combination of all of those things that has us excited. And as we said, when we did the A-Shoc deal, we would like to do more of these. We see this as again, part of this ecosystem that we've created. We can create these win-win structures, help entrepreneurs and startup companies get up and running, and buy an option on them for the future and get rewarded for the help that we're able to provide to make them successful, so more to come on that. Hey Kevin. Thank you. Yes, we look at whitespace in our portfolio, and we could define whitespace very broadly. And again, I don't want to tip our hand in any way on that front. But just like you heard us talk about energy in the past with A-Shoc we just talked about, Don't Quit! in protein, I'm just using those examples, although they're relatively small at this point, that we're very clear as to where we have whitespace in our portfolio. And I think we're very creative in thinking through, how do we access that whitespace in a way, that's a win-win, meaning we don't want to just be a distributor, we've said that multiple times. And so, when you look at the arrangement that we have with Evian, which was a space that we couldn't access on our own, and then you look at the deal that we announced today on Polar which is very significant because it's big category, rapid growth, whitespace, we could try to invent it ourselves. We could try to acquire somebody in that space. But look Polar is a family-owned business. It's a great brand and it's not for sale. And to be able to sit down with them who we've had a long and successful relationship with and come up with this win-win scenario, says that we can move forward in these spaces without having to necessarily buy something outright and we get all the benefits from it. And then if you take a look at Polar they get the benefits of maintaining ownership of the brand and experiencing now what will be a national brand for them. And with regard to specifically M&A, just a couple more things that we've talked about before that I would emphasize. We are very wary of acquisitions of highly developed businesses or rapidly growing businesses that have reached thresholds that are at very high multiples. We've said this before. We've studied every one of these. We cannot find one that has created value in the industry. It's happened within our own house right? We've talked about it and our Bai, it's good learning for the future. We love the brand, but the multiples don't make sense. And so, we are not going to fall into that trap. And so, we look at the possibility of filling our whitespace through the arrangements that we talked about earlier, which are seed investments, long-term partnerships, franchise agreements. We also look at M&A, but I will tell you what's off the table is going out there and making a very large acquisition a huge multiple because those values always get written down in the future. Okay. Thank you. Hi Peter. Yes, with regard to McAfee, that was announced in the beginning of the year. So that was always part of our 2020 guidance. And I would say that everything is on track there so no new news. So that's embedded in the guidance. Polar is something that will be up and going, but it's really a benefit towards 2021 rather than 2020. Both McAfee as well as Polar, there are investments that are required in the first six months to a year. So there's almost no profit impact on either of those, and again, we've said that before on McAfee. So I look at those as much more of 2021 impact. And the story that that comes out of that is, we are managing our way through the COVID crisis really well, and holding on the guidance. And we're doing that with what we have in hand, but we're continuing to invest in innovation and new partnerships. And we talked about a lot of innovation today, as well as these new partnerships, which really set us up for continued growth. This is not a short-term phenomena, this is something that we will invest in over the long-term. Your question about back half the year is a really important one, because we're one of the few companies that has provided guidance. And we do not think for a second that we can predict the future better than anyone else. And if you look at the Fed's comments yesterday and they have better access to the economy than we do in terms of the data, they put a lot of caution out there on the second half. So I think, the important thing for you to take away from this is that we're not operating off of a single point forecast. We tested our second half plans against a number of macro scenarios and despite the fact that we think it's going to be bumpy and volatile, we feel like with that, that testing that we've been able to put out there that we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver really strong revenue and EPS growth. So it's not just a matter of holding on to guidance, I'd like to point out to people, its guidance for 13% to 15% EPS growth and 3% to 4% revenue growth for the year, in a year that is unprecedented in terms of its challenges. It's because we're working against a range and not a single point. All right, thank you. Good morning. Yes I don't \u2013 unfortunately in this category, there's not an international benchmark that's very helpful. I think what you're seeing is that people love carbonated soft drinks, I'll put that in the broadest category, people like bubbles, and there are full calorie versions of them. There are low or no calorie versions of them using a variety of sweeteners and then there are unsweetened flavor varieties in there. And we're seeing growth right now across all of them. But the area that's really emerged in recent years and continues to be strong through the crisis has been this unflavored \u2013 I mean excuse me, unsweetened flavored sparkling water and I don't see any signs of that slowing down because it's representative of a shift in consumer preferences towards healthier, but also just less flavor, less sweetness in general and we see that in a number of categories. I don't know how high is high, but again, when you're looking at the growth rates, Polar in the past six months grew at like 25%. You're seeing explosive growth and we, as I said before, could have come at this just by an acquisition, we could have come at it by trying to develop our own brand and we thought this was the best way to go. This is the highest velocity brand in the category. They have one challenge, and that is they're only in about a third of the country. We can help them with that challenge. And so, we think taking that brand in partnership with them and making it national is the best way for us to leapfrog in this category and end up in a leadership position. And I would also point out that we've got some other smaller positions in this category, Canada Dry and Schweppes are in there. Canada Dry by the way in the Northeast quarter is a very strong brand in unsweetened flavored sparkling water. But we really are emphasizing Canada Dry in its Ginger Ale credentials. And you see that it has had 13 years of growth, with a lot of innovation behind it. And so, that's always going to be the focus on Canada Dry. We're not going to pivot that to a sparkling water brand. And we made an acquisition last year that we didn't talk a lot about of Limitless, which is more of a functional, sparkling water and I would just say more to come on that one. We haven't really put our game plan in play on that and we'll be happy to share that with you in the future. And we think that like many large and growing categories, the best way to access them is through multiple plays. But be clear, the Polar play is our lead one and we couldn't be more excited to partner with the fastest selling brand in that category. Hi Sean. Yes, very good question. That has been strong and steady with no signs of slowing throughout the quarter. So it's not an issue like we saw in some of the other categories like fountain and foodservice where it was incredibly weak in April, and we saw a recovery by July. This has been strong from the start and persistently strong, we're happy to report. In terms of your point, which is very true, which is a lot of the traditional brick and mortar retailers were impaired. We saw a very significant shift to e-commerce during the quarter. And that's a combination of traditional e-commerce players. The brick and mortar retailers that you refer to some of them did a fantastic job of pivoting to e-com. And then of course, we have Keurig.com and in the case of our e-commerce capabilities, which I would point out again, e-commerce now represents more than 10% of our total company retail sales. We have such strong capabilities there that we were able to step in and actually fulfill shipments for e-commerce retailers who weren't able to catch up with demand. So think about the pressure they were under in the early parts of this crisis. Our brewer sales could have been higher in the early stages if they were able to fulfill. So we actually stepped in, and in a large number of cases fulfilled on their behalf and were able to satisfy the consumer demand that that was there and continues to be there. And the last point I'd make on this is, nobody knew what Mother's Day was going to be like, it's one of those classic holidays and where we think do we play in this one. We had a very strong Mother's Day. It was an e-commerce shift. People shifted towards things that they could get through e-com and also that were predictable, reliable, they knew that they were safe in terms of people would like them. And also there was a real shift towards more functional gifting. I think you're going to see the same thing at Christmas. Whenever there's a situation like this and people are also feeling financial stress, they tend to move away from gifting that's more extravagant to that which is more known and functional and the fact that we're going to be out there with a full lineup of brewer, our best lineup we ever had and some really good innovation on top of it, is the reason why I said in my comments that retail or receptivity around our innovation pipeline and total lineup for Q3, Q4 has been remarkably strong. All right, thank you."

This conference call is being recorded and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Keurig Dr Pepper Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tyson Seely. Mr. Seely, please go ahead.\nTyson Seely: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier this afternoon, we issued our press releases for the first quarter of 2020. If you need a copy, you can get one on our website at keurigdrpepper.com in the Investor section. Consistent with previous quarters, today, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, excluding items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are included in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later this week. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company\u2019s control, we do not reconcile our guidance. Here with me today to discuss our first quarter 2020 results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. And finally, our discussion this afternoon may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of this Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Tyson. Let me start by expressing my sincere hope that everyone dialed in is safe and healthy, and I want to thank you all for joining us this afternoon. As you can see from our Q1 results, we started the year in a strong manner, with financial delivery very much in line with our long-term targets and with continued strong free cash flow and deleveraging. We expanded market share across the majority of our portfolio and believe that we were just getting started, as we began to introduce our best lineup of innovation yet. The continued underlying strength of our business is reflected in the results we reported today, as COVID-19 had only a modest impact on us in the first quarter. Ozan will take you through some of the relevant highlights from the first quarter that carry over into the full-year. But I want to acknowledge that Q1 represent a very different environment than the one we\u2019re operating in today. Therefore, I want to focus my comments on the second quarter and beyond, addressing a number of topics that I believe are most relevant to our investors at this moment. Specifically, we will discuss how consumer behavior has recently shifted and share our assumptions for how we believe that will evolve going forward, explain how those shifts have impacted our portfolio positively and negatively. We\u2019ll do this through the lens of both product categories and retail channels. Review the critical steps we\u2019ve taken to date to navigate this unusual situation, and how we\u2019re managing the business and channel mix to ensure continued success in the short-term and in the long-term. And finally, we\u2019ll provide a more granular view on financial expectations by segment for the next quarter and update you on our outlook for earnings, cash generation, and deleveraging for the full-year. KDP has a remarkably flexible and resilient business model, and our organization is executing very well in this unpredictable and challenging environment. We believe our discussion today will shed new light on how our original merger thesis, which delivered exceptional value in its first seven quarters, is more relevant now than ever. Before getting into that discussion, let me start by thanking our 26,000 employees for their extraordinary efforts that are enabling us to restock store shelves with essential products. I also want to thank the new front-line in North America from healthcare workers to logistics providers to employees at retail, who are out there everyday, helping us all through this difficult time. Early in the crisis, we refocused the organization under a new set of priorities called ONE KDP. The K represents keeping our employees safe and healthy, the D represents delivering for our customers and consumers, and the P stands for providing for our community. We could build this entire call with discussion of the wide ranging steps we have taken to protect our employees from increased sanitation, physical separation, new health screening, making our own hand sanitizers and masks when supplies got low and providing enhanced incentives to our front-line and increased benefits to all employees. Similarly, we could elaborate on our fueling the front-line initiative, which is providing Keurig commercial brewers and hot and cold beverages to hundreds of hospitals and tens of thousands of healthcare workers, who are working tirelessly to help those in their community. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about these and other programs, you can find details on our website. However, given that this is an earnings call, I\u2019m going to focus the remainder of this discussion on the D in ONE KDP, how we\u2019re delivering for our customers and consumers, as that drives our top line and mix. I will then turn it over to Ozan to review all the levers we have available to manage costs in order to drive strong profitability and cash flow. As the majority of the country began operating under stay-at-home restrictions in March, we saw immediate behavioral changes among consumers and continue to see what may be lasting shifts in what consumers are buying and where they are shopping. We\u2019re only about six weeks into this crisis, but we\u2019re gathering more and more insights as we progress. This is an incredibly complex and evolving landscape, which is best visualized as a matrix, with product categories on one axis and retail channels on the other. We are actively managing the intersections within that matrix between product categories and channel, prioritizing resources to deliver what consumers want, while focusing on the highest ROI opportunity and navigating the differential growth and profit mix impacts of each. We think about product categories as falling into one of three buckets: those that were purchased under an initial stock-up mindset, primarily in March, and are no longer growing, and in some cases, declining; those that continue to be purchased for ongoing in-home consumption, many of which are expandable in nature. There\u2019s potential for some of these categories to continue to grow at elevated levels post-crisis, as consumers find or rediscover a role for them in the new world. Finally, there are categories that aren\u2019t as relevant to consumers\u2019 current needs and have been negatively impacted by this crisis, some of which will return to the previous growth levels after the crisis abates, others that may not fully recover. Let\u2019s look at the recent IRi data to illustrate what we\u2019re talking about here. And remember, these data cover primarily in-home consumption and large C-stores. I\u2019ll discuss away-from-home channels and their impact on categories and mix in a few minutes. In the two weeks of March ending 3/22, which represents the early days of the crisis in North America, growth of total Liquid Refreshment Beverages, or LRB, spiked the 30.2%, with all categories growing above average as consumers prepared for an extended stay-at-home. If we dig in further into these data, we see that the real outsized performance during those weeks was driven by consumers stocking up on categories, such as mainstream water and sports drink. Since then, LRB has softened considerably, growing 5% in the latest four weeks and declining slightly in the latest week, as the one-time purchase of some of those same categories such as water and sports drinks are not being repeated. However, beneath the total performance of LRB, there are areas of ongoing strength, representing categories of products experiencing expandable consumption and ongoing replenishment, as I discussed earlier. For example, CSDs remained very strong, growing nearly 10% in the latest four-week, and categories like juices and mixers also continued to demonstrate strength. Not surprisingly, in-home coffee consumption has also been very strong due to the expansion of work from home and the inability to visit coffee shop, with single-serve coffee accelerating from 9% in the most recent 13-week to 21% in the latest four. The majority of our portfolio has exposure to the bucket of expandable consumption and ongoing replenishment, while the rest of our portfolio is exposed to one-time stock-up or off-trend category. We certainly have mix challenges to manage, as strength in our CSDs, juice, applesauce and mixers has been partially offset by softness in Bai and Snapple, which have been impacted by both weaker category trends nationally and the fact that they are highly developed in the Northeast region of the U.S., an area of very hard hit by the virus to date. Our focus has been to drive growth and opportunity category in order to offset the drag in others. Our single-serve coffee business is showing very strong growth and has the potential to enhance its relevance in consumers\u2019 lives well into the future. The IRi data indicate not only accelerating category growth, as I mentioned earlier, but also an increase in average retail price per pod. Yes, you\u2019ve heard that correctly. This is, in part, due to the growth in premium brand, which are outpacing that of value brands. It seems that when consumers are moving their away-from-home coffee consumption to in-home, they\u2019re also bringing their favorite coffee shop brands with them. Single-serve coffee category growth is being driven by a combination of the long-term trend of growing household penetration, combined with an increase in consumption per existing brewer, something we haven\u2019t seen before. We know this from our connected brewer path, a network of approximately 10,000 Internet-connected brewers that has been providing point of consumption data for three years. As we look to a future in which a recession seems to be a near certainty, we also see further opportunity for the Keurig system to expand, as consumers shift more of their coffee preparation in-home. A study completed by IRi over the last few weeks indicated that 27% of consumers are making coffee at home more often than before the crisis, and two-thirds say that behavior will continue, even when restrictions end. We also know that CSDs are remarkably resilient to a recession, and we have a wide range of pricing, pack size and promotion tactics to ensure our continued relevance should consumers become more value sensitive in the future. Let me turn from product categories to retail channel. To give you our perspective on the other side of the beverage industry matrix that I described upfront. Growth has been driven primarily by large retail outlets, namely grocery, club and mass, as consumers have increased stock-up occasion at the expense of impulse and fill-in occasion. As a result, e-commerce has exploded, while C-stores and small outlets have been weaker. Similar to the discussion of how we\u2019re managing mix across product categories, we\u2019re also actively managing mix across retail channels and customers. Our company-owned DSD system has performed remarkably well, enabling us to reach and restock growth customers, while our highly developed e-commerce capability has enabled growth across our full beverage portfolio in this increasingly important channel. Our supply chain has also pivoted significantly to provide the right formats and sizes to deliver on these growth opportunities, as well as securing raw materials and packaging to keep our products flowing. Not surprisingly, the most significant drag on our overall performance has been our fountain and foodservice business on the cold side and our office coffee business on the hot side. The impact of the crisis on restaurants has been well documented. And while the work from home trend has helped our at-home business, it has negatively impacted our office coffee business. All of the discussion to this point has been about the macro trends in the industry and our exposure to them through our portfolio and route to market coverage. However, the quality of execution determines our ultimate success. Effective mix management requires bold moves and a rapid and aligned decision-making. Industry players who were used to operating with predictable demand and relatively small fluctuations in volume are now required to manage a volatile mix of categories, moving at double-digit rate changes versus year ago, both positive and negative in order to land on a good outcome. Since the crisis, we have implemented a new management case with near daily executive team meetings and sales and operations planning meeting, enabling real-time decision and ensuring organizational focus on clear priorities. These efforts are paying off, as indicated by the latest IRi share data. We increased our share of total beverages over the past 13 and four weeks. Within total beverages, we have expanded our share of CSD significantly, growing 1.4 share points in the latest four weeks and we posted share gains in key categories, such as premium water, ready-to-drink tea, juice drinks, shelf stable juices and energy in the most recent period. In the coffee business, the share of pods manufactured by KDP has held steady at approximately 82% of dollars, as total growth accelerated. And we showed share gains in key owned and licensed brands, such as Green Mountain and The Original Donut Shop. With that clarity on revenue and mix, let me now turn it over to Ozan to pick up the story from here.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Since our press release provides significant detail on our performance, let me touch quickly on our results for the first quarter, before shifting to a discussion on some more relevant items, since the environment has changed significantly. At a high level, the first quarter was another very good one for us, reflecting the strength of the business throughout the quarter, as well as the small net benefit of COVID-19 in the final weeks of the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales increased 4.5%, with the growth from all four segments and particular strength in packaged beverages. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS growth of 16% in the quarter, fueled by the growth in adjusted operating income, a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense, due primarily to continued deleveraging. Free cash flow in the quarter was as strong at $464 million, translating into an adjusted free cash flow conversion rate of nearly 115%. We reduced bank debt by $42 million and repaid $107 million of structured payables, and we ended the quarter with almost $200 million of unrestricted cash on hand. In terms of leverage, our bank debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which we refer to as our management leverage ratio, improved to 4.2 times versus 4.5 times at the end of 2019. This improvement was driven by lower outstanding debt balances and continued growth in adjusted EBITDA, including the inclusion of certain permanent amortization expenses, which were not previously recognized in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. I would like to take a moment to provide more information on this change. As part of our detailed financial review with the strategic refinancing we recently completed, we determined that certain components of our reported amortization expense were not reflected in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. This represented approximately $170 million in the trailing 12 month. As a result, we have updated the calculation accordingly, starting in quarter one. The update drove approximately two-thirds of the change in our management leverage ratio. Let me be clear on two things. First, this change does not create a one-time impact, but rather it is permanent and affect all periods. Second, I have described before that we take a very conservative approach in calculating our management leverage ratio, and this change does not affect that expense at all. We still exclude many items that our bank loan covenants allow in the calculation, and this item that we are now including was merely an oversight. Let me now touch briefly on liquidity. As announced previously, we completed a strategic refinancing earlier this month that extended our debt maturities and enhanced our liquidity profile. The refinancing included the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior notes and the refinancing and the doubling of our $750 million, 364-day credit facility to $1.5 billion of borrowing capacity. This strategic refinancing provides additional liquidity to a level that we believe exceeds our potential needs, even in the event of a protracted downturn. Clearly, it was a stronger start to the year. But as both Bob and I have indicated, the environment today is entirely different than the one that we operated in for most of the first quarter. Therefore, let me talk about our priorities to continue to be competitive in the marketplace and protect profit and cash flow. There are four buckets to discuss. First, we are going to be competitive in the marketplace, ensuring we have the right products in the right places, so that we can continue to deliver the product consumers want and drive share gain, as we have across the majority of our categories in the most recent period. Clearly, this strategy is working for us based on the numbers Bob just walk you through. Second is top line discipline. As you would expect in times like this, we are prioritizing profitable business over chasing unprofitable volume growth in order to protect profit. While this may seem like an obvious concept, it takes discipline and is staying close to retailers and the consumer to understand what products to emphasize and which ones are not critical in the environment we are in. Third, beyond being smart on top line discipline, there are cost levers in the P&L that we are using to ensure bottom line delivery. For example, marketing investments. We have reviewed our marketing strategy and will continue to reduce spend in areas where it is not justified in the current consumer environment. As the reopening of the economy occurs, we will redeploy marketing resources, where we believe it is appropriate and where the return on investment is greater. Travel and entertainment and discretionary spending are two other costs levers that we are using. At this time, we have eliminated all discretionary spending and will assess these costs on a go-forward basis. Fourth and finally, is maximizing cash flow. CapEx is one of the most important areas of cash spend. We continue to support the business with necessary CapEx investment, but we expect some projects to be delayed. In some cases, these will be discretionary delays, because the project isn\u2019t a strategy or doesn\u2019t support growth. And in other cases, there are delays due to COVID-19 impact on suppliers and vendors. Given all of this, we have confidence in our target, which I will speak to momentarily. We have a unique business model with a broad portfolio of brands and seven distinct route to markets. Further, we continue to be heavily into our integration and synergy mode, which means we have deep understanding of our cost structure, which includes our productivity programs. This gives us great confidence in the levers we have to control those costs, which brings us to guidance. In terms of the full-year, we have confidence in our ability to deliver adjusted EPS growth of 13% to 15%, given our ability to control cost levers in the organization that I just spoke about. We also have confidence in our deleveraging target and continue to expect our management leverage ratio to be between 3.5 times and 3.8 times at the end of the year. During the uncertainty and variability with the current economic and consumer environment, we expect net sales growth will likely be at the low-end of our 3% to 4% range on a constant currency basis. While the path to achieve these targets will certainly be different than what we originally plan, we have confidence in our ability to execute and deliver on our commitment. And finally, COVID-19 is likely to have a large impact in the second quarter. We know this may make modeling of our segment difficult. So let me give you some incremental thoughts. In Coffee, we would expect net sales to be up mid single-digit, as the increased consumption we are seeing in our at-home business outweighs the pressures from our away-from-home business. In Packaged Beverages, we would expect net sales to be about flat, as continued outperformance in serving categories, such as CSDs and juice in large format retailers is largely offset by softness in other categories, such as premium water and continued weakness in the convenience and gas channel. Beverage Concentrates net sales will be significantly impacted by our fountain foodservice business, which will continue to be a drag due to the weak restaurant and hospitality environment until the economy starts to open up and consumers gaining confidence returning to public life. As such, net sales for this segment are likely to be down in the mid-teens in the second quarter. Latin America Beverages net sales will be about flat on a constant currency basis, reflecting a modest impact from COVID-19. On a reported basis, foreign exchange translation is expected to have a significant unfavorable impact in the quarter. And as a result, we expect reported net sales for this segment to also be down in the mid-teens. With all of these puts and takes, we would expect total KDP constant currency net sales to be about flat in the second quarter. With that, let me turn it back to Bob for some closing remarks.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Ozan. While we are very pleased with our Q1 performance, which followed a strong 2019, we recognize the need to make bold changes to win in this very different environment and we continue to pivot accordingly. As we look to the future, we don\u2019t have a better crystal ball than anyone else. We built our plans on the assumption that the second quarter will reflect the most severe impact of home sheltering, followed by a gradual reopening of the economy starting in Q3 with offices and schools first. This will be followed by restaurants and travel, and still later, we\u2019ll have large gatherings and events, most likely when a combination of testing, treatment and vaccines are available. We expect consumer spending to be impaired for a longer period of time, with the shift towards a value mindset elevating in-home consumption of food and beverage. We\u2019re also developing our game plan for how to market and create demand for our brands in this new environment, where both the consumer and the retail landscape will show lasting change. The most important takeaway from this conversation, as evidenced by our comments on this call, is the optionality we have to successfully navigate in this changing environment due to the broad beverage portfolio we manage, combined with our diverse and flexible selling and distribution system. Finally, we would not have been able to deliver the Q1 results we share today, nor have the confidence in our guidance we provided, if not for the loyalty, dedication and professionalism of our team. Our front-line employees are executing exceptionally well at retail and keeping our plants safe and running, all to ensure our customers and consumers have the products they need during this crisis. Our team is demonstrating KDP at its very best. With that, we\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Bryan Spillane.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good afternoon, everyone.\nRobert Gamgort: Hi, Bryan.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Hi, Bryan. Good afternoon.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. So just two questions for me. One is, I guess, thinking about the flow of 1Q to 2Q, I think, one of the questions we\u2019re getting quite a bit this evening is just, it seems like previously that there were some sales that would have been pulled into 2Q out of 1Q. So, if we\u2019re going through a reduction or a deceleration sequentially just what changed since there? So maybe I\u2019ll start with that, and then I\u2019ve got [indiscernible]\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. So as we said on the call, and then I\u2019ll pause after this part to make sure that I\u2019m answering your question that you had in mind. When you think about the first quarter, as we said, we had modest impact of \u2013 on our top line sales from the consumer behavior related to the shelter at-home. It really impacted us in our DSD segment, because you see an immediate reflection of sales in that segment and that shows up in PB as our overall segment. Interestingly, in coffee, we started to see consumer behavior at-home begin to pick up, but we get the immediate hit from the away-from-home segment, because that\u2019s the office coffee piece that we ship directly. And so we see the negative of that immediately. We also see the negative fairly quickly of the fountain foodservice business as well. So that\u2019s what explains Q1, so very solid performance with a little bit of upside on the revenue, almost all in the PB business, with some negative in rest of our business. When we take a look at Q2 and Ozan gave you some very clear specifics on how we see this shaking out. We see growth in coffee, driven by away-from-home, I mean, by at-home, offset by away-from-home. We see this pluses and minuses that I talked about, and these are massive swings in categories of retailers delivering flat in PB. And then the area where the fountain and foodservice business really hits us is in our BC segment. So when you net those all out assuming really a rough Q2 for the industry, we see ourselves coming in around flat total and then obviously improving from there based on the \u2013 based on our outlook for the full-year. So does that get at the question, or was there more clarity I can provide?\nBryan Spillane: No, no, I think so. I think the \u2013 relative to maybe where external expectations were, it\u2019s really the falloff in Beverage Concentrates in 2Q\u2026\nRobert Gamgort: Sure.\nBryan Spillane: \u2026that is going to be severe and probably is, again, just thinking at an enterprise level is what a lot of it drives the sequential change. So that\u2019s helpful.\nRobert Gamgort: Sure.\nBryan Spillane: And then just just one other one and related to Beverage Concentrates and the fountain foodservice piece, can you remind us how big that is as a percentage of the segment? And then also my recollection is that geographically, it\u2019s a little bit more skewed to the Dr Pepper Heartland market. So as we\u2019re beginning to kind of try to model out beyond 2Q and do scenarios beyond that, if you could just give us a little help there geographically, where you\u2019re more exposed in U.S.?. Thank you.\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. If you look at the fountain and foodservice segment, as we described it in our 2018 Investor Day, right after we announced the merger, we talked about that being 20% of the legacy DPS business. And so it\u2019s a smaller portion of the total business, all combined. It is a significant portion of the BC segment, and that\u2019s why you see the impact there. And the numbers that are coming out of restaurants, which are widely available, explain the magnitude of the decline, combined with that exposure to our portfolio. So that\u2019s really not a surprise. We do see it improving as the year goes on. We are \u2013 from a geographic standpoint, we are now really national in coverage. The legacy was that it was in Dr Pepper\u2019s Heartland in the South and the Southeast, but not anymore. We really have national coverage. Remember, Dr Pepper is the most widely available carbonated soft drink in restaurants. And so as a result, we, by definition, have national coverage. We see the geographic SKUs based on the degree of the consumer impact, but we\u2019re going to perform like the country in total on average.\nBryan Spillane: So just tracking QSR traffic, in general, probably the best way to kind of look at it from the outside?\nRobert Gamgort: Absolutely, and we\u2019re very heavily exposed to the QSR segment. And there\u2019s some signs of that improving with drive-thrus, and we hope with a gradual reopening of the economy that\u2019s going to pick up. But again, our estimation is the biggest hit will be in Q2, and I think we\u2019ve modeled a very significant hit in all of our numbers to make sure that we\u2019re able to pressure test our P&L to deliver on EPS and cash.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thanks, Bob. I appreciate your color.\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. Okay.\nOperator: Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thank you. I just wanted to talk a little bit about brewer trends, because I know this quarter there was a difficult comparison, but also you had mentioned in the release supply from Asia and some thoughts about some shipments shifting from first quarter to later in the year. So I guess, one, what are you seeing in terms of brewer sell-through from retail? So I think with people at home, not everyone had a Keurig to start when the crisis hit and they all need to make coffee at home. So what are you seeing on that front? What might you be doing to shift your marketing specifically for brewers as you look forward? And then third, anything you can share on innovation plans? I\u2019m going to guess that, how we all gotten together in March, we would have heard a bit about brewery innovation plans for this year, maybe that\u2019s shifted a bit, just given the environment, but would love to hear any update there if there\u2019s one? Thanks.\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. The \u2013 let me just say, overall, the coffee business in the at-home portion is performing remarkably well. And I\u2019ll reiterate something I said earlier, because it is notable. We are seeing a significant uptick in consumption per machine. As I said, that\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen for a long time. And we have that connected brewer network, about 10,000 Internet-connected brewers to allow us to be on a real same basis of what\u2019s happening. And it was really striking to see the tick-up happen in the first couple of days and it has remained at an elevated level. So we\u2019re getting growth off of existing machine because of the that behavior. And at some point you could say, what happens in the future when it all normalizes? There\u2019s a lot of indications that, that\u2019s going to stick at a higher level than anticipated. There\u2019s a lot of noise in our ability to read what\u2019s going on with household penetration. And remember, we\u2019re six weeks into it. And there\u2019s great demand for brewers and there are other indicators that you could look at like search terms for coffeemakers in Keurig, in particular, being elevated. The biggest shift is where consumers are buying their brewer. More has moved to online than before. We\u2019re seeing good growth in mass channels. But remember, the entire specialty channel where we sold a considerable number of brewers has been largely shutdown. So the demand for the brewers among consumers is very high. They\u2019ve had to alter where they\u2019re able to buy them. And as a consequence, we\u2019ve altered our marketing vehicle more online and more targeted to where the consumer is searching. We\u2019ll see how that shakes out over the coming months, as consumers know where to get machine that\u2019s easier for them to buy. With regard to the supply chain side of it, yes, there has been some minor disruptions, but nothing that has gotten in the way of selling any brewers. Originally, we were \u2013 the whole crisis started off in China, so we were happy to be diversified outside of China. We\u2019ve seen the crisis moved into other Asian markets. We\u2019ve actually shifted a little bit of production back to China. And so, again, we\u2019ve got a lot of optionality now that we\u2019ve spread our production base to be able to react to that to make sure that we are able to supply the brewers that people want. And your point about innovation is absolutely right. When we were supposed to get together for our Analyst Day in February, we were going to show you the rest of the lineup for the year, not only for brewers, but for our beverage portfolio in total, which we believe was a very, very strong lineup of innovation. We did talk to you about the newest brewer that had just been launched, which was the K-Slim, about $100 price point, less [ph] for brewer, very different and upgraded industrial design. That was an indication of where we were going with our innovation. We\u2019ll talk to you about that on our next call, because from an innovation perspective, we will still be launching our brewer innovation in the third and fourth quarter of this year.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. And then just lastly, the pieces on marketing, what you\u2019re doing in terms of marketing differently for the system\u2026\nRobert Gamgort: Yes.\nLauren Lieberman: \u2026in terms of driving household penetration?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. We\u2019ve moved even more online, because that\u2019s where the consumer is going to find brewers. E-commerce has been a real growth engine, not only on the coffee side of the business, but on the total beverage side of our business. We had always talked about at the time of the merger that because of the Keurig legacy, not only in selling within e-commerce, but having our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce site that we were well developed, probably ahead of everyone on e-commerce, that\u2019s serving as well on the Keurig side, as well as total beverage side. So I think that the move online, which has accelerated dramatically in the past six weeks, again, a lot of that is going to stick into the future. And therefore, our marketing will continue to evolve. But it\u2019ll always be a combination of mass vehicles to targeted vehicles. But as more and more brewers shift online, it\u2019s very attractive for us to target to a consumer who was raised his or her hand and interested in buying a coffeemaker to be able to target them with the right message right the time now.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Thanks so much.\nRobert Gamgort: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from Peter Grom.\nPeter Grom: Hey, good afternoon, everyone.\nRobert Gamgort: Hi.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Hi.\nPeter Grom: So I just kind of wanted to follow-up on Bryan\u2019s question more around Q2 coffee guidance for mid single-digit growth. I know back in March, you mentioned that most of the benefit from the stock-up would really occur in Q2. So does the mid single-digit guidance reflect that benefit? And then you mentioned pod pricing is actually in positive territory. And with some of these category changes likely permanent, how should we be thinking about pricing for pods through the balance of 2020 and beyond? Thanks.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. First of all, coffee is not stocked up. Coffee is elevated consumption. And again, we know that, because we have access to our connected brewers through our household panel. So that\u2019s the conversation we had earlier. When you look at elevated growth in a number of beverage categories, we had to make the conclusion, which of these were one-time stock-up? Which of these are ongoing consumption? And which of these are really categories will be off-trend? And coffee is clearly in the category of being elevated consumption. So this is not a stock-up behavior, but rather a shift in fundamental behavior that\u2019s on there. The mid single digit that we\u2019re talking about here is a representation of significantly higher growth on that, on the at-home side of our business driving that, offset by an office coffee business that has plummeted very similar to trends you\u2019d see in the restaurant business. The net of that is that, we come out nicely ahead, because we have both sides of the equation covered. But it \u2013 but there\u2019s no mistake that the office coffee shutdown or slowdown has certainly been an offset to the explosive growth we\u2019re seeing at-home. So that\u2019s the way that we take a look at coffee in total. Again, a lot of this behavior in the in-home side will stick. If we think that there\u2019s a recession coming, we will absolutely see more consumption moving in-home, especially as people have discovered how easy it is to make coffee at-home. And that\u2019s part of what\u2019s driving the pricing trend that we talked about, as people move from purchasing coffee out-of-home to in-home, they\u2019re bringing the premium brands with them. So the IRi or Nielsen numbers that you see over the past month or so show premium brands growing at a faster rate that value brands. You see great improvement in the trends in our owned and licensed portfolio, that\u2019s a positive contributor to pricing. And then you\u2019re seeing more of the category being purchased at full price, not waiting for a deal on all combined, that\u2019s leading to a \u2013 an elevated price within pods. I have no idea how to forecast that for the rest of the year. What I would say is, as we\u2019ve talked before, we have great line of sight to the pricing that we charge to our partners and that doesn\u2019t change in this environment. A positive price impact, like you\u2019re seeing right now does have a good profit contribution to our owned and licensed portfolio, but doesn\u2019t have an impact on the long-term pricing agreements we have with our partners.\nPeter Grom: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Bonnie Herzog.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m \u2013 I wanted to circle back with a question on your guidance. I guess, I\u2019m wanting to reconcile something you had said last quarter about the first-half. You\u2019d originally guided that first-half sales and EPS growth would be tempered, given several factors, such as higher investments and lower productivity and synergies. So could you guys touch on how much of that you shifted in the quarter, such as maybe pushing out investments or pulling forward some of the savings just trying to kind of think through that? And then I guess, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of, again, how confident you are that you\u2019re going to be able to hit your guidance, especially, if things don\u2019t recover for a while and in light of the recession we\u2019re in, I guess, I\u2019m thinking about it in the context of down trading pressures increasing, especially in your pod business, just can you touch on what is in your guidance as it relates to that? Thank you.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. The first quarter results that we delivered are reflective of everything that we said on the last call in terms of the sequence of timing of impacts. I won\u2019t go through all of those, I think, it\u2019s well documented in the earnings release and nicely covered by Ozan on the call. No big surprises in the first quarter other than we outperformed and we could talk about where that performance came from, but there are a number of factors. I would suggest that for Q2 and on that guidance that we gave back at the end of fourth quarter, it doesn\u2019t even matter anymore. It\u2019s a completely new world and it\u2019s a complete reset of our plans than any other company operating in this environment isn\u2019t looking at its AOP anymore. They have completely zero-based their budgets and they look at the new world, and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve thought about it. And so while we assume some gradual recovery beginning in Q3, those are the words we used, we have pressure-tested our P&L to be able to deliver in the priority that Ozan talked about, which is being competitive in the marketplace, continuing to gain share, protection of cash and earnings in that order, and we have every confidence in our ability to do so, otherwise, we would not continue to reiterate that.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Powers.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hi. Can you hear me?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, Steve.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Yes.\nSteve Powers: All right, great. Hey, I guess, I wanted to build a little bit on what you\u2019ve already said and just dig further into visibility into the Coffee System and pod demand over the balance of the year, considering all the cross-channel volatility that you referenced. Maybe you could just talk through how an earlier or conversely later returned to social mobility, for lack of a better term, might impact your planning on that coffee business over the balance of the year versus the slow recovery base case that you\u2019ve referenced, I\u2019m just trying to figure out how you toggle those plans going forward, based on a lot of different outcomes channel-by-channel?\nRobert Gamgort: Steve, just to clarify, are you saying what happens if the recovery is faster?\nSteve Powers: Is faster or conversely, slower longer duration?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. As I talked about before when I used the term that we pressure tested our P&L, is we put a base case out there. And anybody in this environment, who is managing to a single number forecast, would be fooling themselves, because the ranges are significant. Nobody is managed in a territory like this, where we\u2019re seeing double-digit movements up and down across different segments. So everything that we\u2019ve done internally is within a range. And so we look at scenarios in which the Bonnie\u2019s question, the recovery is slower, and we look at other scenarios and what comes in faster. And so how you have to toggle all of these things are, as we said before, the at-home consumption is benefiting from work from home, but we\u2019re getting hit very hard on our office coffee business. As we get a recovery and people go back to work, our office coffee business improves nicely. And one of the things we\u2019re fascinated with is, how much of that at-home business will stick? And we believe that a good portion of that will stick and we\u2019ve got a number of reasons to believe that, I quoted a couple earlier in the call, so I won\u2019t repeat those. And so we think that that\u2019s a win. If it extends longer, again, we\u2019ve pressure tested ourselves, otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have the confidence that we put out there around the EPS or the cash. And so we would love a return to business as usual. This is not a \u2013 we\u2019re not a company who has got a one-time gain from this crisis, who then is going to have to worry about what we do once things recover, we would like everything to recover. But we\u2019d be able \u2013 we\u2019re able to toggle the mix elements of our portfolio very uniquely, given the broad portfolio that we manage, as well as the cost elements of our portfolio that Ozan talked about to be able to manage ourselves to success on almost any one of the scenarios that we described. It occurs to me that I didn\u2019t answer part of Bonnie\u2019s question, which was about what do we think about down trading or a recession on the Keurig business? We think we\u2019re set up really nicely for that. First of all, people trade from premium price away-from-home products, food and beverage going to the coffee shop to in-home during the recession, so we\u2019re a great value compared to that. And also think about all the work that we\u2019ve done to strategically lower our price, both on brewers and pods, you can get a high quality pod now for around $0.30. We are not concerned about a recession and its impact on the Keurig business. We think it\u2019s actually a net positive on that business if that were to occur.\nSteve Powers: Thanks. That helps a lot. Can I just ask one quick question, different topic, some of your smaller third-party independent bottling partners. I\u2019m just curious any comments you have on how they\u2019re faring with a mix shift away from immediate consumption channels, which are obviously very profitable for them? Just your confidence in their ability to weather the toughest part of this downturn through 2Q? Thanks.\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. We stay very close with them. And they are \u2013 the share growth numbers that I talked about earlier, our independent operator performance is embedded in those share numbers. And so they\u2019re executing very well right now. It\u2019s a challenge for them to manage like it is for all of us, but we don\u2019t have any concern in their ability to weather the storm.\nSteve Powers: Great. Thanks so much.\nRobert Gamgort: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kevin Grundy.\nKevin Grundy: Hey, good evening, guys. Sorry about that.\nRobert Gamgort: Good evening.\nKevin Grundy: Hey, Bob, I wanted to pick up on the coffee business and the working from home dynamic longer-term. So clearly, it\u2019s a positive here was in March seems to be into April. I guess, it\u2019s still a little bit murky, I think, for some of us with with the pantry load and going beyond coffee and into other beverage categories as well we\u2019ll see where the dust settles. But where I\u2019d like to sort of drill down here is, how positive this could be the working from home dynamic, which will be with us for a long period of time, I think, even beyond the recovery here with the virus? And what sort of positive that could be for your business? So the increased coffee usage is there with the 10,000 brewers that you have, I guess, that that\u2019s unsurprising, because people are spending more time at home, but then you\u2019re down to a trickle probably in the office space. So how should we think about that longer-term? And then to sort of like frame that context, you talked about the 20% of the business in Beverage Concentrates its own premise, what percentage of the business in coffee is going to be leveraged to off-premise channels as well? I think that would kind of help us think about it and you\u2019re sharing that channel as well. Thanks for all that, Bob.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. We would love for the economy to go back to normal. People will go back to work. Net-net, we go back to delivering our long-term trends, where we talked about accelerated growth this year, 13% to 15% EPS, we\u2019d like that world. So again, I would reiterate that this is not one that we view as more desirable for a number of reasons. Having said that, we\u2019re in a unique situation. Now we\u2019re able to satisfy consumers\u2019 needs in a unique way in the moment in which they really need it. And that is, we\u2019re able to take care of all of their beverage, their coffee needs in-home. They\u2019re using our machines more frequently. And we know that, as that continues to happen and new people come into the system, which they are right now, that that\u2019s going to be sticky. And so there\u2019s a scenario as people go back to work, where they\u2019re more attached to their Keurig machine at-home than ever before. There are more people using Keurig machine at-home than ever before. And yet, we\u2019re able to pick up the office coffee business as well. So we\u2019re very bullish, as you can tell on the long-term prospects of the entire Keurig system. And that\u2019s why when you think about all these different scenarios that the questions are centering around today, what if the current crisis lasts longer? What if the recovery is faster? We can navigate through any of those scenarios and come out in a good place on the Keurig business. And when you look at the impact on our total company, that\u2019s why we\u2019re in a unique position. We\u2019ve got a portfolio that covers almost every beverage need. We have routes to market that we talked about now for two years, where we can cover anything from a C-store all the way through to e-commerce, those seemed interesting at the theoretical level. You\u2019re seeing that all play out live right now in this environment. And as it recovers, whichever path recovery takes, it\u2019s not going to be a straight line. We\u2019re very comfortable that we can navigate through that as well.\nKevin Grundy: Thanks, Bob. Yes, just to make sure I\u2019m clear, though, and maybe I missed this, what percentage of the business in coffee is away-from-home? So it\u2019s 20% in on the legacy Dr Pepper side, all of that in Bev Con? How much on the coffee side of the business and what\u2019s your share relative to the 80%-plus that you speak to in the food channel?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. You didn\u2019t miss it, because we never have disclosed that and we\u2019re not planning to. We\u2019ve talked about 50% of our business on the coffee side being in the unmeasured channels and that includes e-commerce specialty, but also includes away-from-home coffee. And our share in that channel is significantly lower than our share in the in-Home channel. The office called is a very fragmented business. And all the \u2013 all of the exposure to these different channels that you guys are asking about, that\u2019s all embedded in the guidance that we\u2019ve given you for the year and also for Q2, which is more granular guidance than we\u2019ve ever given before.\nKevin Grundy: Okay. Thanks for that, Bob. Good luck.\nRobert Gamgort: All right. Thanks.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Bill Chappell.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good afternoon. Hey, just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I think I\u2019m right in saying that the away-from-home and at-home split before Green Mountain went \u2013 or Keurig went was taken private is around 75-25? Is there any reason to think that that\u2019s changed over the past few years? And then secondly, just on the promotional kind of cost environment. Can \u2013 I mean, can you get a \u2013 give us an update of what you\u2019re doing over the next four or five months? We\u2019re hearing from a lot of food beverage companies of \u2013 because the is demand so strong, kind of quickly pulling a lot of promotions, which presumably falls to the bottom line. So just trying to understand if that\u2019s the case and that\u2019s kind of factored into your guidance as well?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. If you take a look at the latest IRi and Nielsen numbers, I would not say that beverage demand, in general, is strong. I would say it is elevated in pockets and it\u2019s weak in other pockets. This is a tremendous mix management challenge for everybody in, in the industry, including us. And that\u2019s how you see that playing out in the Q2 numbers that we talked about before. Fortunately, CSDs are remaining elevated and we\u2019re gaining share in that segment. We\u2019re also gaining share in a number of other segments, some of which are strong like juices and juice drinks, and then there are other categories that are not as strong. So it\u2019s not a situation, where beverage is so strong everywhere the people are pulling promotions. And so we\u2019re targeting our promotions to the right areas, where we think it\u2019s appropriate and there are other areas where it doesn\u2019t make sense. So it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s not a big macro conclusion you can take out of that. On the coffee side of the business, there is certainly elevated consumption. And it is not a stock-up, it\u2019s an ongoing piece. We\u2019re continuing with somewhat of our normal promotion schedule, but what you\u2019re seeing is the consumers also buying product at full price day in and day out, which is part of the reason, along with the mix towards more premium brands that you\u2019re seeing pricing going up there. So I wouldn\u2019t take any \u2013 the way any big conclusions on the promotional environment for us, at least, in general. I think in a lot of these categories, where you\u2019re seeing weak demand from consumers, you\u2019re actually going to see more promotion going forward. Take a look at the Nielsen and IRi trends right now, there are segments that are running negative for a consistent period of time. There\u2019s a lot of incentive for players to promote in that environment. We\u2019ve got good exposure and we\u2019re managing it really tightly.\nBill Chappell: Got it. And then on the breakout, any reason to think that it\u2019s changed from when it was last disclosed five years ago?\nRobert Gamgort: I don\u2019t know those numbers from five years ago. I\u2019ve been there for five years, but I don\u2019t really have a comment on that one, to be honest.\nBill Chappell: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Sean King.\nSean King: Great. Thanks for the question. You touched on a pod pricing strategy, but in the context of recession and consumers being more value sensitive, what can you say about the risk that consumers, specifically returned to pod and coffee, especially after they\u2019ve been spending a long period of time at home? And is \u2013 I guess, is household penetration at a point where that\u2019s \u2013 that risk is, I guess, no longer relevant?\nRobert Gamgort: But yes. So I think, first of all, we have got a really established household penetration base that continues to grow at a steady rate year in and year out. I think the second part of it is, when you look at consumer behavior during a recession, the first trade-off they make is out-of-home food and beverage to in-home food and beverage. And if you look at a price comparison of Keurig versus purchasing coffee from outside of the home, it\u2019s a tremendous bargain. But again, the last time there was a recession, the price of pods were significantly higher than they are today. So all of the work that we\u2019ve done to get the price of pods down serves us day in and day out and it prepares us really nicely to be recession-resistant. Similarly, we\u2019ve gotten the price of machines down in some cases. In other cases, we\u2019ve gone to more premium. So we\u2019re able to fill a wide range of consumer needs there, and we have machines that are below $100, we have machines that sell for around $50. And so the thought of a recession and a trade down, I think, is a net benefit to us, not a net risk, as people move from consuming coffee out-of-home to in-home. And as we see right now, in a situation where people are moving their consumption in home, not only are they drinking more coffee, they\u2019re actually drinking more premium coffee right now, because they\u2019re filling that need for the coffee shop occasion that they\u2019re not able to get.\nSean King: Great. Thanks for the color. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nRobert Gamgort: Okay.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.\nTyson Seely: Thanks, everyone. This is Tyson. Thank you for joining us tonight. The IR team is around and available throughout the week and this evening. If you would like to follow-up, just reach out to myself or Steve, and we\u2019ll get back to you. Thanks, everyone. Stay safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ozan Dokmecioglu",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Since our press release provides significant detail on our performance, let me touch quickly on our results for the first quarter, before shifting to a discussion on some more relevant items, since the environment has changed significantly. At a high level, the first quarter was another very good one for us, reflecting the strength of the business throughout the quarter, as well as the small net benefit of COVID-19 in the final weeks of the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales increased 4.5%, with the growth from all four segments and particular strength in packaged beverages. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS growth of 16% in the quarter, fueled by the growth in adjusted operating income, a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense, due primarily to continued deleveraging. Free cash flow in the quarter was as strong at $464 million, translating into an adjusted free cash flow conversion rate of nearly 115%. We reduced bank debt by $42 million and repaid $107 million of structured payables, and we ended the quarter with almost $200 million of unrestricted cash on hand. In terms of leverage, our bank debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which we refer to as our management leverage ratio, improved to 4.2 times versus 4.5 times at the end of 2019. This improvement was driven by lower outstanding debt balances and continued growth in adjusted EBITDA, including the inclusion of certain permanent amortization expenses, which were not previously recognized in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. I would like to take a moment to provide more information on this change. As part of our detailed financial review with the strategic refinancing we recently completed, we determined that certain components of our reported amortization expense were not reflected in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. This represented approximately $170 million in the trailing 12 month. As a result, we have updated the calculation accordingly, starting in quarter one. The update drove approximately two-thirds of the change in our management leverage ratio. Let me be clear on two things. First, this change does not create a one-time impact, but rather it is permanent and affect all periods. Second, I have described before that we take a very conservative approach in calculating our management leverage ratio, and this change does not affect that expense at all. We still exclude many items that our bank loan covenants allow in the calculation, and this item that we are now including was merely an oversight. Let me now touch briefly on liquidity. As announced previously, we completed a strategic refinancing earlier this month that extended our debt maturities and enhanced our liquidity profile. The refinancing included the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior notes and the refinancing and the doubling of our $750 million, 364-day credit facility to $1.5 billion of borrowing capacity. This strategic refinancing provides additional liquidity to a level that we believe exceeds our potential needs, even in the event of a protracted downturn. Clearly, it was a stronger start to the year. But as both Bob and I have indicated, the environment today is entirely different than the one that we operated in for most of the first quarter. Therefore, let me talk about our priorities to continue to be competitive in the marketplace and protect profit and cash flow. There are four buckets to discuss. First, we are going to be competitive in the marketplace, ensuring we have the right products in the right places, so that we can continue to deliver the product consumers want and drive share gain, as we have across the majority of our categories in the most recent period. Clearly, this strategy is working for us based on the numbers Bob just walk you through. Second is top line discipline. As you would expect in times like this, we are prioritizing profitable business over chasing unprofitable volume growth in order to protect profit. While this may seem like an obvious concept, it takes discipline and is staying close to retailers and the consumer to understand what products to emphasize and which ones are not critical in the environment we are in. Third, beyond being smart on top line discipline, there are cost levers in the P&L that we are using to ensure bottom line delivery. For example, marketing investments. We have reviewed our marketing strategy and will continue to reduce spend in areas where it is not justified in the current consumer environment. As the reopening of the economy occurs, we will redeploy marketing resources, where we believe it is appropriate and where the return on investment is greater. Travel and entertainment and discretionary spending are two other costs levers that we are using. At this time, we have eliminated all discretionary spending and will assess these costs on a go-forward basis. Fourth and finally, is maximizing cash flow. CapEx is one of the most important areas of cash spend. We continue to support the business with necessary CapEx investment, but we expect some projects to be delayed. In some cases, these will be discretionary delays, because the project isn't a strategy or doesn't support growth. And in other cases, there are delays due to COVID-19 impact on suppliers and vendors. Given all of this, we have confidence in our target, which I will speak to momentarily. We have a unique business model with a broad portfolio of brands and seven distinct route to markets. Further, we continue to be heavily into our integration and synergy mode, which means we have deep understanding of our cost structure, which includes our productivity programs. This gives us great confidence in the levers we have to control those costs, which brings us to guidance. In terms of the full-year, we have confidence in our ability to deliver adjusted EPS growth of 13% to 15%, given our ability to control cost levers in the organization that I just spoke about. We also have confidence in our deleveraging target and continue to expect our management leverage ratio to be between 3.5 times and 3.8 times at the end of the year. During the uncertainty and variability with the current economic and consumer environment, we expect net sales growth will likely be at the low-end of our 3% to 4% range on a constant currency basis. While the path to achieve these targets will certainly be different than what we originally plan, we have confidence in our ability to execute and deliver on our commitment. And finally, COVID-19 is likely to have a large impact in the second quarter. We know this may make modeling of our segment difficult. So let me give you some incremental thoughts. In Coffee, we would expect net sales to be up mid single-digit, as the increased consumption we are seeing in our at-home business outweighs the pressures from our away-from-home business. In Packaged Beverages, we would expect net sales to be about flat, as continued outperformance in serving categories, such as CSDs and juice in large format retailers is largely offset by softness in other categories, such as premium water and continued weakness in the convenience and gas channel. Beverage Concentrates net sales will be significantly impacted by our fountain foodservice business, which will continue to be a drag due to the weak restaurant and hospitality environment until the economy starts to open up and consumers gaining confidence returning to public life. As such, net sales for this segment are likely to be down in the mid-teens in the second quarter. Latin America Beverages net sales will be about flat on a constant currency basis, reflecting a modest impact from COVID-19. On a reported basis, foreign exchange translation is expected to have a significant unfavorable impact in the quarter. And as a result, we expect reported net sales for this segment to also be down in the mid-teens. With all of these puts and takes, we would expect total KDP constant currency net sales to be about flat in the second quarter. With that, let me turn it back to Bob for some closing remarks. Hi, Bryan. Good afternoon. Hi. Yes. Thanks."

            "name": "Robert Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks, Tyson. Let me start by expressing my sincere hope that everyone dialed in is safe and healthy, and I want to thank you all for joining us this afternoon. As you can see from our Q1 results, we started the year in a strong manner, with financial delivery very much in line with our long-term targets and with continued strong free cash flow and deleveraging. We expanded market share across the majority of our portfolio and believe that we were just getting started, as we began to introduce our best lineup of innovation yet. The continued underlying strength of our business is reflected in the results we reported today, as COVID-19 had only a modest impact on us in the first quarter. Ozan will take you through some of the relevant highlights from the first quarter that carry over into the full-year. But I want to acknowledge that Q1 represent a very different environment than the one we're operating in today. Therefore, I want to focus my comments on the second quarter and beyond, addressing a number of topics that I believe are most relevant to our investors at this moment. Specifically, we will discuss how consumer behavior has recently shifted and share our assumptions for how we believe that will evolve going forward, explain how those shifts have impacted our portfolio positively and negatively. We'll do this through the lens of both product categories and retail channels. Review the critical steps we've taken to date to navigate this unusual situation, and how we're managing the business and channel mix to ensure continued success in the short-term and in the long-term. And finally, we'll provide a more granular view on financial expectations by segment for the next quarter and update you on our outlook for earnings, cash generation, and deleveraging for the full-year. KDP has a remarkably flexible and resilient business model, and our organization is executing very well in this unpredictable and challenging environment. We believe our discussion today will shed new light on how our original merger thesis, which delivered exceptional value in its first seven quarters, is more relevant now than ever. Before getting into that discussion, let me start by thanking our 26,000 employees for their extraordinary efforts that are enabling us to restock store shelves with essential products. I also want to thank the new front-line in North America from healthcare workers to logistics providers to employees at retail, who are out there everyday, helping us all through this difficult time. Early in the crisis, we refocused the organization under a new set of priorities called ONE KDP. The K represents keeping our employees safe and healthy, the D represents delivering for our customers and consumers, and the P stands for providing for our community. We could build this entire call with discussion of the wide ranging steps we have taken to protect our employees from increased sanitation, physical separation, new health screening, making our own hand sanitizers and masks when supplies got low and providing enhanced incentives to our front-line and increased benefits to all employees. Similarly, we could elaborate on our fueling the front-line initiative, which is providing Keurig commercial brewers and hot and cold beverages to hundreds of hospitals and tens of thousands of healthcare workers, who are working tirelessly to help those in their community. If you're interested in learning more about these and other programs, you can find details on our website. However, given that this is an earnings call, I'm going to focus the remainder of this discussion on the D in ONE KDP, how we're delivering for our customers and consumers, as that drives our top line and mix. I will then turn it over to Ozan to review all the levers we have available to manage costs in order to drive strong profitability and cash flow. As the majority of the country began operating under stay-at-home restrictions in March, we saw immediate behavioral changes among consumers and continue to see what may be lasting shifts in what consumers are buying and where they are shopping. We're only about six weeks into this crisis, but we're gathering more and more insights as we progress. This is an incredibly complex and evolving landscape, which is best visualized as a matrix, with product categories on one axis and retail channels on the other. We are actively managing the intersections within that matrix between product categories and channel, prioritizing resources to deliver what consumers want, while focusing on the highest ROI opportunity and navigating the differential growth and profit mix impacts of each. We think about product categories as falling into one of three buckets: those that were purchased under an initial stock-up mindset, primarily in March, and are no longer growing, and in some cases, declining; those that continue to be purchased for ongoing in-home consumption, many of which are expandable in nature. There's potential for some of these categories to continue to grow at elevated levels post-crisis, as consumers find or rediscover a role for them in the new world. Finally, there are categories that aren't as relevant to consumers' current needs and have been negatively impacted by this crisis, some of which will return to the previous growth levels after the crisis abates, others that may not fully recover. Let's look at the recent IRi data to illustrate what we're talking about here. And remember, these data cover primarily in-home consumption and large C-stores. I'll discuss away-from-home channels and their impact on categories and mix in a few minutes. In the two weeks of March ending 3/22, which represents the early days of the crisis in North America, growth of total Liquid Refreshment Beverages, or LRB, spiked the 30.2%, with all categories growing above average as consumers prepared for an extended stay-at-home. If we dig in further into these data, we see that the real outsized performance during those weeks was driven by consumers stocking up on categories, such as mainstream water and sports drink. Since then, LRB has softened considerably, growing 5% in the latest four weeks and declining slightly in the latest week, as the one-time purchase of some of those same categories such as water and sports drinks are not being repeated. However, beneath the total performance of LRB, there are areas of ongoing strength, representing categories of products experiencing expandable consumption and ongoing replenishment, as I discussed earlier. For example, CSDs remained very strong, growing nearly 10% in the latest four-week, and categories like juices and mixers also continued to demonstrate strength. Not surprisingly, in-home coffee consumption has also been very strong due to the expansion of work from home and the inability to visit coffee shop, with single-serve coffee accelerating from 9% in the most recent 13-week to 21% in the latest four. The majority of our portfolio has exposure to the bucket of expandable consumption and ongoing replenishment, while the rest of our portfolio is exposed to one-time stock-up or off-trend category. We certainly have mix challenges to manage, as strength in our CSDs, juice, applesauce and mixers has been partially offset by softness in Bai and Snapple, which have been impacted by both weaker category trends nationally and the fact that they are highly developed in the Northeast region of the U.S., an area of very hard hit by the virus to date. Our focus has been to drive growth and opportunity category in order to offset the drag in others. Our single-serve coffee business is showing very strong growth and has the potential to enhance its relevance in consumers' lives well into the future. The IRi data indicate not only accelerating category growth, as I mentioned earlier, but also an increase in average retail price per pod. Yes, you've heard that correctly. This is, in part, due to the growth in premium brand, which are outpacing that of value brands. It seems that when consumers are moving their away-from-home coffee consumption to in-home, they're also bringing their favorite coffee shop brands with them. Single-serve coffee category growth is being driven by a combination of the long-term trend of growing household penetration, combined with an increase in consumption per existing brewer, something we haven't seen before. We know this from our connected brewer path, a network of approximately 10,000 Internet-connected brewers that has been providing point of consumption data for three years. As we look to a future in which a recession seems to be a near certainty, we also see further opportunity for the Keurig system to expand, as consumers shift more of their coffee preparation in-home. A study completed by IRi over the last few weeks indicated that 27% of consumers are making coffee at home more often than before the crisis, and two-thirds say that behavior will continue, even when restrictions end. We also know that CSDs are remarkably resilient to a recession, and we have a wide range of pricing, pack size and promotion tactics to ensure our continued relevance should consumers become more value sensitive in the future. Let me turn from product categories to retail channel. To give you our perspective on the other side of the beverage industry matrix that I described upfront. Growth has been driven primarily by large retail outlets, namely grocery, club and mass, as consumers have increased stock-up occasion at the expense of impulse and fill-in occasion. As a result, e-commerce has exploded, while C-stores and small outlets have been weaker. Similar to the discussion of how we're managing mix across product categories, we're also actively managing mix across retail channels and customers. Our company-owned DSD system has performed remarkably well, enabling us to reach and restock growth customers, while our highly developed e-commerce capability has enabled growth across our full beverage portfolio in this increasingly important channel. Our supply chain has also pivoted significantly to provide the right formats and sizes to deliver on these growth opportunities, as well as securing raw materials and packaging to keep our products flowing. Not surprisingly, the most significant drag on our overall performance has been our fountain and foodservice business on the cold side and our office coffee business on the hot side. The impact of the crisis on restaurants has been well documented. And while the work from home trend has helped our at-home business, it has negatively impacted our office coffee business. All of the discussion to this point has been about the macro trends in the industry and our exposure to them through our portfolio and route to market coverage. However, the quality of execution determines our ultimate success. Effective mix management requires bold moves and a rapid and aligned decision-making. Industry players who were used to operating with predictable demand and relatively small fluctuations in volume are now required to manage a volatile mix of categories, moving at double-digit rate changes versus year ago, both positive and negative in order to land on a good outcome. Since the crisis, we have implemented a new management case with near daily executive team meetings and sales and operations planning meeting, enabling real-time decision and ensuring organizational focus on clear priorities. These efforts are paying off, as indicated by the latest IRi share data. We increased our share of total beverages over the past 13 and four weeks. Within total beverages, we have expanded our share of CSD significantly, growing 1.4 share points in the latest four weeks and we posted share gains in key categories, such as premium water, ready-to-drink tea, juice drinks, shelf stable juices and energy in the most recent period. In the coffee business, the share of pods manufactured by KDP has held steady at approximately 82% of dollars, as total growth accelerated. And we showed share gains in key owned and licensed brands, such as Green Mountain and The Original Donut Shop. With that clarity on revenue and mix, let me now turn it over to Ozan to pick up the story from here. Thanks, Ozan. While we are very pleased with our Q1 performance, which followed a strong 2019, we recognize the need to make bold changes to win in this very different environment and we continue to pivot accordingly. As we look to the future, we don't have a better crystal ball than anyone else. We built our plans on the assumption that the second quarter will reflect the most severe impact of home sheltering, followed by a gradual reopening of the economy starting in Q3 with offices and schools first. This will be followed by restaurants and travel, and still later, we'll have large gatherings and events, most likely when a combination of testing, treatment and vaccines are available. We expect consumer spending to be impaired for a longer period of time, with the shift towards a value mindset elevating in-home consumption of food and beverage. We're also developing our game plan for how to market and create demand for our brands in this new environment, where both the consumer and the retail landscape will show lasting change. The most important takeaway from this conversation, as evidenced by our comments on this call, is the optionality we have to successfully navigate in this changing environment due to the broad beverage portfolio we manage, combined with our diverse and flexible selling and distribution system. Finally, we would not have been able to deliver the Q1 results we share today, nor have the confidence in our guidance we provided, if not for the loyalty, dedication and professionalism of our team. Our front-line employees are executing exceptionally well at retail and keeping our plants safe and running, all to ensure our customers and consumers have the products they need during this crisis. Our team is demonstrating KDP at its very best. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Hi, Bryan. Sure. So as we said on the call, and then I'll pause after this part to make sure that I'm answering your question that you had in mind. When you think about the first quarter, as we said, we had modest impact of \u2013 on our top line sales from the consumer behavior related to the shelter at-home. It really impacted us in our DSD segment, because you see an immediate reflection of sales in that segment and that shows up in PB as our overall segment. Interestingly, in coffee, we started to see consumer behavior at-home begin to pick up, but we get the immediate hit from the away-from-home segment, because that's the office coffee piece that we ship directly. And so we see the negative of that immediately. We also see the negative fairly quickly of the fountain foodservice business as well. So that's what explains Q1, so very solid performance with a little bit of upside on the revenue, almost all in the PB business, with some negative in rest of our business. When we take a look at Q2 and Ozan gave you some very clear specifics on how we see this shaking out. We see growth in coffee, driven by away-from-home, I mean, by at-home, offset by away-from-home. We see this pluses and minuses that I talked about, and these are massive swings in categories of retailers delivering flat in PB. And then the area where the fountain and foodservice business really hits us is in our BC segment. So when you net those all out assuming really a rough Q2 for the industry, we see ourselves coming in around flat total and then obviously improving from there based on the \u2013 based on our outlook for the full-year. So does that get at the question, or was there more clarity I can provide? Sure. Sure. Sure. If you look at the fountain and foodservice segment, as we described it in our 2018 Investor Day, right after we announced the merger, we talked about that being 20% of the legacy DPS business. And so it's a smaller portion of the total business, all combined. It is a significant portion of the BC segment, and that's why you see the impact there. And the numbers that are coming out of restaurants, which are widely available, explain the magnitude of the decline, combined with that exposure to our portfolio. So that's really not a surprise. We do see it improving as the year goes on. We are \u2013 from a geographic standpoint, we are now really national in coverage. The legacy was that it was in Dr Pepper's Heartland in the South and the Southeast, but not anymore. We really have national coverage. Remember, Dr Pepper is the most widely available carbonated soft drink in restaurants. And so as a result, we, by definition, have national coverage. We see the geographic SKUs based on the degree of the consumer impact, but we're going to perform like the country in total on average. Absolutely, and we're very heavily exposed to the QSR segment. And there's some signs of that improving with drive-thrus, and we hope with a gradual reopening of the economy that's going to pick up. But again, our estimation is the biggest hit will be in Q2, and I think we've modeled a very significant hit in all of our numbers to make sure that we're able to pressure test our P&L to deliver on EPS and cash. Sure. Okay. Sure. The \u2013 let me just say, overall, the coffee business in the at-home portion is performing remarkably well. And I'll reiterate something I said earlier, because it is notable. We are seeing a significant uptick in consumption per machine. As I said, that's something we haven't seen for a long time. And we have that connected brewer network, about 10,000 Internet-connected brewers to allow us to be on a real same basis of what's happening. And it was really striking to see the tick-up happen in the first couple of days and it has remained at an elevated level. So we're getting growth off of existing machine because of the that behavior. And at some point you could say, what happens in the future when it all normalizes? There's a lot of indications that, that's going to stick at a higher level than anticipated. There's a lot of noise in our ability to read what's going on with household penetration. And remember, we're six weeks into it. And there's great demand for brewers and there are other indicators that you could look at like search terms for coffeemakers in Keurig, in particular, being elevated. The biggest shift is where consumers are buying their brewer. More has moved to online than before. We're seeing good growth in mass channels. But remember, the entire specialty channel where we sold a considerable number of brewers has been largely shutdown. So the demand for the brewers among consumers is very high. They've had to alter where they're able to buy them. And as a consequence, we've altered our marketing vehicle more online and more targeted to where the consumer is searching. We'll see how that shakes out over the coming months, as consumers know where to get machine that's easier for them to buy. With regard to the supply chain side of it, yes, there has been some minor disruptions, but nothing that has gotten in the way of selling any brewers. Originally, we were \u2013 the whole crisis started off in China, so we were happy to be diversified outside of China. We've seen the crisis moved into other Asian markets. We've actually shifted a little bit of production back to China. And so, again, we've got a lot of optionality now that we've spread our production base to be able to react to that to make sure that we are able to supply the brewers that people want. And your point about innovation is absolutely right. When we were supposed to get together for our Analyst Day in February, we were going to show you the rest of the lineup for the year, not only for brewers, but for our beverage portfolio in total, which we believe was a very, very strong lineup of innovation. We did talk to you about the newest brewer that had just been launched, which was the K-Slim, about $100 price point, less [ph] for brewer, very different and upgraded industrial design. That was an indication of where we were going with our innovation. We'll talk to you about that on our next call, because from an innovation perspective, we will still be launching our brewer innovation in the third and fourth quarter of this year. Yes. Yes. We've moved even more online, because that's where the consumer is going to find brewers. E-commerce has been a real growth engine, not only on the coffee side of the business, but on the total beverage side of our business. We had always talked about at the time of the merger that because of the Keurig legacy, not only in selling within e-commerce, but having our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce site that we were well developed, probably ahead of everyone on e-commerce, that's serving as well on the Keurig side, as well as total beverage side. So I think that the move online, which has accelerated dramatically in the past six weeks, again, a lot of that is going to stick into the future. And therefore, our marketing will continue to evolve. But it'll always be a combination of mass vehicles to targeted vehicles. But as more and more brewers shift online, it's very attractive for us to target to a consumer who was raised his or her hand and interested in buying a coffeemaker to be able to target them with the right message right the time now. Sure. Hi. Yes. First of all, coffee is not stocked up. Coffee is elevated consumption. And again, we know that, because we have access to our connected brewers through our household panel. So that's the conversation we had earlier. When you look at elevated growth in a number of beverage categories, we had to make the conclusion, which of these were one-time stock-up? Which of these are ongoing consumption? And which of these are really categories will be off-trend? And coffee is clearly in the category of being elevated consumption. So this is not a stock-up behavior, but rather a shift in fundamental behavior that's on there. The mid single digit that we're talking about here is a representation of significantly higher growth on that, on the at-home side of our business driving that, offset by an office coffee business that has plummeted very similar to trends you'd see in the restaurant business. The net of that is that, we come out nicely ahead, because we have both sides of the equation covered. But it \u2013 but there's no mistake that the office coffee shutdown or slowdown has certainly been an offset to the explosive growth we're seeing at-home. So that's the way that we take a look at coffee in total. Again, a lot of this behavior in the in-home side will stick. If we think that there's a recession coming, we will absolutely see more consumption moving in-home, especially as people have discovered how easy it is to make coffee at-home. And that's part of what's driving the pricing trend that we talked about, as people move from purchasing coffee out-of-home to in-home, they're bringing the premium brands with them. So the IRi or Nielsen numbers that you see over the past month or so show premium brands growing at a faster rate that value brands. You see great improvement in the trends in our owned and licensed portfolio, that's a positive contributor to pricing. And then you're seeing more of the category being purchased at full price, not waiting for a deal on all combined, that's leading to a \u2013 an elevated price within pods. I have no idea how to forecast that for the rest of the year. What I would say is, as we've talked before, we have great line of sight to the pricing that we charge to our partners and that doesn't change in this environment. A positive price impact, like you're seeing right now does have a good profit contribution to our owned and licensed portfolio, but doesn't have an impact on the long-term pricing agreements we have with our partners. Yes. The first quarter results that we delivered are reflective of everything that we said on the last call in terms of the sequence of timing of impacts. I won't go through all of those, I think, it's well documented in the earnings release and nicely covered by Ozan on the call. No big surprises in the first quarter other than we outperformed and we could talk about where that performance came from, but there are a number of factors. I would suggest that for Q2 and on that guidance that we gave back at the end of fourth quarter, it doesn't even matter anymore. It's a completely new world and it's a complete reset of our plans than any other company operating in this environment isn't looking at its AOP anymore. They have completely zero-based their budgets and they look at the new world, and that's how we've thought about it. And so while we assume some gradual recovery beginning in Q3, those are the words we used, we have pressure-tested our P&L to be able to deliver in the priority that Ozan talked about, which is being competitive in the marketplace, continuing to gain share, protection of cash and earnings in that order, and we have every confidence in our ability to do so, otherwise, we would not continue to reiterate that. Yes, Steve. Steve, just to clarify, are you saying what happens if the recovery is faster? Yes. As I talked about before when I used the term that we pressure tested our P&L, is we put a base case out there. And anybody in this environment, who is managing to a single number forecast, would be fooling themselves, because the ranges are significant. Nobody is managed in a territory like this, where we're seeing double-digit movements up and down across different segments. So everything that we've done internally is within a range. And so we look at scenarios in which the Bonnie's question, the recovery is slower, and we look at other scenarios and what comes in faster. And so how you have to toggle all of these things are, as we said before, the at-home consumption is benefiting from work from home, but we're getting hit very hard on our office coffee business. As we get a recovery and people go back to work, our office coffee business improves nicely. And one of the things we're fascinated with is, how much of that at-home business will stick? And we believe that a good portion of that will stick and we've got a number of reasons to believe that, I quoted a couple earlier in the call, so I won't repeat those. And so we think that that's a win. If it extends longer, again, we've pressure tested ourselves, otherwise, we wouldn't have the confidence that we put out there around the EPS or the cash. And so we would love a return to business as usual. This is not a \u2013 we're not a company who has got a one-time gain from this crisis, who then is going to have to worry about what we do once things recover, we would like everything to recover. But we'd be able \u2013 we're able to toggle the mix elements of our portfolio very uniquely, given the broad portfolio that we manage, as well as the cost elements of our portfolio that Ozan talked about to be able to manage ourselves to success on almost any one of the scenarios that we described. It occurs to me that I didn't answer part of Bonnie's question, which was about what do we think about down trading or a recession on the Keurig business? We think we're set up really nicely for that. First of all, people trade from premium price away-from-home products, food and beverage going to the coffee shop to in-home during the recession, so we're a great value compared to that. And also think about all the work that we've done to strategically lower our price, both on brewers and pods, you can get a high quality pod now for around $0.30. We are not concerned about a recession and its impact on the Keurig business. We think it's actually a net positive on that business if that were to occur. Sure. We stay very close with them. And they are \u2013 the share growth numbers that I talked about earlier, our independent operator performance is embedded in those share numbers. And so they're executing very well right now. It's a challenge for them to manage like it is for all of us, but we don't have any concern in their ability to weather the storm. Okay. Good evening. Yes. We would love for the economy to go back to normal. People will go back to work. Net-net, we go back to delivering our long-term trends, where we talked about accelerated growth this year, 13% to 15% EPS, we'd like that world. So again, I would reiterate that this is not one that we view as more desirable for a number of reasons. Having said that, we're in a unique situation. Now we're able to satisfy consumers' needs in a unique way in the moment in which they really need it. And that is, we're able to take care of all of their beverage, their coffee needs in-home. They're using our machines more frequently. And we know that, as that continues to happen and new people come into the system, which they are right now, that that's going to be sticky. And so there's a scenario as people go back to work, where they're more attached to their Keurig machine at-home than ever before. There are more people using Keurig machine at-home than ever before. And yet, we're able to pick up the office coffee business as well. So we're very bullish, as you can tell on the long-term prospects of the entire Keurig system. And that's why when you think about all these different scenarios that the questions are centering around today, what if the current crisis lasts longer? What if the recovery is faster? We can navigate through any of those scenarios and come out in a good place on the Keurig business. And when you look at the impact on our total company, that's why we're in a unique position. We've got a portfolio that covers almost every beverage need. We have routes to market that we talked about now for two years, where we can cover anything from a C-store all the way through to e-commerce, those seemed interesting at the theoretical level. You're seeing that all play out live right now in this environment. And as it recovers, whichever path recovery takes, it's not going to be a straight line. We're very comfortable that we can navigate through that as well. Yes. You didn't miss it, because we never have disclosed that and we're not planning to. We've talked about 50% of our business on the coffee side being in the unmeasured channels and that includes e-commerce specialty, but also includes away-from-home coffee. And our share in that channel is significantly lower than our share in the in-Home channel. The office called is a very fragmented business. And all the \u2013 all of the exposure to these different channels that you guys are asking about, that's all embedded in the guidance that we've given you for the year and also for Q2, which is more granular guidance than we've ever given before. All right. Thanks. Yes. If you take a look at the latest IRi and Nielsen numbers, I would not say that beverage demand, in general, is strong. I would say it is elevated in pockets and it's weak in other pockets. This is a tremendous mix management challenge for everybody in, in the industry, including us. And that's how you see that playing out in the Q2 numbers that we talked about before. Fortunately, CSDs are remaining elevated and we're gaining share in that segment. We're also gaining share in a number of other segments, some of which are strong like juices and juice drinks, and then there are other categories that are not as strong. So it's not a situation, where beverage is so strong everywhere the people are pulling promotions. And so we're targeting our promotions to the right areas, where we think it's appropriate and there are other areas where it doesn't make sense. So it's \u2013 there's not a big macro conclusion you can take out of that. On the coffee side of the business, there is certainly elevated consumption. And it is not a stock-up, it's an ongoing piece. We're continuing with somewhat of our normal promotion schedule, but what you're seeing is the consumers also buying product at full price day in and day out, which is part of the reason, along with the mix towards more premium brands that you're seeing pricing going up there. So I wouldn't take any \u2013 the way any big conclusions on the promotional environment for us, at least, in general. I think in a lot of these categories, where you're seeing weak demand from consumers, you're actually going to see more promotion going forward. Take a look at the Nielsen and IRi trends right now, there are segments that are running negative for a consistent period of time. There's a lot of incentive for players to promote in that environment. We've got good exposure and we're managing it really tightly. I don't know those numbers from five years ago. I've been there for five years, but I don't really have a comment on that one, to be honest. But yes. So I think, first of all, we have got a really established household penetration base that continues to grow at a steady rate year in and year out. I think the second part of it is, when you look at consumer behavior during a recession, the first trade-off they make is out-of-home food and beverage to in-home food and beverage. And if you look at a price comparison of Keurig versus purchasing coffee from outside of the home, it's a tremendous bargain. But again, the last time there was a recession, the price of pods were significantly higher than they are today. So all of the work that we've done to get the price of pods down serves us day in and day out and it prepares us really nicely to be recession-resistant. Similarly, we've gotten the price of machines down in some cases. In other cases, we've gone to more premium. So we're able to fill a wide range of consumer needs there, and we have machines that are below $100, we have machines that sell for around $50. And so the thought of a recession and a trade down, I think, is a net benefit to us, not a net risk, as people move from consuming coffee out-of-home to in-home. And as we see right now, in a situation where people are moving their consumption in home, not only are they drinking more coffee, they're actually drinking more premium coffee right now, because they're filling that need for the coffee shop occasion that they're not able to get. Okay."

This conference call is being recorded and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Steve Alexander. Mr. Alexander, please go ahead.\nSteve Alexander: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued our press release for the fourth quarter of 2021. If you need a copy, you can get one on our website in the Investors section. Consistent with previous quarters, today, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, excluding items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides a meaningful comparison and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance. Here with us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2021 results are KDP\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\nBob Gamgort: Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. As you recall, this past quarter represents the completion of our three-year merger plan and the beginning of the next chapter of our transformation and growth, as we detailed for you during our Investor Day in October. With the merger plan now in the record books, I am pleased to report that we met or exceeded all of our key commitments, and we have demonstrated the power of our new company with a significantly faster growing business than at the time of the merger. The volatile macro environment we have faced since the merger has tested the industry and our business. It has also provided the opportunity for KDP to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model and our ability to withstand unforeseen events and deliver on our long-term commitments. In terms of a few specifics, our top-line strength over the past three years is a standout, growing approximately 5% on a compound annual basis over the period, almost double the merger target of 2% to 3% growth. More importantly, our sales growth accelerated significantly over the three years, with 2021 net sales advancing nearly 8.5%. Our strength since merger extends well beyond our financial commitments, as we delivered high-quality, in-market performance, including broad based market share growth across our portfolio, and meaningful expansion of new households using the Keurig system. Importantly, we maintain top line growth each year since the onset of COVID. As we've been able to pivot the growth certain segments of our business faster to offset those that were and, in some cases, continue to be negatively impacted. Market share expansion in cold beverages was driven by exceptional strength in CSDs, which have grown 1.5 share point since 2019. In coffee, the Keurig ecosystem continues to expand with eight million new U.S. households added to the system since 2018. Since 2019, we've driven growth in KDP consolidated net sales of nearly 14% and an adjusted EPS of 31%. These results were fueled by strong execution, successful innovation and high impact marketing. On a three-year basis, key financial metrics including adjusted EPS, management leverage ratio and synergy capture were delivered well within our merger target range, with adjusted EPS up more than 15% on a compound annual basis over the post-merger period. We delivered this performance while building a solid foundation for the future, including the advancement of our corporate responsibility agenda, achieving the goals set before the merger and expanding into new areas such as diversity and inclusion, positive hydration, and regenerative agriculture. All of this is underpinned by a talented team and a culture that rewards bold thinking, speed and a mindset of ownership and accountability. Investors who have been with us since the merger have been rewarded by a total shareholder return of 109% which is more than 2x the Consumer Staples sector index and two times the return of the S&P 500 Index. Important to the delivery of these strong results is how we manage KDP. Our playbook includes a range of strategies and tactics that enable us to navigate through volatile conditions in the short term, to stay true to our long-term vision. A good example is our strategic asset investment program, which we initially launched in 2019 and have used each year since, including in Q4 of 2021 to maintain or increase marketing investment in our brand portfolio. Ozan will discuss more in his remarks. Let's talk about the current environment we're facing. At this point in the earning season, you are fully up to speed on the range of issues negatively impacting the CPG industry. Supply chain disruption driven by labor shortages, lack of material availability and broad transportation issues have reduced industry customer service levels and pressured gross margins. In addition, unprecedented levels of inflation across nearly all components of cost of goods and cost to serve necessitated multiple pricing actions across the industry, most of which lagged inflation in terms of timing in the market. These challenges intensified in the fourth quarter with the onset of Omicron, causing significantly higher absenteeism across manufacturing and commercial frontline workforces. It has been reported that 6% of the U.S. workforce was absent at the start of the new year, due to being infected with COVID or caring for someone who had been infected. As significant as that number is, it actually understates the real impact on supply chains. We, for example, experienced absenteeism at key plants in the double digits, which magnified an already challenged labor situation, causing the workforce to drop below critical threshold levels. We're certainly not alone. Our suppliers have inputs, transportation services, and plant equipment are also experiencing these challenges, which has a compounding effect on our operations. Of course, we don't get paid to report the news but rather to deliver our commitments regardless of the macro situation. That's exactly what we've done. By implementing an unprecedented set of actions to increase labor availability and prioritize our portfolio to ensure availability of the fastest turning highest profit items. A tangible example of the challenges we faced and the solutions we've implemented is in Coffee Systems. Record consumer demand for K-Cup pods bumped up against lower manufacturing output and delayed new capacity availability. Both, directly related to COVID. This caused us to tap into our finished goods inventory in Q4, falling below safety stock levels, which impacted service to our partners and retailers. We have successfully rebuilt production output since the height of Omicron absenteeism, but we are now servicing the continued high consumer demand while working to rebuild inventory, which is a process that we\u2019ll continue well into the next quarter. Ozan will talk more about the impact of the supply challenges in his comments. While we're seeing light at the end of the supply chain tunnel, as the wave of Omicron runs its course, inflationary pressure continues to be persistent. To address continued inflation, we implemented several pricing actions over the past six months and announced more pricing in early 2022. To date, our elasticities have held up nicely. Most of the challenges discussed today were reflected in the 2022 outlook we provided at our October Investor Day. At that time, we expected the impact of supply chain disruption and escalating inflation to be significant headwinds for the year, resulting in our projection for net sales and EPS growth to be in the mid-single digit range for the full year. Nearly five months since Investor Day, we continue to believe this guidance for the full year is realistic. Yet it's important to highlight the expected pacing of results throughout the year. Specifically, we expect Q1 to represent our most challenging comparison to last year, as we managed through the peak levels of supply chain disruption and significant ongoing inflationary pressures. EPS performance is projected to improve starting in Q2 reaching high single digit growth in the second half of 2022 which would put us back on our long-term algorithm. Let me take a few minutes to shift back to 2021 to highlight our full year results. Our top line performance continued to accelerate, with full year net sales growth of more than 8% and all four business segments up strongly. Our Packaged Beverages segment was a standout, posting double digit net sales growth for the year, fueled by an impressive 17% increase in the fourth quarter. Our Beverage Concentrates and Latin America Beverages segments also delivered strong double digit net sales growth in 2021. While our coffee business posted net sales growth of 6% due to an almost 6% increase in pod shipments, and a double digit increase in brewer shipments. In 2021, we added nearly three million new U.S. households to the Keurig system, on top of approximately three million new households added in 2020, which means total U.S. Keurig households are now approaching 36 million. Adjusted EPS for the year advanced more than 15% which translated to 31% EPS growth on a two-year basis as previously mentioned. Strong in-market performance for our brands underpins the delivery of our financials. Our LBR portfolio grew market share across nearly 75% of the portfolio in 2021 and almost 80% when looking at results on a two-year basis. Most notable with continued strength and CSDs, which drew consumption by 26% and market share by 1.5 share points since 2019. In fact, KDP took over the number two share position and CSDs in the grocery channel in 2021. The drivers of our CSD performance are widespread and sustainable. While nearly all of our CSD brands continued to perform well, Dr Pepper was again one of the fastest growing major CSD brands in the U.S. last year, and it was the single fastest growing since 2019. When Fortune recently unveiled its Halo 100 ranking for how well brands serve their consumers, Dr Pepper was the only beverage brand in the top 100 and the only FMCG brand in the top 20. Sunkist took over leadership of the fruit CST segment in 2021, fueled by innovation. Since 2019 Sunkist has grown dollar consumption by 35%. With the success of our zero-sugar innovation in 2021, we gained over three share points in zero-sugar CSDs, capturing a third of the zero-sugar category. And later this year we will be launching Snapple Zero Sugar. Looking at other key segments of our cold beverage portfolio, our CORE, Snapple and Bai brands, whose growth was capped in 2021 by supply chain disruptions demonstrated positive in-market performance as product availability improved in Q3 and Q4. Retail consumption was up double digits for both Core and Bai in the quarter, while Snapple was up 5% in the quarter, and ended with double digit growth in December. The Snapple Refresh, which was designed to bring younger consumers into the franchise with new graphics and sustainable packaging is proving to be successful. Our premium water stream continues to be enhanced by strong partnerships. The success of Polar seltzer demonstrates the power of the KDP distribution network, as we continue to expand availability outside the northeast region, achieving a 4.3% share for our first year in the market for which KDP is responsible for the brand.  Vita Coco, a long-term KDP partner in which we also made an equity investment in 2021 had an exceptional year, growing dollar consumption 33% and market share by almost seven full percentage points to nearly 51% of the coconut water segment. Switching to coffee where retail dollar consumption of single-serve pods manufactured by KDP in tracked channels grew 2.7% for the year, with higher growth achieved in untracked channels due to continued strength in e-commerce and club and a limited return to offices. Growth would have been even higher if not for the Q4 supply chain disruptions which lead to reduce promotions and increase out of stocks. KDP manufactured share remains strong, increasing to 83.2% for the year. As mentioned previously, Keurig household penetration continued to be exceptional, adding eight million new households to the Keurig system since 2018. Further demonstrating the power of the Keurig system, for the first time ever, unit market share of Keurig compatible brewers surpassed traditional drip coffee makers in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we debuted a new platform for Keurig, with the launch of the K-Supreme SMART connected brewer, which is the first of many new connected brewers to come. The consumer reception has been very strong. And we have line of sight to having more than a million connected households in the next few years. Finally, although we don't give our Latin America Beverage segment much airtime on these calls, I'd like to point out that our team delivered 14% revenue growth and 19% operating income growth, behind particular strength in Penafiel and Clamato. In addition to being a strong contributor to total company results, LAB represents an attractive expansion opportunity for KDP. Before I turn it over to Ozan to talk about our 2021 results and our 2022 outlook in more detail, I'd like to reflect on our long-term outlook as discussed at our Investor Day. The completion of our merger period provides an opportunity to reflect on our accomplishments over the past three years, as well as our potential over the next three years. While we will always manage our business through the challenges of the day, we measure ourselves on long-term value creation, and therefore keep our focus on delivering in the present and investing for the future. As we look to the future one of the most attractive aspects of the KDP investment story is our unique potential to drive outsized returns through a combination of an attractive organic growth algorithm, coupled with the opportunity for significant inorganic value creation. You recall from our Investor Day our outlook was to generate approximately $4 billion of discretionary free cash flow between 2022 and 2024. Since Investor Day, we have received proceeds from our BodyArmor investment, as well as funds from the settlement of our litigation against BodyArmor. Combined, this resulted in cash proceeds approaching $1 billion, increasing our discretionary free cash flow outlook over the three-year period to $5 billion. This cash flow is being prioritized to the highest ROI use of our capital, which we continue to believe is strategic M&A, where we have a differentiated and demonstrated management expertise and track record. Discretionary cash of $5 billion translates into more than $20 billion of M&A capacity, assuming the same reasonable expectations we discussed in October. Coming out of Investor Day, we saw a few headlines suggesting that we were looking for a singular large acquisition. Let me assure you that we remain intentional and disciplined in our allocation of capital and that the significance of our more than $20 billion in M&A firepower represents total capacity for M&A, not a singular or targeted deal size. In the absence of value-generating M&A, we will use our new share buyback authorization to opportunistically repurchase shares. Our effective deployment of free cash flow over the previous three years is a good example of how we think about shareholder value creation through deployment of capital. During that time period, debt repayment was our top priority and a strong generator of shareholder value. However, also during that time, we acquired the CORE, Big Red and Limitless brands, made an equity investment in Vita Coco and several startup businesses, brought 22 independent distributor territories into KDP to strengthen our company-owned DSD system and invested in expanded production capacity and high-return plant and warehouse automation projects. At the same time, we also passed on numerous M&A opportunities, including BodyArmor, one we believe it was more prudent to be on the sidelines or a seller rather than a buyer. With our balance sheet and strong position and exceptional free cash flow in front of us, we're excited about our ability to continue to generate strong inorganic returns on top of our attractive organic TSR algorithm. Let me hand it over to Ozan.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, which our press release discusses in significant detail, and then turning to our 2022 guidance. All of this discussion will be on an adjusted basis. Constant currency net sales in the fourth quarter increased 8.5% to $3.49 billion, fueled by higher volume mix of 4.4% and favorable net price realization of 4.1%. This performance was driven by 17% growth in Packaged Beverages as well as very strong growth in Beverage Concentrates and Latin America Beverages. On a two-year basis, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 15.7% versus 2019. Adjusted gross profit increased 47% in the quarter to $1.83 billion. Adjusted gross margin declined 210 basis points versus year ago to 53.8% of net sales. This performance reflected the impact of the significant pricing actions we put in place as well as delivery from our robust productivity program and merger synergies. Offsetting these drivers was the impact of both wide scale, accelerating inflation and supply chain challenges, many of which compounded with the onset of Omicron in the fourth quarter, which is also a seasonally high demand period for us. Adjusted operating income in the quarter grew 6.1% to $910 million driven by the increase in adjusted gross profit and the benefits of productivity and merger synergies that favorably impacted SG&A, as well as $70 million gain in the quarter from our strategic asset investment program. I will talk more about this program in a few moments. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were broad-based inflation in outbound logistics and labor as well as higher marketing investments. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 5.9% versus year ago. And on a three-year basis, adjusted operating income increased 11.9% versus 2019. Adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points to 26.8% of net sales in the quarter, primarily due to the lag between the timing of inflation and pricing. Adjusted net income in the quarter advanced 15.5% to $640 million versus year ago, primarily driven by the growth in adjusted operating income, lower interest expense and lower adjusted tax rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter grew 15.5% to $0.45 compared to $0.39 in the year ago period. Before turning to 2021 full year results, I would like to spend a moment discussing the inflationary pressures and supply chain disruption we have referenced this morning. During the fourth quarter, inflation accelerated considerably. It increased across nearly all key inputs, leading to a double-digit inflation rate across cost of goods sold and SG&A combined, which is significantly higher than we experienced in the third quarter. As we look to 2022, we expect this level of inflation to continue for much of the year, with some moderation expected in the fourth quarter. As Bob explained earlier, similar to others in the industry, we have faced a number of supply chain challenges. However, in quarter four, it was our Coffee Systems business in which short-term profitability was most pressured by the convergence of demand and supply events. Consistently, strong consumer demand for K-Cup pods exceeded our manufacturing output, which was limited due to labor shortages and absenteeism driven by Omicron and a delay of our Spartanburg facility ramp-up, also due to the impact of COVID on our European equipment supplier. As a result, we missed pod revenue opportunities, incurred incremental logistics costs as we expedited the available supply to partners, incurred substantial customer fines when our customer service levels missed targets. It is important to highlight that embedded in our Coffee Systems pricing results are the customer fines related to service levels, which are included on the P&L as a deduction to pricing, which masked the positive net price realization the Coffee Systems achieved in the quarter. As Bob also mentioned, we have taken action to maximize production within our existing network to improve customer sales levels and to meet the continued strong consumer demand. Working closely with our partners, we have been able to simplify variety and implement minimum order sizes. We have also used the supply challenges as an opportunity to rationalize certain SKUs in our owned and licensed brand portfolio. And we have shed some lower-profit partner business. Collectively, these actions are already enabling us to improve production output and rebuild inventory. Our KDP manufactured and to a lesser degree, own aid licensed share that you will see in syndicated data will be negatively impacted by these actions. However, they will have little to no impact on our profitability. Finally, we continue to work with our equipment supplier on ramping up Spartanburg, but we have derisked our plant by increasing capacity at existing facilities and assuming no additional pod capacity coming from Spartanburg until 2023. The actions we have taken to increase production in all other sites will enable us to supply the immediate demand until that time. Let me turn now to our full year results for 2021. Constant currency net sales grew 8.4% to $12.68 billion, driven by higher volume mix of 5.7% and favorable net price realization of 2.7%. More importantly, net sales growth was strong and balanced across each of our business segments. On a two-year basis, KDP net sales advanced 13.9% versus 2019. Adjusted gross profit growth of 7.9% to $7.04 billion equated to a gross margin of 55.5% for the full year, a 70 basis points decline versus last year. This performance reflects a series of pricing actions implemented late in the year, combined with productivity and merger synergies. Offsetting these positives was a significant broad-based inflation and supply chain disruption previously discussed which accelerated in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 7.2% to $3.42 billion and adjusted operating margin declined 50 basis points. Given the industry challenges in 2021, finishing the year with operating margin down only 50 basis points speaks to the underlying strength of our business and the benefits that come with a strong top line growth. In addition to the gross margin performance, also benefiting operating income were strong productivity and merger synergies as well as the year-over-year benefit of our strategic asset investment program. This program, which we started in 2019, creates value from certain assets to enable the investment in strategic assets to drive accelerated growth. Earlier, I mentioned the impact of this program in the fourth quarter results. However, most relevant is the much smaller full year impact of only $28 million, which is significantly below the increase in marketing investment we made in 2021. We plan to continue to use this program in 2022 and beyond. Adjusted net income for the year advanced 14.7% versus a year ago to $2.28 billion, primarily reflecting the growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower interest expense and a lower adjusted tax rate. For the year, adjusted diluted EPS grew 14.3% to $1.60 compared to $1.40 in the year ago period. On a two-year basis adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 31.2% versus 2019. Free cash flow for the full year continued to be strong at almost $2.6 billion, representing a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 113%. This strong free cash flow combined with the cash proceeds of $576 million from the sale of our equity interest in BodyArmor, enabled us to reduce our outstanding bank debt by over $1.7 billion and structural payables by $11 million. We also ended the year with $567 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Due to our growth in earnings and reduction in bank debt, we improved our management leverage ratio to 2.9 times at the end of 2021, which delivers on our merger commitment to achieve a management leverage ratio at or below 3 times. As Bob discussed earlier, in addition to the $576 million received from the sale of our BodyArmor equity interest, we also resolved our litigation against BodyArmor in January, which resulted in additional proceeds of $350 million, driving the combined amount of these items to almost $1 billion in cash proceeds. With these additional proceeds, we now expect to have approximately $5 billion of discretionary cash over the next three years to drive inorganic value creation. Let me now move to our guidance for 2022. Earlier today, we affirmed our 2022 full year guidance for both net sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digit range. Supporting this guidance, we expect the following: Adjusted interest expense is expected to approximate $430 million. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected in the range of 22% to 22.5%. Diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion. Finally, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, given the current environment, I want to share our perspective on how we expect 2022 to unfold over the course of the year. From a timing standpoint, we expect the peak of the supply chain challenges to occur in quarter one, with our results improving through the remaining three quarters. Inflation is expected to pressure margins for much of the year, with some moderation late in 2022. Specifically, supply chain disruption worsened in the second half of last year and is expected to moderate as we lap it in the second half of 2022. Inflation spiked in the second half of last year, particularly in the fourth quarter and as such is expected to moderate as we lap it in the latter part of 2022. Total KDP revenue growth is expected to improve sequentially throughout 2022. From a segment standpoint, it's worth noting that Coffee Systems is expected to start the year slowly as we rebuild inventory to meet strong consumer demand and improved service levels while we're comping net sales growth of 17.4% in quarter one 2021. Included in our guidance is the 53rd week in Coffee Systems which will occur in the fourth quarter of the year. The net of all of these points is that we expect our adjusted earnings per share performance to strength during the year, reaching the high single-digit range in the second half, which is in line with our long-term algorithm. With that, let me hand it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning. I had a couple of questions on your guidance. First, you guys ended 2021 with stronger-than-expected top line, and it really does seem like underlying consumer demand for both your Packaged Beverages and coffee business is strong, yet you did, again, maintain your outlook for this year. So I guess I'm just trying to understand how conservative this might be. And how are you guys thinking about the affordability for your brewers, given the pressures on the consumer, especially the low-income consumer this year? Just trying to understand what's factored into your guidance in terms or on brewers in terms of volume growth and potential down-trading risk? And then just one final quick clarification on your EBIT growth this year. Do you guys expect it to be up mid-single digits as well? Again, I'm just trying to understand that in the context of maybe something below the line driving your mid-single-digit EPS growth outlook for the year? Thanks.\nBob Gamgort: Okay, Bonnie. Good morning and thank you for those questions. Ozan, do you want to talk about the guidance? There were two of them related to guidance, and then I'll come back on the brewer question.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Yes, certainly, Bob. So good morning, Bonnie. So let me start with your last question with regards to the EBIT growth expectations for next year. As we have guided everyone back on October 1 during our Investor Day, our expectation from the top line standpoint of the year [ph] was mid-single digit as well as earnings per share as mid-single digit as well. As you know, we don't guide specifically on either operating income or earnings before interest and taxes. However, as you said we always push and find opportunities to improve below the operating income or the EBIT line, specifically in our interest expense line as well as the taxes. And as you know, over time due to our debt payment capacity along with the improved working capital, I believe we managed to do a pretty good job of lowering our interest expense and that will continue into 2022 as well. At the same time, we always look for further tax effective rate efficiencies, and that will be another good year that we expect as we also guided a little bit lower tax rate expectation in 2022. Therefore, I think this sums up with regards to our guidance and expectations on the profit. Then with that, Bob, you'd like to take the affordability for your brewers?\nBob Gamgort: Yes. Let me talk about the first one, which is about the top line pacing with regard to 2022. You're right the revenue growth has been incredibly strong. If you decompose that growth, we're getting about half of that from volume and mix, which compared to a lot of sectors, is very robust and the remainder of that is coming from pricing. So, I think that's where it gets challenging to forecast, what's going to happen in the balance of the year. We have a great feel for what volume and mix looks like. We're thoughtful about elasticity because we're all entering into uncharted territory here in terms of the price increases collectively that are happening across the industry. And we build it more off of that than we build it off of anticipated pricing going forward. And that's why we thought it's prudent to build a business model that delivers mid-single-digit EPS off of mid-single-digit top line growth. The area we'll have to be thoughtful about and as you look at companies going forward is if top line numbers are exceeded because of additional pricing due to additional inflation, that doesn't mean that any of its ever going to show up in our earnings or EPS. But that's all hypothetical and to come. I think the fact that we build our business model primarily off of volume growth and known pricing is how we got to that guidance. A lot could change between now and this time a year from now based on inflation and pricing trends. With regard to brewer affordability, it's an excellent question because our Number 1 driver of the Keurig system is continued household penetration growth. We've added 8 million households in the past three years, back-to-back years of 3 million households, which is nicely above what we think is our long-term trend. I'll remind everyone that there were concerns. We delivered that 3 million that we had pulled forward from the following year, where we actually had another record year off of demand. We understand very well the critical price points, the threshold price points for consumers at different levels, entry-level, upgrade level. And we also know where there is more sensitivity around pricing and so we've been very strategic in the pricing that we've implemented in our brewers. We've been able to design brewers to value so that we hit an approximately $50 price point and certainly below that on promotion. We know that $100 is the next price point. And then we also know that we have a significant number of brewers that have very low-price elasticity because we offer so much value to them. So even though you'll see pricing move across brewers in aggregate, we will also protect those critical price points and understand that we can lean in more on certain brewers in certain channels where there's less elasticity than others. And we will never be distracted from our overall mandate of driving household penetration.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. That's really helpful. And just if I may just clarify because I know, Bob or Ozan, you mentioned in terms of the brewer volume, that will be quite pressured in Q1 as you work to, I think you mentioned rebuild inventory levels. So, I'm just kind of putting that context of the full year, especially on top of, like you mentioned two really good strong years in terms of brewer volume. I mean, again, just trying to think about what's factored into your guidance. Do you expect total year brewer volume to be up? Or is it more conservative on the brewer side in terms of being flattish for instance?\nBob Gamgort: Yes. I'm glad to be able to clarify that. First of all, the pressure that we're talking about in the rebuilding inventory is all on the pod side.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay.\nBob Gamgort: What's quite remarkable is given all of the global supply chain challenges for a product line that is made overseas and shipped on the ocean and the fact that all of our brewers contain chips in them; our team has been pretty amazing in being able to find alternative materials, chips, et cetera to be able to continue supply brewers. So, brewer supply has not been an issue at all. What we're working towards though as we look at a forecast for the long-term, not just for 2022, but as we think about the long-term for Keurig, we think about 2 million new households per year is what we describe as our long-term trend. And then you \u2013 there's always a significantly higher number of brewers sold, but a lot of those are due to replacements or upgrades. While they show up in our revenue line, they don't really have a material impact on our profitability. That's why we don't focus on brewer sales, nor do we forecast them for you. What's most important are the brewers that are in place to be able to drive new household penetration, and we're fine on that. With regard to pods, we've had incredible demand on pods now. The demand has been increasing every year. We saw it also remained very strong through COVID, although the composition of that growth shifted from away from to at-home, a little bit of that's going back. The issue is that we've been building demand for pods based on that increased installed household base for the Keurig brewers. And as the fourth quarter hit with \u2013 and then later with Omicron into January, we could not supply the current demand. That caused us to draw down our finished goods inventory down to below safety stock levels. And now we're rebuilding that production. Our production is up significantly versus where it was in early January, for example. But now we're serving two masters, we have to solve \u2013 we have to continue to serve strong current demand. And at the same time, we have to take some of that production and use it to restock inventory to improve our efficiency. And that's the process that's going to take another quarter or so. But we've seen the bottom of that, and that was really driven by the absenteeism issue that hit in early January, late Q4. And we're improving that now. So, it's all pod-related with regard to inventory, nothing with brewers at this point.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. Perfect. Very helpful. Thank you.\nBob Gamgort: Okay, Bonnie.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning.\nBob Gamgort: Hi, Chris.\nChris Carey: So just following up on coffee. Typically, when pods outperform, that's a margin tailwind. Obviously, there were other drivers this quarter. And I wonder if you can maybe just review what you see as maybe structural or a bit more lasting to the margin rate this quarter and areas that you would expect to improve from here on a sequential margin rate. Said another way, is this high-20s level of margin base from which to go forward? Or should they sequentially improve with your supply chain? And then just connected to that, on pricing, so in coffee, clearly getting your own business pricing. Can you just maybe frame the impact of the strategic pricing versus these charges that you incurred and your updated thoughts on pricing of the business going forward? Thank you, guys.\nBob Gamgort: Yes, sure. Those are great questions. Let me start with, do I think anything is structural and long-lasting? Simple answer is no. What we're experiencing right now is a supply challenge not a demand challenge. And the supply challenge that we're dealing with is solvable, it's already being solved and it's short-lived. The demand remains incredibly strong based on the fact that we're continuing to drive great household penetration. If you think about the convergence of events that happened in Q4 and carried over into Q1, it's happened to a number of people in the broader CP industry. It really hit us because our demand was so incredibly strong at the same time that it caused a lot of pressure. We just had serious issues in being able to maintain the production due to absenteeism, quite honestly. As I said in my prepared remarks, 6% was the national absenteeism rate in the beginning of January; we had plants that were in regions that were harder hit where the number was a multiple of that. That gets \u2013 you get to a point where your production, you drop below a threshold level for your production, and that's exactly what happened to us. And then there's a series of knock-on effects that happened. All of them are short-lived. But if I give you a sense of it, we missed sales as a result of that. We expedite orders to try to prevent out-of-stocks and service our partners; we prioritized our partners over us in some cases. We are now paying a lot of overtime for people who are showing up. So, all of these things start to build up to cause serious short-term pressure on the business, all of which is being unwound as we speak and none of which is structural in nature. But it has a significant impact, as we said, because we have to rebuild inventory. What compounded this a bit further is we were expecting in late 2021 a ramp-up in new production from our new plant in Spartanburg. And quite frankly, our equipment supplier missed their deadlines. Again, if you think about it, it is a European-driven manufacturing, and they were ahead of us on COVID in general and Omicron, so they started feeling the pressure at the time that we started seeing the demand really ramp up. So that wasn't available to us at the same time. Again, that's solved. We talked about in our script that we've now built our production outside of Spartanburg to be able to handle that demand. We are now giving our supplier full rein of that plant to be able to optimize production without trying to also serve current demand. And we also have a contingency plan should they continue to miss any milestones. We have a backup plan, so we won't let it go any further than 2022. And when Spartanburg is up to full capacity, not only does that represent a growth opportunity that represents productivity that's yet to be realized. So not only is that not a structural issue going forward that's a structural opportunity in front of us. The last point is pricing. Because in an inflationary environment, we know that pricing is critically important. I'll go all the way back to the statements we made more than four years ago when we put the two companies together and we said that with regard to Coffee Systems, we said the strategic pricing investment, which was intentional to get the price point pods down to the appropriate threshold levels, would moderate over time once we hit those thresholds. So, if you think about what's happened since then, 2018 our net pricing in Coffee Systems down about 4%; 2019, down 3%; 2020 down about 2%; 2021 down less than 1%. In Q4, we had positive pricing that was masked by customer service lines. It's one of the knock-on effects of the production issues I talked about. And as we said in our prepared remarks, in 2022, we're putting in more pricing. So, you will see positive pricing in Coffee Systems going forward based on the pricing that we've already put in place. So, we've moved beyond now the strategic price investment into positive pricing, and all of that is yet still in front of us. Again, the most important thing is there are a few, if any CPG businesses that have line of sight to growing their volume in the mid-single-digit range year-after-year by converting people from one behavior to another, which is brewing by the pot to bring by the cup. Not only is that intact, it's been delivered and we still have 55 million potential households remaining to be converted even after we converted eight million in the past three years.\nChris Carey: Thanks Bob.\nBob Gamgort: Okay, Chris, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Hey good morning, everyone. \nBob Gamgort: Yes, good morning.\nKevin Grundy: First, a housekeeping question for Ozan. Just on the tax rate, which has been trending lower here. Just comment, I guess, your expectation longer term and if there's any \u2013 number one, is that sustainable? Number two, is there going to be any difference between the booked tax rate and your cash tax rate? And then Ozan, maybe just spend a moment on commodity cost inflation, which has clearly gotten worse since you initially provided the mid-single-digit EPS growth guidance. Just spend a moment, please, on key exposures, what you're expecting. And then as we think about gross margin, how much you expect to offset with pricing and productivity. Thanks.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Absolutely. Kevin, so with regards to the tax rate, we have initiated and successfully implemented several strategies around lowering our effective tax rate. And when you look to our financials since the onset of putting the two companies together the last three years, I believe we have been quite successful of managing our tax rate. And as I have just explained in our prepared remarks, we expect our tax rate for 2022 to be around 22%, maybe 22.5%. So, that's our ingoing assumptions on the basis of the implementations that we are expecting to deliver the results for us. So, that's number one. And on a normalized basis, probably 2022 levels will more or less sustain, maybe a little bit lower, but not much. So, that's our expectation with regards to overall effective tax rates for 2022 and beyond. So, let's talk a little bit about the inflation in the commodities and our exposures, right? So, as you all know, inflation accelerated throughout 2021, with the fourth quarter in 2021 increasing double digits. It's significantly higher than what we anticipated, and we also expect to continue through much of 2022, with some moderation in the fourth quarter. So as Bob also alluded a little bit ago, we expect quarter one to be the most challenging comparison to last year, when I say quarter one, I mean 2022, as we manage through peak levels of supply chain disruption and significant ongoing inflation. But when you look right now through our overall commodity exposures, we think it will cover six to nine months. Therefore, we feel that we are well covered for 2022, but we continue to layer in some further coverage, albeit at significantly higher rates than last year at this time. And some costs, like transportation, some packaging materials like polypropylene, which is the material for K-Cup, for example, that we can't hedge them because there is no any structured market that we can hedge. Therefore, we believe that we struck a good balance right now with regards to our coverages, the impact of the overall commodity inflation, along with other input costs in 2022 versus 2021. We also, for example, in coffee, had longer positions in 2020 as well as 2021. But our low-cost positions are now fully utilized, which making green coffee, for example, one of the largest percent changes year-over-year in our basket of input costs of KDP. But all these assumptions that we have built in our guidance and in our numbers that we have just reported. Therefore, we believe that we have a good balance right now of dealing and managing the overall inflation, which is arising as a result of all input costs, transportation, along with labor in relation to the guidance that we put along with the margin structure quarter in, quarter out.\nKevin Grundy: Okay. Thanks for the color. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s number of other questions. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks.\nBob Gamgort: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge.\nBrett Cooper: Good morning. A question on how you look at the portfolio in its entirety in making business and price decision. I guess the specific question is that with the cold beverage business performing well, how much flexibility does that give you in potentially taking with less pricing coffee in order to manage pod pricing to the levels that you target with your prior strategic actions? And then just a follow-up from that. Would love any thoughts on the impact of pod pricing moving back above those target levels given the pricing action. Thanks.\nBob Gamgort: Okay. Yes, Brett, thank you. The benefit of the portfolio that we have is a bit of diversification in terms of different consumer trends, different competitive dynamics, et cetera. And so, if you go all the way back to the commitments we put out there in 2018 and the fact that we've been able to deliver them despite all of these challenges that we're with COVID, now inflation, supply chain disruption, et cetera, that's the benefit of having the portfolio that we have, that we're able to leverage one part of the portfolio to be able to offset challenges in the others. And then you've seen it reversed in certain situations, where coffee was over-delivering to help one side of the business and now the cold business in some cases in Q4 was able to do that. That's great from an investor perspective. With regard to how we take pricing though, we don't think about it that way. We look at pricing at the consumer level segment-by-segment. We understand price elasticities, competitive dynamics. And in an inflationary environment like the one that we're in right now, we're going to push pricing as hard as we possibly can based on our best assessment of the impact on that individual business. And that does put us in a position where we say because we can take pricing in one area, we'll take less pricing in the other. We take the maximum amount of pricing that we can in each individual business until we get to the point where we think it adversely impacts demand to a level in which it's not a great business decision. But the diversification of the portfolio, though, allows us to step back and we deliver consolidated results and have the confidence that we are able to deliver against the guidance that we put forward despite all the uncertainty and volatility that we face. Can we take the next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Thanks. Good morning. This is probably a good lead into the last conversation. But I feel like there was, Bob, in your comments over the last few minutes is really sort of passion discussion of the visibility that you think you have to sustain volume growth as you have been keeping the transition in cost and driving consumer behavior. But I was curious how you think about the structural potential of the Keurig businesses. I'm guessing this is where the bulk of the M&A is expected to reside. You've already made all these moves, of course, on route to market So, can you talk a little bit about sort of the structural potential and how you think about volume perhaps versus price mix in those businesses as well? I'd just be curious to kind of hear your same kind of multiyear view on that side of the business. Thanks.\nBob Gamgort: Yes, great question. Our cold business has performed exceptionally well since the merger. It's been driven by the formula that we discussed a number of times, which is building share and volume growth on core brands through renovation and marketing. Countless examples of that, and I won't repeat them because we mentioned most of them in our prepared remarks. Innovating into white space and also doing partnerships and acquisitions to fill in territory that we are covered with our current portfolio and then investing in and improving our route to market to ensure that the delivery, the merchandising, the servicing on the cold side of the business improves every single year. And it's the combination of those three that's delivering the very strong results. What I just described has a significant amount of runway in front of it. You mentioned we've done a lot of work on the route-to-market side, bringing in independent territories into our system. We've also invested heavily to improve the delivery and effectiveness of our system where we already cover. There's still plenty of runway left on both of those. White space, we still have significant amount of open territory in our portfolio to be able to fill in to leverage that distribution system as well as the marketing strength that we have. And we still have tremendous line of sight to the innovation and renovation on our existing brand portfolio. As we talked about three years ago, a lot of conversations, will allow Dr. Pepper has been successful. You can't possibly grow that any further. What else are you going to do? And then I would point out that Dr. Pepper was the fastest-growing major CSD in the past two years driven by marketing innovation. And we feel like we still have plenty more to go on that. So, it's that combination of existing brands, white space and distribution system effectiveness that gives us line of sight to significant growth still in front of us.\nLauren Lieberman: Thank you so much.\nBob Gamgort: Okay, thanks Lauren.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to double click on your comments about M&A. Bob, should we interpret that the Board is mostly looking for bolt-on M&A compared to bigger transactions? And if so, what are the white spaces at this point? Would energy and coffee shops be out of question in this scenario. And related to that, on your use of capital, you mentioned buybacks. Normally, you don't embed that in guidance. So, I just wanted to clarify that on 2022. And lastly, on pricing, I think, what is included in your mid-single digits, and correct me if I'm wrong, you are assuming what is in the market already. And with the labor and other costs where sitting since your Analyst Day, would you contemplate additional pricing at this point? Thank you.\nBob Gamgort: Okay. Yes, on the M&A side, what we've talked about is our capacity for M&A. So, we say it's north of $20 billion based on the $5 billion of discretionary free cash flow and some of the assumptions that we put forward in the Investor Day. The clarification we were making today is there were a number of headlines that came out of that where people said we were looking for a $20 billion acquisition. And what we're saying is that we've got significant capacity to continue to do acquisitions of a variety of sizes and our four areas are filling in the white space as we just talked about, continuing to build our distribution capabilities, which we also talked about; adding new capabilities which as we get further along we could explain some of that; and then obviously, we always have the opportunity for some geographic expansion. We operate in North America today, heavily in the U.S., with nice positions in Canada and Mexico. We talked about today Latin American beverages, for example, just continuing to deliver fantastic results that are accretive to total KDP. That's an area where we could see some opportunity for additional investment. So, we have a wide range of targets, all of which are strategic. They range in sizes, but we wanted to clarify that we're looking at a $20 billion plus as capacity, not as a target. Ozan is going to talk about buybacks in a second. With regard to pricing the pricing that we have in the plan is not just what we've already put in place, but also pricing that we've already announced that's happening in the early part of 2022. With regard to the rest of the year we always say we need to be flexible based on inflation, productivity, pricing and marketing investment. And we don't talk about any one lever in the future at the expense of others. We look at all four in combination, and that's how we will continue to manage through 2022. And Ozan, do you want to \u2013 I think this will be our last question. Do you want to end this on the buyback conversation?\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Yes, absolutely, Bob. And hello Andrea. So, a couple of quick points on our buybacks. I just want to remind ourselves that our Board has authorized us a four-year program up to $4 billion of buyback, which started January of this year through end of December 2025. And we also expressed before that our program is an opportunistic one. It's not formulaic by any mean. It would just depend on the market conditions and will be at the discretion of the management to decide on a buyback or not. And I believe, Andrea, as you said, in line with our Investor Day announcement, and we are also repeating now, we did not build any plus or minus that may come as a result of our buyback decision into our guidance for 2022. It is also fair to say, as Bob explained just now, that our priority to use our capital as well as cash would be in M&A. For some reason, in absence of that, that we may decide to do some buybacks, again on an opportunistic basis. So that will be my couple of quick remarks on the buyback. Thank you.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, both.\nBob Gamgort: Thanks.\nOperator: I'll now turn it back over to management for closing remarks.\nSteve Alexander: Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. The IR team, Maria and myself will be around all day. If you have questions, please reach out to us, we would love to talk to you. Thank you very much and have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ozan Dokmecioglu",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, which our press release discusses in significant detail, and then turning to our 2022 guidance. All of this discussion will be on an adjusted basis. Constant currency net sales in the fourth quarter increased 8.5% to $3.49 billion, fueled by higher volume mix of 4.4% and favorable net price realization of 4.1%. This performance was driven by 17% growth in Packaged Beverages as well as very strong growth in Beverage Concentrates and Latin America Beverages. On a two-year basis, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 15.7% versus 2019. Adjusted gross profit increased 47% in the quarter to $1.83 billion. Adjusted gross margin declined 210 basis points versus year ago to 53.8% of net sales. This performance reflected the impact of the significant pricing actions we put in place as well as delivery from our robust productivity program and merger synergies. Offsetting these drivers was the impact of both wide scale, accelerating inflation and supply chain challenges, many of which compounded with the onset of Omicron in the fourth quarter, which is also a seasonally high demand period for us. Adjusted operating income in the quarter grew 6.1% to $910 million driven by the increase in adjusted gross profit and the benefits of productivity and merger synergies that favorably impacted SG&A, as well as $70 million gain in the quarter from our strategic asset investment program. I will talk more about this program in a few moments. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were broad-based inflation in outbound logistics and labor as well as higher marketing investments. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 5.9% versus year ago. And on a three-year basis, adjusted operating income increased 11.9% versus 2019. Adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points to 26.8% of net sales in the quarter, primarily due to the lag between the timing of inflation and pricing. Adjusted net income in the quarter advanced 15.5% to $640 million versus year ago, primarily driven by the growth in adjusted operating income, lower interest expense and lower adjusted tax rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter grew 15.5% to $0.45 compared to $0.39 in the year ago period. Before turning to 2021 full year results, I would like to spend a moment discussing the inflationary pressures and supply chain disruption we have referenced this morning. During the fourth quarter, inflation accelerated considerably. It increased across nearly all key inputs, leading to a double-digit inflation rate across cost of goods sold and SG&A combined, which is significantly higher than we experienced in the third quarter. As we look to 2022, we expect this level of inflation to continue for much of the year, with some moderation expected in the fourth quarter. As Bob explained earlier, similar to others in the industry, we have faced a number of supply chain challenges. However, in quarter four, it was our Coffee Systems business in which short-term profitability was most pressured by the convergence of demand and supply events. Consistently, strong consumer demand for K-Cup pods exceeded our manufacturing output, which was limited due to labor shortages and absenteeism driven by Omicron and a delay of our Spartanburg facility ramp-up, also due to the impact of COVID on our European equipment supplier. As a result, we missed pod revenue opportunities, incurred incremental logistics costs as we expedited the available supply to partners, incurred substantial customer fines when our customer service levels missed targets. It is important to highlight that embedded in our Coffee Systems pricing results are the customer fines related to service levels, which are included on the P&L as a deduction to pricing, which masked the positive net price realization the Coffee Systems achieved in the quarter. As Bob also mentioned, we have taken action to maximize production within our existing network to improve customer sales levels and to meet the continued strong consumer demand. Working closely with our partners, we have been able to simplify variety and implement minimum order sizes. We have also used the supply challenges as an opportunity to rationalize certain SKUs in our owned and licensed brand portfolio. And we have shed some lower-profit partner business. Collectively, these actions are already enabling us to improve production output and rebuild inventory. Our KDP manufactured and to a lesser degree, own aid licensed share that you will see in syndicated data will be negatively impacted by these actions. However, they will have little to no impact on our profitability. Finally, we continue to work with our equipment supplier on ramping up Spartanburg, but we have derisked our plant by increasing capacity at existing facilities and assuming no additional pod capacity coming from Spartanburg until 2023. The actions we have taken to increase production in all other sites will enable us to supply the immediate demand until that time. Let me turn now to our full year results for 2021. Constant currency net sales grew 8.4% to $12.68 billion, driven by higher volume mix of 5.7% and favorable net price realization of 2.7%. More importantly, net sales growth was strong and balanced across each of our business segments. On a two-year basis, KDP net sales advanced 13.9% versus 2019. Adjusted gross profit growth of 7.9% to $7.04 billion equated to a gross margin of 55.5% for the full year, a 70 basis points decline versus last year. This performance reflects a series of pricing actions implemented late in the year, combined with productivity and merger synergies. Offsetting these positives was a significant broad-based inflation and supply chain disruption previously discussed which accelerated in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 7.2% to $3.42 billion and adjusted operating margin declined 50 basis points. Given the industry challenges in 2021, finishing the year with operating margin down only 50 basis points speaks to the underlying strength of our business and the benefits that come with a strong top line growth. In addition to the gross margin performance, also benefiting operating income were strong productivity and merger synergies as well as the year-over-year benefit of our strategic asset investment program. This program, which we started in 2019, creates value from certain assets to enable the investment in strategic assets to drive accelerated growth. Earlier, I mentioned the impact of this program in the fourth quarter results. However, most relevant is the much smaller full year impact of only $28 million, which is significantly below the increase in marketing investment we made in 2021. We plan to continue to use this program in 2022 and beyond. Adjusted net income for the year advanced 14.7% versus a year ago to $2.28 billion, primarily reflecting the growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower interest expense and a lower adjusted tax rate. For the year, adjusted diluted EPS grew 14.3% to $1.60 compared to $1.40 in the year ago period. On a two-year basis adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 31.2% versus 2019. Free cash flow for the full year continued to be strong at almost $2.6 billion, representing a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 113%. This strong free cash flow combined with the cash proceeds of $576 million from the sale of our equity interest in BodyArmor, enabled us to reduce our outstanding bank debt by over $1.7 billion and structural payables by $11 million. We also ended the year with $567 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Due to our growth in earnings and reduction in bank debt, we improved our management leverage ratio to 2.9 times at the end of 2021, which delivers on our merger commitment to achieve a management leverage ratio at or below 3 times. As Bob discussed earlier, in addition to the $576 million received from the sale of our BodyArmor equity interest, we also resolved our litigation against BodyArmor in January, which resulted in additional proceeds of $350 million, driving the combined amount of these items to almost $1 billion in cash proceeds. With these additional proceeds, we now expect to have approximately $5 billion of discretionary cash over the next three years to drive inorganic value creation. Let me now move to our guidance for 2022. Earlier today, we affirmed our 2022 full year guidance for both net sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digit range. Supporting this guidance, we expect the following: Adjusted interest expense is expected to approximate $430 million. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected in the range of 22% to 22.5%. Diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion. Finally, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, given the current environment, I want to share our perspective on how we expect 2022 to unfold over the course of the year. From a timing standpoint, we expect the peak of the supply chain challenges to occur in quarter one, with our results improving through the remaining three quarters. Inflation is expected to pressure margins for much of the year, with some moderation late in 2022. Specifically, supply chain disruption worsened in the second half of last year and is expected to moderate as we lap it in the second half of 2022. Inflation spiked in the second half of last year, particularly in the fourth quarter and as such is expected to moderate as we lap it in the latter part of 2022. Total KDP revenue growth is expected to improve sequentially throughout 2022. From a segment standpoint, it's worth noting that Coffee Systems is expected to start the year slowly as we rebuild inventory to meet strong consumer demand and improved service levels while we're comping net sales growth of 17.4% in quarter one 2021. Included in our guidance is the 53rd week in Coffee Systems which will occur in the fourth quarter of the year. The net of all of these points is that we expect our adjusted earnings per share performance to strength during the year, reaching the high single-digit range in the second half, which is in line with our long-term algorithm. With that, let me hand it back to the operator for questions. Yes, certainly, Bob. So good morning, Bonnie. So let me start with your last question with regards to the EBIT growth expectations for next year. As we have guided everyone back on October 1 during our Investor Day, our expectation from the top line standpoint of the year [ph] was mid-single digit as well as earnings per share as mid-single digit as well. As you know, we don't guide specifically on either operating income or earnings before interest and taxes. However, as you said we always push and find opportunities to improve below the operating income or the EBIT line, specifically in our interest expense line as well as the taxes. And as you know, over time due to our debt payment capacity along with the improved working capital, I believe we managed to do a pretty good job of lowering our interest expense and that will continue into 2022 as well. At the same time, we always look for further tax effective rate efficiencies, and that will be another good year that we expect as we also guided a little bit lower tax rate expectation in 2022. Therefore, I think this sums up with regards to our guidance and expectations on the profit. Then with that, Bob, you'd like to take the affordability for your brewers? Absolutely. Kevin, so with regards to the tax rate, we have initiated and successfully implemented several strategies around lowering our effective tax rate. And when you look to our financials since the onset of putting the two companies together the last three years, I believe we have been quite successful of managing our tax rate. And as I have just explained in our prepared remarks, we expect our tax rate for 2022 to be around 22%, maybe 22.5%. So, that's our ingoing assumptions on the basis of the implementations that we are expecting to deliver the results for us. So, that's number one. And on a normalized basis, probably 2022 levels will more or less sustain, maybe a little bit lower, but not much. So, that's our expectation with regards to overall effective tax rates for 2022 and beyond. So, let's talk a little bit about the inflation in the commodities and our exposures, right? So, as you all know, inflation accelerated throughout 2021, with the fourth quarter in 2021 increasing double digits. It's significantly higher than what we anticipated, and we also expect to continue through much of 2022, with some moderation in the fourth quarter. So as Bob also alluded a little bit ago, we expect quarter one to be the most challenging comparison to last year, when I say quarter one, I mean 2022, as we manage through peak levels of supply chain disruption and significant ongoing inflation. But when you look right now through our overall commodity exposures, we think it will cover six to nine months. Therefore, we feel that we are well covered for 2022, but we continue to layer in some further coverage, albeit at significantly higher rates than last year at this time. And some costs, like transportation, some packaging materials like polypropylene, which is the material for K-Cup, for example, that we can't hedge them because there is no any structured market that we can hedge. Therefore, we believe that we struck a good balance right now with regards to our coverages, the impact of the overall commodity inflation, along with other input costs in 2022 versus 2021. We also, for example, in coffee, had longer positions in 2020 as well as 2021. But our low-cost positions are now fully utilized, which making green coffee, for example, one of the largest percent changes year-over-year in our basket of input costs of KDP. But all these assumptions that we have built in our guidance and in our numbers that we have just reported. Therefore, we believe that we have a good balance right now of dealing and managing the overall inflation, which is arising as a result of all input costs, transportation, along with labor in relation to the guidance that we put along with the margin structure quarter in, quarter out. Thanks. Yes, absolutely, Bob. And hello Andrea. So, a couple of quick points on our buybacks. I just want to remind ourselves that our Board has authorized us a four-year program up to $4 billion of buyback, which started January of this year through end of December 2025. And we also expressed before that our program is an opportunistic one. It's not formulaic by any mean. It would just depend on the market conditions and will be at the discretion of the management to decide on a buyback or not. And I believe, Andrea, as you said, in line with our Investor Day announcement, and we are also repeating now, we did not build any plus or minus that may come as a result of our buyback decision into our guidance for 2022. It is also fair to say, as Bob explained just now, that our priority to use our capital as well as cash would be in M&A. For some reason, in absence of that, that we may decide to do some buybacks, again on an opportunistic basis. So that will be my couple of quick remarks on the buyback. Thank you."

            "name": "Bob Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. As you recall, this past quarter represents the completion of our three-year merger plan and the beginning of the next chapter of our transformation and growth, as we detailed for you during our Investor Day in October. With the merger plan now in the record books, I am pleased to report that we met or exceeded all of our key commitments, and we have demonstrated the power of our new company with a significantly faster growing business than at the time of the merger. The volatile macro environment we have faced since the merger has tested the industry and our business. It has also provided the opportunity for KDP to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model and our ability to withstand unforeseen events and deliver on our long-term commitments. In terms of a few specifics, our top-line strength over the past three years is a standout, growing approximately 5% on a compound annual basis over the period, almost double the merger target of 2% to 3% growth. More importantly, our sales growth accelerated significantly over the three years, with 2021 net sales advancing nearly 8.5%. Our strength since merger extends well beyond our financial commitments, as we delivered high-quality, in-market performance, including broad based market share growth across our portfolio, and meaningful expansion of new households using the Keurig system. Importantly, we maintain top line growth each year since the onset of COVID. As we've been able to pivot the growth certain segments of our business faster to offset those that were and, in some cases, continue to be negatively impacted. Market share expansion in cold beverages was driven by exceptional strength in CSDs, which have grown 1.5 share point since 2019. In coffee, the Keurig ecosystem continues to expand with eight million new U.S. households added to the system since 2018. Since 2019, we've driven growth in KDP consolidated net sales of nearly 14% and an adjusted EPS of 31%. These results were fueled by strong execution, successful innovation and high impact marketing. On a three-year basis, key financial metrics including adjusted EPS, management leverage ratio and synergy capture were delivered well within our merger target range, with adjusted EPS up more than 15% on a compound annual basis over the post-merger period. We delivered this performance while building a solid foundation for the future, including the advancement of our corporate responsibility agenda, achieving the goals set before the merger and expanding into new areas such as diversity and inclusion, positive hydration, and regenerative agriculture. All of this is underpinned by a talented team and a culture that rewards bold thinking, speed and a mindset of ownership and accountability. Investors who have been with us since the merger have been rewarded by a total shareholder return of 109% which is more than 2x the Consumer Staples sector index and two times the return of the S&P 500 Index. Important to the delivery of these strong results is how we manage KDP. Our playbook includes a range of strategies and tactics that enable us to navigate through volatile conditions in the short term, to stay true to our long-term vision. A good example is our strategic asset investment program, which we initially launched in 2019 and have used each year since, including in Q4 of 2021 to maintain or increase marketing investment in our brand portfolio. Ozan will discuss more in his remarks. Let's talk about the current environment we're facing. At this point in the earning season, you are fully up to speed on the range of issues negatively impacting the CPG industry. Supply chain disruption driven by labor shortages, lack of material availability and broad transportation issues have reduced industry customer service levels and pressured gross margins. In addition, unprecedented levels of inflation across nearly all components of cost of goods and cost to serve necessitated multiple pricing actions across the industry, most of which lagged inflation in terms of timing in the market. These challenges intensified in the fourth quarter with the onset of Omicron, causing significantly higher absenteeism across manufacturing and commercial frontline workforces. It has been reported that 6% of the U.S. workforce was absent at the start of the new year, due to being infected with COVID or caring for someone who had been infected. As significant as that number is, it actually understates the real impact on supply chains. We, for example, experienced absenteeism at key plants in the double digits, which magnified an already challenged labor situation, causing the workforce to drop below critical threshold levels. We're certainly not alone. Our suppliers have inputs, transportation services, and plant equipment are also experiencing these challenges, which has a compounding effect on our operations. Of course, we don't get paid to report the news but rather to deliver our commitments regardless of the macro situation. That's exactly what we've done. By implementing an unprecedented set of actions to increase labor availability and prioritize our portfolio to ensure availability of the fastest turning highest profit items. A tangible example of the challenges we faced and the solutions we've implemented is in Coffee Systems. Record consumer demand for K-Cup pods bumped up against lower manufacturing output and delayed new capacity availability. Both, directly related to COVID. This caused us to tap into our finished goods inventory in Q4, falling below safety stock levels, which impacted service to our partners and retailers. We have successfully rebuilt production output since the height of Omicron absenteeism, but we are now servicing the continued high consumer demand while working to rebuild inventory, which is a process that we'll continue well into the next quarter. Ozan will talk more about the impact of the supply challenges in his comments. While we're seeing light at the end of the supply chain tunnel, as the wave of Omicron runs its course, inflationary pressure continues to be persistent. To address continued inflation, we implemented several pricing actions over the past six months and announced more pricing in early 2022. To date, our elasticities have held up nicely. Most of the challenges discussed today were reflected in the 2022 outlook we provided at our October Investor Day. At that time, we expected the impact of supply chain disruption and escalating inflation to be significant headwinds for the year, resulting in our projection for net sales and EPS growth to be in the mid-single digit range for the full year. Nearly five months since Investor Day, we continue to believe this guidance for the full year is realistic. Yet it's important to highlight the expected pacing of results throughout the year. Specifically, we expect Q1 to represent our most challenging comparison to last year, as we managed through the peak levels of supply chain disruption and significant ongoing inflationary pressures. EPS performance is projected to improve starting in Q2 reaching high single digit growth in the second half of 2022 which would put us back on our long-term algorithm. Let me take a few minutes to shift back to 2021 to highlight our full year results. Our top line performance continued to accelerate, with full year net sales growth of more than 8% and all four business segments up strongly. Our Packaged Beverages segment was a standout, posting double digit net sales growth for the year, fueled by an impressive 17% increase in the fourth quarter. Our Beverage Concentrates and Latin America Beverages segments also delivered strong double digit net sales growth in 2021. While our coffee business posted net sales growth of 6% due to an almost 6% increase in pod shipments, and a double digit increase in brewer shipments. In 2021, we added nearly three million new U.S. households to the Keurig system, on top of approximately three million new households added in 2020, which means total U.S. Keurig households are now approaching 36 million. Adjusted EPS for the year advanced more than 15% which translated to 31% EPS growth on a two-year basis as previously mentioned. Strong in-market performance for our brands underpins the delivery of our financials. Our LBR portfolio grew market share across nearly 75% of the portfolio in 2021 and almost 80% when looking at results on a two-year basis. Most notable with continued strength and CSDs, which drew consumption by 26% and market share by 1.5 share points since 2019. In fact, KDP took over the number two share position and CSDs in the grocery channel in 2021. The drivers of our CSD performance are widespread and sustainable. While nearly all of our CSD brands continued to perform well, Dr Pepper was again one of the fastest growing major CSD brands in the U.S. last year, and it was the single fastest growing since 2019. When Fortune recently unveiled its Halo 100 ranking for how well brands serve their consumers, Dr Pepper was the only beverage brand in the top 100 and the only FMCG brand in the top 20. Sunkist took over leadership of the fruit CST segment in 2021, fueled by innovation. Since 2019 Sunkist has grown dollar consumption by 35%. With the success of our zero-sugar innovation in 2021, we gained over three share points in zero-sugar CSDs, capturing a third of the zero-sugar category. And later this year we will be launching Snapple Zero Sugar. Looking at other key segments of our cold beverage portfolio, our CORE, Snapple and Bai brands, whose growth was capped in 2021 by supply chain disruptions demonstrated positive in-market performance as product availability improved in Q3 and Q4. Retail consumption was up double digits for both Core and Bai in the quarter, while Snapple was up 5% in the quarter, and ended with double digit growth in December. The Snapple Refresh, which was designed to bring younger consumers into the franchise with new graphics and sustainable packaging is proving to be successful. Our premium water stream continues to be enhanced by strong partnerships. The success of Polar seltzer demonstrates the power of the KDP distribution network, as we continue to expand availability outside the northeast region, achieving a 4.3% share for our first year in the market for which KDP is responsible for the brand.  Vita Coco, a long-term KDP partner in which we also made an equity investment in 2021 had an exceptional year, growing dollar consumption 33% and market share by almost seven full percentage points to nearly 51% of the coconut water segment. Switching to coffee where retail dollar consumption of single-serve pods manufactured by KDP in tracked channels grew 2.7% for the year, with higher growth achieved in untracked channels due to continued strength in e-commerce and club and a limited return to offices. Growth would have been even higher if not for the Q4 supply chain disruptions which lead to reduce promotions and increase out of stocks. KDP manufactured share remains strong, increasing to 83.2% for the year. As mentioned previously, Keurig household penetration continued to be exceptional, adding eight million new households to the Keurig system since 2018. Further demonstrating the power of the Keurig system, for the first time ever, unit market share of Keurig compatible brewers surpassed traditional drip coffee makers in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we debuted a new platform for Keurig, with the launch of the K-Supreme SMART connected brewer, which is the first of many new connected brewers to come. The consumer reception has been very strong. And we have line of sight to having more than a million connected households in the next few years. Finally, although we don't give our Latin America Beverage segment much airtime on these calls, I'd like to point out that our team delivered 14% revenue growth and 19% operating income growth, behind particular strength in Penafiel and Clamato. In addition to being a strong contributor to total company results, LAB represents an attractive expansion opportunity for KDP. Before I turn it over to Ozan to talk about our 2021 results and our 2022 outlook in more detail, I'd like to reflect on our long-term outlook as discussed at our Investor Day. The completion of our merger period provides an opportunity to reflect on our accomplishments over the past three years, as well as our potential over the next three years. While we will always manage our business through the challenges of the day, we measure ourselves on long-term value creation, and therefore keep our focus on delivering in the present and investing for the future. As we look to the future one of the most attractive aspects of the KDP investment story is our unique potential to drive outsized returns through a combination of an attractive organic growth algorithm, coupled with the opportunity for significant inorganic value creation. You recall from our Investor Day our outlook was to generate approximately $4 billion of discretionary free cash flow between 2022 and 2024. Since Investor Day, we have received proceeds from our BodyArmor investment, as well as funds from the settlement of our litigation against BodyArmor. Combined, this resulted in cash proceeds approaching $1 billion, increasing our discretionary free cash flow outlook over the three-year period to $5 billion. This cash flow is being prioritized to the highest ROI use of our capital, which we continue to believe is strategic M&A, where we have a differentiated and demonstrated management expertise and track record. Discretionary cash of $5 billion translates into more than $20 billion of M&A capacity, assuming the same reasonable expectations we discussed in October. Coming out of Investor Day, we saw a few headlines suggesting that we were looking for a singular large acquisition. Let me assure you that we remain intentional and disciplined in our allocation of capital and that the significance of our more than $20 billion in M&A firepower represents total capacity for M&A, not a singular or targeted deal size. In the absence of value-generating M&A, we will use our new share buyback authorization to opportunistically repurchase shares. Our effective deployment of free cash flow over the previous three years is a good example of how we think about shareholder value creation through deployment of capital. During that time period, debt repayment was our top priority and a strong generator of shareholder value. However, also during that time, we acquired the CORE, Big Red and Limitless brands, made an equity investment in Vita Coco and several startup businesses, brought 22 independent distributor territories into KDP to strengthen our company-owned DSD system and invested in expanded production capacity and high-return plant and warehouse automation projects. At the same time, we also passed on numerous M&A opportunities, including BodyArmor, one we believe it was more prudent to be on the sidelines or a seller rather than a buyer. With our balance sheet and strong position and exceptional free cash flow in front of us, we're excited about our ability to continue to generate strong inorganic returns on top of our attractive organic TSR algorithm. Let me hand it over to Ozan. Okay, Bonnie. Good morning and thank you for those questions. Ozan, do you want to talk about the guidance? There were two of them related to guidance, and then I'll come back on the brewer question. Yes. Let me talk about the first one, which is about the top line pacing with regard to 2022. You're right the revenue growth has been incredibly strong. If you decompose that growth, we're getting about half of that from volume and mix, which compared to a lot of sectors, is very robust and the remainder of that is coming from pricing. So, I think that's where it gets challenging to forecast, what's going to happen in the balance of the year. We have a great feel for what volume and mix looks like. We're thoughtful about elasticity because we're all entering into uncharted territory here in terms of the price increases collectively that are happening across the industry. And we build it more off of that than we build it off of anticipated pricing going forward. And that's why we thought it's prudent to build a business model that delivers mid-single-digit EPS off of mid-single-digit top line growth. The area we'll have to be thoughtful about and as you look at companies going forward is if top line numbers are exceeded because of additional pricing due to additional inflation, that doesn't mean that any of its ever going to show up in our earnings or EPS. But that's all hypothetical and to come. I think the fact that we build our business model primarily off of volume growth and known pricing is how we got to that guidance. A lot could change between now and this time a year from now based on inflation and pricing trends. With regard to brewer affordability, it's an excellent question because our Number 1 driver of the Keurig system is continued household penetration growth. We've added 8 million households in the past three years, back-to-back years of 3 million households, which is nicely above what we think is our long-term trend. I'll remind everyone that there were concerns. We delivered that 3 million that we had pulled forward from the following year, where we actually had another record year off of demand. We understand very well the critical price points, the threshold price points for consumers at different levels, entry-level, upgrade level. And we also know where there is more sensitivity around pricing and so we've been very strategic in the pricing that we've implemented in our brewers. We've been able to design brewers to value so that we hit an approximately $50 price point and certainly below that on promotion. We know that $100 is the next price point. And then we also know that we have a significant number of brewers that have very low-price elasticity because we offer so much value to them. So even though you'll see pricing move across brewers in aggregate, we will also protect those critical price points and understand that we can lean in more on certain brewers in certain channels where there's less elasticity than others. And we will never be distracted from our overall mandate of driving household penetration. Yes. I'm glad to be able to clarify that. First of all, the pressure that we're talking about in the rebuilding inventory is all on the pod side. What's quite remarkable is given all of the global supply chain challenges for a product line that is made overseas and shipped on the ocean and the fact that all of our brewers contain chips in them; our team has been pretty amazing in being able to find alternative materials, chips, et cetera to be able to continue supply brewers. So, brewer supply has not been an issue at all. What we're working towards though as we look at a forecast for the long-term, not just for 2022, but as we think about the long-term for Keurig, we think about 2 million new households per year is what we describe as our long-term trend. And then you \u2013 there's always a significantly higher number of brewers sold, but a lot of those are due to replacements or upgrades. While they show up in our revenue line, they don't really have a material impact on our profitability. That's why we don't focus on brewer sales, nor do we forecast them for you. What's most important are the brewers that are in place to be able to drive new household penetration, and we're fine on that. With regard to pods, we've had incredible demand on pods now. The demand has been increasing every year. We saw it also remained very strong through COVID, although the composition of that growth shifted from away from to at-home, a little bit of that's going back. The issue is that we've been building demand for pods based on that increased installed household base for the Keurig brewers. And as the fourth quarter hit with \u2013 and then later with Omicron into January, we could not supply the current demand. That caused us to draw down our finished goods inventory down to below safety stock levels. And now we're rebuilding that production. Our production is up significantly versus where it was in early January, for example. But now we're serving two masters, we have to solve \u2013 we have to continue to serve strong current demand. And at the same time, we have to take some of that production and use it to restock inventory to improve our efficiency. And that's the process that's going to take another quarter or so. But we've seen the bottom of that, and that was really driven by the absenteeism issue that hit in early January, late Q4. And we're improving that now. So, it's all pod-related with regard to inventory, nothing with brewers at this point. Okay, Bonnie. Hi, Chris. Yes, sure. Those are great questions. Let me start with, do I think anything is structural and long-lasting? Simple answer is no. What we're experiencing right now is a supply challenge not a demand challenge. And the supply challenge that we're dealing with is solvable, it's already being solved and it's short-lived. The demand remains incredibly strong based on the fact that we're continuing to drive great household penetration. If you think about the convergence of events that happened in Q4 and carried over into Q1, it's happened to a number of people in the broader CP industry. It really hit us because our demand was so incredibly strong at the same time that it caused a lot of pressure. We just had serious issues in being able to maintain the production due to absenteeism, quite honestly. As I said in my prepared remarks, 6% was the national absenteeism rate in the beginning of January; we had plants that were in regions that were harder hit where the number was a multiple of that. That gets \u2013 you get to a point where your production, you drop below a threshold level for your production, and that's exactly what happened to us. And then there's a series of knock-on effects that happened. All of them are short-lived. But if I give you a sense of it, we missed sales as a result of that. We expedite orders to try to prevent out-of-stocks and service our partners; we prioritized our partners over us in some cases. We are now paying a lot of overtime for people who are showing up. So, all of these things start to build up to cause serious short-term pressure on the business, all of which is being unwound as we speak and none of which is structural in nature. But it has a significant impact, as we said, because we have to rebuild inventory. What compounded this a bit further is we were expecting in late 2021 a ramp-up in new production from our new plant in Spartanburg. And quite frankly, our equipment supplier missed their deadlines. Again, if you think about it, it is a European-driven manufacturing, and they were ahead of us on COVID in general and Omicron, so they started feeling the pressure at the time that we started seeing the demand really ramp up. So that wasn't available to us at the same time. Again, that's solved. We talked about in our script that we've now built our production outside of Spartanburg to be able to handle that demand. We are now giving our supplier full rein of that plant to be able to optimize production without trying to also serve current demand. And we also have a contingency plan should they continue to miss any milestones. We have a backup plan, so we won't let it go any further than 2022. And when Spartanburg is up to full capacity, not only does that represent a growth opportunity that represents productivity that's yet to be realized. So not only is that not a structural issue going forward that's a structural opportunity in front of us. The last point is pricing. Because in an inflationary environment, we know that pricing is critically important. I'll go all the way back to the statements we made more than four years ago when we put the two companies together and we said that with regard to Coffee Systems, we said the strategic pricing investment, which was intentional to get the price point pods down to the appropriate threshold levels, would moderate over time once we hit those thresholds. So, if you think about what's happened since then, 2018 our net pricing in Coffee Systems down about 4%; 2019, down 3%; 2020 down about 2%; 2021 down less than 1%. In Q4, we had positive pricing that was masked by customer service lines. It's one of the knock-on effects of the production issues I talked about. And as we said in our prepared remarks, in 2022, we're putting in more pricing. So, you will see positive pricing in Coffee Systems going forward based on the pricing that we've already put in place. So, we've moved beyond now the strategic price investment into positive pricing, and all of that is yet still in front of us. Again, the most important thing is there are a few, if any CPG businesses that have line of sight to growing their volume in the mid-single-digit range year-after-year by converting people from one behavior to another, which is brewing by the pot to bring by the cup. Not only is that intact, it's been delivered and we still have 55 million potential households remaining to be converted even after we converted eight million in the past three years. Okay, Chris, thank you. Yes, good morning. Thanks. Okay. Yes, Brett, thank you. The benefit of the portfolio that we have is a bit of diversification in terms of different consumer trends, different competitive dynamics, et cetera. And so, if you go all the way back to the commitments we put out there in 2018 and the fact that we've been able to deliver them despite all of these challenges that we're with COVID, now inflation, supply chain disruption, et cetera, that's the benefit of having the portfolio that we have, that we're able to leverage one part of the portfolio to be able to offset challenges in the others. And then you've seen it reversed in certain situations, where coffee was over-delivering to help one side of the business and now the cold business in some cases in Q4 was able to do that. That's great from an investor perspective. With regard to how we take pricing though, we don't think about it that way. We look at pricing at the consumer level segment-by-segment. We understand price elasticities, competitive dynamics. And in an inflationary environment like the one that we're in right now, we're going to push pricing as hard as we possibly can based on our best assessment of the impact on that individual business. And that does put us in a position where we say because we can take pricing in one area, we'll take less pricing in the other. We take the maximum amount of pricing that we can in each individual business until we get to the point where we think it adversely impacts demand to a level in which it's not a great business decision. But the diversification of the portfolio, though, allows us to step back and we deliver consolidated results and have the confidence that we are able to deliver against the guidance that we put forward despite all the uncertainty and volatility that we face. Can we take the next question please? Yes, great question. Our cold business has performed exceptionally well since the merger. It's been driven by the formula that we discussed a number of times, which is building share and volume growth on core brands through renovation and marketing. Countless examples of that, and I won't repeat them because we mentioned most of them in our prepared remarks. Innovating into white space and also doing partnerships and acquisitions to fill in territory that we are covered with our current portfolio and then investing in and improving our route to market to ensure that the delivery, the merchandising, the servicing on the cold side of the business improves every single year. And it's the combination of those three that's delivering the very strong results. What I just described has a significant amount of runway in front of it. You mentioned we've done a lot of work on the route-to-market side, bringing in independent territories into our system. We've also invested heavily to improve the delivery and effectiveness of our system where we already cover. There's still plenty of runway left on both of those. White space, we still have significant amount of open territory in our portfolio to be able to fill in to leverage that distribution system as well as the marketing strength that we have. And we still have tremendous line of sight to the innovation and renovation on our existing brand portfolio. As we talked about three years ago, a lot of conversations, will allow Dr. Pepper has been successful. You can't possibly grow that any further. What else are you going to do? And then I would point out that Dr. Pepper was the fastest-growing major CSD in the past two years driven by marketing innovation. And we feel like we still have plenty more to go on that. So, it's that combination of existing brands, white space and distribution system effectiveness that gives us line of sight to significant growth still in front of us. Okay, thanks Lauren. Okay. Yes, on the M&A side, what we've talked about is our capacity for M&A. So, we say it's north of $20 billion based on the $5 billion of discretionary free cash flow and some of the assumptions that we put forward in the Investor Day. The clarification we were making today is there were a number of headlines that came out of that where people said we were looking for a $20 billion acquisition. And what we're saying is that we've got significant capacity to continue to do acquisitions of a variety of sizes and our four areas are filling in the white space as we just talked about, continuing to build our distribution capabilities, which we also talked about; adding new capabilities which as we get further along we could explain some of that; and then obviously, we always have the opportunity for some geographic expansion. We operate in North America today, heavily in the U.S., with nice positions in Canada and Mexico. We talked about today Latin American beverages, for example, just continuing to deliver fantastic results that are accretive to total KDP. That's an area where we could see some opportunity for additional investment. So, we have a wide range of targets, all of which are strategic. They range in sizes, but we wanted to clarify that we're looking at a $20 billion plus as capacity, not as a target. Ozan is going to talk about buybacks in a second. With regard to pricing the pricing that we have in the plan is not just what we've already put in place, but also pricing that we've already announced that's happening in the early part of 2022. With regard to the rest of the year we always say we need to be flexible based on inflation, productivity, pricing and marketing investment. And we don't talk about any one lever in the future at the expense of others. We look at all four in combination, and that's how we will continue to manage through 2022. And Ozan, do you want to \u2013 I think this will be our last question. Do you want to end this on the buyback conversation? Thanks."

This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call.  I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Steve Alexander. Mr. Alexander, please go ahead.\nSteve Alexander: Thank you. And hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued our press release for the third quarter of 2021. If you need a copy, you can get one on our website in the Investors section.  Consistent with previous quarters, today, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis excluding items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides a meaningful comparison and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance.  Here with me today to discuss our third quarter 2021 results are KDP's Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio.  And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort : Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. As we approach the completion of our three-year, post-merger period, we're looking forward to our next chapter of transformation and growth. We're entering that phase from a position of strength, with topline momentum fueled by new tools and capabilities, robust innovation, and the right team and culture to enable continued success.  Importantly, we're also nearing our targeted leverage ratio, which enables us to shift the use of our industry-leading cash generation from debt reduction to a new set of options for increased value creation. We have successfully navigated the macro dislocation that has occurred over the past 20 months and expect to be able to do the same in the face of the new challenges that are causing incremental disruption across the economy.  The escalation in input cost inflation coupled with labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, including constraints in transportation, impacted us in the quarter and will likely persist for some time. As part of the offset, we have increased price and utilized a wide range of RGM initiatives across our portfolio, along with stepped up productivity, alternate sourcing and supplier strategies, and other cost mitigation activities. Given the strength of our brands, driven by increased investment in innovation in marketing, we have been successful in limiting the elasticity impact of the pricing to date.  Our third quarter results provide a good example of KDP's ability to manage through challenges and deliver strong and balanced results. We posted another quarter of high-single-digit constant currency net sales growth, with all four business segments reporting strong increases. We also delivered double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth, while increasing marketing investment in the quarter.  As discussed last quarter, we believe it's helpful to highlight our results on a two-year basis because we are layering strong current year performance on top of strong year-ago performance, which we believe sets KDP apart from most companies.  On this basis, constant currency net sales advanced 13% versus the third quarter of 2019 and adjusted diluted EPS was up 38%. On a year-to-date basis, results were similarly strong compared to 2019.  KDP's in-market performance for the third quarter was as strong as our financial performance. We continue to grow share in carbonated soft drinks, reflecting core brand growth, and successful innovation and renovation, most notably our new zero sugar variety. Sunkist continued to post strong double-digit consumption growth behind its new flavor lineup and is now the number one fruit flavored CSD brand in the category. Other CSDs posting strong growth in the quarter were Canada Dry, A&W, and Squirt.  The Dr Pepper brand also continued to perform exceptionally well, consistently gaining market share on the strength of double-digit consumption growth. This growth has accelerated with the recent launch of this year's Fansville campaign, which celebrates the passion consumers have for college football and Dr Pepper.  In-market performance of our key non-carb beverage brands such as Snapple, Bai, and Core continued to be impacted by supply chain challenges that capped growth. The supply chain situation is already showing signs of improvement with Snapple's latest four-week consumption well above its 13-week trend, and Bai growing consumption by nearly 15% in the most recent periods behind the success of Bai Boost.  On a two-year stack basis, in-market performance of our cold beverages was very strong, with nearly 75% of the portfolio's retail sales base expanding market share.  We continue to drive our newest brand partnerships and deepen existing ones. In the case of Polar, we expanded availability outside of the Northeast region, achieving a 3.7% share and 60% ACV distribution in markets for which KDP is responsible for the brand. We also invested in Vita Coco's recent IPO. And as part of that transaction, extended our distribution agreement with them.  In coffee, our K-Cup pod shipments advanced 6% in the quarter and are up almost 7% year-to-date. This reflects continued strong at-home performance and a modest improvement versus year ago in away-from-home coffee, although the latter continues to be down significantly versus pre-COVID levels. Market share of KDP manufactured pods and track channels was 83%, up almost a full point versus year ago.  As we discussed during our recent Investor Day, we expect to add at least 2 million new Keurig households in 2021, continuing our long-term growth trajectory and clearly showing no pullback following our accelerated level of 3 million new Keurig households added in 2020. We will provide a final 2021 household penetration number when we report our Q4 earnings.  Brewer shipments grew 2.2% in the quarter, successfully comping a 34% increase in the third quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, brewer sales were up 22% versus year ago. And compared to the third quarter of 2019, brewer sales were up 44%. Driving this impressive growth is effective marketing and our comprehensive quality and innovation strategy that is widening choice, functionality, and price points of our brewer portfolio. The most recent example is our new MultiStream Technology, which delivers a richer, more balanced, and flavorful cup of coffee.  Our newest brewer is the Keurig Supreme Plus SMART, initially launched on keurig.com in July and now rolling out to retailers in time for the holidays. In addition to incorporating MultiStream Technology, this Internet-connected brewer also features our new BrewID technology, which recognizes the specific K cup pod in use and automatically customizes brew settings. The brewer SMART technology also enhances our successful auto delivery business by utilizing SKU level pod consumption data to automatically replenish consumers via shipments direct to home. Both our auto delivery and broader ecommerce business continued to expand in the quarter on top of the exceptionally strong growth experienced last year.  We also continue to innovate in pod sustainability and have begun the introduction of Easy Peel lids to our recyclable K-cup pods in order to make the recycling process simpler for consumers.  In addition to the good progress we've made in coffee pod sustainability, the accomplishments in our companywide ESG efforts continue to be recognized. Recently, we received the Reuters Responsible Business Award for the social and human capital category, recognizing our 20-year journey of putting farmers first by improving 1 million lives in our coffee supply. A top 10% ranking among 350 food and agriculture companies by the World Benchmarking Alliance, a United Nations affiliated organization that focuses on improving private sector performance against the UN Sustainable Development Goals. A number two ranking out of 50 of the largest CPGs and retailers in North America by the nonprofit, As You Sow, in their assessment of plastic usage and packaging sustainability progress, and LEED Gold certification for our new Frisco headquarters.  Before turning it over to Ozan, I want to highlight the increase in our outlook for 2021 net sales growth to 7% to 8% as communicated in our press release this morning. We continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS growth in the range of 13% to 15% as pricing, productivity, and revenue growth are being leveraged to offset significant and accelerating industry inflation, as Ozan will now discuss in his comments.\nOzan Dokmecioglu : Thanks, Bob. And good morning, everyone. Continuing on an adjusted basis, I will briefly review our performance for the third quarter, which was another strong one for us. I will then turn to our outlook for the balance of 2021. Constant currency net sales increased 6.8%, fueled by higher volume mix of 3.2% and favorable net price realization of 3.6%. Importantly, all four business segments posted growth, driven by successful innovation and strong marketing, along with continued solid in-market execution.  For the first nine months of 2021, constant currency net sales grew 8.4% versus year ago. And on a two-year basis advanced 13.3% versus the same period in 2019. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter advanced 50 basis points versus a year ago to 56.4% of net sales, reflecting higher pricing and productivity, partially offset by significant and accelerating inflation in cost of goods sold.  Adjusted operating income in the quarter grew 6.5% versus year ago to $931 million, driven by the strong and balanced net sales growth in the gross margin expansion as well as productivity and merger synergies in SG&A. These positive drivers were partially offset by significant inflation in transportation and logistics and significantly higher marketing investment.  On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 5.7% versus a year ago. Adjusted operating margin declined 30 basis points, reflecting our decision to reinvest in marketing to drive brand strength. Excluding the increase in marketing, adjusted operating margin was up versus year ago.  For the first nine months of 2021, adjusted operating income increased 7.6% versus year ago. And on a two-year basis, adjusted operating income was up 21% versus the first nine months of 2019.  Adjusted net income in the quarter advanced 13.3% versus year ago to $631 million, primarily driven by the growth in adjusted operating income and lower interest expense., largely reflecting lower interest rates stemming from the strategic financing completed in the first quarter of 2021, lower outstanding indebtedness, and realized gains on interest rate swap contracts. Also benefiting the growth in adjusted net income was a lower adjusted tax rate.  Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter grew 12.8% to $0.44 compared to $0.39 in the year ago period. For the first nine months of 2021, adjusted diluted EPS advanced 13.9% versus year ago. And on a two-year basis, adjusted diluted EPS was up 32% versus the first nine months of 2019.  Let me take a moment to discuss the inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges we have referenced this morning that are impacting the broader economy and our industry.  We are experiencing significantly higher inflation this year than we expected at the start of the year, which we were managing with pricing, productivity and accelerated growth. For perspective, we expect all-in inflation this year, which includes inflation in cost of goods sold, transportation, warehousing and logistics, and SG&A, to be up approximately 6% versus year ago. This inflation has accelerated in the second half of 2021.  Our updated guidance for 2021 incorporates all of these considerations, and we are confident that we have the tools and management disciplines in place to deliver our guidance for both revenue and earnings growth.  Let me now turn to our segment performance in the third quarter. Coffee Systems constant currency net sales increased 4.6%, driven by higher volume mix of 5.7%, partially offset by lower net price realization of 1.1% which continued to moderate as expected.  The value mix performance reflected pod shipment volume growth of 6.3% and brewer volume growth of 2.2%. The pod volume growth reflected continued strong momentum in our at-home pods and improved performance in our away from home business, although returning to offices continues to be slow and this business remains well below pre pandemic levels. The 2.2% increase in brewer shipments, which is on top of the 34% increase in brewer shipments in the third quarter last year, was fueled by continued strong consumer purchases stemming from successful brewer innovation and a double digit increase in marketing.  During the quarter, we took pricing in our brewer portfolio, and more recently, took pricing on our owned and licensed coffee brands, given the escalation in coffee commodity pricing. As a reminder, most of our partner contracts require the partner to be responsible for coffee beans. Therefore, the increased commodity costs and any pricing they chose to take for these brands does not follow through the KDP profit and loss.  Adjusted operating income for Coffee Systems increased 1.1% to $377 million, driven by the net sales growth and continued productivity and merger synergies, partially offset by inflation and a double-digit increase in marketing investment in the quarter.  This marketing investment supported the launch of our new Keurig Supreme Plus SMART brewer, featuring our new BrewID technology platform. The campaign was executed nationally via digital, social and earned media and was amplified by experiential activations.  On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 0.5% in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 32.6% compared to 34% in the year-ago period, largely reflecting the significant increase in inflation and marketing investment.  Packaged Beverages constant currency net sales grew 6.8% in the quarter, with volume mix growth of 1.5% and higher net price realization of 5.3%, reflecting continued growth in both our company-owned CSD operations and warehouse direct business.  The majority of our liquid refreshment beverage portfolio contributed to this growth, with CSDs, notably Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Sunkist particularly strong, along with Polar, Vita Coco and Motts driving growth.  Adjusted operating income for Packaged Beverages increased 2.6% in the third quarter to $312 million, driven by strong net sales growth, productivity and merger synergies, partially offset by inflation, particularly in transportation, as well as marketing investment and increased operating costs to meet continued strong consumer demand.  On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 2.3% versus year ago. Adjusted operating margin for packaged beverages was 20.2% in the quarter compared to adjusted operating margin of 21% in the year-ago period, largely reflecting the impact of inflation and higher marketing investment.  Beverage Concentrates constant currency net sales increased 10.8%, reflecting favorable net price realization of 11.4%, resulting from higher pricing and lower trade expense, slightly offset by lower volume mix of 0.6%. The growth in net sales also reflected a continued recovery in the fountain foodservice business due to increased consumer mobility in the restaurant and hospitality channels, with brand Dr Pepper driving the growth. Offsetting this growth was the decline in bottle can concentrate shipment volume.  Adjusted operating income for Beverage Concentrates increased 9.1% to $289 million, driven by Lynette [ph] sales growth, partially offset by a strong double-digit increase in marketing investment. This increase reflected investment behind Dr Pepper zero sugar and the Dr Pepper college football campaign. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income advanced 8.7%. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter totaled 73.7% compared to 75.3% in the year-ago period, reflecting the impact of significantly higher marketing investment. Excluding the increase in marketing, adjusted operating margin was up versus a year ago.  And finally, Latin America Beverages constant currency net sales grew 14.5%, reflecting strong volume mix growth of 10.5% and favorable net price realization of 4%. Liquid refreshment beverage in-market execution in Mexico continued to be strong across all channels, which drove significant net sales growth for key brands, namely Pe\u00f1afiel and Clamato.  Adjusted operating income increased 48% to $37 million. And on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 36%. This strong operating income performance reflected the net sales growth and productivity, partially offset by significantly higher marketing investment and inflation. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter advanced 350 basis points to 23.7% despite the meaningful increase in marketing investment.  Free cash flow in the quarter continued to be strong at $676 million, driving year-to-date free cash flow to $1.6 billion. This strong free cash flow performance for the quarter and year-to-date periods represented free cash flow conversion ratios of approximately 107% and 100% respectively.  During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding bank debt by $325 million and structured payables by $2 million. We also ended the third quarter with $200 million of unrestricted cash on hand.  Due to our growth in earnings and reduction in bank debt, we improved our management leverage ratio to 3.2 times at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Since the merger close in July 2018, we have reduced our management leverage ratio by 2.8 times and continue to expect to achieve a management leverage ratio at or below 3 times at year end.  Let me now move to our outlook for full-year 2021. For the third time this year, we increase our guidance for constant currency net sales growth to reflect the significant momentum in the business. And we now expect growth in the range of 7% to 8%. This compares with our original 2021 guidance for constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 4% and our most recent guidance of 6% to 7%.  We continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the range of 13% to 15%. And we expect to continue to invest significantly in marketing to maintain our top line momentum.  Supporting this guidance, we expect the following. Adjusted interest expense is now expected in the range of $495 million to $500 million, reflecting the realized gains on interest rate swap contracts that benefited the third quarter. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected in the range of 23.5% to 24%. Diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion. And finally, our management leverage ratio is expected to be at or below 3 times at year end.  With that, let me hand it back to Bob for some closing remarks.\nRobert Gamgort: Closing out 2021 completes the three-year commitment established in January of 2018 at the announcement of the merger. Clearly, a lot has transpired since then, and throughout this time, the KDP team has remained focused, flexible and resilient. With one quarter left to go, we are confident that we will significantly over deliver our net sales commitment and achieve our 15% to 17% adjusted EPS commitment.  I will now turn back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: I wanted to ask about your topline, which continues to be much stronger than expected, and it's impressive that you guys have taken up your sales growth guidance yet again. So, given this how does this potentially change your thinking regarding your preliminary outlook for 2022? Does it give you any more confidence in your ability to deliver on a mid-single-digit top line growth or possibly above this? And if so, do you think your initial outlook for mid-single-digit EPS growth next year could ultimately prove conservative given that lever? Just wanted to get your thoughts on that.\nRobert Gamgort: We're very happy with revenue growth that we've seen. If you recall, when we put the company together, we talked about revenue \u2013 three-year revenue guidance of 2% to 3%, and we've far exceeded that. It's driven in a really healthy way through a combination of growth across the entire business, core business growth, and innovation, and it's fueled by great marketing as well and our execution at retail. So, the drivers behind it are sustainable. The contributions from our brands and the innovation pipeline is very strong.  Again, as we sit here in \u2013 during the Investor Day in October and we're looking out over the future, we think that mid-single digits is the right target. Remember that everybody is getting some revenue growth off of the pricing that we're putting in place right now. So, it's hard to look down the road and forecast what pricing will be over the next three to five years. So, we base it more on what the underlying volume growth is in a normalized pricing environment, and are comfortable that mid-single digits is the right commitment for us to make over the long term. Obviously, the trends that we're seeing right now are stronger than that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. \nChris Carey: The pricing in the Packaged Beverage business, I think, was the highest in over a decade unless I'm mistaken. Clearly it makes sense. Elasticities are not what they historically have been. They're not in any category right now. Can you just talk about maybe how this pricing evolves over the next year or six quarters? I think KDP was a little bit slower to ramp pricing as aggressive as some of your other domestic peers. When does revenue growth management become a bigger dynamic here? When do you think volumes could potentially be impacted by pricing? I imagine the pricing model will be more pricing driven ahead. Again, the concept of higher pricing makes sense, but it's historically high, of course, and just want some more perspective on how this evolves over time and where the RGM piece comes in relative to list price and just how you're thinking about how this evolves over the next year or so. \nRobert Gamgort: The questions that you're asking are on the minds of everybody in the industry. The fortunate thing is that we operate in a wonderful industry, beverages, and I'm including coffee in that as well, that is incredibly rational.  So, the objective is margin protection. And what we've all faced is an unprecedented level of inflation, certainly unprecedented in all of our working careers for the North American market level of inflation. There are three ways to offset that \u2013 pricing. And I would include RGM in pricing, and I'll talk more about that. Pricing, productivity, and then there's another lever, which is reinvestment back in the business. And so, we can pull those levers in different magnitudes based on the level of inflation and what we believe the impact will be on the overall business.  What we're seeing right now is that there's been a significant amount of pricing across the industry. The data that I have doesn't suggest that we were slower than anyone else. I think we were right in line. Different parts of our business realized the pricing faster than others. So, for example, our BC business has an immediate impact. When you take pricing, it hits the P&L. There's a delayed response in some of our other businesses, as it has to reach retail, and you have to protect some of the promotions in place. So that\u2019s may be what you're thinking about there, but certainly there's been extensive pricing.  The impact of elasticities has been better than historical, and in part it's because of the way we've taken pricing and also the strength of the brands. And we've been able to find a way uniquely within I think the industry to continue to have positive gross margin in the quarter, for example, which gives us the opportunity to reinvest back in our business, which makes pricing even more possible because you continue to invest in your brand strength. So, I would suggest that that's the framework we approach 2022, and any prediction I would make in the future about elasticities, where do I think inflation is going to be, how do I think pricing will respond to that, not productive because it's impossible for anybody, including the Fed, to predict what's happening going forward. What I would say is that we manage this in a very dynamic manner. When there is more inflation, the industry has put on more pricing. And we have the other levers that I talked about in terms of productivity and reinvestment to pull to protect margin. And that's why we're confident in the guidance that we put out in October 1 in an environment as volatile as this. We still have the ability to manage our way through that. \nOperator: And your next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nPeter Galbo: It's Pete Galbo on for Bryan. I guess just on Bev Con, obviously, there's a natural gap between shipment volumes and bottler case volume, but I think bottler case volumes were maybe a little bit lighter than we had expected and there wasn't a ton of detail around what happened there in the press release. So, just anything there would be helpful.  And I think, Ozan, just there were some comments, particularly on the bottling can part of the Bev Con business, just how are your franchisees managing inflation? How is it impacting their ability to serve \u2013 having to do anything kind of to accommodate them for their rising costs?\nRobert Gamgort: Let me let me kick it off, Ozan, and then I'll turn it over to you. The timing between shipments \u2013 our shipments and bottler case volumes is always quarter to quarter some disconnect. They equalize over time. There's nothing notable there. And the best way to look at the underlying health of our business, and it's more of a leading indicator, is to look at the consumption numbers, the offtake numbers from IRI and Nielsen because that's the leading indicator of consumer demand that will pull our brand through, whether it comes through our system or through another entity's system, it's still our brand and that's reflected in those numbers. And you can see that they're exceptionally strong, particularly on Dr Pepper, which is the largest brand that flows through multiple systems. So, everything is very positive there. There's nothing to note. Ozan, you want to talk a little bit about the inflationary impact on our partners and how they offset that.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Of course. Particularly on the bevcon, as you were saying, Bob, bevcon comes in two pieces. One is the bottlers and the distributors that we work as well as our fountain foodservice business. And specific answer to the question, Pete, on the mechanism of our bottlers and distributors pricing, most of our bottlers and distributors are on incident pricing, which, as you know, is a quite a bit sophisticated algorithm that starts from the shelf prices, then goes to the bottlers and distributors and reflects to us. Therefore, this is a best-in-class in terms of pricing adjustments that take place in the marketplace. And that also includes the sophisticated revenue growth management strategies that we deploy on a consistent basis.  Therefore, as Bob also alluded a couple of minutes ago, the whole sector took some forms and shapes of pricing actions, either shelf price improvements or using a sophisticated revenue growth management strategies. And as a result of that, there's a net flow through to our bevcon business. And given the nature of the bevcon that we ship and sell and transfer the concentrate, the increase in the pricing in that segment reflects in our numbers right away. Right away meaning a little earlier than the packaged beverages, for example, that takes a little bit gap between the price improvements, we turn into the finished product, ship it and sell it across the board. So, that will be our algorithm that make us to realize very good margin improvement from the pricing in bevcon.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Just want to kind of like go back to the supply chain points that I think you kind of managed really well. Can you kind of give us an idea of how, at this point, the packaging side will be able to manage and how it positions you into 2022?  And, Bob, I wanted to go back to also to \u2013 just to clarify your point about protecting profitability. I know it's early to say, and obviously, when you gave the 2022 preliminary outlook, it kind of implies the margins are probably going to be on a gross margin basis. I don't know, but that you're going to have a similar algorithm or protect profitability. Is that still going to be more of financial deleverage and below the line or you may be able to protect your gross margin?\nRobert Gamgort: I'm going to tackle the first one on supply chain and then, Ozan, you want to talk a bit about 2022 and margins after I finish that. With regard to supply chain piece, like everyone, this has just been a rolling pattern of challenges. So, last time we talked to you, we were having some issues with regard to packaging availability, particularly in the area of Snapple and glass, which required us to move faster to our PET conversion, and starting up the plant much faster than we expected. That is largely behind us. And as I said, you're seeing improvements in those businesses. And so, at the moment, that is less of the issue. Our bigger challenges, and I think consistent with the industry, is actually transportation right now. Customer pickups, as well as shipments that we make that are not through our own fleet are increasingly challenged where pickups don't happen as scheduled and transportation is unreliable, as well as incredibly costly.  And then again, like everybody, we're facing some rolling labor issues as well that are not adequate from time to time to be able to service the demand. So, our supply chain team has done incredibly well in navigating through all of these. As you know, we have new supply chain leadership. And Tony, who has joined us, made an immediate impact on that. And so, we're seeing a lot of improvements. But it continues to be incredibly volatile.  Ozan, you want to talk about the margin side? \nOzan Dokmecioglu: Actually, I like to expand a little bit because, obviously, the whole inflation and the pricing algorithm is so interrelated to each other. As we shared with you, and I'm sure you are seeing this every day, like everyone else, we are experiencing a significant increase in inflation, particularly in packaging materials, labor, lately coffee beans, Corning glass, and so forth, which is a broad base of our input costs, combined with transportation. And the latest one, we are seeing pressure on the labor shortage as well as the availability.  As we also shared with you a little while ago, we expect overall inflation rate for 2021 to impact us negatively around 6%. And also, inflation has accelerated through 2021, with the second half being higher than the first half. So, what does this mean? This means that we are entering into 2022 at a higher second half run rate. So, we expect that at least the first couple of quarters of 2022 to face tougher comps than the second half of 2021.  Having said that, during our Investor Day, October 1, we also shared with you that our long term outlook is for continued adjusted operating margin growth fueled by primarily three things \u2013 productivity, mix and overhead leverage \u2013 while we continue to invest in our brands to continue to drive our strong growth.  Therefore, at this point in time, our 2022 outlook is our best estimate based on a range of assumptions, which is very important to articulate and this is how we have been managing the enterprise for a while, which is a balance between the inflation, pricing, productivity and business investments. Obviously, the more we know, we will update you and the timing of that update would be during our February 2022 call that will announce our quarter four and the full-year results.  But in summary, we believe in the strength of our plan and the algorithm that we put in front of you that will deliver over time.\nAndrea Teixeira: And your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. \nKevin Grundy: Congratulations on another strong result. I wanted to kind of zoom out a little bit. I have a more strategic question for you this morning just as it pertains to your distribution assets and the potential to move into alcohol following PepsiCo's announcement with Hard Mtn Dew. As you know, the legacy Dr Pepper company has long viewed its bottling assets as strategic. I think there's been some questions over the years about potentially taking a look at doing something more strategic, spinning them off, refranchising, etc. But it was collectively something the board thought never made a lot of sense. You mentioned the Vita Coco investment there. That's been a long term relationships. It's part of the allied strategy. The Polar deal that you guys entered into made a lot of sense as well.  So my question is this. I'm sure the PepsiCo announcement is in no way lost on you. I just wanted you to comment this morning on the potential for Keurig Dr Pepper to move into the alcohol space, to take a look at your own distribution assets. Is that something that you're entertaining? Is that something that you think makes a lot of sense?\nRobert Gamgort: I think we lost the end of it. But let me give you a point of view on this space here. On alcohol, in particular, is an area that we look at, it's very similar to the way we look at beverages in total. So as we said, when we put the other coffee with cold beverages, that we thought there was an opportunity to look at beverages holistically. It's the same with alcohol. Now, the complexity of distribution is one that has been pointed out by many including us. And I think that what you referenced with regard to Pepsi is very interesting in how they're being creative around that.  What you're seeing is really the intersection of two opportunities. One is portfolio expansion to new territories, as well as consolidation in the distribution assets to make sure that they are at scale and therefore more efficient. And so, we look at both of those opportunities. And the one that you point out is there is some overlap. So, it's an area that we continue to study. As we had pointed out on the Investor Day, we participate in alcohol in a variety of ways that I think was surprising that people. We talked about the business we have in Canada, where the distribution environment is very different. The fact that we do licensing in the alcohol space, and we think that our brands can play in alcohol nicely, the fact that we're the number one mixer company which has us participating in alcohol consumption occasions at a much higher rate. And we put all of that knowledge and objective together to think about that.  So I think, in short, there's a lot of complexity to do this in the US. It's interesting to see how others are looking at it. We look at beverages holistically, and so it's certainly on our radar screen. It'll be something in the broadest sense that we'll be talking about in the future.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. \nBrett Cooper: Bob, the leadership team that you brought in comes more from outside of non-alcoholic beverages versus what we typically see in the space. So I was just hoping three years into the deal, you can talk about where you see the state of your route to market business, your observations on what the accepted view of operations was versus how you as a team are seeing it, and then how you look at managing evolutions in the industry, whether those are the ecommerce, the rising penetration of electric vehicles altering convenience store purchases and/or the rise in non-ready-to-drink beverages?\nRobert Gamgort: First of all, I'll start with the team. We're really proud and pleased with the team that we have in place right now. We continue to build capabilities. If you look at where we have drawn team members, especially at the most senior levels, and you see it at the EL, executive team level. But I would also say, at the level of direct reports to the executive team, it's very similar. Wide range of packaged goods experience with a focus on beverages. We like to pull people from all elements of beverages. So we have non-alcohol as well as alcohol experience. We have a number of people who in that individual have experience in both. We also have people who have a number of experiences both within North America as well as international experience. And we think that this combination of skills, experiences, backgrounds and style make us much stronger as a team. And we will continue to add talented team as well as promote and upgrade talent from within as we've done. So, it is a critical part for our ongoing success to make sure that we've got the management team who can really lead the business of the future.  So let's talk about some of the future-looking comments or questions that you ask right there. Again, we go back to our original thesis for putting the two companies together is that beverages historically had been managed in silos. And we thought if we took a look at it from a consumer perspective that we would be better off and it's exactly what we've seen, is that consumers don't think about beverages in formats, the silos. They think about needs and occasions and they use multiple beverage formats, brands, products, etc., to satisfy those needs.  So, by taking a consumer first, need-based approach, it has really informed our innovation pipeline, both in the cold and hot side to great success, as you see, it's driven our marketing programs. And it helps us think about partnerships going forward, whether that's a partnership like Polar that was our most recent one, in which we have a long term franchise agreement with them, but not ownership. Or partnerships where we have seen investment or ultimately acquire the business as we've done with others.  When you think about our distribution assets, which is another area that you point to, we put the company together in 2018, and talked about seven different ways that we went to market. We ranged from direct store delivery, to wholesale direct, to franchise \u2013 our fountain foodservice which is our on-premise business. But the other one that we talked about at that time was ecommerce, and there was very little appreciation for ecommerce, particularly in beverage in 2018. And that's changed dramatically.  We have seen the percentage of our ecommerce business grow. We've talked to you before. That's north of 10%. It's higher on our coffee business. It grows significantly faster than our average business. And we are in position to be the market leader, the category leader in this space, driven by the historical strength of Keurig. And now with Keurig, where there's always been a substantial ecommerce business, the fact that we are selling brewers that are smart brewers that can recognize the pod, that can trigger an order direct to consumer based on actual SKU level consumption, suggests that we are thinking way ahead in terms of what the next steps are in terms of distribution routes, as well as efficiency.  My last point is it ties back to the question that Kevin asked, in addition to portfolio whitespace and finding new points of distribution, we think our CSD asset is a competitive advantage. But we also believe in consolidation and distribution in the industry. And we'll look for ways to continue to consolidate distribution and drive more efficiency and effectiveness through that really important asset to us.  So, I think I've covered all of your forward-looking points. If there's anything else on there or anything I missed, let me know.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about Polar. I know it's still relatively early, but had been expanding distribution. And I was just curious if you could talk about some of the uptake you're seeing and what you're doing also to build awareness of that brand because it's one thing to put it on the shelf, another for people outside of the Northeast to pick it up off that shelf. \nRobert Gamgort: As you know, Polar continues to be responsible for the brand in their territories. And we've expanded outside of the Northeast for them. Right now, we're at 60% ACV distribution in the territories for which we're responsible. We're happy with that. It continues to grow. We've achieved now just under a four share of that category, which is a sizable and growing category. And we're happy with the trajectory that we're on.  I was out just recently doing retail in a number of markets across the country, and I was really pleased with the level of distribution and display activity that we're getting. And in stores in which we haven't gotten it fully slotted onto the shelf yet because of timing, I saw a lot of off-shelf display pressure, which will continue to grow the brand.  The Polar team is responsible for marketing the brand. And it's something that we work with in conjunction \u2013 work with them on. And I agree with you that, as this distribution base continues to build, and we have great push activity behind it, needs to be supported with an increasing amount of consumer poll activity. And that's something that we're continue to work with them on. But I think that the foundation is in place to be able to activate that. And overall, we're just really pleased with how that business is trending.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sean King with UBS.\nSean King: First off, I'm glad to see you're starting to move pricing higher on the pod side for the owned and licensed brands. But first off, do you expect or are you seeing the partner brands following on price at retail? And then second, over time, can you get pricing on the partner brand manufacturing contracts, given the higher costs you're seeing?\nRobert Gamgort: Let me talk a little bit about just pricing in total on pods and then, Ozan, why don't you pick up on the partner agreements and potential pricing there. I think pricing is always an interesting conversation in the context of K cup pods because we have intentionally been lowering the price, although I know for analysts and investors that was always something of concern. We always point out that that was an intentional strategy that has continued to drive household penetration. And we knew that the price was too high. And we're able to back up those price investments with strong levels of productivity because, as the price came down, we were able to expand margin. That's certainly the proof point that it was intentional. We had that well under control. We are seeing an increase in the underlying price of coffee. And while that is a lesser component of a finished K cup pod than somebody who's selling roast and ground coffee, it still is of a magnitude where we know that pricing is appropriate and required. So we pass it on immediately in the form of pricing in our owned and licensed brands. And we do think that's the right thing to do, given the inflation. But it's a little more complex in the partner situation as well as private label. And I think, Ozan, why don't you talk that through because it's a good opportunity to remind everyone how our contracts work and what they're likely to see inside and outside of the KDP P&L.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: And as we say, use the genetic code on partners, and obviously, we include the branded partners we have as well as private label. It's one group for us. And as we shared with you, not the specifics, but in general terms, our partner contracts are for long-term duration. So, they are not for the short term. And the contracts obviously specify all the details in terms of the working relationship.  So, when we do the double click, we also see that, as KDP, we are not responsible to source the coffee beans for the most of our partner group. So, what does this mean? This means that any fluctuation, plus or minus, in the coffee bean procurement, responsibility of the profit and loss management lie with the partner group. That also obviously includes the pricing on the shelves that we have zero saying and it's their business and their job to decide how they manage their pricing.  And in some instances that we are responsible in terms of the coffee bean supply, we use our broad hedging strategies and techniques by considering all these puts and takes and protect ourselves at all times. So, this is our overall working relationship from the core manufacturing side of our business and how we set the algorithm between the partner groups as well as the branded ones as well as the private label. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Actually, the question I've got is very much the same as Sean. I'd like to re-dig more a bit about these. So I understand about the coffee bean and all these, but what about the pod manufacturing. You said in your prepared remarks that the manufacturing went up for your pods? So, are you able to pass through some of that increased cost of manufacturing the pods? I'm not talking about the coffee here, but more the pod by itself to either your product level or [indiscernible] or Nestle, Starbucks? \nRobert Gamgort: Ozan, you want to pick that up. \nOzan Dokmecioglu: First of all, we are not at a position to disclose all the detailed relationship between us and our partners. I'm sure you will appreciate. But if I want to make, let's say, overall general statement on that one, we always look to several pieces as a kind of basket between \u2013 from the manufacturing perspective, that includes some of the input cost. As you said and as I said that we are not responsible for the most part from the coffee beans. But there are some other elements, as you say, but that's why we have our overall productivity programs. That's why we always look for further efficiencies in our business in order, first of all, to help us to improve our margins as we have been doing as well as to weather these type of non-persistent or persistent inflationary environments. Therefore, it wouldn't be right just to look to one piece element and try to make sense out of it, but rather we need to look holistically and that's how we were managing not only coffee, but all segments of our business on the basis of the relationship with pricing, the inflation, productivity as well as the business investments.  And as we have also spoke, we also improved our pricing on the owned and licensed that will be impacting our numbers. And you will see in the data as well starting quarter four onwards. And as we also said that we are very pleased both on the coffee beverages as well as cold beverages that the sector is very rational and very responsible to manage the inflation and the pricing relationship. Therefore, we are very pleased, Laurent, with our algorithm and our working relationship with our partners in all pieces of the elements. \nRobert Gamgort: I think just to build on that, as I said before, just to reemphasize, our objective is margin protection. Our levers to pull are a combination of pricing, productivity and reinvestment. And we have different mechanisms in different contracts to be able to protect margin against that, using that entire basket.  And in the case of coffee, which has been the most inflationary item within the manufacturing and delivery of a K cup pod \u2013 as we said, we're not responsible for it for most of our partners. And in the case of our own brands, we immediately took pricing, which by the way, as you can see, didn't really show up at all in Q3 based on the timing of the pricing and the lag on that. So, that's the actual pricing that we put in place, and we've seen across the industry as more to come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. \nDara Mohsenian: Just a follow up on that. Look, obviously, the guidance for 2022 is below your long-term algorithm because of the cost pressures. So clearly, there's some ability not to fully price away those commodity costs. Theoretically, with the conversations we've been having today, heritage DPS is in good shape to do that. You talked about some pricing on your owned and licensed brands. So just to be very clear, I assume the gap for 2022 is that the cost pressures you're seeing on the manufacturing side for your partner brands, understanding you're not responsible for the coffee grounds themselves, but you're not fully getting the pricing to offset that. So, A, is that the case just to be explicit about it? Seems clear, but just to be explicit. And, B, is that more just a lack of ability to sort of respond short term and you can make up for that in future years as you think about it? Or is it more just the contracts are set the way they are in terms of pricing and the way the relationships work, it's more of sort of a standard pricing over time as opposed to responsiveness to commodity costs. Just to clear that up? \nRobert Gamgort: First of all, I think you're connecting things that aren't connected right now. So you're looking at our 2022 guidance, which was our initial guidance that we were in a position to \u2013 I think really felt obligated to provide some guidance in October, four to five months in advance of when we normally would. And as we've shown, since the very beginning, we pick our guidance and our commitments really seriously. We're pretty much the only company that held on to guidance during COVID. So when we put a number out there, we treat it as a commitment and an obligation. And so, when we're sitting there in October, operating an incredibly volatile environment that nobody can predict, we feel that it was important to set expectations for 2022 that was friendly to investors, so that they could plan appropriately.  So, connecting coffee contracts and our ability to price or not, which I think we just explained in great detail over the last two questions to our guidance for 2022, I think is not appropriate.  Having said all that, I'm going to say what we said a couple times today. Inflation is one input cost. We are managing around a range of inflation. One of the pieces that I think is not well understood is as soon as we talk about inflation, immediately, I see reports jump to commodities and hedging. Let's be clear, the inflation that the industry is seeing right now is way beyond commodities. It's packaging, it's labor, transportation. Some, if not most of those, cannot be hedged and are impossible to forecast. So, everybody is getting exposed to a high level of inflation. We're exiting 2021 at the highest run rate of the year. Nobody can fully predict how that's going to flow through in 2022. But if you're entering the year at the highest level of the previous year, that would cause you to say, okay, there's going to be increasing pressure and we're going to have to offset that through a range of pricing, productivity and reinvestment. Last point I would make as you think about 2022 is we're really clear. Our marketing is up in 2021 versus 2020. We intend for our marketing to be up in 2022 as well. The industry took down marketing in 2020 versus 2019 reluctantly, but the whole industry did it. Our objective is to build it back because we think investment in our brands behind innovation is the most important thing, and it's fueling the top line. So there's an assumption in 2022 that we're going to reinvest. And you can figure that into the estimates as well.  So, that's our outlook for 2022. It's early. We're going to provide a lot more information when we're in our normal position of doing so in early February. We take our commitment seriously. And we're really pleased with the growth of our business and believe that the right thing for us over the long term is to continue to invest in growth and not cut marketing spend to be able to offset any margin pressures.\nDara Mohsenian: Can I just follow-up with one question? If you see manufacturing costs continue to move up on the partner side in coffee, do you think you can get incremental pricing over time? How do you think about just that piece of it? I understand there are a lot of moving pieces and you're still delivering solid growth for next year. But I'm just trying to understand that one piece of it. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of responsiveness to the costs on the heritage DPS side, right, a very strong pricing this quarter. So I'm just trying to understand that one piece of it. \nRobert Gamgort: There are a variety mechanisms for us to recover inflation on the pod side of the business. Pricing is one of them. Productivity is another. My black point on this one is \u2013 I said this for the past three years that the focus on pricing on coffee, while it makes sense from a traditional CPG perspective, makes no sense in the coffee pod business when the company is intentionally trying to lower prices. And even in an inflationary environment, we're trying to keep prices down. We're only passing on the coffee costs because they are excessively high.  With regards to the rest of our business, we have a significant amount of productivity and mechanisms to take more pricing if we choose going forward. But remember, our overarching strategy is to try to keep prices down even in the face in the face of inflation and protect our margins through a combination of productivity and pricing. In this business, we have leaned on productivity because it's available to us much more than pricing because it's the right thing to do for the ecosystem of Keurig.  Recognize that concept is very different concept than traditional CPG. I would also say it's the beauty of the Keurig system because it truly is an ecosystem. That's an overused phrase, but it's true in the case of Keurig. And that's what makes this thing work over the long term. You can't focus on one metric because if you do you have you run the risk of damaging the long term growth of the system. And you could see that, if anything, we're accelerating the growth of the system, which really drives everything. \nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: And just want to follow-up on a couple of questions. We've covered a lot of ground. So just one, as you look at the growth opportunities in the M&A, how does international expansion rank in terms of priority? Is that something that you see as natural, particularly maybe in Mexico, or particularly in areas where you have the brand in the US, but maybe not overseas? Or you can use your expertise in other areas? So that's the first question.  And then second, as you look at these commodities, there's a traditional hedging playbook, right, that you guys have traditionally used, but you've got prices now at unprecedented levels with a steepness in the curves like aluminum that I don't think any of us have ever seen. Does that change your strategy in terms of the duration of the hedges? \nRobert Gamgort: Let me hit the first one and then, Ozan, you want to talk about hedging and duration of our positions and how we think about that.  Yeah, on the international side, with regard to M&A specifically, as we talked about in our Investor Day, we're really excited about being able to use our high levels of discretionary free cash flow to look beyond debt reduction as we're just about to reach our long-term leverage targets. And we talked about the capacity to do $20 billion worth of M&A.  There are four areas that we talked about in that portfolio, whitespace distribution and consolidation within distribution, adding capabilities to our business. And then we also talked about market expansion or international. So, it's one of the top priorities. I don't want to rank them because it's going to be dependent upon not just our needs and our opportunities, but what is available and what kind of partners are on the other side. We've got really nice business in Mexico. We hadn't talked about it very much. And we were proud to share with you the business that we built in Mexico at Investor Day.  Similarly, in Canada, we have a nice business there that we have really driven nicely. And we believe that both of those markets are \u2013 we've got a position there with management, infrastructure capabilities that are scalable. And so, we see opportunities in those two markets.  And then I really don't want to talk beyond that because our objective is to make sure that we leverage the investments that we already have in place and scale them before we look at completely open territory, although that's not off the table, and see a lot of exciting opportunities across all of North America, not just in the US. Ozan, you want to talk about the hedging in our commodity position.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Absolutely. And I like to expand a little bit on this because this is a very important topic and is ever changing, especially times of COVID proved how vigilant and flexible and adaptive we need to be.  First of all, when we look to the sources of the inflation, you will see that that's across the board. That includes, as you were saying, Bob, the main commodities that we buy that we have several sophisticated hedging strategies and techniques that we apply.  But that is not all. There are other elements of the cost of goods sold that are being increased as part of the general inflation. That includes transportation, warehousing, which is hard to being able to hedge, for example, and even some parts of our portfolio in the packaging like polypropylene which is the main material that we use in the K cups. The traditional hedging techniques do not work there.  But having said that, what is important for us that we manage this again in a very basket driven basis by looking to several scenarios and assumptions. And of course, we do change our hedging strategies and policies on the basis of the expectations as well as taking very different blends of positions again, depending on which segment of our business.  But beyond that, we are also very active to protect ourselves because inflation comes obviously as an increased price, but the availability is also important. Therefore, we have been very active of trying to find alternative suppliers. And beyond that alternative suppliers, also diversifying geographically the sources of the input to fulfill our business requirements.  Therefore, when we say hedging, it summarizes quite a bit, but it's not all there are several legs to how we manage the overall cost of goods sold base of our company. That includes the supplier relationship. That includes the diversification. That includes the geographical diversification at the same time. Therefore, it's a very vigilant part of our business that we are all over and spending a huge amount of time to get it right. And what matters at the end of the day that we manage this complex situation on the basis of the various assumptions and still continue to successfully deliver against our financial commitments. As we have been doing a little bit more than three years, I think the model that we have adopted has proven to be successful, and we will continue to act as such. \nOperator: I would now like to hand the conference over to management for closing remarks.\nRobert Gamgort: Thank you very much for joining us today. Our teams are out all day. So if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. We're here.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ozan Dokmecioglu",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. And good morning, everyone. Continuing on an adjusted basis, I will briefly review our performance for the third quarter, which was another strong one for us. I will then turn to our outlook for the balance of 2021. Constant currency net sales increased 6.8%, fueled by higher volume mix of 3.2% and favorable net price realization of 3.6%. Importantly, all four business segments posted growth, driven by successful innovation and strong marketing, along with continued solid in-market execution.  For the first nine months of 2021, constant currency net sales grew 8.4% versus year ago. And on a two-year basis advanced 13.3% versus the same period in 2019. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter advanced 50 basis points versus a year ago to 56.4% of net sales, reflecting higher pricing and productivity, partially offset by significant and accelerating inflation in cost of goods sold.  Adjusted operating income in the quarter grew 6.5% versus year ago to $931 million, driven by the strong and balanced net sales growth in the gross margin expansion as well as productivity and merger synergies in SG&A. These positive drivers were partially offset by significant inflation in transportation and logistics and significantly higher marketing investment.  On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 5.7% versus a year ago. Adjusted operating margin declined 30 basis points, reflecting our decision to reinvest in marketing to drive brand strength. Excluding the increase in marketing, adjusted operating margin was up versus year ago.  For the first nine months of 2021, adjusted operating income increased 7.6% versus year ago. And on a two-year basis, adjusted operating income was up 21% versus the first nine months of 2019.  Adjusted net income in the quarter advanced 13.3% versus year ago to $631 million, primarily driven by the growth in adjusted operating income and lower interest expense., largely reflecting lower interest rates stemming from the strategic financing completed in the first quarter of 2021, lower outstanding indebtedness, and realized gains on interest rate swap contracts. Also benefiting the growth in adjusted net income was a lower adjusted tax rate.  Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter grew 12.8% to $0.44 compared to $0.39 in the year ago period. For the first nine months of 2021, adjusted diluted EPS advanced 13.9% versus year ago. And on a two-year basis, adjusted diluted EPS was up 32% versus the first nine months of 2019.  Let me take a moment to discuss the inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges we have referenced this morning that are impacting the broader economy and our industry.  We are experiencing significantly higher inflation this year than we expected at the start of the year, which we were managing with pricing, productivity and accelerated growth. For perspective, we expect all-in inflation this year, which includes inflation in cost of goods sold, transportation, warehousing and logistics, and SG&A, to be up approximately 6% versus year ago. This inflation has accelerated in the second half of 2021.  Our updated guidance for 2021 incorporates all of these considerations, and we are confident that we have the tools and management disciplines in place to deliver our guidance for both revenue and earnings growth.  Let me now turn to our segment performance in the third quarter. Coffee Systems constant currency net sales increased 4.6%, driven by higher volume mix of 5.7%, partially offset by lower net price realization of 1.1% which continued to moderate as expected.  The value mix performance reflected pod shipment volume growth of 6.3% and brewer volume growth of 2.2%. The pod volume growth reflected continued strong momentum in our at-home pods and improved performance in our away from home business, although returning to offices continues to be slow and this business remains well below pre pandemic levels. The 2.2% increase in brewer shipments, which is on top of the 34% increase in brewer shipments in the third quarter last year, was fueled by continued strong consumer purchases stemming from successful brewer innovation and a double digit increase in marketing.  During the quarter, we took pricing in our brewer portfolio, and more recently, took pricing on our owned and licensed coffee brands, given the escalation in coffee commodity pricing. As a reminder, most of our partner contracts require the partner to be responsible for coffee beans. Therefore, the increased commodity costs and any pricing they chose to take for these brands does not follow through the KDP profit and loss.  Adjusted operating income for Coffee Systems increased 1.1% to $377 million, driven by the net sales growth and continued productivity and merger synergies, partially offset by inflation and a double-digit increase in marketing investment in the quarter.  This marketing investment supported the launch of our new Keurig Supreme Plus SMART brewer, featuring our new BrewID technology platform. The campaign was executed nationally via digital, social and earned media and was amplified by experiential activations.  On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 0.5% in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 32.6% compared to 34% in the year-ago period, largely reflecting the significant increase in inflation and marketing investment.  Packaged Beverages constant currency net sales grew 6.8% in the quarter, with volume mix growth of 1.5% and higher net price realization of 5.3%, reflecting continued growth in both our company-owned CSD operations and warehouse direct business.  The majority of our liquid refreshment beverage portfolio contributed to this growth, with CSDs, notably Dr Pepper, Canada Dry and Sunkist particularly strong, along with Polar, Vita Coco and Motts driving growth.  Adjusted operating income for Packaged Beverages increased 2.6% in the third quarter to $312 million, driven by strong net sales growth, productivity and merger synergies, partially offset by inflation, particularly in transportation, as well as marketing investment and increased operating costs to meet continued strong consumer demand.  On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 2.3% versus year ago. Adjusted operating margin for packaged beverages was 20.2% in the quarter compared to adjusted operating margin of 21% in the year-ago period, largely reflecting the impact of inflation and higher marketing investment.  Beverage Concentrates constant currency net sales increased 10.8%, reflecting favorable net price realization of 11.4%, resulting from higher pricing and lower trade expense, slightly offset by lower volume mix of 0.6%. The growth in net sales also reflected a continued recovery in the fountain foodservice business due to increased consumer mobility in the restaurant and hospitality channels, with brand Dr Pepper driving the growth. Offsetting this growth was the decline in bottle can concentrate shipment volume.  Adjusted operating income for Beverage Concentrates increased 9.1% to $289 million, driven by Lynette [ph] sales growth, partially offset by a strong double-digit increase in marketing investment. This increase reflected investment behind Dr Pepper zero sugar and the Dr Pepper college football campaign. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income advanced 8.7%. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter totaled 73.7% compared to 75.3% in the year-ago period, reflecting the impact of significantly higher marketing investment. Excluding the increase in marketing, adjusted operating margin was up versus a year ago.  And finally, Latin America Beverages constant currency net sales grew 14.5%, reflecting strong volume mix growth of 10.5% and favorable net price realization of 4%. Liquid refreshment beverage in-market execution in Mexico continued to be strong across all channels, which drove significant net sales growth for key brands, namely Pen\u0303afiel and Clamato.  Adjusted operating income increased 48% to $37 million. And on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 36%. This strong operating income performance reflected the net sales growth and productivity, partially offset by significantly higher marketing investment and inflation. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter advanced 350 basis points to 23.7% despite the meaningful increase in marketing investment.  Free cash flow in the quarter continued to be strong at $676 million, driving year-to-date free cash flow to $1.6 billion. This strong free cash flow performance for the quarter and year-to-date periods represented free cash flow conversion ratios of approximately 107% and 100% respectively.  During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding bank debt by $325 million and structured payables by $2 million. We also ended the third quarter with $200 million of unrestricted cash on hand.  Due to our growth in earnings and reduction in bank debt, we improved our management leverage ratio to 3.2 times at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Since the merger close in July 2018, we have reduced our management leverage ratio by 2.8 times and continue to expect to achieve a management leverage ratio at or below 3 times at year end.  Let me now move to our outlook for full-year 2021. For the third time this year, we increase our guidance for constant currency net sales growth to reflect the significant momentum in the business. And we now expect growth in the range of 7% to 8%. This compares with our original 2021 guidance for constant currency net sales growth of 3% to 4% and our most recent guidance of 6% to 7%.  We continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the range of 13% to 15%. And we expect to continue to invest significantly in marketing to maintain our top line momentum.  Supporting this guidance, we expect the following. Adjusted interest expense is now expected in the range of $495 million to $500 million, reflecting the realized gains on interest rate swap contracts that benefited the third quarter. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected in the range of 23.5% to 24%. Diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion. And finally, our management leverage ratio is expected to be at or below 3 times at year end.  With that, let me hand it back to Bob for some closing remarks. Of course. Particularly on the bevcon, as you were saying, Bob, bevcon comes in two pieces. One is the bottlers and the distributors that we work as well as our fountain foodservice business. And specific answer to the question, Pete, on the mechanism of our bottlers and distributors pricing, most of our bottlers and distributors are on incident pricing, which, as you know, is a quite a bit sophisticated algorithm that starts from the shelf prices, then goes to the bottlers and distributors and reflects to us. Therefore, this is a best-in-class in terms of pricing adjustments that take place in the marketplace. And that also includes the sophisticated revenue growth management strategies that we deploy on a consistent basis.  Therefore, as Bob also alluded a couple of minutes ago, the whole sector took some forms and shapes of pricing actions, either shelf price improvements or using a sophisticated revenue growth management strategies. And as a result of that, there's a net flow through to our bevcon business. And given the nature of the bevcon that we ship and sell and transfer the concentrate, the increase in the pricing in that segment reflects in our numbers right away. Right away meaning a little earlier than the packaged beverages, for example, that takes a little bit gap between the price improvements, we turn into the finished product, ship it and sell it across the board. So, that will be our algorithm that make us to realize very good margin improvement from the pricing in bevcon. Actually, I like to expand a little bit because, obviously, the whole inflation and the pricing algorithm is so interrelated to each other. As we shared with you, and I'm sure you are seeing this every day, like everyone else, we are experiencing a significant increase in inflation, particularly in packaging materials, labor, lately coffee beans, Corning glass, and so forth, which is a broad base of our input costs, combined with transportation. And the latest one, we are seeing pressure on the labor shortage as well as the availability.  As we also shared with you a little while ago, we expect overall inflation rate for 2021 to impact us negatively around 6%. And also, inflation has accelerated through 2021, with the second half being higher than the first half. So, what does this mean? This means that we are entering into 2022 at a higher second half run rate. So, we expect that at least the first couple of quarters of 2022 to face tougher comps than the second half of 2021.  Having said that, during our Investor Day, October 1, we also shared with you that our long term outlook is for continued adjusted operating margin growth fueled by primarily three things \u2013 productivity, mix and overhead leverage \u2013 while we continue to invest in our brands to continue to drive our strong growth.  Therefore, at this point in time, our 2022 outlook is our best estimate based on a range of assumptions, which is very important to articulate and this is how we have been managing the enterprise for a while, which is a balance between the inflation, pricing, productivity and business investments. Obviously, the more we know, we will update you and the timing of that update would be during our February 2022 call that will announce our quarter four and the full-year results.  But in summary, we believe in the strength of our plan and the algorithm that we put in front of you that will deliver over time. And as we say, use the genetic code on partners, and obviously, we include the branded partners we have as well as private label. It's one group for us. And as we shared with you, not the specifics, but in general terms, our partner contracts are for long-term duration. So, they are not for the short term. And the contracts obviously specify all the details in terms of the working relationship.  So, when we do the double click, we also see that, as KDP, we are not responsible to source the coffee beans for the most of our partner group. So, what does this mean? This means that any fluctuation, plus or minus, in the coffee bean procurement, responsibility of the profit and loss management lie with the partner group. That also obviously includes the pricing on the shelves that we have zero saying and it's their business and their job to decide how they manage their pricing.  And in some instances that we are responsible in terms of the coffee bean supply, we use our broad hedging strategies and techniques by considering all these puts and takes and protect ourselves at all times. So, this is our overall working relationship from the core manufacturing side of our business and how we set the algorithm between the partner groups as well as the branded ones as well as the private label. First of all, we are not at a position to disclose all the detailed relationship between us and our partners. I'm sure you will appreciate. But if I want to make, let's say, overall general statement on that one, we always look to several pieces as a kind of basket between \u2013 from the manufacturing perspective, that includes some of the input cost. As you said and as I said that we are not responsible for the most part from the coffee beans. But there are some other elements, as you say, but that's why we have our overall productivity programs. That's why we always look for further efficiencies in our business in order, first of all, to help us to improve our margins as we have been doing as well as to weather these type of non-persistent or persistent inflationary environments. Therefore, it wouldn't be right just to look to one piece element and try to make sense out of it, but rather we need to look holistically and that's how we were managing not only coffee, but all segments of our business on the basis of the relationship with pricing, the inflation, productivity as well as the business investments.  And as we have also spoke, we also improved our pricing on the owned and licensed that will be impacting our numbers. And you will see in the data as well starting quarter four onwards. And as we also said that we are very pleased both on the coffee beverages as well as cold beverages that the sector is very rational and very responsible to manage the inflation and the pricing relationship. Therefore, we are very pleased, Laurent, with our algorithm and our working relationship with our partners in all pieces of the elements. Absolutely. And I like to expand a little bit on this because this is a very important topic and is ever changing, especially times of COVID proved how vigilant and flexible and adaptive we need to be.  First of all, when we look to the sources of the inflation, you will see that that's across the board. That includes, as you were saying, Bob, the main commodities that we buy that we have several sophisticated hedging strategies and techniques that we apply.  But that is not all. There are other elements of the cost of goods sold that are being increased as part of the general inflation. That includes transportation, warehousing, which is hard to being able to hedge, for example, and even some parts of our portfolio in the packaging like polypropylene which is the main material that we use in the K cups. The traditional hedging techniques do not work there.  But having said that, what is important for us that we manage this again in a very basket driven basis by looking to several scenarios and assumptions. And of course, we do change our hedging strategies and policies on the basis of the expectations as well as taking very different blends of positions again, depending on which segment of our business.  But beyond that, we are also very active to protect ourselves because inflation comes obviously as an increased price, but the availability is also important. Therefore, we have been very active of trying to find alternative suppliers. And beyond that alternative suppliers, also diversifying geographically the sources of the input to fulfill our business requirements.  Therefore, when we say hedging, it summarizes quite a bit, but it's not all there are several legs to how we manage the overall cost of goods sold base of our company. That includes the supplier relationship. That includes the diversification. That includes the geographical diversification at the same time. Therefore, it's a very vigilant part of our business that we are all over and spending a huge amount of time to get it right. And what matters at the end of the day that we manage this complex situation on the basis of the various assumptions and still continue to successfully deliver against our financial commitments. As we have been doing a little bit more than three years, I think the model that we have adopted has proven to be successful, and we will continue to act as such."

            "name": "Robert Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. As we approach the completion of our three-year, post-merger period, we're looking forward to our next chapter of transformation and growth. We're entering that phase from a position of strength, with topline momentum fueled by new tools and capabilities, robust innovation, and the right team and culture to enable continued success.  Importantly, we're also nearing our targeted leverage ratio, which enables us to shift the use of our industry-leading cash generation from debt reduction to a new set of options for increased value creation. We have successfully navigated the macro dislocation that has occurred over the past 20 months and expect to be able to do the same in the face of the new challenges that are causing incremental disruption across the economy.  The escalation in input cost inflation coupled with labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, including constraints in transportation, impacted us in the quarter and will likely persist for some time. As part of the offset, we have increased price and utilized a wide range of RGM initiatives across our portfolio, along with stepped up productivity, alternate sourcing and supplier strategies, and other cost mitigation activities. Given the strength of our brands, driven by increased investment in innovation in marketing, we have been successful in limiting the elasticity impact of the pricing to date.  Our third quarter results provide a good example of KDP's ability to manage through challenges and deliver strong and balanced results. We posted another quarter of high-single-digit constant currency net sales growth, with all four business segments reporting strong increases. We also delivered double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth, while increasing marketing investment in the quarter.  As discussed last quarter, we believe it's helpful to highlight our results on a two-year basis because we are layering strong current year performance on top of strong year-ago performance, which we believe sets KDP apart from most companies.  On this basis, constant currency net sales advanced 13% versus the third quarter of 2019 and adjusted diluted EPS was up 38%. On a year-to-date basis, results were similarly strong compared to 2019.  KDP's in-market performance for the third quarter was as strong as our financial performance. We continue to grow share in carbonated soft drinks, reflecting core brand growth, and successful innovation and renovation, most notably our new zero sugar variety. Sunkist continued to post strong double-digit consumption growth behind its new flavor lineup and is now the number one fruit flavored CSD brand in the category. Other CSDs posting strong growth in the quarter were Canada Dry, A&W, and Squirt.  The Dr Pepper brand also continued to perform exceptionally well, consistently gaining market share on the strength of double-digit consumption growth. This growth has accelerated with the recent launch of this year's Fansville campaign, which celebrates the passion consumers have for college football and Dr Pepper.  In-market performance of our key non-carb beverage brands such as Snapple, Bai, and Core continued to be impacted by supply chain challenges that capped growth. The supply chain situation is already showing signs of improvement with Snapple's latest four-week consumption well above its 13-week trend, and Bai growing consumption by nearly 15% in the most recent periods behind the success of Bai Boost.  On a two-year stack basis, in-market performance of our cold beverages was very strong, with nearly 75% of the portfolio's retail sales base expanding market share.  We continue to drive our newest brand partnerships and deepen existing ones. In the case of Polar, we expanded availability outside of the Northeast region, achieving a 3.7% share and 60% ACV distribution in markets for which KDP is responsible for the brand. We also invested in Vita Coco's recent IPO. And as part of that transaction, extended our distribution agreement with them.  In coffee, our K-Cup pod shipments advanced 6% in the quarter and are up almost 7% year-to-date. This reflects continued strong at-home performance and a modest improvement versus year ago in away-from-home coffee, although the latter continues to be down significantly versus pre-COVID levels. Market share of KDP manufactured pods and track channels was 83%, up almost a full point versus year ago.  As we discussed during our recent Investor Day, we expect to add at least 2 million new Keurig households in 2021, continuing our long-term growth trajectory and clearly showing no pullback following our accelerated level of 3 million new Keurig households added in 2020. We will provide a final 2021 household penetration number when we report our Q4 earnings.  Brewer shipments grew 2.2% in the quarter, successfully comping a 34% increase in the third quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, brewer sales were up 22% versus year ago. And compared to the third quarter of 2019, brewer sales were up 44%. Driving this impressive growth is effective marketing and our comprehensive quality and innovation strategy that is widening choice, functionality, and price points of our brewer portfolio. The most recent example is our new MultiStream Technology, which delivers a richer, more balanced, and flavorful cup of coffee.  Our newest brewer is the Keurig Supreme Plus SMART, initially launched on keurig.com in July and now rolling out to retailers in time for the holidays. In addition to incorporating MultiStream Technology, this Internet-connected brewer also features our new BrewID technology, which recognizes the specific K cup pod in use and automatically customizes brew settings. The brewer SMART technology also enhances our successful auto delivery business by utilizing SKU level pod consumption data to automatically replenish consumers via shipments direct to home. Both our auto delivery and broader ecommerce business continued to expand in the quarter on top of the exceptionally strong growth experienced last year.  We also continue to innovate in pod sustainability and have begun the introduction of Easy Peel lids to our recyclable K-cup pods in order to make the recycling process simpler for consumers.  In addition to the good progress we've made in coffee pod sustainability, the accomplishments in our companywide ESG efforts continue to be recognized. Recently, we received the Reuters Responsible Business Award for the social and human capital category, recognizing our 20-year journey of putting farmers first by improving 1 million lives in our coffee supply. A top 10% ranking among 350 food and agriculture companies by the World Benchmarking Alliance, a United Nations affiliated organization that focuses on improving private sector performance against the UN Sustainable Development Goals. A number two ranking out of 50 of the largest CPGs and retailers in North America by the nonprofit, As You Sow, in their assessment of plastic usage and packaging sustainability progress, and LEED Gold certification for our new Frisco headquarters.  Before turning it over to Ozan, I want to highlight the increase in our outlook for 2021 net sales growth to 7% to 8% as communicated in our press release this morning. We continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS growth in the range of 13% to 15% as pricing, productivity, and revenue growth are being leveraged to offset significant and accelerating industry inflation, as Ozan will now discuss in his comments. Closing out 2021 completes the three-year commitment established in January of 2018 at the announcement of the merger. Clearly, a lot has transpired since then, and throughout this time, the KDP team has remained focused, flexible and resilient. With one quarter left to go, we are confident that we will significantly over deliver our net sales commitment and achieve our 15% to 17% adjusted EPS commitment.  I will now turn back to the operator for your questions. We're very happy with revenue growth that we've seen. If you recall, when we put the company together, we talked about revenue \u2013 three-year revenue guidance of 2% to 3%, and we've far exceeded that. It's driven in a really healthy way through a combination of growth across the entire business, core business growth, and innovation, and it's fueled by great marketing as well and our execution at retail. So, the drivers behind it are sustainable. The contributions from our brands and the innovation pipeline is very strong.  Again, as we sit here in \u2013 during the Investor Day in October and we're looking out over the future, we think that mid-single digits is the right target. Remember that everybody is getting some revenue growth off of the pricing that we're putting in place right now. So, it's hard to look down the road and forecast what pricing will be over the next three to five years. So, we base it more on what the underlying volume growth is in a normalized pricing environment, and are comfortable that mid-single digits is the right commitment for us to make over the long term. Obviously, the trends that we're seeing right now are stronger than that. The questions that you're asking are on the minds of everybody in the industry. The fortunate thing is that we operate in a wonderful industry, beverages, and I'm including coffee in that as well, that is incredibly rational.  So, the objective is margin protection. And what we've all faced is an unprecedented level of inflation, certainly unprecedented in all of our working careers for the North American market level of inflation. There are three ways to offset that \u2013 pricing. And I would include RGM in pricing, and I'll talk more about that. Pricing, productivity, and then there's another lever, which is reinvestment back in the business. And so, we can pull those levers in different magnitudes based on the level of inflation and what we believe the impact will be on the overall business.  What we're seeing right now is that there's been a significant amount of pricing across the industry. The data that I have doesn't suggest that we were slower than anyone else. I think we were right in line. Different parts of our business realized the pricing faster than others. So, for example, our BC business has an immediate impact. When you take pricing, it hits the P&L. There's a delayed response in some of our other businesses, as it has to reach retail, and you have to protect some of the promotions in place. So that's may be what you're thinking about there, but certainly there's been extensive pricing.  The impact of elasticities has been better than historical, and in part it's because of the way we've taken pricing and also the strength of the brands. And we've been able to find a way uniquely within I think the industry to continue to have positive gross margin in the quarter, for example, which gives us the opportunity to reinvest back in our business, which makes pricing even more possible because you continue to invest in your brand strength. So, I would suggest that that's the framework we approach 2022, and any prediction I would make in the future about elasticities, where do I think inflation is going to be, how do I think pricing will respond to that, not productive because it's impossible for anybody, including the Fed, to predict what's happening going forward. What I would say is that we manage this in a very dynamic manner. When there is more inflation, the industry has put on more pricing. And we have the other levers that I talked about in terms of productivity and reinvestment to pull to protect margin. And that's why we're confident in the guidance that we put out in October 1 in an environment as volatile as this. We still have the ability to manage our way through that. Let me let me kick it off, Ozan, and then I'll turn it over to you. The timing between shipments \u2013 our shipments and bottler case volumes is always quarter to quarter some disconnect. They equalize over time. There's nothing notable there. And the best way to look at the underlying health of our business, and it's more of a leading indicator, is to look at the consumption numbers, the offtake numbers from IRI and Nielsen because that's the leading indicator of consumer demand that will pull our brand through, whether it comes through our system or through another entity's system, it's still our brand and that's reflected in those numbers. And you can see that they're exceptionally strong, particularly on Dr Pepper, which is the largest brand that flows through multiple systems. So, everything is very positive there. There's nothing to note. Ozan, you want to talk a little bit about the inflationary impact on our partners and how they offset that. I'm going to tackle the first one on supply chain and then, Ozan, you want to talk a bit about 2022 and margins after I finish that. With regard to supply chain piece, like everyone, this has just been a rolling pattern of challenges. So, last time we talked to you, we were having some issues with regard to packaging availability, particularly in the area of Snapple and glass, which required us to move faster to our PET conversion, and starting up the plant much faster than we expected. That is largely behind us. And as I said, you're seeing improvements in those businesses. And so, at the moment, that is less of the issue. Our bigger challenges, and I think consistent with the industry, is actually transportation right now. Customer pickups, as well as shipments that we make that are not through our own fleet are increasingly challenged where pickups don't happen as scheduled and transportation is unreliable, as well as incredibly costly.  And then again, like everybody, we're facing some rolling labor issues as well that are not adequate from time to time to be able to service the demand. So, our supply chain team has done incredibly well in navigating through all of these. As you know, we have new supply chain leadership. And Tony, who has joined us, made an immediate impact on that. And so, we're seeing a lot of improvements. But it continues to be incredibly volatile.  Ozan, you want to talk about the margin side? I think we lost the end of it. But let me give you a point of view on this space here. On alcohol, in particular, is an area that we look at, it's very similar to the way we look at beverages in total. So as we said, when we put the other coffee with cold beverages, that we thought there was an opportunity to look at beverages holistically. It's the same with alcohol. Now, the complexity of distribution is one that has been pointed out by many including us. And I think that what you referenced with regard to Pepsi is very interesting in how they're being creative around that.  What you're seeing is really the intersection of two opportunities. One is portfolio expansion to new territories, as well as consolidation in the distribution assets to make sure that they are at scale and therefore more efficient. And so, we look at both of those opportunities. And the one that you point out is there is some overlap. So, it's an area that we continue to study. As we had pointed out on the Investor Day, we participate in alcohol in a variety of ways that I think was surprising that people. We talked about the business we have in Canada, where the distribution environment is very different. The fact that we do licensing in the alcohol space, and we think that our brands can play in alcohol nicely, the fact that we're the number one mixer company which has us participating in alcohol consumption occasions at a much higher rate. And we put all of that knowledge and objective together to think about that.  So I think, in short, there's a lot of complexity to do this in the US. It's interesting to see how others are looking at it. We look at beverages holistically, and so it's certainly on our radar screen. It'll be something in the broadest sense that we'll be talking about in the future. First of all, I'll start with the team. We're really proud and pleased with the team that we have in place right now. We continue to build capabilities. If you look at where we have drawn team members, especially at the most senior levels, and you see it at the EL, executive team level. But I would also say, at the level of direct reports to the executive team, it's very similar. Wide range of packaged goods experience with a focus on beverages. We like to pull people from all elements of beverages. So we have non-alcohol as well as alcohol experience. We have a number of people who in that individual have experience in both. We also have people who have a number of experiences both within North America as well as international experience. And we think that this combination of skills, experiences, backgrounds and style make us much stronger as a team. And we will continue to add talented team as well as promote and upgrade talent from within as we've done. So, it is a critical part for our ongoing success to make sure that we've got the management team who can really lead the business of the future.  So let's talk about some of the future-looking comments or questions that you ask right there. Again, we go back to our original thesis for putting the two companies together is that beverages historically had been managed in silos. And we thought if we took a look at it from a consumer perspective that we would be better off and it's exactly what we've seen, is that consumers don't think about beverages in formats, the silos. They think about needs and occasions and they use multiple beverage formats, brands, products, etc., to satisfy those needs.  So, by taking a consumer first, need-based approach, it has really informed our innovation pipeline, both in the cold and hot side to great success, as you see, it's driven our marketing programs. And it helps us think about partnerships going forward, whether that's a partnership like Polar that was our most recent one, in which we have a long term franchise agreement with them, but not ownership. Or partnerships where we have seen investment or ultimately acquire the business as we've done with others.  When you think about our distribution assets, which is another area that you point to, we put the company together in 2018, and talked about seven different ways that we went to market. We ranged from direct store delivery, to wholesale direct, to franchise \u2013 our fountain foodservice which is our on-premise business. But the other one that we talked about at that time was ecommerce, and there was very little appreciation for ecommerce, particularly in beverage in 2018. And that's changed dramatically.  We have seen the percentage of our ecommerce business grow. We've talked to you before. That's north of 10%. It's higher on our coffee business. It grows significantly faster than our average business. And we are in position to be the market leader, the category leader in this space, driven by the historical strength of Keurig. And now with Keurig, where there's always been a substantial ecommerce business, the fact that we are selling brewers that are smart brewers that can recognize the pod, that can trigger an order direct to consumer based on actual SKU level consumption, suggests that we are thinking way ahead in terms of what the next steps are in terms of distribution routes, as well as efficiency.  My last point is it ties back to the question that Kevin asked, in addition to portfolio whitespace and finding new points of distribution, we think our CSD asset is a competitive advantage. But we also believe in consolidation and distribution in the industry. And we'll look for ways to continue to consolidate distribution and drive more efficiency and effectiveness through that really important asset to us.  So, I think I've covered all of your forward-looking points. If there's anything else on there or anything I missed, let me know. As you know, Polar continues to be responsible for the brand in their territories. And we've expanded outside of the Northeast for them. Right now, we're at 60% ACV distribution in the territories for which we're responsible. We're happy with that. It continues to grow. We've achieved now just under a four share of that category, which is a sizable and growing category. And we're happy with the trajectory that we're on.  I was out just recently doing retail in a number of markets across the country, and I was really pleased with the level of distribution and display activity that we're getting. And in stores in which we haven't gotten it fully slotted onto the shelf yet because of timing, I saw a lot of off-shelf display pressure, which will continue to grow the brand.  The Polar team is responsible for marketing the brand. And it's something that we work with in conjunction \u2013 work with them on. And I agree with you that, as this distribution base continues to build, and we have great push activity behind it, needs to be supported with an increasing amount of consumer poll activity. And that's something that we're continue to work with them on. But I think that the foundation is in place to be able to activate that. And overall, we're just really pleased with how that business is trending. Let me talk a little bit about just pricing in total on pods and then, Ozan, why don't you pick up on the partner agreements and potential pricing there. I think pricing is always an interesting conversation in the context of K cup pods because we have intentionally been lowering the price, although I know for analysts and investors that was always something of concern. We always point out that that was an intentional strategy that has continued to drive household penetration. And we knew that the price was too high. And we're able to back up those price investments with strong levels of productivity because, as the price came down, we were able to expand margin. That's certainly the proof point that it was intentional. We had that well under control. We are seeing an increase in the underlying price of coffee. And while that is a lesser component of a finished K cup pod than somebody who's selling roast and ground coffee, it still is of a magnitude where we know that pricing is appropriate and required. So we pass it on immediately in the form of pricing in our owned and licensed brands. And we do think that's the right thing to do, given the inflation. But it's a little more complex in the partner situation as well as private label. And I think, Ozan, why don't you talk that through because it's a good opportunity to remind everyone how our contracts work and what they're likely to see inside and outside of the KDP P&L. Ozan, you want to pick that up. I think just to build on that, as I said before, just to reemphasize, our objective is margin protection. Our levers to pull are a combination of pricing, productivity and reinvestment. And we have different mechanisms in different contracts to be able to protect margin against that, using that entire basket.  And in the case of coffee, which has been the most inflationary item within the manufacturing and delivery of a K cup pod \u2013 as we said, we're not responsible for it for most of our partners. And in the case of our own brands, we immediately took pricing, which by the way, as you can see, didn't really show up at all in Q3 based on the timing of the pricing and the lag on that. So, that's the actual pricing that we put in place, and we've seen across the industry as more to come. First of all, I think you're connecting things that aren't connected right now. So you're looking at our 2022 guidance, which was our initial guidance that we were in a position to \u2013 I think really felt obligated to provide some guidance in October, four to five months in advance of when we normally would. And as we've shown, since the very beginning, we pick our guidance and our commitments really seriously. We're pretty much the only company that held on to guidance during COVID. So when we put a number out there, we treat it as a commitment and an obligation. And so, when we're sitting there in October, operating an incredibly volatile environment that nobody can predict, we feel that it was important to set expectations for 2022 that was friendly to investors, so that they could plan appropriately.  So, connecting coffee contracts and our ability to price or not, which I think we just explained in great detail over the last two questions to our guidance for 2022, I think is not appropriate.  Having said all that, I'm going to say what we said a couple times today. Inflation is one input cost. We are managing around a range of inflation. One of the pieces that I think is not well understood is as soon as we talk about inflation, immediately, I see reports jump to commodities and hedging. Let's be clear, the inflation that the industry is seeing right now is way beyond commodities. It's packaging, it's labor, transportation. Some, if not most of those, cannot be hedged and are impossible to forecast. So, everybody is getting exposed to a high level of inflation. We're exiting 2021 at the highest run rate of the year. Nobody can fully predict how that's going to flow through in 2022. But if you're entering the year at the highest level of the previous year, that would cause you to say, okay, there's going to be increasing pressure and we're going to have to offset that through a range of pricing, productivity and reinvestment. Last point I would make as you think about 2022 is we're really clear. Our marketing is up in 2021 versus 2020. We intend for our marketing to be up in 2022 as well. The industry took down marketing in 2020 versus 2019 reluctantly, but the whole industry did it. Our objective is to build it back because we think investment in our brands behind innovation is the most important thing, and it's fueling the top line. So there's an assumption in 2022 that we're going to reinvest. And you can figure that into the estimates as well.  So, that's our outlook for 2022. It's early. We're going to provide a lot more information when we're in our normal position of doing so in early February. We take our commitment seriously. And we're really pleased with the growth of our business and believe that the right thing for us over the long term is to continue to invest in growth and not cut marketing spend to be able to offset any margin pressures. There are a variety mechanisms for us to recover inflation on the pod side of the business. Pricing is one of them. Productivity is another. My black point on this one is \u2013 I said this for the past three years that the focus on pricing on coffee, while it makes sense from a traditional CPG perspective, makes no sense in the coffee pod business when the company is intentionally trying to lower prices. And even in an inflationary environment, we're trying to keep prices down. We're only passing on the coffee costs because they are excessively high.  With regards to the rest of our business, we have a significant amount of productivity and mechanisms to take more pricing if we choose going forward. But remember, our overarching strategy is to try to keep prices down even in the face in the face of inflation and protect our margins through a combination of productivity and pricing. In this business, we have leaned on productivity because it's available to us much more than pricing because it's the right thing to do for the ecosystem of Keurig.  Recognize that concept is very different concept than traditional CPG. I would also say it's the beauty of the Keurig system because it truly is an ecosystem. That's an overused phrase, but it's true in the case of Keurig. And that's what makes this thing work over the long term. You can't focus on one metric because if you do you have you run the risk of damaging the long term growth of the system. And you could see that, if anything, we're accelerating the growth of the system, which really drives everything. Let me hit the first one and then, Ozan, you want to talk about hedging and duration of our positions and how we think about that.  Yeah, on the international side, with regard to M&A specifically, as we talked about in our Investor Day, we're really excited about being able to use our high levels of discretionary free cash flow to look beyond debt reduction as we're just about to reach our long-term leverage targets. And we talked about the capacity to do $20 billion worth of M&A.  There are four areas that we talked about in that portfolio, whitespace distribution and consolidation within distribution, adding capabilities to our business. And then we also talked about market expansion or international. So, it's one of the top priorities. I don't want to rank them because it's going to be dependent upon not just our needs and our opportunities, but what is available and what kind of partners are on the other side. We've got really nice business in Mexico. We hadn't talked about it very much. And we were proud to share with you the business that we built in Mexico at Investor Day.  Similarly, in Canada, we have a nice business there that we have really driven nicely. And we believe that both of those markets are \u2013 we've got a position there with management, infrastructure capabilities that are scalable. And so, we see opportunities in those two markets.  And then I really don't want to talk beyond that because our objective is to make sure that we leverage the investments that we already have in place and scale them before we look at completely open territory, although that's not off the table, and see a lot of exciting opportunities across all of North America, not just in the US. Ozan, you want to talk about the hedging in our commodity position. Thank you very much for joining us today. Our teams are out all day. So if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. We're here."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Conference call for the Second Quarter of 2021. This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tyson Seely. Mr. Seely, please go ahead.\nTyson Seely: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued our press release for the second quarter of 2021. If you need a copy, you can get one on our website at keurigdrpepper.com in the Investors section. Consistent with previous quarters, today, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis excluding items affecting comparability. The Company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. With the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons in an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are included in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the Company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance. Here with me to discuss our second quarter 2021 results are KDP Chairman and CEO, and Bob Gamgort; our CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\nBob Gamgort: Thanks, Tyson, and good morning, everyone. Since we spoke last quarter, consumer mobility across North America has continued to increase, with improving trends in travel, grocery and retail and recreation translating into changes in growth trends in beverage category segments and retail channels. Just as we experienced in 2020, the COVID recovery period in 2021 is creating significant volatility in demand, which has required us to remain nimble and flexible in managing our business. One area in which mobility remains challenged is offices, which continues to be a headwind for us in coffee. While we've experienced some improvement year-to-date and expect more over the balance of the year, we project the recovery of office mobility to lag other areas of the economy. Mix management was key to our success in 2020 as we were able to drive growth in on-trend segments and channels to offset those that were structurally challenged by COVID. While managing demand mix continues to be critical this year, we also face the added challenges of input cost and labor inflation, transportation constraints, labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, making 2021 arguably more difficult in many respects than 2020. We expect another 6 to 12 months of macro volatility before a more predictable operating environment emerges. Key to stabilization will be a return to both school and the office environment, the course of the COVID virus and its variants, the impact of reduced or eliminated government subsidies, the catch-up of global supply chains to meet unprecedented demand and an improvement in the labor market. Despite all the challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our EPS guidance for 2021 while increasing our revenue growth target to 6% to 7% for the full year. Our updated financial outlook offsets the challenges I mentioned a moment ago with new pricing actions announced across most of our categories, along with continued productivity and efficiency efforts and the improving performance in our higher-margin beverage concentrates and fountain food services businesses that both benefit from increased mobility. It's important to note that we still intend to reinvest any earnings upside into growth investments. At the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range we will have achieved the three-year financial algorithm that we communicated at the time of our merger, delivering annual adjusted diluted EPS within our target range of 15% to 17%, revenue growth well above our target range of 2% to 3% and our leverage ratio at or below 3x by the end of this year. We will share our outlook for the business and update our long-term algorithm for total shareholder return at our upcoming investor event in September. Details regarding the virtual event will be shared next week. Turning to second quarter results we announced this morning. We posted another strong quarter, highlighted by double-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS and high single-digit growth in constant currency net sales. These results were broad-based and balanced across the Company with growth driven by both core business and innovation. Because we're one of the few companies layering strong current year performance on top of strong year ago performance, it's also helpful to highlight our results on a two-year basis. Comparing the first half of 2021 with the same time period in 2019 shows constant currency net sales growth of 13.5%, adjusted operating income growth of 19.5% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of just under 30%. We expanded our market share of total liquid refreshment beverages over the previous two years, driven in part by our 1.4 share point increase in carbonated soft drinks. Total K-Cup pod shipments increased nearly 15% over the same time, and brewer sales are up nearly 50%. Looking specifically at the second quarter, more than 70% of our cold beverage retail sales base expanded market share, reflecting continued growth of CSDs driven by core brand strength and innovation, the most recent being our new Zero Sugar lineup which is performing exceptionally well. Growth in key non-carb beverage brands such as Snapple, Core, Bai and Evian was good for the quarter but could have been even stronger had it not been for supply disruptions, which I will discuss in a few moments. In coffee, our K-Cup pod shipments were essentially flat in the quarter successfully lapping the very strong year ago period that was driven by peak at-home consumption. Comparing K-Cup pod shipment volume to 2019 removes some of the significant noise and timing for that business. For the quarter, K-Cup pods grew nearly 10% on a two-year basis, demonstrating the underlying long-term growth trends in our coffee business. Keurig brewer sales in the quarter increased by nearly 30% compared to a year ago, some of which was influenced by government stimulus and the timing of Amazon Prime Day. Finally, with regard to coffee systems innovation, we were excited to announce earlier this week the launch of the K-Supreme Plus Smart Brewer, marking our first launch of a connected brewer for the broader consumer market. We look forward to talking more about the new Brew ID technology and the growth platforms it creates for us at our upcoming Investor Day event. Shifting from demand to supply, nearly all CPG companies have discussed supply disruptions in 2021, and we're certainly not immune to these challenges. We continue to be effective d in supplying K-Cup pods and CSDs, and we've been able to overcome chip shortages and ocean transportation limitations to supply the high levels of demand for our Keurig brewers. However, our non-carb beverage portfolio has been negatively impacted by supply disruptions, especially Snapple and Core, which is evident in the latest Scanner numbers. I'll use Snapple as one example of the type of challenges that we and most other CPG companies are facing in the current environment. As we discussed on previous earnings calls, we started rolling out our refreshed Snapple bottle on the West Coast in November of 2020. That new package substitutes post-consumer recycled plastic or rPET for glass and non-recycled plastic. And it also contemporizes the Snapple brand look and feel. The consumer reception has been very strong, with Snapple growing share for the first six months of the year as we increased recruitment of younger consumers, exactly what we intended to do with the refresh. However, an unexpected shortfall in committed glass bottles from our supplier required us to transition our new rPET packaging faster, which pressured material availability from our supplier of rPET and stretch the startup curve of our new production lines. We're navigating through this challenge and other disruptions that have become the new normal in 2021 to maintain our guidance. However, we do expect some sales and share pressure on key non-carb beverage brands throughout the third quarter. Our learnings on how to successfully manage our business through the volatility of COVID continue to serve us well as we build an increasingly resilient organization. Before I turn it over to Ozan to discuss our segment performance in detail, I'd like to mention the great progress we continue to make in the area of ESG, which we know is important to an increasing number of investors. We recently issued our annual corporate responsibility report that highlights our performance against our previous ESG goals, increases our ambition through new ESG goals and expands our impact in new areas such as diversity and inclusion and health and wellness. If you haven't done so already, I encourage you to read the CR report, which is available on the KDP corporate website. Ozan, over to you.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on an adjusted basis, I will briefly review our performance for the second quarter, which was very strong and our press release discusses in significant detail. I will then turn to our outlook for 2021. Constant currency net sales increased 8.1%, fueled by higher volume mix of 6.1% and favorable net price realization of 2%, with all four of our business segments posting growth driven by elevated consumption and strong in-market execution. For the first six months of 2021, constant currency net sales grew 9.4% versus a year ago and 13.4% versus the first six months of 2019. Adjusted operating income in the second quarter totaled $839 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to $775 million in the year ago period, driven by this strong net sales growth across our portfolio, productivity and merger synergies. These growth drivers were partially offset by significantly higher marketing investment in the quarter, inflation in logistics, manufacturing and input costs and higher operating expenses associated with increased consumer demand. For the first six months of 2021, adjusted operating income increased 8.3% versus year ago and 19.4% as compared to the first six months of 2019. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased 6.8% versus year ago. Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 26.7% compared to 27.1% in the prior year, significantly impacted by the reinvestment in marketing in the quarter, inflation and unfavorable margin mix due to the higher brewer sales. Adjusted net income advanced 14.7% in the quarter to $538 million compared to $469 million in a year ago period driven by growth in adjusted operating income and lower interest expense, largely driven by lower interest rates stemming from the strategic refinancing we completed in the first quarter of 2021. Debt repayments and the lower adjusted tax rate in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 15.2% to $0.38 per diluted share compared to $0.33 per diluted share in the year ago period. For the first six months of 2021, adjusted diluted EPS advanced approximately 14.5% versus a year ago and more than 29% versus the first six months of 2019. Let me pause for a moment to discuss the inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges we have referenced this morning. Price expectations continue to rise for aluminum, glass, corn products and polypropylene, which is a material use in our K-Cup pods. And like most other CPG companies, we have also experienced an increase in transportation and logistics costs as well as supply chain challenges related to supplier constraints, labor shortages and material and packaging availability. Despite these challenges, we have confidence in our ability to successfully navigate them. I will elaborate on this. For 2021, we are in a position of strength as our sales growth momentum will help to offset inflation. As discussed previously, we rely on a combination of productivity, cost controls, pricing and various other revenue growth management strategies, pulling the right levers at the right time to protect the long-term health of our business. In terms of price, we have already announced increases in both our core beverage and owned and licensed coffee portfolios. Along with the other levers I just mentioned, this approach enables us to mitigate rising input costs and address supply chain challenges while reinvesting in the business and protecting bottom line profit. As we did in 2020, we will remain nimble in response to changing market conditions to ensure our continued success focusing on flexibility, speed and delivery to manage our product and SKU performance at a granular level. Our updated guidance for 2021 incorporates all of these considerations, and we are confident that we have the tools and management disciplines to deliver strong growth in both revenue and earnings despite the dynamic inflation and logistics challenges. Let me now turn to our segment performance in the second quarter. Coffee Systems constant currency net sales increased 3.9% driven by higher volume mix of 3.5% and favorable net price realization of 0.4%. The volume mix performance reflected pod volume growth of 0.2% and brewer volume growth of 29%. The pod growth reflected successfully, lapping peak shipments in the year ago period related to consumer stock-up behavior in the early days of the pandemic and an improved performance in the away-from-home business. Even though the return to offices continues to be slow, and this business remains well below pre-pandemic levels, the 29% increase in brewer shipments in the quarter was fueled by continued strong consumer purchases stemming from successful brewer innovation and, to a lesser extent, favorable timing of time day during the second quarter of 2021 versus the third quarter of 2020. The favorable net price realization in the quarter was largely driven by brewers and the continued moderation of pod pricing declines, consistent with our strategic pod pricing initiative launched several years ago. Looking to the back half of the year, we expect pod shipments growth to continue in the mid-single-digit range, while brewer shipments are expected to be about even with a year ago given the 30% brewer growth we achieved in the second half last year, which benefited from the government stimulus during COVID sheltering. At the time, we heard some concern that the elevated brewer growth and incremental households we were adding in 2020 represented a pull forward from '21. Given the continued strength of brewers, which are now expected to be up approximately 10% for the year on top of the 21% last year, performance would suggest that the pull forward did not occur and that our momentum continues. Adjusted operating income for Coffee Systems totaled $371 million, an increase of 2.2% compared to $363 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by continued productivity and merger synergies partially offset by inflation in manufacturing, input costs and logistics. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 1.1% in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 33.7% compared to 34.8% in the year-ago period, largely driven by the negative margin mix associated with the very strong brewer sales. Packaged Beverages constant currency net sales grew 7.3% in the second quarter driven by strong volume mix growth of 6.2% and higher net pricing of 1.1%. This performance reflected growth in both our company-owned DSD operations and warehouse direct business. The majority of our LRB portfolio contributed to this growth, with CSDs, including Canada Dry, Dr Pepper and Sunkist, along with premium water leading the way. Adjusted operating income for Packaged Beverages in the second quarter totaled $286 million, an increase of 6.3%, compared to $269 million in the year ago period. This was driven by the strong net sales growth as well as productivity and merger synergies. These growth drivers were partially offset by inflation in logistics, manufacturing and input costs, a significant increase in marketing investment and higher operating costs to meet continued strong consumer demand. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 5.9% versus a year ago. Adjusted operating margin for Packaged Beverages was 19.1% in the quarter compared to adjusted operating margin of 19.3% in the year-ago period, largely reflecting our significant reinvestment in marketing. Beverage Concentrates constant currency net sales increased 20.7% due to favorable net pricing of 10.4% and higher volume mix of 10.3%. The net pricing was driven by our annual price increase and a favorable comparison to prior year on our annual true-up of customer incentive accruals as well as strong revenue growth management. The volume mix performance was largely driven by improving trends in the fountain foodservice business, reflecting higher levels of consumer mobility in the restaurant and hospitality channels compared to the year ago period as well as the benefit of significant marketing investment driving growth in the quarter. Dr Pepper and Crush led the growth, partially offset by declines in Canada Dry. Adjusted operating income for Beverage Concentrates increased 15.3% to $256 million compared to $222 million in the year ago period, driven by net sales growth, which was partially offset by the significantly higher marketing investment. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income advanced 14.4%. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 68.3% compared to 71.8% in the year ago period, primarily reflecting the higher marketing investments. And finally, Latin America Beverages constant currency net sales grew 20.8%, reflecting strong volume mix of 16.6% and favorable net pricing of 4.2%. The liquid refreshment beverage in market execution in Mexico continued to be strong and resulting in the overall liquid refreshment beverage share expansion and continued robust retail consumption, which drove significant net sales growth for key brands, namely Penafiel and Clamato. Adjusted operating income increased 61% and to $37 million compared to $23 million in the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 44%, reflecting the strong net sales growth and productivity. These growth drivers were partially offset by significantly higher marketing investments in the quarter and inflation in logistics, manufacturing and input costs. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter advanced 310 basis points to 22.3%. Free cash flow in the quarter continued to be strong at $492 million, which translated into a year-to-date free cash flow conversion ratio of nearly 95%. In addition to our ongoing deleveraging and investing in the business to drive top line momentum, we're also increasing our return to shareholders. Specifically, during the quarter, the KBP Board authorized the previously announced 25% increase in our quarterly dividend rate, which was paid earlier this month. Despite this healthy increase, our payout as a percentage of free cash flow remains below 50%, pointing to the exceptional strength of our cash flow generation and the future optionality it provides. During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding bank debt by $427 million and structural payables by $4 million. We also ended the second quarter with $167 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Due to growth in earnings and our reduction in bank debt, we improved our management leverage ratio to 3.4x at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Since the merger closed in July 2018, we have reduced our management leverage ratio by 2.6x. Let me now move to our outlook for 2021. For the full year 2021, we now expect net sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 7%. This compares with our original guidance for the year of 3% to 4% and our most recent guidance of 4% to 6%. We continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS growth of 13% to 15% for the year and plan to reinvest any over-delivery back into the business to support continued momentum. Supporting this guidance, we continue to expect merger synergies of approximately $200 million for a three-year total of approximately $600 million, in line with our merger targets; adjusted interest expense in the range of $505 million to $515 million; an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 24%; diluted weighted shares outstanding of approximately 1.43 billion. And finally, our management leverage ratio is expected to be at or below 3x by the end of this year. With that, let me hand it back to Bob for some closing remarks.\nBob Gamgort: Thanks, Ozan. Before handing it over to questions, I want to highlight that earlier this month, we celebrated the three-year anniversary of the Keurig Dr Pepper merger. Transaction that was based on our vision to create a North America-focused beverage company that approach the consumer and customer beverage experience in a more contemporary way. In the three years since we've accomplished a great deal and we are on track to achieve all of the financial commitments we made back in January 2018. We will continue to demonstrate what we believe it takes to be a modern beverage company, and we look forward to sharing more details with you in September. I will now turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You may ask question.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning everyone. I guess I was hoping for a little more color on your Packaged Bev volume in the quarter, which was definitely strong especially considering you were lapping a tough comp from the pantry loading last year. Could you guys give us a sense of how maybe the growth progressed through the quarter and your expectations for this business in the second half? And I'm also curious how much of the strength was driven by the rollout of your new zero line and how incremental that has been on your portfolio? And maybe any early reads on the rollout from retailers in terms of securing incremental space? Thank you.\nBob Gamgort: Sure. Good morning, Bonnie. The growth in Packaged Beverages for this quarter was pretty well balanced across all items. CSD had particular strength, and I'll talk about Zero Sugar in a minute. The one area that we did flag is that in our non-carb portfolio, we started seeing some weakness as we got into the month of June in particular. And it is 100% driven by some supply issues with real issue on Snapple and Core. Both those brands were growing very, very well up into the supply disruptions. If you look at the IRi data, you see where we actually start to drop off during a little bit in May but really in the month of June on those two. So, that was the flow of the volume over the quarter as well as what the composition was. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we've increased our guidance on the year. Obviously, it's driven a lot by our Packaged Beverage business, and so all of the supply issues that we talked about are taken into consideration in that guidance. So, we're navigating our way through it. Real bright spot within the quarter continues to be CSDs. We refreshed or we converted our diet flavor brands over to Zero Sugar. If you look at an even comparison of those two, in other words, take out Dr Pepper Zero Sugar, which is an incremental item, if you just look at like-for-like on the conversion, our sales were up 16% as a result of the conversion from diet to zero sugar. And then the Dr Pepper Zero Sugar variety has been incredibly strong. Year-to-date consumption, if you look at an IRi is about $100 million. Our early read is about 70% of that is incremental, and we've been able to get that in distribution in 85% ACV. So, great execution across the board in that conversion and the addition of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar, yet one more thing that's driving our CSD portfolio, and that gave us strength combined with everything else I just talked about in the Packaged Beverage segment.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. So as I think about the second half, you expect some of this momentum to continue. Would that be fair, Bob?\nBob Gamgort: Yes, that's fair. And you can take a look at, I think, a very high level of info that we gave today, which is updating guidance for the balance of the year. So, it allows you to see a first half, second half calculation. And then we were very specific about within that, what we're expecting in terms of coffee brewer sales as well as pod sales. So, you start -- we're narrowing it down for you to give you what a Packaged Beverage business should look like.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Good morning everyone and congratulations on the quarter. Bob, just picking up on your prior remarks but maybe bringing it up to a total portfolio level. So, the 6% to 7% upwardly revised guidance is fantastic. This has been stair stepped up from 4% to 6% previously and then 3% to 4% initially. So, just maybe sort of again picking up on the last line of question, but bringing it more broadly to both the coffee and total LRB side of the portfolio, how has the view evolved over the past six months for you guys thinking about the portfolio? And the growth outlook, what specifically has come in better? What gives you confidence for the balance of the year? And then longer term and maybe you want to get into this more at the upcoming Analyst Day, what do you want to communicate to the Street in terms of what you think the sustainable growth rate is for this business longer term?\nBob Gamgort: Sure and good morning. The last part we will cover in some depth at the Investor Day, which is coming up, so I'll wait for that event to talk about beyond 2021. With regard to 2021, we're seeing strength across the board. So in the decomposition of the year-to-date numbers that you've seen, you've seen strength in every single segment, and you've seen some mix benefits. So for example, fountain foodservice and beverage concentrates, which are among our most profitable items, were negatively impacted in the year ago period. We're getting a good rebound on that. We're seeing continued strength in at-home coffee. Certainly not at the peak of consumption in home that we did a year ago, but we've been talking about that expectation since Q2 of last year. And then brewer sales continued to be exceptional. We're projecting for the rest of the year that those will be flat. But as Ozan said earlier, it certainly takes aside the concerns that many had that the incremental households we gained in 2020 and the extra brewer sales were a pull forward. That's certainly not the case. So quite simply, we're seeing strength across the entire business. That's given us the confidence to take our revenue expectations up. And then anything in a first half, second half or quarterly comparison is really driven by the volatility of a year ago. And that's why I think it's really important to look at two-year numbers to take the noise out. And it's easy for all of us to get enamored with one quarter performance. We've always taken a long-term view. And you're seeing a lot of rebound from other companies, but the reality of it is if you compare our numbers to 2019, our revenue was up almost 14%. Operating income is 20%, as I said before. Earnings per share is up about 30%. I think that's the real way to evaluate performance.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Good morning everyone. So Bob, maybe just to step back a little bit further, and I guess I wanted to get your perspective on two things. One is just given all of the supply chain, I guess, challenges or constraints, and this is -- we're hearing this across a lot of companies, just how you're thinking about the balance of reinvestment or like stimulating demand while it's just becoming more challenging to produce things. And then maybe if you can also comment on just this whole environment with inflation and labor force being tight and just -- have you seen this before? How does it change the way you think about just kind of how you're running the business day-to-day over the next year or so? I'm just trying to get a sense of just do things have to change because this just environment is so dynamic.\nBob Gamgort: Yes. I think we've seen a lot -- a number of things in the past two years that we've never seen before in our career. Certainly, the shutdown of COVID and all of the related issues around keeping employee safe and running our operations under real constrained conditions was unique. I think this rebound, as I said in my remarks, in some respects, it's actually more challenging than that because we're getting a lot of mixed signals. There's reopenings in certain areas, and then there's problems in others. We've all dealt with inflation. We've seen it in commodities and input costs. We've never seen this level of labor inflation, which is not necessarily a bad thing because there are consumers as well, so it gives them more purchasing power. But the labor shortages are something that none of us have seen in our career. And I have no idea how much of it is tied to government stimulus and concern about going back to work, how much is tied to the fact that kids need to be in school in the fall to free up the labor force who are watching the children. We're going to know a lot more when September October rolls around, but I'd say this is very much unprecedented in all of our careers. The way that we're managing through it goes back to how we started in March of 2020 when we had to make some dramatic changes due to COVID. We stay very flexible. We're looking at the short term as well as the long-term, but emphasis on not committing to anything for too long because we know it's going to change. Your comments about supply chain disruptions, I'm calling it the new normal, now hopefully, it's not normal. It's the reality we're dealing with. And we just flex when we have capacity in one area. We lean in more on demand generation when we have constraints in others. Certainly, we're not going to promote or spend incremental dollars promoting an area that we have supply constraints on. So the game is really going to be won or lost by speed by speed and flexibility. That's something that we were able to do last year. And we're certainly doing it to even a greater degree this year. And I think that will continue until this all settles out.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then just -- and maybe not even specific to KDP, but just would your expectation be that like it just doesn't stop at the end of the calendar year? Meaning this -- some of these sort of factors could continue for a while? Or should the baseline expectation be that within the next six months or so, this should start to settle out?\nBob Gamgort: It's really hard to forecast. And I said in 2020, I want to get out of the forecasting game and get into the reaction game, and I think that served us well. As I listened to the Fed, and they don't know, if inflation is short term or long-term, and you can hear the President talking about supply issues, and they don't have a good handle on what's going on here. So, I'm not going to be a better forecaster than they. I do -- if you really push us, I think we'll see this start to settle out in 2022. But again, it's going to be driven by the course of the virus and the variants. It's going to be driven by things like government stimulus. Those seem to be the two biggest factors in everything that we've just talked about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: I wanted to talk a little bit about marketing spending because in 2020, where we all know that you pulled back on marketing spend quite a bit particularly in the CSD business and yet posted these tremendous market share gains, not just the sales growth. And so as you bring marketing back into the fold, I guess, one kind of short-term question, would you say, at this point you're kind of back to 2019 levels of spend on your -- the CSD -- the cold businesses, I should say, excuse me, number one? And number two, as you think holistically knowing the plan is to reinvest any revenue upside into the business, but have you discovered better ROI on your spend that you think is sustainable rather than just was a function of the environment last year? And if so, what are maybe some of the key changes or areas where you're getting greater efficiencies?\nBob Gamgort: Good morning. Yes, we have certainly been more efficient in our marketing, and that's a continuation of a trend that's been in place for a while now. The nature of marketing has moved from being more broad targeting to more precise targeting. We have a significant number of tools and metrics available to us today that weren't available even a couple of years ago. And so the efficiency of our spend continues to increase, and that got pushed to an extreme during COVID, in which we were able to continue to generate demand, as you point out, with significantly lower levels of spend. I think part of that was efficiency and a big part of that was a unique situation a year ago. And if everybody pulls back at the same time, really, its execution, in-store availability, the right promotions that were driving a lot of demand, and we did that very well. But our intention is to continue to ramp our spending back up. You see a big jump in our numbers this quarter versus a year ago. I think everybody experienced that. We, along with pretty much everyone in the industry, is not fully back to 2019 levels of spending, but we're ramping our way up. And I think we're doing it for two reasons. One is there are a lot of cost pressures on all of us right now and a lot of volatility. So it's prudent to be able to keep some in reserve as you're increasing your spend to say let's ramp it up versus go all at once because we need some offsets to volatility going forward in addition to productivity, efficiency and the pricing that we've put in place. And that's what I just said is true for everybody in the industry right now. I think the second part is it gives us an opportunity to really test efficiency. If you ramp it up, you can see where your next dollars being spent and it's a good return on investment. And that gives you the confidence to add the incremental dollars beyond that back. So our track is to continue to increase over time. We'll talk more about what the long-term projection of that is when we get together in September, but that's how it's playing out right now in 2021.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. That's great. And as you also just think about continuing to reinvest in the business this year with any further upside you may see, what would you say are key areas, right? Because there's an element of we're getting greater efficiency in marketing. We don't need to go too quickly both because of the supply commentary that you talked about with Bryan and the industry kind of standard. What are other areas? I mean is it as you've kind of continued to change your route to market? What are the kinds of activities that you might be investing in there where some of this profit or sales-driven upside might go?\nBob Gamgort: Sure. When we get together in September, we're going to talk about the investments that we've made in the areas of R&D and product development. That's both on the hot side as well as the cold side of the business, and we'll give you some real examples of that. You point out route to market, which is critically important in beverages and something that we think is very unique. So the investments that we've made in our DSD system, which has been a big driver of growth, we've talked about it in bits and pieces over the earnings call. But when we get together, we'll be able to do a more holistic view of what we've done over the past three years and where that's going. And that's a big source of investment for us. E-commerce is another area. It's hard for you all to see the sales that we're generating in e-commerce because it doesn't show up in IRi right now. But when you see, the disconnect, sometimes between our shipment numbers and the IRi numbers, with the shipment numbers being stronger, and that happens over time, you know that we're getting some significant growth out of e-commerce. And that's a big investment area. And then just purely from a brand perspective, we would -- as we add more money, we would add to the number of -- add to our portfolio the number of brands we advertise. So right now, we focus our advertising on our largest brands. But we've got some midsized brands in there that are deserving of advertising as well, and that would be the next area that we would fund once we get to what we think is threshold on the large brands. So, there's a lot of opportunities for investment. We're very selective and test our way through it. But again, these are some of the themes that we look forward to sharing with you in September.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Good morning. So, I wanted to discuss a little bit more, Bob, if you can, on the pod attachment rate. So I think you guys said last April that it is too elevated. Your comments so far on the call have been very positive against the historical levels but a bit of peak, right? So -- and I wanted to kind of also get a little bit of -- because I believe you, Ozan, spoke to pricing during the quarter or planned pricing. So with the benefit of a few months since your last comment, can you update us what you're seeing as the office reopened and the at-home could moderate? Obviously, as you're seeing probably less than 1:1 trade-offs with away from home more than offsetting the at-home kind of moderation at this point. And on the beans, on the coffee beans and the green coffee, I think it's not that much of an impact for you, but can you kind of explain to us how protected or hedged you are and what are you embedding in your guidance? Thank you.\nBob Gamgort: Okay. Yes. Let me just go with pod growth first and just remind everybody the formula for our pod volume. It's a combination of household penetration. In growth in household penetration, the number of new households that we're adding to our existing base times the attachment rate, which is the current usage per machine. This quarter a year ago, we saw a peak level of attachment rate as people were really in lockdown mode. And as we talked about it at that time, we saw that as temporary and that over time, that would revert back to the long-term average. Over the very long term, attachment rate is very steady, and that's why we've suggested prior to COVID that you could use pod volume growth as a good proxy for household penetration growth. Very simply, our household penetration was very strong last year. We were up about 9%. We added 3 million households. We've told you before that we expected 2 million additional households this year and that attachment rate would go back to the long-term average. It's exactly what's happened. The attachment rate that we're seeing right now is very much in line with what we've seen over the long term, and household penetration continues to grow. And that's what you're seeing in the pod volume growth. So, so far, everything has gone as expected. When we look at mobility, we're seeing a significant increase in people going out of the home into restaurants and hospitality. Certainly, people going and getting coffee out-of-home in coffee shops has gone up significantly. In fact, we saw a bit of a spike at one point in the early part of reopening. I think people felt liberated to go back out and wanted to enjoy a coffee on the go. The one area that has been lagging and continues to lag is office. So even with the strong numbers that we have in our coffee business, we're still getting a fairly significant headwind out of the away-from-home business, which for us is concentrated in offices. And very similar to the question Bryan asked, it's hard for us to predict what's going to happen there. And we see an improvement versus a year ago. You couldn't get much lower than the numbers we saw a year ago and away from home, but nowhere near back to normal, nowhere near to 2019. So that provides long-term or longer-term upside for us. And as we said before, that's a higher-margin business, so it will be accretive to both top line as well as mix. But we think that will be a slow recovery, and that assumption is embedded in the numbers we gave you. With regard to pricing, like everyone who has a coffee business who has reported so far, we've talked about the significant increase in coffee pricing. We are hedged like everyone else, but hedging, it just delays the pricing. It doesn't make it go away. And so our best practices have always been is that when we see an increase in pricing that we believe will be sustained that you take pricing now, because it takes time for it to flow through the system, and you know that you're eventually going to be paying that price when you add new coverage into your portfolio. With regard to us, you're right, coffee is a lower percentage of our cost structure compared to if we were just a traditional roast and ground player. But when you have a significant increase like we're experiencing right now, it certainly does impact us to the level that we want to take pricing. And then the last point, I'll add because I think you're asking about the different forms of pricing, we have big piece of our business are brands that we own or license. We're responsible for everything on those, so we've taken pricing on that because we pay for the coffee that's in that. And then the remainder of our business is either partner or private label. In most of those situations, the partner is responsible for the price of coffee. We're responsible for everything else. So it's really up to them to decide what they want to do from a pricing standpoint with regard to coffee. That's not something we get involved in. So I think I've covered everything you asked about with regard to coffee.\nAndrea Teixeira: That's super helpful. But the like if I can just ask on that, what are you seeing in terms of like any rebounds to your private label or the ones that you represent, as you said, the brand that you have passed through, how is that reacting?\nBob Gamgort: It hasn't really. If you take a look at the IRi numbers, you haven't seen much pricing actually reach the shelf right now. So more to come that will be something we could talk about on the next quarter call about what that impact is. But typically, we don't see much in the way of trade down. But if we do, I would just remind everybody that we have -- we manufacture pods that are generating 83% of category sales. So wherever the consumer goes in terms of brand choice and wherever they go from an outlet in terms of where they buy it, we got it covered. And so we're fairly neutral in those perspectives, and we just give the consumer choice and let them decide what they want to buy.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you. Bob, just to round out that conversation on coffee, so what I took from just the cadence of what you described is that you're implementing pricing down than pricing builds over the back half. And then presumably the delayed inflation to the extent it manifests would be a '22 phenomenon. You'd have the pricing in place when you get there. Is that the way to think about it?\nBob Gamgort: Yes, that's a good way to think about it. And the pricing and the costs never match up exactly, and that's why we always create some margin for us to smooth that out, but that's a reasonable assumption.\nSteve Powers: Great. And I guess -- and maybe just a little dovetail into some of the themes you talked about in September, but I just -- maybe just an update on the build-outs that you've had going on at Spartanburg and Allentown and in Ireland and just where those are, any unexpected development, positive or not so positive? And then just, any way to think about the impact of that on -- the benefits of that on the business as we go forward beyond '21?\nBob Gamgort: Absolutely. Yes, I think it's a good time to talk about that. Ozan, would you like to jump in and update Steve and everyone on those projects?\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Absolutely. Absolutely. Steve, with regards to Allentown, we began our production of cold average cases earlier this year. And as we speak, we are proceeding to ramp up to reach full utilization levels, and it will continue through this year as well as 2021. Also as a side note, the combined cold beverage and coffee warehouse that we put together in Allentown is also fully operational. With regards to Spartanburg, we began to produce some of our K-Cups as being the first line back in June, which is very recent. And we'll continue to ramp up over the course of approximately 18 to 24 months and the reason being is due to the sheer size of the huge volume and the planned capacity that we have been implementing. And the lines will be coming up and running in a sequential, let's say, order. With regards to the investment in the project in our Ireland facility, the concentrate beverage plant, that we have been building, is almost complete. And we are expecting to put into service and ramp up from there on sometime in quarter four this year. Therefore, after the COVID related some delays, as we have communicated in three major of our investments, we are back on track. We have been getting the lines up and running in line with our new time lines right now. And we are very happy with the progress that we have been seeing.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Sean King with UBS. Your line is open.\nSean King: Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned the macro volatility lasting for the next 6 to 12 months before sort of seeing normalized consumer behavior. Is it safe to say that this could impact, I guess, the pending outlook for '22? Or am I trying to jump ahead a little bit too far here?\nBob Gamgort: Yes, it's a little jumping ahead a little bit. I mean clearly, we think about this and going into '22, but I wouldn't have any read-through in terms of trying to predict what that means for us in 2022. I think we've done a really good job of recognizing the challenges and being able to mitigate them pretty substantially if you take a look at what's happened last year and what's going on this year. And look, I can't forecast that. I can tell you that we all hope that things start to return to more normal in 2022.\nSean King: Right. Great. One more, if I could just sneak in. Just on the substantial brewer growth that you've been seeing, is there any way you can kind of break that down between brewer replacement, new brewers versus trading up? And I know a lot of that has to do with your household penetration comments, but any color you can provide around there would be great.\nBob Gamgort: Yes, it's really hard to do that in the moment. We're always able to do that in hindsight, and we do quite a bit of analysis of understanding how much of these are brewer upgrades versus straight-up replacements versus completely new households or even a secondary placement in an existing household. So, that's something that we dig in answer we're able to see in hindsight. For perspective, a year ago, we added 3 million net new households, and we sold 11 million brewers. So that gives you an idea of how much household penetration growth we were able to drive, which was substantial, almost 10%. But at the same time, we continue to offer better brewers with new features that are encouraging people to upgrade. And although an upgrade is not something that we profit from in the moment because we don't make money on the brewers, as you know, it really is a serious recommitment for those households to stay with the Keurig system for the long haul because the model is dependent upon not just bringing in new households, but also keeping our current households, which we do at a very high rate. And so right now, it's hard to know the breakout we are offering really attractive brewers that offer new benefits. We just launched this week the K-Supreme Plus Smart Brewer. If you go online and look at some of the reviews both on our website from consumers as well as from the media, it's getting terrific reviews. And I just think this will be yet another reason for people to upgrade. So something we'll share with you when we have it, but it's a very, very bullish indicator in terms of the health of the business from both the current households as well as new households.\nOperator: And your last question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Just following up on the line of question around pricing. I guess I'm conscious that you're seeing like polypropylene inflation in one of the categories where you have a stated strategy to actually lower pricing. Obviously, you have the new plants coming online. You're announcing pricing in the back half. But I guess, can you just comment maybe on like holistically how you think about offsetting inflation? And certainly, one could argue an area like packaged beverages probably has a bit more maybe like structural pricing power in North America right now than does pods. And so maybe just comment on that. I guess it's -- you're seeing positive pricing in coffee systems this quarter for the first time. I realize that's mix driven. But I just wonder if we're on the verge of seeing that stabilize and potentially rebound with inflation, if you're comfortable with that concept. So anything just around conceptually how you're thinking about offsetting inflation with pricing on a sort of a total portfolio basis would be helpful?\nBob Gamgort: Yes. So I think our entire portfolio has good pricing power, which is one of the reasons why I think beverages, is a great category. We are aggressive in productivity and efficiency as our first line of defense. We implement all kinds of purchasing strategies, hedging, as I said before, being one that delays the inevitability of inflation. It gives you some short-term pricing certainty but doesn't eliminate it. And then of course, pricing, when it can't be covered by the others, is the ultimate answer. And you're seeing pricing now not just in the beverage industry but across the board. I have absolutely no concern with pricing in coffee. As we talked about three years ago when we talked about it publicly, but it's been in progress now for five years, we wanted to lower the price of coffee pods in the U.S. because we knew they were too high. And when we compare them to steady-state rates around the world, they were way out of comparison to those five years ago. The price has been reduced significantly. And the data that we put in our Investor Day deck in 2018 is very relevant in terms of what the right price point is for consumers. And it shows that, to a degree, the industry has actually overshot that and its pricing it below the levels that consumers thought would be a good value. They're doing it for a variety of reasons, and I've talked about it before. There are retailers who know that K-Cups are a real attraction to consumers, and so they'll price them very low just to bring people in. Putting a little bit of pricing in to recover inflation is not a concern at all given where we stand across the industry in pricing. And I think price stabilization is something that we've talked about happening for a long term. It's already happening as we speak, and I still think it's an incredible value to consumers.\nChris Carey: Thanks so much. And I appreciate it's the end of the call, I'll keep this quick. But just on the road to zero, is there a way to think about how long this launch could go before getting fully penetrated? You're running two to three shares, but obviously, other offerings from competitors have had kind of like years of runway. Just how you're thinking about the time horizon from which this can continue to benefit the portfolio? So thanks so much for that.\nBob Gamgort: Yes. We've been successful in driving growth in our CSD portfolio now for years. We've done that through a combination of very solid marketing and good market execution on our core brands and by bringing news and refreshment to them. And it's hard to put a timetable around what is any one line extension or refresh do for the brand. So we have a constant stream of them. Think about what Dr Pepper and Cream has done for the Dr Pepper brand, and that's still growing right now. I think zero sugar both on Dr Pepper and across our flavors is a similar platform. And we have additional innovation and renovation ideas to come that we'll be layering on top of that in the future. And that's really the game is that you don't launch something and assume that that's the answer forever, that is part of the news that you're delivering. And that's how we think about this as well. So thanks for that question.\nOperator: All right, there are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the call back to the Company.\nTyson Seely: Thank you. This is Tyson, everyone. Thank you for the time. I know we're slightly over, and you all have very busy days today. Please reach out to myself or Steve or the IR team for any follow-ups. We look forward to talking to you. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us today. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ozan Dokmecioglu",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on an adjusted basis, I will briefly review our performance for the second quarter, which was very strong and our press release discusses in significant detail. I will then turn to our outlook for 2021. Constant currency net sales increased 8.1%, fueled by higher volume mix of 6.1% and favorable net price realization of 2%, with all four of our business segments posting growth driven by elevated consumption and strong in-market execution. For the first six months of 2021, constant currency net sales grew 9.4% versus a year ago and 13.4% versus the first six months of 2019. Adjusted operating income in the second quarter totaled $839 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to $775 million in the year ago period, driven by this strong net sales growth across our portfolio, productivity and merger synergies. These growth drivers were partially offset by significantly higher marketing investment in the quarter, inflation in logistics, manufacturing and input costs and higher operating expenses associated with increased consumer demand. For the first six months of 2021, adjusted operating income increased 8.3% versus year ago and 19.4% as compared to the first six months of 2019. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased 6.8% versus year ago. Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 26.7% compared to 27.1% in the prior year, significantly impacted by the reinvestment in marketing in the quarter, inflation and unfavorable margin mix due to the higher brewer sales. Adjusted net income advanced 14.7% in the quarter to $538 million compared to $469 million in a year ago period driven by growth in adjusted operating income and lower interest expense, largely driven by lower interest rates stemming from the strategic refinancing we completed in the first quarter of 2021. Debt repayments and the lower adjusted tax rate in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 15.2% to $0.38 per diluted share compared to $0.33 per diluted share in the year ago period. For the first six months of 2021, adjusted diluted EPS advanced approximately 14.5% versus a year ago and more than 29% versus the first six months of 2019. Let me pause for a moment to discuss the inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges we have referenced this morning. Price expectations continue to rise for aluminum, glass, corn products and polypropylene, which is a material use in our K-Cup pods. And like most other CPG companies, we have also experienced an increase in transportation and logistics costs as well as supply chain challenges related to supplier constraints, labor shortages and material and packaging availability. Despite these challenges, we have confidence in our ability to successfully navigate them. I will elaborate on this. For 2021, we are in a position of strength as our sales growth momentum will help to offset inflation. As discussed previously, we rely on a combination of productivity, cost controls, pricing and various other revenue growth management strategies, pulling the right levers at the right time to protect the long-term health of our business. In terms of price, we have already announced increases in both our core beverage and owned and licensed coffee portfolios. Along with the other levers I just mentioned, this approach enables us to mitigate rising input costs and address supply chain challenges while reinvesting in the business and protecting bottom line profit. As we did in 2020, we will remain nimble in response to changing market conditions to ensure our continued success focusing on flexibility, speed and delivery to manage our product and SKU performance at a granular level. Our updated guidance for 2021 incorporates all of these considerations, and we are confident that we have the tools and management disciplines to deliver strong growth in both revenue and earnings despite the dynamic inflation and logistics challenges. Let me now turn to our segment performance in the second quarter. Coffee Systems constant currency net sales increased 3.9% driven by higher volume mix of 3.5% and favorable net price realization of 0.4%. The volume mix performance reflected pod volume growth of 0.2% and brewer volume growth of 29%. The pod growth reflected successfully, lapping peak shipments in the year ago period related to consumer stock-up behavior in the early days of the pandemic and an improved performance in the away-from-home business. Even though the return to offices continues to be slow, and this business remains well below pre-pandemic levels, the 29% increase in brewer shipments in the quarter was fueled by continued strong consumer purchases stemming from successful brewer innovation and, to a lesser extent, favorable timing of time day during the second quarter of 2021 versus the third quarter of 2020. The favorable net price realization in the quarter was largely driven by brewers and the continued moderation of pod pricing declines, consistent with our strategic pod pricing initiative launched several years ago. Looking to the back half of the year, we expect pod shipments growth to continue in the mid-single-digit range, while brewer shipments are expected to be about even with a year ago given the 30% brewer growth we achieved in the second half last year, which benefited from the government stimulus during COVID sheltering. At the time, we heard some concern that the elevated brewer growth and incremental households we were adding in 2020 represented a pull forward from '21. Given the continued strength of brewers, which are now expected to be up approximately 10% for the year on top of the 21% last year, performance would suggest that the pull forward did not occur and that our momentum continues. Adjusted operating income for Coffee Systems totaled $371 million, an increase of 2.2% compared to $363 million in the prior year. This increase was driven by continued productivity and merger synergies partially offset by inflation in manufacturing, input costs and logistics. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 1.1% in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 33.7% compared to 34.8% in the year-ago period, largely driven by the negative margin mix associated with the very strong brewer sales. Packaged Beverages constant currency net sales grew 7.3% in the second quarter driven by strong volume mix growth of 6.2% and higher net pricing of 1.1%. This performance reflected growth in both our company-owned DSD operations and warehouse direct business. The majority of our LRB portfolio contributed to this growth, with CSDs, including Canada Dry, Dr Pepper and Sunkist, along with premium water leading the way. Adjusted operating income for Packaged Beverages in the second quarter totaled $286 million, an increase of 6.3%, compared to $269 million in the year ago period. This was driven by the strong net sales growth as well as productivity and merger synergies. These growth drivers were partially offset by inflation in logistics, manufacturing and input costs, a significant increase in marketing investment and higher operating costs to meet continued strong consumer demand. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 5.9% versus a year ago. Adjusted operating margin for Packaged Beverages was 19.1% in the quarter compared to adjusted operating margin of 19.3% in the year-ago period, largely reflecting our significant reinvestment in marketing. Beverage Concentrates constant currency net sales increased 20.7% due to favorable net pricing of 10.4% and higher volume mix of 10.3%. The net pricing was driven by our annual price increase and a favorable comparison to prior year on our annual true-up of customer incentive accruals as well as strong revenue growth management. The volume mix performance was largely driven by improving trends in the fountain foodservice business, reflecting higher levels of consumer mobility in the restaurant and hospitality channels compared to the year ago period as well as the benefit of significant marketing investment driving growth in the quarter. Dr Pepper and Crush led the growth, partially offset by declines in Canada Dry. Adjusted operating income for Beverage Concentrates increased 15.3% to $256 million compared to $222 million in the year ago period, driven by net sales growth, which was partially offset by the significantly higher marketing investment. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income advanced 14.4%. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 68.3% compared to 71.8% in the year ago period, primarily reflecting the higher marketing investments. And finally, Latin America Beverages constant currency net sales grew 20.8%, reflecting strong volume mix of 16.6% and favorable net pricing of 4.2%. The liquid refreshment beverage in market execution in Mexico continued to be strong and resulting in the overall liquid refreshment beverage share expansion and continued robust retail consumption, which drove significant net sales growth for key brands, namely Penafiel and Clamato. Adjusted operating income increased 61% and to $37 million compared to $23 million in the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income increased 44%, reflecting the strong net sales growth and productivity. These growth drivers were partially offset by significantly higher marketing investments in the quarter and inflation in logistics, manufacturing and input costs. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter advanced 310 basis points to 22.3%. Free cash flow in the quarter continued to be strong at $492 million, which translated into a year-to-date free cash flow conversion ratio of nearly 95%. In addition to our ongoing deleveraging and investing in the business to drive top line momentum, we're also increasing our return to shareholders. Specifically, during the quarter, the KBP Board authorized the previously announced 25% increase in our quarterly dividend rate, which was paid earlier this month. Despite this healthy increase, our payout as a percentage of free cash flow remains below 50%, pointing to the exceptional strength of our cash flow generation and the future optionality it provides. During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding bank debt by $427 million and structural payables by $4 million. We also ended the second quarter with $167 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Due to growth in earnings and our reduction in bank debt, we improved our management leverage ratio to 3.4x at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Since the merger closed in July 2018, we have reduced our management leverage ratio by 2.6x. Let me now move to our outlook for 2021. For the full year 2021, we now expect net sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 7%. This compares with our original guidance for the year of 3% to 4% and our most recent guidance of 4% to 6%. We continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS growth of 13% to 15% for the year and plan to reinvest any over-delivery back into the business to support continued momentum. Supporting this guidance, we continue to expect merger synergies of approximately $200 million for a three-year total of approximately $600 million, in line with our merger targets; adjusted interest expense in the range of $505 million to $515 million; an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 24%; diluted weighted shares outstanding of approximately 1.43 billion. And finally, our management leverage ratio is expected to be at or below 3x by the end of this year. With that, let me hand it back to Bob for some closing remarks. Absolutely. Absolutely. Steve, with regards to Allentown, we began our production of cold average cases earlier this year. And as we speak, we are proceeding to ramp up to reach full utilization levels, and it will continue through this year as well as 2021. Also as a side note, the combined cold beverage and coffee warehouse that we put together in Allentown is also fully operational. With regards to Spartanburg, we began to produce some of our K-Cups as being the first line back in June, which is very recent. And we'll continue to ramp up over the course of approximately 18 to 24 months and the reason being is due to the sheer size of the huge volume and the planned capacity that we have been implementing. And the lines will be coming up and running in a sequential, let's say, order. With regards to the investment in the project in our Ireland facility, the concentrate beverage plant, that we have been building, is almost complete. And we are expecting to put into service and ramp up from there on sometime in quarter four this year. Therefore, after the COVID related some delays, as we have communicated in three major of our investments, we are back on track. We have been getting the lines up and running in line with our new time lines right now. And we are very happy with the progress that we have been seeing."

            "content": "Thanks, Tyson, and good morning, everyone. Since we spoke last quarter, consumer mobility across North America has continued to increase, with improving trends in travel, grocery and retail and recreation translating into changes in growth trends in beverage category segments and retail channels. Just as we experienced in 2020, the COVID recovery period in 2021 is creating significant volatility in demand, which has required us to remain nimble and flexible in managing our business. One area in which mobility remains challenged is offices, which continues to be a headwind for us in coffee. While we've experienced some improvement year-to-date and expect more over the balance of the year, we project the recovery of office mobility to lag other areas of the economy. Mix management was key to our success in 2020 as we were able to drive growth in on-trend segments and channels to offset those that were structurally challenged by COVID. While managing demand mix continues to be critical this year, we also face the added challenges of input cost and labor inflation, transportation constraints, labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, making 2021 arguably more difficult in many respects than 2020. We expect another 6 to 12 months of macro volatility before a more predictable operating environment emerges. Key to stabilization will be a return to both school and the office environment, the course of the COVID virus and its variants, the impact of reduced or eliminated government subsidies, the catch-up of global supply chains to meet unprecedented demand and an improvement in the labor market. Despite all the challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our EPS guidance for 2021 while increasing our revenue growth target to 6% to 7% for the full year. Our updated financial outlook offsets the challenges I mentioned a moment ago with new pricing actions announced across most of our categories, along with continued productivity and efficiency efforts and the improving performance in our higher-margin beverage concentrates and fountain food services businesses that both benefit from increased mobility. It's important to note that we still intend to reinvest any earnings upside into growth investments. At the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range we will have achieved the three-year financial algorithm that we communicated at the time of our merger, delivering annual adjusted diluted EPS within our target range of 15% to 17%, revenue growth well above our target range of 2% to 3% and our leverage ratio at or below 3x by the end of this year. We will share our outlook for the business and update our long-term algorithm for total shareholder return at our upcoming investor event in September. Details regarding the virtual event will be shared next week. Turning to second quarter results we announced this morning. We posted another strong quarter, highlighted by double-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS and high single-digit growth in constant currency net sales. These results were broad-based and balanced across the Company with growth driven by both core business and innovation. Because we're one of the few companies layering strong current year performance on top of strong year ago performance, it's also helpful to highlight our results on a two-year basis. Comparing the first half of 2021 with the same time period in 2019 shows constant currency net sales growth of 13.5%, adjusted operating income growth of 19.5% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of just under 30%. We expanded our market share of total liquid refreshment beverages over the previous two years, driven in part by our 1.4 share point increase in carbonated soft drinks. Total K-Cup pod shipments increased nearly 15% over the same time, and brewer sales are up nearly 50%. Looking specifically at the second quarter, more than 70% of our cold beverage retail sales base expanded market share, reflecting continued growth of CSDs driven by core brand strength and innovation, the most recent being our new Zero Sugar lineup which is performing exceptionally well. Growth in key non-carb beverage brands such as Snapple, Core, Bai and Evian was good for the quarter but could have been even stronger had it not been for supply disruptions, which I will discuss in a few moments. In coffee, our K-Cup pod shipments were essentially flat in the quarter successfully lapping the very strong year ago period that was driven by peak at-home consumption. Comparing K-Cup pod shipment volume to 2019 removes some of the significant noise and timing for that business. For the quarter, K-Cup pods grew nearly 10% on a two-year basis, demonstrating the underlying long-term growth trends in our coffee business. Keurig brewer sales in the quarter increased by nearly 30% compared to a year ago, some of which was influenced by government stimulus and the timing of Amazon Prime Day. Finally, with regard to coffee systems innovation, we were excited to announce earlier this week the launch of the K-Supreme Plus Smart Brewer, marking our first launch of a connected brewer for the broader consumer market. We look forward to talking more about the new Brew ID technology and the growth platforms it creates for us at our upcoming Investor Day event. Shifting from demand to supply, nearly all CPG companies have discussed supply disruptions in 2021, and we're certainly not immune to these challenges. We continue to be effective d in supplying K-Cup pods and CSDs, and we've been able to overcome chip shortages and ocean transportation limitations to supply the high levels of demand for our Keurig brewers. However, our non-carb beverage portfolio has been negatively impacted by supply disruptions, especially Snapple and Core, which is evident in the latest Scanner numbers. I'll use Snapple as one example of the type of challenges that we and most other CPG companies are facing in the current environment. As we discussed on previous earnings calls, we started rolling out our refreshed Snapple bottle on the West Coast in November of 2020. That new package substitutes post-consumer recycled plastic or rPET for glass and non-recycled plastic. And it also contemporizes the Snapple brand look and feel. The consumer reception has been very strong, with Snapple growing share for the first six months of the year as we increased recruitment of younger consumers, exactly what we intended to do with the refresh. However, an unexpected shortfall in committed glass bottles from our supplier required us to transition our new rPET packaging faster, which pressured material availability from our supplier of rPET and stretch the startup curve of our new production lines. We're navigating through this challenge and other disruptions that have become the new normal in 2021 to maintain our guidance. However, we do expect some sales and share pressure on key non-carb beverage brands throughout the third quarter. Our learnings on how to successfully manage our business through the volatility of COVID continue to serve us well as we build an increasingly resilient organization. Before I turn it over to Ozan to discuss our segment performance in detail, I'd like to mention the great progress we continue to make in the area of ESG, which we know is important to an increasing number of investors. We recently issued our annual corporate responsibility report that highlights our performance against our previous ESG goals, increases our ambition through new ESG goals and expands our impact in new areas such as diversity and inclusion and health and wellness. If you haven't done so already, I encourage you to read the CR report, which is available on the KDP corporate website. Ozan, over to you. Thanks, Ozan. Before handing it over to questions, I want to highlight that earlier this month, we celebrated the three-year anniversary of the Keurig Dr Pepper merger. Transaction that was based on our vision to create a North America-focused beverage company that approach the consumer and customer beverage experience in a more contemporary way. In the three years since we've accomplished a great deal and we are on track to achieve all of the financial commitments we made back in January 2018. We will continue to demonstrate what we believe it takes to be a modern beverage company, and we look forward to sharing more details with you in September. I will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Sure. Good morning, Bonnie. The growth in Packaged Beverages for this quarter was pretty well balanced across all items. CSD had particular strength, and I'll talk about Zero Sugar in a minute. The one area that we did flag is that in our non-carb portfolio, we started seeing some weakness as we got into the month of June in particular. And it is 100% driven by some supply issues with real issue on Snapple and Core. Both those brands were growing very, very well up into the supply disruptions. If you look at the IRi data, you see where we actually start to drop off during a little bit in May but really in the month of June on those two. So, that was the flow of the volume over the quarter as well as what the composition was. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we've increased our guidance on the year. Obviously, it's driven a lot by our Packaged Beverage business, and so all of the supply issues that we talked about are taken into consideration in that guidance. So, we're navigating our way through it. Real bright spot within the quarter continues to be CSDs. We refreshed or we converted our diet flavor brands over to Zero Sugar. If you look at an even comparison of those two, in other words, take out Dr Pepper Zero Sugar, which is an incremental item, if you just look at like-for-like on the conversion, our sales were up 16% as a result of the conversion from diet to zero sugar. And then the Dr Pepper Zero Sugar variety has been incredibly strong. Year-to-date consumption, if you look at an IRi is about $100 million. Our early read is about 70% of that is incremental, and we've been able to get that in distribution in 85% ACV. So, great execution across the board in that conversion and the addition of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar, yet one more thing that's driving our CSD portfolio, and that gave us strength combined with everything else I just talked about in the Packaged Beverage segment. Yes, that's fair. And you can take a look at, I think, a very high level of info that we gave today, which is updating guidance for the balance of the year. So, it allows you to see a first half, second half calculation. And then we were very specific about within that, what we're expecting in terms of coffee brewer sales as well as pod sales. So, you start -- we're narrowing it down for you to give you what a Packaged Beverage business should look like. Sure and good morning. The last part we will cover in some depth at the Investor Day, which is coming up, so I'll wait for that event to talk about beyond 2021. With regard to 2021, we're seeing strength across the board. So in the decomposition of the year-to-date numbers that you've seen, you've seen strength in every single segment, and you've seen some mix benefits. So for example, fountain foodservice and beverage concentrates, which are among our most profitable items, were negatively impacted in the year ago period. We're getting a good rebound on that. We're seeing continued strength in at-home coffee. Certainly not at the peak of consumption in home that we did a year ago, but we've been talking about that expectation since Q2 of last year. And then brewer sales continued to be exceptional. We're projecting for the rest of the year that those will be flat. But as Ozan said earlier, it certainly takes aside the concerns that many had that the incremental households we gained in 2020 and the extra brewer sales were a pull forward. That's certainly not the case. So quite simply, we're seeing strength across the entire business. That's given us the confidence to take our revenue expectations up. And then anything in a first half, second half or quarterly comparison is really driven by the volatility of a year ago. And that's why I think it's really important to look at two-year numbers to take the noise out. And it's easy for all of us to get enamored with one quarter performance. We've always taken a long-term view. And you're seeing a lot of rebound from other companies, but the reality of it is if you compare our numbers to 2019, our revenue was up almost 14%. Operating income is 20%, as I said before. Earnings per share is up about 30%. I think that's the real way to evaluate performance. Yes. I think we've seen a lot -- a number of things in the past two years that we've never seen before in our career. Certainly, the shutdown of COVID and all of the related issues around keeping employee safe and running our operations under real constrained conditions was unique. I think this rebound, as I said in my remarks, in some respects, it's actually more challenging than that because we're getting a lot of mixed signals. There's reopenings in certain areas, and then there's problems in others. We've all dealt with inflation. We've seen it in commodities and input costs. We've never seen this level of labor inflation, which is not necessarily a bad thing because there are consumers as well, so it gives them more purchasing power. But the labor shortages are something that none of us have seen in our career. And I have no idea how much of it is tied to government stimulus and concern about going back to work, how much is tied to the fact that kids need to be in school in the fall to free up the labor force who are watching the children. We're going to know a lot more when September October rolls around, but I'd say this is very much unprecedented in all of our careers. The way that we're managing through it goes back to how we started in March of 2020 when we had to make some dramatic changes due to COVID. We stay very flexible. We're looking at the short term as well as the long-term, but emphasis on not committing to anything for too long because we know it's going to change. Your comments about supply chain disruptions, I'm calling it the new normal, now hopefully, it's not normal. It's the reality we're dealing with. And we just flex when we have capacity in one area. We lean in more on demand generation when we have constraints in others. Certainly, we're not going to promote or spend incremental dollars promoting an area that we have supply constraints on. So the game is really going to be won or lost by speed by speed and flexibility. That's something that we were able to do last year. And we're certainly doing it to even a greater degree this year. And I think that will continue until this all settles out. It's really hard to forecast. And I said in 2020, I want to get out of the forecasting game and get into the reaction game, and I think that served us well. As I listened to the Fed, and they don't know, if inflation is short term or long-term, and you can hear the President talking about supply issues, and they don't have a good handle on what's going on here. So, I'm not going to be a better forecaster than they. I do -- if you really push us, I think we'll see this start to settle out in 2022. But again, it's going to be driven by the course of the virus and the variants. It's going to be driven by things like government stimulus. Those seem to be the two biggest factors in everything that we've just talked about. Good morning. Yes, we have certainly been more efficient in our marketing, and that's a continuation of a trend that's been in place for a while now. The nature of marketing has moved from being more broad targeting to more precise targeting. We have a significant number of tools and metrics available to us today that weren't available even a couple of years ago. And so the efficiency of our spend continues to increase, and that got pushed to an extreme during COVID, in which we were able to continue to generate demand, as you point out, with significantly lower levels of spend. I think part of that was efficiency and a big part of that was a unique situation a year ago. And if everybody pulls back at the same time, really, its execution, in-store availability, the right promotions that were driving a lot of demand, and we did that very well. But our intention is to continue to ramp our spending back up. You see a big jump in our numbers this quarter versus a year ago. I think everybody experienced that. We, along with pretty much everyone in the industry, is not fully back to 2019 levels of spending, but we're ramping our way up. And I think we're doing it for two reasons. One is there are a lot of cost pressures on all of us right now and a lot of volatility. So it's prudent to be able to keep some in reserve as you're increasing your spend to say let's ramp it up versus go all at once because we need some offsets to volatility going forward in addition to productivity, efficiency and the pricing that we've put in place. And that's what I just said is true for everybody in the industry right now. I think the second part is it gives us an opportunity to really test efficiency. If you ramp it up, you can see where your next dollars being spent and it's a good return on investment. And that gives you the confidence to add the incremental dollars beyond that back. So our track is to continue to increase over time. We'll talk more about what the long-term projection of that is when we get together in September, but that's how it's playing out right now in 2021. Sure. When we get together in September, we're going to talk about the investments that we've made in the areas of R&D and product development. That's both on the hot side as well as the cold side of the business, and we'll give you some real examples of that. You point out route to market, which is critically important in beverages and something that we think is very unique. So the investments that we've made in our DSD system, which has been a big driver of growth, we've talked about it in bits and pieces over the earnings call. But when we get together, we'll be able to do a more holistic view of what we've done over the past three years and where that's going. And that's a big source of investment for us. E-commerce is another area. It's hard for you all to see the sales that we're generating in e-commerce because it doesn't show up in IRi right now. But when you see, the disconnect, sometimes between our shipment numbers and the IRi numbers, with the shipment numbers being stronger, and that happens over time, you know that we're getting some significant growth out of e-commerce. And that's a big investment area. And then just purely from a brand perspective, we would -- as we add more money, we would add to the number of -- add to our portfolio the number of brands we advertise. So right now, we focus our advertising on our largest brands. But we've got some midsized brands in there that are deserving of advertising as well, and that would be the next area that we would fund once we get to what we think is threshold on the large brands. So, there's a lot of opportunities for investment. We're very selective and test our way through it. But again, these are some of the themes that we look forward to sharing with you in September. Okay. Yes. Let me just go with pod growth first and just remind everybody the formula for our pod volume. It's a combination of household penetration. In growth in household penetration, the number of new households that we're adding to our existing base times the attachment rate, which is the current usage per machine. This quarter a year ago, we saw a peak level of attachment rate as people were really in lockdown mode. And as we talked about it at that time, we saw that as temporary and that over time, that would revert back to the long-term average. Over the very long term, attachment rate is very steady, and that's why we've suggested prior to COVID that you could use pod volume growth as a good proxy for household penetration growth. Very simply, our household penetration was very strong last year. We were up about 9%. We added 3 million households. We've told you before that we expected 2 million additional households this year and that attachment rate would go back to the long-term average. It's exactly what's happened. The attachment rate that we're seeing right now is very much in line with what we've seen over the long term, and household penetration continues to grow. And that's what you're seeing in the pod volume growth. So, so far, everything has gone as expected. When we look at mobility, we're seeing a significant increase in people going out of the home into restaurants and hospitality. Certainly, people going and getting coffee out-of-home in coffee shops has gone up significantly. In fact, we saw a bit of a spike at one point in the early part of reopening. I think people felt liberated to go back out and wanted to enjoy a coffee on the go. The one area that has been lagging and continues to lag is office. So even with the strong numbers that we have in our coffee business, we're still getting a fairly significant headwind out of the away-from-home business, which for us is concentrated in offices. And very similar to the question Bryan asked, it's hard for us to predict what's going to happen there. And we see an improvement versus a year ago. You couldn't get much lower than the numbers we saw a year ago and away from home, but nowhere near back to normal, nowhere near to 2019. So that provides long-term or longer-term upside for us. And as we said before, that's a higher-margin business, so it will be accretive to both top line as well as mix. But we think that will be a slow recovery, and that assumption is embedded in the numbers we gave you. With regard to pricing, like everyone who has a coffee business who has reported so far, we've talked about the significant increase in coffee pricing. We are hedged like everyone else, but hedging, it just delays the pricing. It doesn't make it go away. And so our best practices have always been is that when we see an increase in pricing that we believe will be sustained that you take pricing now, because it takes time for it to flow through the system, and you know that you're eventually going to be paying that price when you add new coverage into your portfolio. With regard to us, you're right, coffee is a lower percentage of our cost structure compared to if we were just a traditional roast and ground player. But when you have a significant increase like we're experiencing right now, it certainly does impact us to the level that we want to take pricing. And then the last point, I'll add because I think you're asking about the different forms of pricing, we have big piece of our business are brands that we own or license. We're responsible for everything on those, so we've taken pricing on that because we pay for the coffee that's in that. And then the remainder of our business is either partner or private label. In most of those situations, the partner is responsible for the price of coffee. We're responsible for everything else. So it's really up to them to decide what they want to do from a pricing standpoint with regard to coffee. That's not something we get involved in. So I think I've covered everything you asked about with regard to coffee. It hasn't really. If you take a look at the IRi numbers, you haven't seen much pricing actually reach the shelf right now. So more to come that will be something we could talk about on the next quarter call about what that impact is. But typically, we don't see much in the way of trade down. But if we do, I would just remind everybody that we have -- we manufacture pods that are generating 83% of category sales. So wherever the consumer goes in terms of brand choice and wherever they go from an outlet in terms of where they buy it, we got it covered. And so we're fairly neutral in those perspectives, and we just give the consumer choice and let them decide what they want to buy. Yes, that's a good way to think about it. And the pricing and the costs never match up exactly, and that's why we always create some margin for us to smooth that out, but that's a reasonable assumption. Absolutely. Yes, I think it's a good time to talk about that. Ozan, would you like to jump in and update Steve and everyone on those projects? Yes, it's a little jumping ahead a little bit. I mean clearly, we think about this and going into '22, but I wouldn't have any read-through in terms of trying to predict what that means for us in 2022. I think we've done a really good job of recognizing the challenges and being able to mitigate them pretty substantially if you take a look at what's happened last year and what's going on this year. And look, I can't forecast that. I can tell you that we all hope that things start to return to more normal in 2022. Yes, it's really hard to do that in the moment. We're always able to do that in hindsight, and we do quite a bit of analysis of understanding how much of these are brewer upgrades versus straight-up replacements versus completely new households or even a secondary placement in an existing household. So, that's something that we dig in answer we're able to see in hindsight. For perspective, a year ago, we added 3 million net new households, and we sold 11 million brewers. So that gives you an idea of how much household penetration growth we were able to drive, which was substantial, almost 10%. But at the same time, we continue to offer better brewers with new features that are encouraging people to upgrade. And although an upgrade is not something that we profit from in the moment because we don't make money on the brewers, as you know, it really is a serious recommitment for those households to stay with the Keurig system for the long haul because the model is dependent upon not just bringing in new households, but also keeping our current households, which we do at a very high rate. And so right now, it's hard to know the breakout we are offering really attractive brewers that offer new benefits. We just launched this week the K-Supreme Plus Smart Brewer. If you go online and look at some of the reviews both on our website from consumers as well as from the media, it's getting terrific reviews. And I just think this will be yet another reason for people to upgrade. So something we'll share with you when we have it, but it's a very, very bullish indicator in terms of the health of the business from both the current households as well as new households. Yes. So I think our entire portfolio has good pricing power, which is one of the reasons why I think beverages, is a great category. We are aggressive in productivity and efficiency as our first line of defense. We implement all kinds of purchasing strategies, hedging, as I said before, being one that delays the inevitability of inflation. It gives you some short-term pricing certainty but doesn't eliminate it. And then of course, pricing, when it can't be covered by the others, is the ultimate answer. And you're seeing pricing now not just in the beverage industry but across the board. I have absolutely no concern with pricing in coffee. As we talked about three years ago when we talked about it publicly, but it's been in progress now for five years, we wanted to lower the price of coffee pods in the U.S. because we knew they were too high. And when we compare them to steady-state rates around the world, they were way out of comparison to those five years ago. The price has been reduced significantly. And the data that we put in our Investor Day deck in 2018 is very relevant in terms of what the right price point is for consumers. And it shows that, to a degree, the industry has actually overshot that and its pricing it below the levels that consumers thought would be a good value. They're doing it for a variety of reasons, and I've talked about it before. There are retailers who know that K-Cups are a real attraction to consumers, and so they'll price them very low just to bring people in. Putting a little bit of pricing in to recover inflation is not a concern at all given where we stand across the industry in pricing. And I think price stabilization is something that we've talked about happening for a long term. It's already happening as we speak, and I still think it's an incredible value to consumers. Yes. We've been successful in driving growth in our CSD portfolio now for years. We've done that through a combination of very solid marketing and good market execution on our core brands and by bringing news and refreshment to them. And it's hard to put a timetable around what is any one line extension or refresh do for the brand. So we have a constant stream of them. Think about what Dr Pepper and Cream has done for the Dr Pepper brand, and that's still growing right now. I think zero sugar both on Dr Pepper and across our flavors is a similar platform. And we have additional innovation and renovation ideas to come that we'll be layering on top of that in the future. And that's really the game is that you don't launch something and assume that that's the answer forever, that is part of the news that you're delivering. And that's how we think about this as well. So thanks for that question."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the First Quarter of 2021. This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tyson Seely. Mr. Seely, please go ahead.\nTyson Seely: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued our press release for the first quarter of 2021. If you need a copy you can get on our website keurigdrpepper.com in the Investor section. Consistent with previous quarters, today, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, excluding items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are included in the reconciliation tables, included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance. Here with me virtually today to discuss our first quarter 2021 results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Tyson. And good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are well. As we enter spring cautious optimism as in the year, vaccine rates are approaching 50% of the US adult population and growing across North America. Higher levels of consumer mobility are evident in retail, restaurants and entertainment. And there is an increasing belief that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. If the last year has taught us anything, however, it is that our role is not to predict the future but rather to be nimble, responsive and prepare for whatever we may face in the future. This same mindset enabled Keurig Dr Pepper to deliver meaningful outperformance in 2020 and a strong start to 2021. While some companies have been devastated by the impacts of the crisis, others have experienced a windfall from it. We on the other hand have succeeded despite the pandemic, by driving the parts of our business that are performing well to overcome the declines we've experienced in areas structurally challenged by COVID. While that may sound easy and concept, it is very difficult to execute in the real world. And I would like to thank our 27,000 team members across KDP, who continue to step up to meet the challenge. In the first quarter of 2021, we delivered strong performance across the board, highlighted by double-digit growth in both net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. We also reaffirmed our outlook for another strong year of double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth. Despite the specter of rising inflation, in part by increasing our net sales growth expectations from 3% to 4% to 4% to 6%. This sets us up for a solid 2021 and positions us to achieve our ambitious three-year merger targets ending this year. Let me now provide key highlights of the first quarter. Our net sales grew by 11%, with all four business segments posting growth, driving this performance with continued strong in-market execution across the business. In cold beverages, we continue to perform well, with more than 80% of our cold beverage retail sales space expanding market share during the quarter. We believe a helpful way to assess both our results and those of the broader industry, given the unique volatility of 2020 is on a two-year stack basis. Over this time period, nearly 90% of our cold retail sales space grew market share and our consumption was up nearly 17%. LRBD performance continues to reflect KDPs broad-based strength and CSD, premium unflavored water, Snapple teas and fruit drinks and others. During the quarter we launched new zero sugar varieties across our CSD portfolio, which has helped to solidify our number two CSD manufacturer status in key retail accounts. We're also seeing KDP brands take over leadership position. The latest being Sunkist becoming the number one fruit flavored CSD brand, fueled by the zero sugar introduction and flavor-line extension. In the past few months, we launched innovation behind Bai with Bai Boost, made with clean ingredients, including plant-based energy from tea extract, Bai Boost has been well received by retailers and consumers in early days. Finally on cold beverages, our new brand partnership and the growing sparkling water segment with Polar is performing well. National ACB has grown to 55% with more distribution to come, as shelf resets are completed across the country. Our coffee business posted an exceptionally strong quarter, with net sales advancing 17% on a constant currency basis, due to a 14% increase in pod volume growth and a 61% increase in brewer volume. The latter primarily being driven by a roughly 40% increase in consumer sales, and some benefits of shipment timing between the quarters. Approximately half of the 14% increase in pod volume was due to strong consumption in the quarter, with the remainder driven by differences in pod shipment timing relative to the unusual year ago period. The fact that pod volume growth in track channels registered at just above 3% for the quarter, demonstrate the trend that we've been discussing for some time, take a pause are experiencing significantly higher levels of growth in untracked channels, particularly e-commerce. Sticking deeper into untracked channels highlights further the growing importance of e-commerce. Strength in at-home pods has been tempered by continued weakness in the away-from-home channel, as the return to offices continued to be slow. We do expect improvement over the course of 2021, especially after Labor Day when we anticipate the rates of office re-openings to accelerate. On a two-year stack basis, dollar consumption of positive track channels was up 11% with two-year shipments up more than 20%. For total KDP we delivered very strong bottom line results in the quarter, with adjusted diluted EPS growth of nearly 14%, despite lapping the sale leaseback gains in the first quarter of the year. We also continue to generate high levels of free cash flow, enabling us to pay down debt and improve our management leverage ratios of 3.5 times at the end of the quarter. Since the merger, we have reduced our leverage ratio by 2.5 turns while also investing meaningfully across the business. Let me now hand it over to Ozan to walk you through the financial results for the quarter and provide further details on our outlook for 2021.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks, Bob. And good morning, everyone. Continuing on an adjusted basis, I will briefly review our performance for the first quarter, which was very strong, and our press release discusses in significant detail. I will then turn into our outlook for the full year 2021. Constant currency net sales increased nearly 11%, fueled by higher volume mix of 10.3% and favorable net price realization of 0.5% with all four of our business segments posting growth. Adjusted operating income in the first quarter totaled $741 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to $684 million in the year ago period, driven by the very strong net sales growth, continued productivity and merger synergies and lower marketing spending in relation to the pre-COVID spending levels in the year ago period. These drivers were partially offset by higher operating expenses associated with increased consumer demand, inflation in logistics and input costs and an unfavorable comparison to a $2 million [ph] gain in the prior year on the sale leaseback of four facilities. For perspective, this gain negatively impacted the year-over-year adjusted operating income growth rate by more than seven full percentage points. Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 25.5%, a decline of 70 basis points versus year ago, which included the 160 basis points headwind from the gain on sale leaseback transactions. Adjusted net income advanced 15.4% in the quarter to $471 million compared to $408 million in the year ago period, driven by growth in adjusted operating income, and the lower adjusted effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13.8% to $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $0.29 per diluted share the year ago period, which included the $0.02 gain from the year ago sale leaseback transactions. Let me take a moment to discuss the inflationary pressures we have referenced this morning. Like most other CPG companies, we have increased our outlook for inflation over the past month. Price expectations continue to rise for aluminum, glass, corn inputs, and polypropylene, which is the material used in K-Cup pods. Most recently, we have experienced a spike in transportation and logistics costs, which is especially acute when we have been required to purchase sport capacity to satisfy the strong demand for our products. Some of these input costs, for example, transportation, and polypropylene cannot be hatched. To manage inflation, we rely on a combination of productivity, cost control, pricing and incremental volume growth, pulling the right levers at the right time to protect the long term health of our business, while offsetting rising input costs. For 2021, we are in a position of strength, as we are able to utilize our sales growth momentum to mitigate inflation. However, if inflation were to accelerate, we may need to utilize other options, just like we did in 2020. We will remain nimble and flexible to react to changing market conditions to ensure our continued success. Finally, we get a number of questions on the benefit of hedging and forward buying with regards to mitigating inflation. First, while we use these practices wisely, their role is primarily to provide plenty of certainty for a period of time and to insulate against short term volatility in input costs, they can postpone, but not offset inflation. Coffee is a great example. We are seeing green coffee prices on the rise right now. But we are covered for a period of time, which lets us see how the market settles before we need to react. Like every other input cost, with green coffee inflation were to be persistent, then we would consider all of our available options to offset its impact on our profit and loss. The good news today is our strong guidance for 2021 incorporates all of these considerations. As we are confident that we have the tools and management discipline to deliver a strong growth in both revenue and earnings, despite the inflation outlook that has been widely discussed this earnings season. Let me now turn into our segment performance in the first quarter. Coffee systems constant currency net sales increased 16.9%, driven by higher volume mix of 19.5%, partially offset by lower net price realization of 2.6%. The volume mix performance reflected pod shipment volume growth of 13.7%, driven by double-digit at-home shipments, partially offset by continued softness in the away-from-home coffee businesses. The 61% increase in brew shipments in the quarter was fueled by strong consumer consumption and the benefits of shipment timing. Adjusted operating income for coffee systems totaled $389 million, an increase of 12.1%, compared to $347 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by the strong net sales growth, as well as continued productivity and merger synergies. These growth drivers were partially offset by inflation in logistics and inputs costs and the unfavorable comparison to the sale leaseback gain in the year ago quarter that impacted the segment by $16 million. The year-over-year adjusted operating income growth rate would have been 5 percentage points higher in the quarter, absent this year ago gain. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 34.1% compared to 35.7% in the year ago period, a decline of 160 basis points, including a 170 basis points headwind from the asset sale leaseback gain in the first quarter of 2020. Also impacting the comparison was unfavorable margin mix, due to the exception on the strong brewer growth in the current quarter, and the breakeven margin structure of brewers, offsetting these impacts were continued strong productivity and merger synergies. Packaged Beverages constant currency net sales grew 7.2% in the first quarter, driven by strong volume mix growth of 6.8% and higher net pricing of 0.4%. This performance reflected growth in both our company-owned DSD operations, and warehouse direct businesses. Driving this growth were Dr Pepper, A&W, Canada Dry, Sunkist, 7UP and Squirt in CSDs, along with Snapple and Clamato, partially offset by a decline in Bai. Adjusted operating income for packaged beverages in the first quarter totaled $197 million, a decrease of 3% compared to $203 million in the year ago period. That included the sale and leaseback gain of $26 million for the segment. The year-over-year adjusted operating income growth rate would have been 14 percentage points higher in the quarter, absent this year ago gain. Inflation in logistics and input costs and higher operating costs to meet strong consumer demand were also headwinds in the quarter, as were continued channel and format mix challenges, as we are comping to a largely non-COVID period last year. Partially offsetting these drivers were the strong net sales, continued productivity and merger synergies and lower discretionary expenses. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 15.1% in the quarter compared adjusted operating margin of 16.7% in the year ago period, a decline of 160 basis points, including the 220 basis point headwind from the year-ago sale-leaseback gain. Beverage concentrates constant currency net sales increased 6.5% due to favorable net pricing of 7.2%, partially offset by lower volume mix of 0.7%. This performance continued to be affected by the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on fountain foodservice business, albeit, improved since the beginning of 2021. Adjusted operating income for beverage concentrates increased 21.3% to $239 million compared to $197 million in the year ago period, driven by net sales growth and lower marketing spending. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter advanced 850 basis points to 72.9%, primarily reflecting the favorable net price realization. And finally, Latin America beverages constant currency net sales grew 7.7%, reflecting strong net pricing of 10.3%, partially offset by lower volume mix of 2.6%, as consumer mobility in Mexico continued to be impacted by COVID-19. However, this has improved from the beginning of 2021. Liquid refreshment beverage in market execution in Mexico continue to be strong, driving market share growth for key brands, namely Pe\u00f1afiel, Squirt and Clamato. Adjusted operating income decreased 15% to $23 million, compared to $27 million in the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income decreased 14.8%, reflecting the impact of foreign currency transaction expense and inflation in logistics, partially offset by the strong growth in constant currency net sales, continued productivity and lower discretionary spending. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter decreased 470 basis points to 18.4%, primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency transactions expense. Switching back to total KDP. Free cash flow in the quarter was again exceptionally strong at $458 million, which translated into a free cash flow conversion ratio of nearly 100%. As previously announced, we completed a $2.2 billion strategic refinancing in March of this year. Since the time of the merger, nearly three years ago, we have generated significant cash flow and have rapidly delevered. This strategically financing further enhances our liquidity profile and strengths our balance sheet. To that end, our strong free cash flow performance in the quarter enabled us to reduce outstanding bank debt by $25 million and structured payables by $5 million. And we paid $95 million for the early retirement of that, in conjunction with previously mentioned March strategic refinancing. We also ended the first quarter with $335 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Due to growth in earnings, our reduction in bank debt and increased cash on hand, we improved our management leverage ratio to 3.5 times at the end of the first quarter of 2021. Since the merger closed in July 2018, we have reduced our management leverage ratio by 2.5 times. Let me move to our updated outlook for 2021. For the full year 2021, we now expect constant currency net sales in the range of 4% to 6% compared to our initial guidance of 3% to 4% at the beginning of this year, which reflects the strong demand for our brands across all segments. We also reaffirmed our EPS guidance range of 13% to 15% growth for the year, in part driven by the benefit of higher net sales outlook in offsetting higher inflation. As indicated in our release this morning, we plan to invest any earnings outside above our guidance range back in the business to drive future growth. For perspective, on a two year stack basis, assuming the midpoint of our guidance range, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth will approach to 30%. Supporting our guidance, we continue to expect merger synergies of approximately $200 million for the three year total of approximately $600 million, in line with our merger targets. Adjusted interest expense in the range of $505 million to $515 million and adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 24%. As you have seen in our results this morning, our effective tax rate was below this guidance range at 22.1% in quarter one, due to one-time discrete favorable items, including employee stock vesting, which we anticipated, which is lastly, a first quarter event. Our dividend rate will increase 25%, beginning with our regular quarterly dividend to be announced in the second quarter subject to official board declaration, as previously disclosed, diluted weighted shares outstanding of approximately of 1.43 billion. Finally, we continue to expect our management leverage ratio to be at or below three times by the end of this year. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, giving the company is on to an unusually volatile quarter two 2020, let me provide some additional perspective on the second quarter. Giving the inflation allocations we discussed and their significant year-over-year increase in marketing spending, we expect to deliver double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth for the quarter, although, it will be below the full year guidance range of 13% to 15%. Transportation will continue to be a headwind in the second quarter. With respect to marketing, we continue to restore investment behind our brands this year, especially to support our strong sale of innovation, which is comping a year ago period in which everyone in the industry reduced marketing expenses, due to the uncertain consumer demand environment under COVID. We hope this provides some helpful clarity on the phasing of our business results this year. With that, let me hand it back to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Ozan. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to provide a brief update on corporate governance. As you are aware, we transitioned from a controlled company to a widely-held one in 2020. Since that time, we've enhanced our board structure, increasing its independence and diversity, and establishing the role of lead independent director. I want to highlight - or announced it yesterday that we welcome Lubomira Rochet, as a new Director to our Board. Since November, we've added four new directors, each of whom brings a unique experiences and fresh perspective to the Board. Finally, many of you have asked questions about our post-2021 outlook. We plan to hold an Investor Day shortly after we report our Q2 earnings, during which we look forward to sharing insights on our long-term strategy and financial expectation. Details for the conference will be provided in the near future. I will now hand back to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your lines open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right, thank you. Good morning.\nRobert Gamgort: Hi, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: Hi. I wanted to ask you guys about you know, the brewer sales in the quarter, I was hoping just to get a little bit more color on, you know, the much better than expected sales that you guys reported and how impactful some of the innovation that you've put in the marketplace has been? And then in looking forward, how should we think about your brewer\u2019s sale to the balance of the year, especially in the context of some of the tougher comps that you're going to be facing? And then separately, thinking about attach rates on a go forward basis, you know, especially given some of the brewer volume growth that you've seen. I guess to me, it seems like if you're attach rate hold, this really could be a meaningful driver behind pod volumes in the coming quarters and years. And if you could just touch on that or is that the right way to think about it? Thanks.\nRobert Gamgort: Yeah, okay. Sounds great. Let me start with attach first. During the pandemic, we saw an increase in attachment rate, especially in the early days. And that was very different than the long term trend we had experienced, we said the attachment rates were very stable. Our expectation that we communicated at that time at that time is that, as consumer mobility normalized, we would see attachment rates normalize back to their long-term levels. And that's exactly what we're seeing right now. So I think attachment rate, on hand have come down from their piece in Q2 a year ago, no surprise there. But the reverse side of it is, our attachment rates holding up versus their long-term trend, even as we add new households, absolutely. And I think - it's as simple as when we're able to convert a home from brewing coffee by the pots to brewing it by the cup, it settles in at a consumption race. And unless there's some substantial change in their behavior, stays very solid over time, which is ultimately good news. As we talked about a number of times, so it's worth, but it is worth repeating. Household penetration growth is what drives our pod growth over the long-term. And brewer sales over a longer period of time has some correlation. But especially in the short term, there's not causality. So you can't automatically look at trump brewer sales and say, that's going to mean that we've got a even higher rate of household penetration. And let me give you a little more depth on that, because it's such a critical point. In 2020, as you know, we added 3 million new households to the Keurig system. And that was about a million households above our normal run rate of 2 million. And there were a lot of questions about is this a pull-forward from the future? When we look at 2021? We said absolutely not. And that's exactly what's playing out right now. To get those 3 million households, we sold 11 million brewers. So that tells you that we had a record year, not only in terms of new household, but a record year in seeing existing households, which are now 33 million strong in the US, replace or upgrade their brewers. And while replacements and upgrades don't lead to household penetration growth, they're really important because they represent a strong recommitment to the Keurig system. So let's talk about 2021. When we talk about - when we put our initial thoughts about 2021, we said that we believe that we'll return to our long-term trend of adding 2 million new households per year, and we weren't concerned about any pull-forward. We had a really strong quarter in brewer sales in Q1, and by the way, 40% of that 60% growth was driven by consumption. So there's some shipment timing in there. But it's really consumer sales driving the majority of that, as happy as we are with that it is far too early in the year for us to conclude that that translates to household penetration growth above 2 million. Why is that? Because we've got a ton of innovation in the market right now. And you're also seeing two rounds of government stimulus in the past few months, that have people feeling very liquid. And so a number of people are using it to still invest in their homes, and they're upgrading their brewers. And we've given them innovation to do so. So as we sit here today, we're still talking about 2 million new households, which is a tremendous growth. And as we always do, we'll update our household penetration growth at the end of the year. And the start that we see on brewers to give us confidence, if nothing else to give us confidence that the 2 million number is very doable.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your lines open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nRobert Gamgort: Morning.\nBryan Spillane: Just two quick ones for me. First one just Ozan on the inflation outlook for the year and relative to the comments on hedging. Just wanted to clarify, is your inflation outlook, you know, is it hedged. So meaning is there a potential for more? I don't know volatility, I guess in the COGS inflation over the balance of the year, or are we you know, is the outlook pretty well locked in?\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Sure. Good morning, Bryan. And like you have heard, likes of many of our peer group of companies, we have increased our outlook for inflation over the past month. And when you looked at the major reasons of the inflation, you would see that primarily around the packaging likes of aluminium, glass, as well as polypropylene, the material that we use in the K-Cup pods, that includes corn inputs that translates for us as the high fructose syrup. \\And then, in the past one month, we were expecting already an inflationary environment in the transportation and the overall logistics, but we have seen an uptick in those. And we also service our increased volume using at times off the spot rate, which makes it a little bit higher inflationary environment. And right now, we believe that we have included a healthy amount of inflation expectations, in our view to go period. And some of the input costs, especially transportation, which is translates for us as freight, as well as polypropylene are not really hedge above in terms of there not regulated market, so we can perform some of the hedging activities that we have then. And - but nevertheless, Bryan, we feel very good with our expectations and how much inflation we have increased in our outlook and build for the rest of the year. And for the commodities and the other input costs, there are other measurable items, as we always use widely hedging techniques to protect and bring price stability and then forecast transparency for the year to go, they are all intact. But please make no mistake, that hedging or forward purchasing provides high certainty for a period of time. And in a persistent inflation is just postponing, is not really mitigating the inflation as such. But in short, we feel very good with our expectations for the rest of the year. And we believe we de-risked our P&L as much as we could.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about marketing plans for this year, as you mentioned in the prepared remarks industry - the cold drinks industry, everyone reduced spending significantly in 2020. And then you guys had tremendous results regardless. So I just want to talk about how your marketing plans for \u201821 possibly have changed with inflation being so much worse, you know, than initially anticipated. I'm sure marketing is up year-over-year, but just how much, anything that you can offer, how that may have shifted. And then also the mix of that spend, you know, again, given the very strong returns on the relatively low level of spend in 2020. How is that informing your thought process on what actually needs to be spent to support this business? Thanks.\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. Good morning, Lauren. Thanks for the question. Marketing plans, well, let me talk about marketing spending first. As you point out, everybody in industry dropped their spending in 2020. It was a combination of covering mix issues. But also in the early days of the pandemic, the marketing wasn't very efficient. As we got through the years, as you also point out, not only did we restore some of the spend, but we also learned to be incredibly efficient with that spend, nothing like being under pressure to innovate on how we're able to reach consumers in a more efficient way. And a lot of that learning carries over into 2021, where we build in that expected efficiency, plus we have plans to invest more in marketing. To be really - directly to your question, we have not changed our commitment to the increase in marketing that we have planned in 2021, despite the fact that we're seeing higher inflation, so we haven't touched marketing to offset inflation at all, in 2021. Our expectation is increased marketing spend, restore as much of that as we possibly can, although we won't get all the way back to where we were in 2019, for sure, that will take a couple of years to get there. We are also looking for opportunities to invest more in our marketing spend. So as we talked about a number of times, that we think 13% to 15% growth in an environment like we're in right now, especially when you look at a two year stack of 30% EPS at the midpoint is fantastic return. And anything above that, we would then use opportunistically to invest back in the business to continue to drive long-term growth, getting the balance right between delivering best-in-class EPS, plus best-in-class growth and market share expansion is what we're doing here. And we will reinvest any opportunity that we get. We spend an increasingly - increasingly we're spending more and more on digital, that's not a surprise, everyone's doing that. We have much more science behind our marketing. And our team continues to build their expertise in doing so and that leads to more efficiency. So absolute spending investment is no longer as it relevant, as it once was because we're dialing up the productivity and efficiency of that spend every year and so we're able to squeeze more out of every dollar in terms of the consumer impacting, as you point out, you know, even though our marketing was down in 2020, we gained share on 90% of our core portfolio, and we added 3 million new households security. So clearly, we knew what we were doing on that spending. And then my last point is, what are we going to spend the money on this year, we've got an incredible lineup of innovation, on the LRB side, well, first on CSD, zero sugar is our big news. You're already seeing advertising right now on Dr Pepper zero sugar. We're running NASCAR for the first time this weekend, in many, many years with Dr Pepper behind zero sugar and Bubba Wallace. We're introducing Bai Boost, which will support with advertising. And then on the Keurig side, we've got a number of innovations, Green Mountain Brew Over Ice. We're continuing the One Step Lattes and cappuccinos on Donut Shop, both of whom have done really well. And then, of course, substantial spending beyond the Keurig business to drive household penetration. So not only do we restore the spending, do we know how to spend it, but we're really focused that spending on innovation, which we know drives really efficient marketing. So thanks for that question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to go back to the comments about Q2 coming in below the guide for EPS, despite obviously being the easiest comp for you. I understand the transportation cost pressures and reinvestment. But can you talk about the top line outlook? And if it's coming above the - what do you have the now that you raised? Thank you.\nRobert Gamgort: Yeah. Ozan, will likely talk about the EPS side, the earning side of it and the pluses or minuses? Andrea, thanks for the question. We did something that we usually don't, which gave guidance on a quarter because of the volatility. So we're certainly doing in the earning side, but we do not plan to give guidance for quarter-by-quarter on the revenue side. But Ozan, do you want to talk about the earnings visibility that we have and why we decided to give some extra color on Q2?\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Absolutely. Good morning. So when we look to our overall expectation and the construct of the quarter two, we still see a very healthy quarter, as you have said a good top line increase expectation. And when we look to the inflationary pressures that are coming along, we expect a healthy amount of inflation to realize in our quarter two [ph] P&L. And we should not also forget that when you comp versus the last year in quarter two, we have seen some declines, especially in the transportation and the logistics area, for example, which was purely driven by the demand and supply, which was coming from the marketplace as part of the pandemic environment. So we are going to lap lows periods that on a like for like basis is up taking the overall freight costs, as well as logistics expectation for us. But the good news is we have a good handle on those things, and we have built in our forecast and the plans and not only for quarter two, but beyond, including the second half of the year. At the same time, last year, in quarter two, as part of the overall industry giving there wasn't much return in a pandemic environment, we reduced more, so from our marketing spending, especially behind the advertisement and promotion. And as Bob was articulating a couple of minutes ago, we started to reinstate some of the advertisement and promotion investments behind our brands and also support a slate of the innovation that we have and putting in the marketplace. Therefore this is also technically creating a negative comparison, increase in the advertisement and promotion versus last year. But it's all good expand that goes behind our branch and investment and of our business. And as we always do, we are very careful in terms of delivering on our productivities, merger synergies, as well as other cost controls that we have been doing very successfully since the actual emergent date, but we took it to the different levels starting with the pandemic environment. Therefore, when we put all the puts and takes, we do we still expect a very healthy growth in terms of the either the top line, mid part, as well as the bottom line of our P&L.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. So I know we're still not in a you know completely normal operating environment with COVID. You know, but I guess with the strength that you're seeing in coffee, what looks like a pretty rational environment in the North American beverage environment, especially on the pricing front and you're still gaining share. I wonder if you have some, you know incremental thoughts as we get into this year, just about the steady state organic sales growth of this portfolio because it continues to show an ability to grow better than a low single digit top line algorithm, which to category exposure might suggest that the packaged beverage unit specifically has been coming in significantly better. And I just wonder if there's more opportunity here, then what again, that that low single digit category growth rate might imply? So thanks for any thoughts around that.\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. Good morning. Thanks for your question. The - this environment is anything but steady state, as we sit here right now. And as we said upfront, it appears to be returning to more of a business as new normal, whatever that's going to be when it settles basis. But way too early in this year, for us to even think about steady state. We have our entire organization remaining on their toes. We're looking for changes in the environment, none of us went into this year expecting the level of inflation that we're seeing right now, for example, and we don't know if it's temporary, or if it's sustained. So I don't know what steady state looks like. And when we get towards the end of the year, we'll probably have a better view on that. I mean, your question is, what's the longer term growth outlook for this portfolio and whatever that environment is? I won't steal any thunder from our Investor Day, which we'll be doing right after our Q2 earnings, because that will be the topic. What does the KDP outlook look like both from a strategy and a financial algorithm post-2021. At that point in time, we'll have more data on what the marketplace looks like. And that'll be a very robust part of that conversation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your lines open.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks. And good morning, everybody. Two questions, if I could, I guess, maybe Ozan for you just to round the 2Q key versus balance of the year question. I think, you know, I appreciate the color you gave to Andrea\u2019s question. But if you could just hit maybe for us a little bit more specificity on what you expect to get better in the back half versus 2Q, whether it's the cost environment, or the cost savings momentum, pricing benefits, or otherwise. Just looking for a bit more clarity on where the back half acceleration has to be sourced from relative to what you said about 2Q? And then Bob, what I really wanted to ask about was just the relative strength of packaged beverages on the top line, not just this quarter. But what we've seen over the past several, there's been tailwind in that business, but you've, I think, pretty consistently exceeded expectations. And I'm curious, if there are things you can, you know, you know, hammer home for us in terms of where you attribute or what you attribute outperformance to. Part of that, I think, is that your market shares are stronger in future consumption channels where consumers have been biased to shop this past year. To the extent that's true, I guess maybe you could talk about that. But I'm also curious if you feel you see opportunities to leverage the strength you've had in those channels into future gains and immediate consumption channels when traffic builds as we go forward? Thank you.\nRobert Gamgort: Ozan, do you want to start with the first one?\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Yes. Yes, Bob. Good morning, Steve. Thanks for the question. So in order to bring a little bit more color, let me try to break up a little bit more. And then - and we go from there. So as I said, we do believe that we have a good planning stance, not only for Q2, but for the remainder of the year. So - but let's make sure that we all agree on one thing is still we are not 100% out of the woods in terms of the pandemic environment. We still don't know exactly how all these things going to play out and how the macroeconomic situation going to react, and most importantly, how the mobility is going to be impacted. As we said in numerous number of times, we did not get any windfall from the pandemic environment. This was a ruthless prioritization in terms of managing the mix, along with the innovation and the categories that we operate. Therefore, we also said that we have seen some pressure in our - for example, in the coffee side, away from home business, that primarily serves the offices, as well as the hospitality sector. On the cold beverage side, the most negatively impacted part of our business was the fountain foodservice, as we discussed, again in numerous number of occasions. The good news with those, starting quarter two onwards, we are going to lap those negative numbers that we have seen in 2020. And with the increasing of the mobility, we do expect those two parts of our business to start to perform better than 2020. And albeit, we already started to see month in month out since January onwards. So we don't know and we don't have a real crystal ball in terms of how the mobility is going to be impacted and what would be the puts and takes on our business. Having said that, we also have a good understanding and some expectations in terms of how our top nine we look like in relation to the crisis stability that we believe now we have in our overall cost of goods sold portfolio, that goes back to the inflationary comments, and I have just made, which a good chunk of our portfolio that is hedgeable and we are taking all the necessary measures to assure up the rest of the year. And for the other input costs, like soft polypropylene and trade that there are not regulated markets that we can hedge, that we believe we put the incremental inflationary environment that would be applicable for our business for the rest of the year. And as we also discussed, we have several levels actually in case the inflammation goes further to put into the service, likes of productivities, cost controls, pricing whenever it is appropriate, as well as our increased volume profile to support the bottom line. Therefore, we are very fortunate in terms of having several resources in order to fight back even further inflation that may happen, given that we don't know exactly what we don't know at this point in time. And therefore, when we step back and look at it, we will also continue to ramp up our remainder productivity problems, as well as merger synergies more in the second half of this year. So when we add up all these puts and takes, we believe that we have quite a bit of healthy profit and loss profile to deliver our EPS commitment of 13% to 15%, with the associated top line. Therefore, the good news is that we have built in all these, again, puts and takes into the remainder of 2021 and came up with the full year profile that we have been talking. Bob? A - Robert Gamgort Yeah. Let me - I'm going to add one thing to that, Steve, before I get to your second question. To bring together your question and Andrea's question, you know, sometimes we get into the details, which are important, we lose the big picture. So let me just step back before I move on and say the big picture on it. The second quarter, we said is going to be below our 13% to 15% annual guidance, but still double digit. So we're talking very strong performance in second quarter. The biggest driver of that fact, in Q2, if you want to look at why is Q2 below the balance of the year is this reinvestment in marketing in 2021 compared to a quarter a year ago, we're marketing across our business and the entire industry was - had a dramatic pullback, I view that as a position of strength, not as a cost. But obviously it shows up on the earning side for one quarter. So all of that detail is really important. But let's not lose the big picture of what I just said. I think this is actually a very, very strong position. With regard to our results of our packaged beverage business, it's two things, its brand strength and its outstanding execution of retail with regard to the brand strength. We have you know talked about our share gain on Dr Pepper, Canada Dry for years, which continues to say and I won't build - drill down deeper into those because we talked about those all the time, but we're getting broader share strength across our portfolio. So I mentioned one today this deserves a little bit of a call out which is Sunkist, which has now moved to the number one fruit flavored CSD share position. We never talked about Sunkist, but we've had innovation, renovation and marketing behind that brand. And you see that it respond, and I could keep going throughout our CSD portfolio to talk about that. Beyond CSDs, we've had fantastic results on brands like CORE, Snapple, we're in the middle of a Snapple reinvention right now, which is a completely new look to it, new bottle 100%, post consumer recycled, et cetera, et cetera. So I won't go through this laundry list. But there is real brand strength and it's not accidental. It's driven by innovation, renovation and really strong marketing and that will continue. With regards to execution, it's more than just we're getting the blocking and tackling right. We have added really strong leadership to that side of the business. We've upgraded the data and technology that helps aid our decision making. We have real strength in things like - on areas like revenue growth management, which allows us to be very precise in our promotion program. And then finally, we've made 14 investments, some are substantial, like the Honickman partnerships. Some are very small, but we made 14 transactions in our route to market to take some independent businesses and move them over to our businesses in which our thesis is that when we can consolidate the supply and distribution, we're able to execute better market, and that's showing up and that's not going to slow down. So it's really the combination of those, your point about C store versus others is really not a major factor here. If you want to look at our relative C store performance, I can make it really simple for you. The single biggest reason why we are not as large as some of our competitors is because we don't have a meaningful position in energy or sports, but particularly energy. And energy is a big category in C stores. But it's nothing beyond that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Bon, a question for you on Polar and the company's sparkling water strategy more broadly. So you spent a little bit of time, you mentioned distribution opportunity for the brand. It also seemed like it contributed to the strong package beverage result in the quarter building on Steve's question a moment ago. So a few questions, please. What is the ACV opportunity? I think you mentioned it's 55%. What is the ambition? Where do you think that can go? And where are those shelf space gains going to come from, as you as you expand? Have you been pleased with the existing velocity, as you've expanded here at existing retailers? And then Bob maybe just more broadly on the company's sparkling water strategy, just more broadly, given the attractiveness of it, and it continues to be one of high growth categories in the beverage space a lot there? Thank you.\nRobert Gamgort: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, thanks for question. We have - really if you look at our previous position as sparkling water with relatively limited, we had some regional positions in Canada Dry and Schweppes. And we actually think those brands are much more fit for the ginger ale and CSD business, they are in sparkling water. But it made some sense when we didn't have anything. The Polar is the brand that we're backing. We're happy with the velocity. We're really pleased with the ACV that we're at right now, which is 55%. And where does it go from here? It's going to deliver at the HCD level of all of our top brands. You know, that's almost universal distribution. So there's no reason why this is one of our big investment areas is not going to achieve that strength. With regard to how do we plan on playing within sparklings? We have some niche brands. The businesses that we can add around the edges here, Limitless was one which is caffeinated, that we're expanding beyond just caffeinated, that we will position against that. But I think very clearly Polar is the brand that we're backing. It's an important brand in a high growth segment, one that's been a gap in our portfolio, and like our position in premium water in total, where we've now become the number two player we\u2019re being very intentional about making sure that we have a good position in sparkling water going forward.\nOperator: All right, thank you. That concludes the Q&A session of today's call. I'll hand the call back to Tyson.\nTyson Seely: Thank you, Jerome. And thank you everyone for your participation today. The IR team is around as usual. I know it's a busy day for everyone. We didn't get to everyone in the queue, but the IR team is here for your questions throughout the day. Please reach out to us. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you, presenters. And thank you ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Bob. And good morning, everyone. Continuing on an adjusted basis, I will briefly review our performance for the first quarter, which was very strong, and our press release discusses in significant detail. I will then turn into our outlook for the full year 2021. Constant currency net sales increased nearly 11%, fueled by higher volume mix of 10.3% and favorable net price realization of 0.5% with all four of our business segments posting growth. Adjusted operating income in the first quarter totaled $741 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to $684 million in the year ago period, driven by the very strong net sales growth, continued productivity and merger synergies and lower marketing spending in relation to the pre-COVID spending levels in the year ago period. These drivers were partially offset by higher operating expenses associated with increased consumer demand, inflation in logistics and input costs and an unfavorable comparison to a $2 million [ph] gain in the prior year on the sale leaseback of four facilities. For perspective, this gain negatively impacted the year-over-year adjusted operating income growth rate by more than seven full percentage points. Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 25.5%, a decline of 70 basis points versus year ago, which included the 160 basis points headwind from the gain on sale leaseback transactions. Adjusted net income advanced 15.4% in the quarter to $471 million compared to $408 million in the year ago period, driven by growth in adjusted operating income, and the lower adjusted effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13.8% to $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $0.29 per diluted share the year ago period, which included the $0.02 gain from the year ago sale leaseback transactions. Let me take a moment to discuss the inflationary pressures we have referenced this morning. Like most other CPG companies, we have increased our outlook for inflation over the past month. Price expectations continue to rise for aluminum, glass, corn inputs, and polypropylene, which is the material used in K-Cup pods. Most recently, we have experienced a spike in transportation and logistics costs, which is especially acute when we have been required to purchase sport capacity to satisfy the strong demand for our products. Some of these input costs, for example, transportation, and polypropylene cannot be hatched. To manage inflation, we rely on a combination of productivity, cost control, pricing and incremental volume growth, pulling the right levers at the right time to protect the long term health of our business, while offsetting rising input costs. For 2021, we are in a position of strength, as we are able to utilize our sales growth momentum to mitigate inflation. However, if inflation were to accelerate, we may need to utilize other options, just like we did in 2020. We will remain nimble and flexible to react to changing market conditions to ensure our continued success. Finally, we get a number of questions on the benefit of hedging and forward buying with regards to mitigating inflation. First, while we use these practices wisely, their role is primarily to provide plenty of certainty for a period of time and to insulate against short term volatility in input costs, they can postpone, but not offset inflation. Coffee is a great example. We are seeing green coffee prices on the rise right now. But we are covered for a period of time, which lets us see how the market settles before we need to react. Like every other input cost, with green coffee inflation were to be persistent, then we would consider all of our available options to offset its impact on our profit and loss. The good news today is our strong guidance for 2021 incorporates all of these considerations. As we are confident that we have the tools and management discipline to deliver a strong growth in both revenue and earnings, despite the inflation outlook that has been widely discussed this earnings season. Let me now turn into our segment performance in the first quarter. Coffee systems constant currency net sales increased 16.9%, driven by higher volume mix of 19.5%, partially offset by lower net price realization of 2.6%. The volume mix performance reflected pod shipment volume growth of 13.7%, driven by double-digit at-home shipments, partially offset by continued softness in the away-from-home coffee businesses. The 61% increase in brew shipments in the quarter was fueled by strong consumer consumption and the benefits of shipment timing. Adjusted operating income for coffee systems totaled $389 million, an increase of 12.1%, compared to $347 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by the strong net sales growth, as well as continued productivity and merger synergies. These growth drivers were partially offset by inflation in logistics and inputs costs and the unfavorable comparison to the sale leaseback gain in the year ago quarter that impacted the segment by $16 million. The year-over-year adjusted operating income growth rate would have been 5 percentage points higher in the quarter, absent this year ago gain. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 34.1% compared to 35.7% in the year ago period, a decline of 160 basis points, including a 170 basis points headwind from the asset sale leaseback gain in the first quarter of 2020. Also impacting the comparison was unfavorable margin mix, due to the exception on the strong brewer growth in the current quarter, and the breakeven margin structure of brewers, offsetting these impacts were continued strong productivity and merger synergies. Packaged Beverages constant currency net sales grew 7.2% in the first quarter, driven by strong volume mix growth of 6.8% and higher net pricing of 0.4%. This performance reflected growth in both our company-owned DSD operations, and warehouse direct businesses. Driving this growth were Dr Pepper, A&W, Canada Dry, Sunkist, 7UP and Squirt in CSDs, along with Snapple and Clamato, partially offset by a decline in Bai. Adjusted operating income for packaged beverages in the first quarter totaled $197 million, a decrease of 3% compared to $203 million in the year ago period. That included the sale and leaseback gain of $26 million for the segment. The year-over-year adjusted operating income growth rate would have been 14 percentage points higher in the quarter, absent this year ago gain. Inflation in logistics and input costs and higher operating costs to meet strong consumer demand were also headwinds in the quarter, as were continued channel and format mix challenges, as we are comping to a largely non-COVID period last year. Partially offsetting these drivers were the strong net sales, continued productivity and merger synergies and lower discretionary expenses. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 15.1% in the quarter compared adjusted operating margin of 16.7% in the year ago period, a decline of 160 basis points, including the 220 basis point headwind from the year-ago sale-leaseback gain. Beverage concentrates constant currency net sales increased 6.5% due to favorable net pricing of 7.2%, partially offset by lower volume mix of 0.7%. This performance continued to be affected by the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on fountain foodservice business, albeit, improved since the beginning of 2021. Adjusted operating income for beverage concentrates increased 21.3% to $239 million compared to $197 million in the year ago period, driven by net sales growth and lower marketing spending. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter advanced 850 basis points to 72.9%, primarily reflecting the favorable net price realization. And finally, Latin America beverages constant currency net sales grew 7.7%, reflecting strong net pricing of 10.3%, partially offset by lower volume mix of 2.6%, as consumer mobility in Mexico continued to be impacted by COVID-19. However, this has improved from the beginning of 2021. Liquid refreshment beverage in market execution in Mexico continue to be strong, driving market share growth for key brands, namely Pen\u0303afiel, Squirt and Clamato. Adjusted operating income decreased 15% to $23 million, compared to $27 million in the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income decreased 14.8%, reflecting the impact of foreign currency transaction expense and inflation in logistics, partially offset by the strong growth in constant currency net sales, continued productivity and lower discretionary spending. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter decreased 470 basis points to 18.4%, primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency transactions expense. Switching back to total KDP. Free cash flow in the quarter was again exceptionally strong at $458 million, which translated into a free cash flow conversion ratio of nearly 100%. As previously announced, we completed a $2.2 billion strategic refinancing in March of this year. Since the time of the merger, nearly three years ago, we have generated significant cash flow and have rapidly delevered. This strategically financing further enhances our liquidity profile and strengths our balance sheet. To that end, our strong free cash flow performance in the quarter enabled us to reduce outstanding bank debt by $25 million and structured payables by $5 million. And we paid $95 million for the early retirement of that, in conjunction with previously mentioned March strategic refinancing. We also ended the first quarter with $335 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Due to growth in earnings, our reduction in bank debt and increased cash on hand, we improved our management leverage ratio to 3.5 times at the end of the first quarter of 2021. Since the merger closed in July 2018, we have reduced our management leverage ratio by 2.5 times. Let me move to our updated outlook for 2021. For the full year 2021, we now expect constant currency net sales in the range of 4% to 6% compared to our initial guidance of 3% to 4% at the beginning of this year, which reflects the strong demand for our brands across all segments. We also reaffirmed our EPS guidance range of 13% to 15% growth for the year, in part driven by the benefit of higher net sales outlook in offsetting higher inflation. As indicated in our release this morning, we plan to invest any earnings outside above our guidance range back in the business to drive future growth. For perspective, on a two year stack basis, assuming the midpoint of our guidance range, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth will approach to 30%. Supporting our guidance, we continue to expect merger synergies of approximately $200 million for the three year total of approximately $600 million, in line with our merger targets. Adjusted interest expense in the range of $505 million to $515 million and adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 24%. As you have seen in our results this morning, our effective tax rate was below this guidance range at 22.1% in quarter one, due to one-time discrete favorable items, including employee stock vesting, which we anticipated, which is lastly, a first quarter event. Our dividend rate will increase 25%, beginning with our regular quarterly dividend to be announced in the second quarter subject to official board declaration, as previously disclosed, diluted weighted shares outstanding of approximately of 1.43 billion. Finally, we continue to expect our management leverage ratio to be at or below three times by the end of this year. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, giving the company is on to an unusually volatile quarter two 2020, let me provide some additional perspective on the second quarter. Giving the inflation allocations we discussed and their significant year-over-year increase in marketing spending, we expect to deliver double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth for the quarter, although, it will be below the full year guidance range of 13% to 15%. Transportation will continue to be a headwind in the second quarter. With respect to marketing, we continue to restore investment behind our brands this year, especially to support our strong sale of innovation, which is comping a year ago period in which everyone in the industry reduced marketing expenses, due to the uncertain consumer demand environment under COVID. We hope this provides some helpful clarity on the phasing of our business results this year. With that, let me hand it back to Bob. Sure. Good morning, Bryan. And like you have heard, likes of many of our peer group of companies, we have increased our outlook for inflation over the past month. And when you looked at the major reasons of the inflation, you would see that primarily around the packaging likes of aluminium, glass, as well as polypropylene, the material that we use in the K-Cup pods, that includes corn inputs that translates for us as the high fructose syrup. \\And then, in the past one month, we were expecting already an inflationary environment in the transportation and the overall logistics, but we have seen an uptick in those. And we also service our increased volume using at times off the spot rate, which makes it a little bit higher inflationary environment. And right now, we believe that we have included a healthy amount of inflation expectations, in our view to go period. And some of the input costs, especially transportation, which is translates for us as freight, as well as polypropylene are not really hedge above in terms of there not regulated market, so we can perform some of the hedging activities that we have then. And - but nevertheless, Bryan, we feel very good with our expectations and how much inflation we have increased in our outlook and build for the rest of the year. And for the commodities and the other input costs, there are other measurable items, as we always use widely hedging techniques to protect and bring price stability and then forecast transparency for the year to go, they are all intact. But please make no mistake, that hedging or forward purchasing provides high certainty for a period of time. And in a persistent inflation is just postponing, is not really mitigating the inflation as such. But in short, we feel very good with our expectations for the rest of the year. And we believe we de-risked our P&L as much as we could. Absolutely. Good morning. So when we look to our overall expectation and the construct of the quarter two, we still see a very healthy quarter, as you have said a good top line increase expectation. And when we look to the inflationary pressures that are coming along, we expect a healthy amount of inflation to realize in our quarter two [ph] P&L. And we should not also forget that when you comp versus the last year in quarter two, we have seen some declines, especially in the transportation and the logistics area, for example, which was purely driven by the demand and supply, which was coming from the marketplace as part of the pandemic environment. So we are going to lap lows periods that on a like for like basis is up taking the overall freight costs, as well as logistics expectation for us. But the good news is we have a good handle on those things, and we have built in our forecast and the plans and not only for quarter two, but beyond, including the second half of the year. At the same time, last year, in quarter two, as part of the overall industry giving there wasn't much return in a pandemic environment, we reduced more, so from our marketing spending, especially behind the advertisement and promotion. And as Bob was articulating a couple of minutes ago, we started to reinstate some of the advertisement and promotion investments behind our brands and also support a slate of the innovation that we have and putting in the marketplace. Therefore this is also technically creating a negative comparison, increase in the advertisement and promotion versus last year. But it's all good expand that goes behind our branch and investment and of our business. And as we always do, we are very careful in terms of delivering on our productivities, merger synergies, as well as other cost controls that we have been doing very successfully since the actual emergent date, but we took it to the different levels starting with the pandemic environment. Therefore, when we put all the puts and takes, we do we still expect a very healthy growth in terms of the either the top line, mid part, as well as the bottom line of our P&L. Yes. Yes, Bob. Good morning, Steve. Thanks for the question. So in order to bring a little bit more color, let me try to break up a little bit more. And then - and we go from there. So as I said, we do believe that we have a good planning stance, not only for Q2, but for the remainder of the year. So - but let's make sure that we all agree on one thing is still we are not 100% out of the woods in terms of the pandemic environment. We still don't know exactly how all these things going to play out and how the macroeconomic situation going to react, and most importantly, how the mobility is going to be impacted. As we said in numerous number of times, we did not get any windfall from the pandemic environment. This was a ruthless prioritization in terms of managing the mix, along with the innovation and the categories that we operate. Therefore, we also said that we have seen some pressure in our - for example, in the coffee side, away from home business, that primarily serves the offices, as well as the hospitality sector. On the cold beverage side, the most negatively impacted part of our business was the fountain foodservice, as we discussed, again in numerous number of occasions. The good news with those, starting quarter two onwards, we are going to lap those negative numbers that we have seen in 2020.

And for the other input costs, like soft polypropylene and trade that there are not regulated markets that we can hedge, that we believe we put the incremental inflationary environment that would be applicable for our business for the rest of the year. And as we also discussed, we have several levels actually in case the inflammation goes further to put into the service, likes of productivities, cost controls, pricing whenever it is appropriate, as well as our increased volume profile to support the bottom line.

            "content": "Thanks, Tyson. And good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are well. As we enter spring cautious optimism as in the year, vaccine rates are approaching 50% of the US adult population and growing across North America. Higher levels of consumer mobility are evident in retail, restaurants and entertainment. And there is an increasing belief that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. If the last year has taught us anything, however, it is that our role is not to predict the future but rather to be nimble, responsive and prepare for whatever we may face in the future. This same mindset enabled Keurig Dr Pepper to deliver meaningful outperformance in 2020 and a strong start to 2021. While some companies have been devastated by the impacts of the crisis, others have experienced a windfall from it. We on the other hand have succeeded despite the pandemic, by driving the parts of our business that are performing well to overcome the declines we've experienced in areas structurally challenged by COVID. While that may sound easy and concept, it is very difficult to execute in the real world. And I would like to thank our 27,000 team members across KDP, who continue to step up to meet the challenge. In the first quarter of 2021, we delivered strong performance across the board, highlighted by double-digit growth in both net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. We also reaffirmed our outlook for another strong year of double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth. Despite the specter of rising inflation, in part by increasing our net sales growth expectations from 3% to 4% to 4% to 6%. This sets us up for a solid 2021 and positions us to achieve our ambitious three-year merger targets ending this year. Let me now provide key highlights of the first quarter. Our net sales grew by 11%, with all four business segments posting growth, driving this performance with continued strong in-market execution across the business. In cold beverages, we continue to perform well, with more than 80% of our cold beverage retail sales space expanding market share during the quarter. We believe a helpful way to assess both our results and those of the broader industry, given the unique volatility of 2020 is on a two-year stack basis. Over this time period, nearly 90% of our cold retail sales space grew market share and our consumption was up nearly 17%. LRBD performance continues to reflect KDPs broad-based strength and CSD, premium unflavored water, Snapple teas and fruit drinks and others. During the quarter we launched new zero sugar varieties across our CSD portfolio, which has helped to solidify our number two CSD manufacturer status in key retail accounts. We're also seeing KDP brands take over leadership position. The latest being Sunkist becoming the number one fruit flavored CSD brand, fueled by the zero sugar introduction and flavor-line extension. In the past few months, we launched innovation behind Bai with Bai Boost, made with clean ingredients, including plant-based energy from tea extract, Bai Boost has been well received by retailers and consumers in early days. Finally on cold beverages, our new brand partnership and the growing sparkling water segment with Polar is performing well. National ACB has grown to 55% with more distribution to come, as shelf resets are completed across the country. Our coffee business posted an exceptionally strong quarter, with net sales advancing 17% on a constant currency basis, due to a 14% increase in pod volume growth and a 61% increase in brewer volume. The latter primarily being driven by a roughly 40% increase in consumer sales, and some benefits of shipment timing between the quarters. Approximately half of the 14% increase in pod volume was due to strong consumption in the quarter, with the remainder driven by differences in pod shipment timing relative to the unusual year ago period. The fact that pod volume growth in track channels registered at just above 3% for the quarter, demonstrate the trend that we've been discussing for some time, take a pause are experiencing significantly higher levels of growth in untracked channels, particularly e-commerce. Sticking deeper into untracked channels highlights further the growing importance of e-commerce. Strength in at-home pods has been tempered by continued weakness in the away-from-home channel, as the return to offices continued to be slow. We do expect improvement over the course of 2021, especially after Labor Day when we anticipate the rates of office re-openings to accelerate. On a two-year stack basis, dollar consumption of positive track channels was up 11% with two-year shipments up more than 20%. For total KDP we delivered very strong bottom line results in the quarter, with adjusted diluted EPS growth of nearly 14%, despite lapping the sale leaseback gains in the first quarter of the year. We also continue to generate high levels of free cash flow, enabling us to pay down debt and improve our management leverage ratios of 3.5 times at the end of the quarter. Since the merger, we have reduced our leverage ratio by 2.5 turns while also investing meaningfully across the business. Let me now hand it over to Ozan to walk you through the financial results for the quarter and provide further details on our outlook for 2021. Thanks, Ozan. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to provide a brief update on corporate governance. As you are aware, we transitioned from a controlled company to a widely-held one in 2020. Since that time, we've enhanced our board structure, increasing its independence and diversity, and establishing the role of lead independent director. I want to highlight - or announced it yesterday that we welcome Lubomira Rochet, as a new Director to our Board. Since November, we've added four new directors, each of whom brings a unique experiences and fresh perspective to the Board. Finally, many of you have asked questions about our post-2021 outlook. We plan to hold an Investor Day shortly after we report our Q2 earnings, during which we look forward to sharing insights on our long-term strategy and financial expectation. Details for the conference will be provided in the near future. I will now hand back to the operator. Hi, Bonnie. Yeah, okay. Sounds great. Let me start with attach first. During the pandemic, we saw an increase in attachment rate, especially in the early days. And that was very different than the long term trend we had experienced, we said the attachment rates were very stable. Our expectation that we communicated at that time at that time is that, as consumer mobility normalized, we would see attachment rates normalize back to their long-term levels. And that's exactly what we're seeing right now. So I think attachment rate, on hand have come down from their piece in Q2 a year ago, no surprise there. But the reverse side of it is, our attachment rates holding up versus their long-term trend, even as we add new households, absolutely. And I think - it's as simple as when we're able to convert a home from brewing coffee by the pots to brewing it by the cup, it settles in at a consumption race. And unless there's some substantial change in their behavior, stays very solid over time, which is ultimately good news. As we talked about a number of times, so it's worth, but it is worth repeating. Household penetration growth is what drives our pod growth over the long-term. And brewer sales over a longer period of time has some correlation. But especially in the short term, there's not causality. So you can't automatically look at trump brewer sales and say, that's going to mean that we've got a even higher rate of household penetration. And let me give you a little more depth on that, because it's such a critical point. In 2020, as you know, we added 3 million new households to the Keurig system. And that was about a million households above our normal run rate of 2 million. And there were a lot of questions about is this a pull-forward from the future? When we look at 2021? We said absolutely not. And that's exactly what's playing out right now. To get those 3 million households, we sold 11 million brewers. So that tells you that we had a record year, not only in terms of new household, but a record year in seeing existing households, which are now 33 million strong in the US, replace or upgrade their brewers. And while replacements and upgrades don't lead to household penetration growth, they're really important because they represent a strong recommitment to the Keurig system. So let's talk about 2021. When we talk about - when we put our initial thoughts about 2021, we said that we believe that we'll return to our long-term trend of adding 2 million new households per year, and we weren't concerned about any pull-forward. We had a really strong quarter in brewer sales in Q1, and by the way, 40% of that 60% growth was driven by consumption. So there's some shipment timing in there. But it's really consumer sales driving the majority of that, as happy as we are with that it is far too early in the year for us to conclude that that translates to household penetration growth above 2 million. Why is that? Because we've got a ton of innovation in the market right now. And you're also seeing two rounds of government stimulus in the past few months, that have people feeling very liquid. And so a number of people are using it to still invest in their homes, and they're upgrading their brewers. And we've given them innovation to do so. So as we sit here today, we're still talking about 2 million new households, which is a tremendous growth. And as we always do, we'll update our household penetration growth at the end of the year. And the start that we see on brewers to give us confidence, if nothing else to give us confidence that the 2 million number is very doable. Morning. Sure. Good morning, Lauren. Thanks for the question. Marketing plans, well, let me talk about marketing spending first. As you point out, everybody in industry dropped their spending in 2020. It was a combination of covering mix issues. But also in the early days of the pandemic, the marketing wasn't very efficient. As we got through the years, as you also point out, not only did we restore some of the spend, but we also learned to be incredibly efficient with that spend, nothing like being under pressure to innovate on how we're able to reach consumers in a more efficient way. And a lot of that learning carries over into 2021, where we build in that expected efficiency, plus we have plans to invest more in marketing. To be really - directly to your question, we have not changed our commitment to the increase in marketing that we have planned in 2021, despite the fact that we're seeing higher inflation, so we haven't touched marketing to offset inflation at all, in 2021. Our expectation is increased marketing spend, restore as much of that as we possibly can, although we won't get all the way back to where we were in 2019, for sure, that will take a couple of years to get there. We are also looking for opportunities to invest more in our marketing spend. So as we talked about a number of times, that we think 13% to 15% growth in an environment like we're in right now, especially when you look at a two year stack of 30% EPS at the midpoint is fantastic return. And anything above that, we would then use opportunistically to invest back in the business to continue to drive long-term growth, getting the balance right between delivering best-in-class EPS, plus best-in-class growth and market share expansion is what we're doing here. And we will reinvest any opportunity that we get. We spend an increasingly - increasingly we're spending more and more on digital, that's not a surprise, everyone's doing that. We have much more science behind our marketing. And our team continues to build their expertise in doing so and that leads to more efficiency. So absolute spending investment is no longer as it relevant, as it once was because we're dialing up the productivity and efficiency of that spend every year and so we're able to squeeze more out of every dollar in terms of the consumer impacting, as you point out, you know, even though our marketing was down in 2020, we gained share on 90% of our core portfolio, and we added 3 million new households security. So clearly, we knew what we were doing on that spending. And then my last point is, what are we going to spend the money on this year, we've got an incredible lineup of innovation, on the LRB side, well, first on CSD, zero sugar is our big news. You're already seeing advertising right now on Dr Pepper zero sugar. We're running NASCAR for the first time this weekend, in many, many years with Dr Pepper behind zero sugar and Bubba Wallace. We're introducing Bai Boost, which will support with advertising. And then on the Keurig side, we've got a number of innovations, Green Mountain Brew Over Ice. We're continuing the One Step Lattes and cappuccinos on Donut Shop, both of whom have done really well. And then, of course, substantial spending beyond the Keurig business to drive household penetration. So not only do we restore the spending, do we know how to spend it, but we're really focused that spending on innovation, which we know drives really efficient marketing. So thanks for that question. Yeah. Ozan, will likely talk about the EPS side, the earning side of it and the pluses or minuses? Andrea, thanks for the question. We did something that we usually don't, which gave guidance on a quarter because of the volatility. So we're certainly doing in the earning side, but we do not plan to give guidance for quarter-by-quarter on the revenue side. But Ozan, do you want to talk about the earnings visibility that we have and why we decided to give some extra color on Q2? Sure. Good morning. Thanks for your question. The - this environment is anything but steady state, as we sit here right now. And as we said upfront, it appears to be returning to more of a business as new normal, whatever that's going to be when it settles basis. But way too early in this year, for us to even think about steady state. We have our entire organization remaining on their toes. We're looking for changes in the environment, none of us went into this year expecting the level of inflation that we're seeing right now, for example, and we don't know if it's temporary, or if it's sustained. So I don't know what steady state looks like. And when we get towards the end of the year, we'll probably have a better view on that. I mean, your question is, what's the longer term growth outlook for this portfolio and whatever that environment is? I won't steal any thunder from our Investor Day, which we'll be doing right after our Q2 earnings, because that will be the topic. What does the KDP outlook look like both from a strategy and a financial algorithm post-2021. At that point in time, we'll have more data on what the marketplace looks like. And that'll be a very robust part of that conversation. Ozan, do you want to start with the first one? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, thanks for question. We have - really if you look at our previous position as sparkling water with relatively limited, we had some regional positions in Canada Dry and Schweppes. And we actually think those brands are much more fit for the ginger ale and CSD business, they are in sparkling water. But it made some sense when we didn't have anything. The Polar is the brand that we're backing. We're happy with the velocity. We're really pleased with the ACV that we're at right now, which is 55%. And where does it go from here? It's going to deliver at the HCD level of all of our top brands. You know, that's almost universal distribution. So there's no reason why this is one of our big investment areas is not going to achieve that strength. With regard to how do we plan on playing within sparklings? We have some niche brands. The businesses that we can add around the edges here, Limitless was one which is caffeinated, that we're expanding beyond just caffeinated, that we will position against that. But I think very clearly Polar is the brand that we're backing. It's an important brand in a high growth segment, one that's been a gap in our portfolio, and like our position in premium water in total, where we've now become the number two player we're being very intentional about making sure that we have a good position in sparkling water going forward."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Earnings Call for the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year of 2022. This conference call is being recorded and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. Ms. Sceppaguercio, please go ahead.\nMaria Sceppaguercio: Thank you. And hello everyone. Earlier this morning we issued a press release for the fourth quarter. Consistent with previous quarters, we\u2019ll be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability and the use of constant currency growth rates are not in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company\u2019s control, we do not reconcile our guidance. Today, we will also speak to the concept of underlying performance, which removes the impact of previously disclosed non-operational items. In \u201922, these items included gains on asset sale leasebacks, reimbursement of litigation expenses related to BodyArmor, a business interruption insurance recovery and a change in accounting policy for stock compensation. Here with us today to discuss our results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort, and our Chief Financial Officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi. Also with us this morning is the IR team, including Jane Gelfand, who we are excited to welcome this week as our new Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives. I'm confident that many of you know Jane from her time on the street, as well as her most recent role at Wayfair, where she led a number of finance functions including Investor Relations and Treasury. Jane is replacing Steve Alexander, who after more than 16 successful years in finance, commercial and IR with KDP and predecessor companies has decided to take some time off for family and travel. We are pleased that Steve has agreed to stay on to April to support the transition. And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. In 2022, we continue to advance our vision of a modern beverage company by expanding our portfolio to reach more beverage consumers, needs and occasions and by enhancing our unique selling and after-market capabilities to make our brands available at every point of sale. Our full-year financial results were in line with or above our guidance with revenue growing by 11% and adjusted diluted EPS expanding by 5%. Since our Q3 earnings call, we had the opportunity to engage with many of you twice. First, at our early December in- person event, where you met the KDP Management Team and Board of Directors, and again, on our mid -December fireside chat, during which we discussed our investment in Nutrabolt, including the distribution agreement for C4 and answer questions regarding recent trends in the categories in which we compete. Those conversations provided us with a good sense of what's top of mind with our investors, which we will build upon during today's call. I'll start by providing perspective on the macro and category environments we faced in 2022, discuss how we created shareholder value over the past year and offer thoughts on how we see 2023 shaping up both in terms of the macro environment and our strategy to continue winning. Sudhanshu will follow me with specifics on our Q4 and full-year 2022 results, provide more detailed guidance on key metrics for 2023, and discuss the evolution of our capital allocation policy. While it seems like a long time ago, we started 2022 with the lingering effects of supply chain disruption, primarily driven by a final COVID wave that reduced labor availability in late 2021 and early 2022. We felt that impact most acutely in our coffee business where strong 2021 consumer demand had depleted our inventories and in our still beverage portfolio where we faced a range of supply shortages. We implemented supply recovery programs that yielded strong customer service improvements with replenished inventory levels. By Q2, our concerns around COVID and supply chain disruptions were quickly supplanted by industry inflation in ingredients and materials, labor, and transportation. That was outpacing significant pricing. Velocity held up well in the categories in which we compete, which enabled strong revenue growth, driven by both the higher pricing and increased volume, but came at lower margins. Store perspective, we faced total cost inflation in 2022 of 16% far above our expectations going into the year. And we implemented pricing actions across our portfolio that averaged in the low double-digits. Pricing realization was strong and accelerated throughout the year. Yet it consistently lagged the timing of the escalating inflationary impact on our P&L. As we approach the end of the year and enter 2023, we became more focused on the potential impact a recession on our consumers, despite seeing minimal evidence of changing behavior to-date. We are monitoring consumer behavior closely and are taking proactive steps to ensure our brand strength continues into 2023 and beyond. Of course, the wide range of challenges of 2022 is a continuation of the rolling set of obstacles we have navigated since the onset of COVID in 2020. In this context, we have discussed the benefits of our all-weather business model. This is more than a punchy sound bite; it reflects our ability to manage our broad portfolio in unique routes to market to deliver strong and consistent shareholder returns in an unpredictable and changing environment as we did in 2022 and every year since forming KDP in 2018. In addition to delivering our ambitious financial commitments over the past five years, we've also been immersed in an integration and transformation process that created a modern beverage company that today can consistently deliver attractive, high quality, dependable returns with a well-capitalized balance sheet. Toward that end, we have evolved our capital allocation policy to reflect that of a more mature KDP and to be contemporary with a changing macro environment marked by rising interest rates. During the integration and transformation stage, we had a strong focus on rapid deleveraging. Using all available levers available to us, while still investing in building our capabilities and brands. We took advantage of compelling opportunities to monetize non-strategic assets through sale leaseback transactions, which enabled us to simultaneously invest, delever and drive strong returns for our shareholders. As we shift from integration and transformation to activation, we are planning for a step change reduction in the use of non-operational benefits starting this year. That means our underlying operational growth will exceed our adjusted growth in 2023. Of course, our guidance will continue to be for adjusted metrics and we will report results on the same basis we've always done. But we will also highlight operational performance from time-to-time to provide you with a better sense of the underlying strength of our business. Strong cash flow remains a hallmark of KDP. As we discussed in December, we plan to deploy our cash to improve our long-term targeted leverage ratio to 2.5 times or below. While still funding strategic growth projects, and attractive return of cash to shareholders. With the learnings from 2022 in mind, I'll shift to a discussion of our 2023 outlook. Starting with the most pressing industry topic from last year, inflation. Our plan assumes the rate of inflation will moderate to the mid-single-digit range, that translates to a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 30% over the past three years clearly unprecedented in our lifetime. Regarding the inflation outlook for 2023, recent spot price declines of key inputs might lead some to believe this could be industry deflation. The reality is we don't buy on a spot basis and the underlying commodity cost doesn't reflect the total delivered cost to us. Such is certainly the case in coffee where seed prices dropped in late 2022. However, the differential, which includes everything in our fully landed coffee costs, such as broker fees, sea freight and premium coffee up charges was up meaningfully. Labor is another area in which we're continuing to see persistent inflation. To offset the continued impact of inflation, we have upped our game in productivity, reduced our discretionary costs and increased pricing. The realization of 2022 pricing actions will continue to flow into our P&L during 2023. And in some areas, where continued inflation impacts are not yet fully covered by pricing. We've implemented additional revenue growth management actions to address key margin gaps. The combination of moderating inflation and continued pricing realization means that we expect year-over-year improvement in gross margin in 2023, but not yet returning to 2019 levels. With higher gross margins in view for 2023, the conversation shift the demand. A key focus point for us in 2023 is the financial health of American consumers and its impact on price elasticity for the categories in which we compete. Therefore, we believe it's prudent to expect that lower, but still positive of year-over-year pricing realization combined with modest elasticities will yield KDP net revenue growth of approximately 5% in 2023. It's also important to be proactive in ensuring the continued strength of our brands by increasing our investment in growth in 2023. As we are all aware, industry marketing budgets were reduced during COVID and many haven\u2019t yet been fully restored. While we have learned to be significantly more efficient with our brand spending, 2023 is the right time to increase our absolute investment behind key segments and brands, as well as the support a strong lineup of innovation. The improvement in our gross margin combined with 5% revenue growth will enable us to deliver year-over-year improvement in operating income growth. Even with our increased brand investments and the headwind of comping significant non-operational benefits in 2022. Taking all of the macro and company specific factors discussed this morning into account, we expect adjusted EPS for 2023 to grow by 6% to 7%. Removing the impact of previously disclosed non-operational items from 2022 implies adjusted EPS growth that is toward the high end of our long-term algorithm. Our expectation for continued strong value creation in 2023 is rooted in the success of our unique and flexible business strategy over the past five years. In cold beverage, our focus is on driving growth. First in core brands through marketing, brand renovation and continued strong end market execution. In 2022, we continue to build upon or hold the significant share gains we achieved over the past few years in total liquid refreshment beverages and key segments such as CSDs and premium water. Second, by filling white space in our portfolio through innovation and partnerships such as our strategic relationship with Nutrabolt for C4 Energy and our Red Bull agreement in Mexico, as well as our expansion into new platforms such as non0alcohol beer with our investment in athletic brewing and better for you drinks in foodservice through our partnership with Tractor Beverage. Third, by enhancing the effectiveness of our omnichannel selling and distribution system, including e-commerce, where we are one of the food and beverage leaders, and our company owned direct store distribution system. Over the past several years, we have built a stronger direct to market -- direct route to market capability through investment in capabilities and tools and acquiring key DSD distributor territories, all of which have driven consistently strong market share performance across our brands and segments. In coffee systems, we are focused on growth. First, by driving household penetration growth for the Keurig system every year. Given the large number of remaining addressable households, we have line of sight to continued household growth well into the future. As we enter 2023, we have built the U.S. installed base of 38 million households, which along with our installed base in Canada consumed more than 13 billion cups of coffee manufactured by KDP annually. Second, by expanding the roster of coffee partners in the Keurig system. 2022, we welcomed back community coffee and added new brands such as BLK & Bold, the first black-owned nationally distributed coffee brand and Intelligentsia, one of specialty coffee's most pioneering and innovative brands. Third, by creating new platforms to drive incremental revenue and profit growth from existing Keurig households such as connected brewers and new beverage formats and occasions. In 2022, we expanded our lineup of connected brewers with the introduction of K -Caf\u00e9 Smart, which has received outstanding consumer and professional reviews, expanded the Keurig app, which works with both connected and non-connected brewers to help consumers make barista quality specialty coffee beverages at home and expanded availability of our Keurig\u2019s Slim + ICED brewer and expanded our brew over iced pods. In 2023, iced will be a significant focus area procuring with expanded K-Ice machines and pods supported by dedicated marketing and focused retailer support. And finally, KDP's extraordinary free cash flow enables the potential for incremental shareholder returns through strategic capital allocation including M&A and partnerships, opportunistic share repurchases and growing our dividend within our stated payout ratio of 45% of free cash flow. With that as important context, I'll hand it over to Sudhanshu to discuss 2022 results and our 2023 outlook in more depth.\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I joined the company three months ago, because I believed KDP represented a unique investment and value creating opportunity and my conviction has grown significantly as I\u2019ve targeted to understand the business better. This conviction will be reflected in my perspective on our 2022 results, the important learnings as we look back on the year and the implications for 2023. Starting with coffee systems, before jumping into specific numbers, I'd like to share my perspective on the coffee category. Coffee is an attractive long-term growth category. KDP operates primarily in the at home coffee segment in the U.S. and Canada where we are the industry leader. The at home segment comprises the vast majority of all coffee drinking occasions and single serve is the clear winner, consistently growing share of at home occasions. There has been significant noise between 2019 and 2022 in both the at home and away from home coffee categories, primarily due to shifting consumer mobility and we acknowledge that it has been a challenge for investors to separate the signal from that noise. After significant at home coffee volume growth in 2020 and 2021, due to increased consumer time spent at home, we began to see a deceleration in 2022. This occurred globally in all forms of at home coffee, which is quite unprecedented. There are several factors at play causing this concurrent decline. We believe the primary contributors are a reduction in time spent at home for consumers, which we know correlates with coffee consumption as the elasticity impact of significant pricing actions taken in 2022. Specific to the U.S. consistent with the global trends, volume for the total at home coffee category decreased 6% in IRI with all major forms declining, including bags, cans and single serve. However, single serve coffee outperformed, enabling it to gain share of total at home coffee consumption. KDP's owned and licensed brands demonstrated selective strength in 2022, despite having among the highest price increases in the single sub-segment. With the fourth quarter, representing its highest share position since before COVID. Driving its strength by the strong innovation that originated with consumers and reinstated promotions in the second half as parts supply was restored. We saw a similar trend at play in coffee brewers in the U.S., where smaller plants volume were challenged in 2022 comping against growth in 2020 and 2021 that was primarily fueled by time at home, as well as in part by stimulus checks. Although not immune from this dynamic, curate compatible brewers also gain a share of all coffee makers in 2022. Moving to the financials. For the year, the segment grew net sales 6.2% with pricing up 7% and volume mix down 0.8%. Product revenue also advanced 6.2%, reflecting the benefit of pricing and a 1.4% increase in volume. Brewer volume declined 5.2% in 2022 comping the double-digit growth we have experienced each year since the onset of COVID. As you know, our goal is not brewer sales, but rather household penetration and we added more than 2 million new households to the Keurig system in 2022 modestly above our long-term annual target. Innovation is a key driver of household penetration and we are pleased with the performance of our 2022 brewer innovation slate and excited about what's coming in 2023. While top line growth in profit systems was solid, the challenge in 2022 was operating income which declined 7.5% as inflation exceeded, net realized pricing compressing margins. We expect an improvement in the relationship between inflation and pricing going forward, leading to a year-over-year improvement in gross margin in 2023. But specifically, our 2023 outlook projects KDP coffee systems to deliver 3% to 4% net sales growth and 5% to 7% operating income growth. Removing the impact of non-operational items in 2022, this implies higher coffee systems operating income growth in 2023. We expect a strong recovery in margins, reflecting the strength of KDP's owned and licensed brands and a favorable relationship between pricing and inflation, particularly in the second half of the year, which will be significantly stronger than the first half. While the Keurig system is unique, its scale of $5 billion in net sales and OI margins above 30% are consistent with a best-in -class CPG business. While we continue to manage the business to drive household growth and extract incremental value from our existing installed base, I think it makes sense to access coffee systems using the same conventional metrics as you would any other CPG business. That translates into net sales and operating income performance, the outlook for which we are sharing with you today for the year ahead. Our 2023 outlook reflects the following factors that we believe are most relevant to consider. First, while mobility has recovered significantly from 2020 lows, it still remains below pre-COVID levels and we expect its continued recovery in 2023 to represent a headwind for at home coffee consumption especially in the past half. Second, the industry's pricing actions taken in 2022 will have a carryover benefit in the first half of 2023, which will have a modest negative impact on volumes. As discussed, total at home coffee volumes declined during 2022 and these category trends have continued in early 2023, although single serve importantly continues to outperform. Third, we see a rapidly evolving retail environment for small appliances with challenges in key mass and department and as specifically retailers impacting the availability of our brewers. We are targeting alternative channels such as e-commerce to pick up the slack. However, we believe, is reasonable to expect a modest decline in curate brewer shipments year-over-year in 2023. These factors, which will have an influence on 2023 results, in no way alter our bullish long-term outlook for the coffee category or our expected outperformance for the single serve format. Turning now to our cold beverage business, which performed very well in 2022 and enters 2023 with strong momentum. Beverage Concentrate had an exceptional year in 2022. Net sales grew 16.4% with net pricing up 14.7% and volume mix up 1.7%. Dr Pepper brand drove the performance largely reflecting the expansion of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar and a strong in-market support. Dr Pepper zero sugar retail dollars in volumes each grew in the strong double-digits during 2022, outpacing the Zero Sugar segment, reflecting net price realization, strong velocity growth and incremental distribution gains. Beverage Concentrates adjusted operating income grew 16.9%. This reflected the favorable relationship between pricing and inflation as the shared benefit of bottler pricing actions was only minimally offset by inflation given the margin structure of the business. During the year, we also benefited from the opening of our Newbridge Ireland concentrate facility, which represented a dual source of concentrate manufacturing for KDP. The new facility had a smooth and successful start-up in 2022. Looking ahead to 2023, we continue to be excited about the beverage concentrates business particularly given our strong innovation offerings, including the first quarter launch of Dr Pepper Strawberries and Cream. We expect the segment to post operating income growth in 2023 that moderates versus a strong 17% growth achieved in 2022. This reflects our expectation for a reduced benefit of pricing in response to the expected lower level of year-over-year inflation. Continuing with packaged beverages for the year, we grew net sales 12.4%, with pricing up a strong 12.1% and volume mix up 0.3%. Elasticities for the business remain modest due to the strength of our brand portfolio. This strength is most evident in our in-market performance where we gained share in categories, representing 92% of our U.S. retail sales pace, leading to expansion of our total LRB share. We are pleased with our strong ongoing in-market execution, which has enabled us to maintain the cumulative share gains achieved in CSDs, since 2019 and continue to strengthen our number two share position in premium water driven by significant growth of core hydration, polar and Vita Coco. Our partnership with Polar is a great example of our win-win partnership approach as Polar is now the number two national sparkling water brand in the grocery channel and is gaining ground in all other channels. In the juice category, Mott's continued to be a standout, driving double-digit growth in both pricing and volume for the year and gaining an impressive 3.6 share points in a category in which its primary competitor is private label. Adjusted operating income for packaged beverages grew 1.2% in 2022, as our strong net sales growth and productivity were largely offset by inflation, as well as a negative year-over-year non-operational competition. Similar to Coffee Systems, adjusted operating margin for packaged beverages compressed for the year due to the timing disconnect between inflation and pricing despite our ability to realize more pricing in core beverages than in coffee systems. Importantly, packaged beverages exited the year with strong underlying momentum. Turning to 2023. We expect a strong net sales growth for packaged beverages that moderate versus the 12% growth in 2022 as the impact from carryover and select new pricing actions is expected to be less significant than the pricing benefit realized in 2022. Net sales will also benefit from our recently announced distribution partnership for C4 energy drinks. The integration is well underway and tracking our plans. Packaged beverages has a strong innovation lineup planned for the year beginning with an active first quarter. In CSDs, the highlight will be the Q1 launch of Dr Pepper Strawberries and Cream, which has garnered a strong consumer response, achieving a 1% share of CSDs in the very early stages of the launch. In addition, we just launched CORE Hydration+, a nutrient enhanced water that offers distinct functional benefits and we are launching a new variety for our highly incremental Snapple elements line in March. We plan to increase marketing investments to support the core business and this new innovation. Packaged Beverages operating income is expected to be strong in 2023 with margin expanding, due to a better relationship between pricing and inflation and we expect the segment's underlying performance to be even stronger, driven by gross margin expansion, partially offset by marketing investments. Ending with Latin America beverages. Latin America Beverages had another outstanding year, delivering a strong and balanced net sales growth of 23% with both net pricing and volume mix up significantly. Our performance was led by Pe\u00f1afiel, which delivered a strong double-digit sales growth and continued to gain share. Clamato was also a standout with double-digit sales growth and a significant increase in market share. Adjusted operating income for the segment grew 18.5% in 2022, reflecting the strong top line growth and productivity that more than offset inflation and a significant increase in marketing investment. In 2023, we expect continued momentum in Latin America Beverages, reflecting strong commercial plans to drive incremental distribution continued a strong in-market performance and our distribution partnership with Red Bull Mexico. Turning briefly to the consolidated results for the fourth quarter which are addressed in detail in our press release. Consolidated net sales grew more than 12%, reflecting higher net pricing and a modest volume/mix decline. Growth was balanced across our portfolio, with all four segments expanding net sales at a double-digit rate in the quarter. Adjusted gross profit advanced almost 11% and gross margin contracted 80 basis points, but improved sequentially on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted operating income grew 13.2% and adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS in the quarter grew 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 to $0.50. Turning to our 2022 full-year results. Total company net sales grew 11% with growth in both net price and volume mix, reflecting the strength of our portfolio. Adjusted gross profit grew almost 8% and gross margin contracted 170 basis points, due to the timing of pricing and productivity lagging double-digit inflation. Adjusted operating income grew 4%, reflecting a double-digit growth in net sales and a year-over-year benefit from company's strategic asset investment program largely offset by the contraction in gross margin and significant inflation in transportation and warehousing costs. As a result, adjusted operating margin contracted 180 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 5% to $1.68 for the year, consistent with the guidance. Turning now to our balance sheet, cash flow generation and evolve capital allocation policy. Free cash flow conversion was exceptionally in 2022 at 111%, well ahead of our long-term target of approximately 100%. Operating cash flow totaled $2.8 billion for the year and free cash flow grew to $2.7 billion. Our strong cash flow generation is a powerful value creation tool. As Bob discussed, we evolved our capital education policy to reflect changes in the macro environment. With the interest rate increases over the past year, our hurdle rate for deploying cash has increased, and it is appealing to maintain strong liquidity and ample dry powder. As discussed during our December fireside chat, we believe it makes sense to continue to reduce our leverage over time and had established a long-term management leverage target of 2 times to 2.5 times, which compared to 2.8 times at the end of 2022. From a capital allocation perspective, in addition to internal organic growth investments, our top priority is value-enhancing M&A and strategic partnerships, along with opportunistic share repurchases to return value to shareholders and manage share creep, as well as growing our dividend within our 45% stated payout ratio target. Our focus in 2023 will be the integration and expansion of our 2022 partnerships and investments, so we currently do not expect M&A to represent a significant use of cash in the near-term. Our capital allocation action in 2022 already began to demonstrate our updated priorities. During the course of the year, we invested almost $1 billion in attractive new growth platforms, namely our 30% equity stake in Nutrabolt, the acquisition of AT peak and equity investments in athletic brewing and tractor beverages. We also continued to strengthen our DSD network with a number of territory deals to further increase our scale and effectiveness. At the same time, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through our quarterly dividend, which we increased by 6.7% in September, and the opportunistic repurchased of 10.6 million shares. I will close with our outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 constant currency net sales growth of 5% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. The later representing a year-over-year growth improvement versus 2022. Foreign currency translation is expected to approximate 0.5-point headwind to both net sales and adjusted EPS growth. Removing the impact of non-operational items, this implies significantly higher adjusted EPS growth. Included in our guidance are the following assumptions: interest expense in the range of $465 million to $470 million, reflecting the rising interest rate environment and including approximately $45 million related to financing the Nutrabolt transaction. Regarding Nutrabolt, we expect some net sales benefit from our distribution agreement for C4 as previously discussed, 2023 is expected to be a transition and investment year for the partnership, and therefore, we are not expecting any material impact on earnings this year. However, we do expect equity method income from our 30% stake in Nutrabolt to approximate $40 million to $45 million, which offsets the Nutrabolt-related interest expense. This equity method income will flow through non-operating other expense and income. The effective tax rate is estimated at approximately 22%. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $1.42 billion. From a timing standpoint, we expect EPS for the first quarter to be roughly even with a year ago, reflecting our belief that Q1 will have the highest rate of inflation, the largest marketing increase and the smallest productivity benefit of the year. Q1 will also be comping significant non-operational benefits in the year ago period. We expect EPS growth to strengthen in the balance of the year as inflation moderates and productivity benefits ramp. I will now turn it over to Bob for closing comments.\nRobert Gamgort: We formed KDP in 2018 as a pure-play beverage company focused on the North American market. In the U.S. alone, there are 1.2 trillion beverage consumption occasions in play every year. Beyond population growth, that number doesn't change much, nor do the fundamental consumer needs for beverages. What has and will continue to change is which beverage formats consumers choose to satisfy their needs and where consumers purchase their beverages. Compared to 2017, we served an additional 6 billion beverage occasions in 2022 through portfolio innovation, renovation and new partnerships. By executing our concept of a modern beverage company, which reflects our holistic view of all beverage opportunities, we've been able to better satisfy consumer needs, leading to our accelerated growth rate. We remain excited about the significant growth opportunities ahead. In 2023 and beyond, we'll continue to leverage our business model to capture even more of the trillion-plus beverage occasions each year in North America. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Chris Carey at Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning.\nRobert Gamgort: Hey, Chris.\nChris Carey: So I just want to clarify one thing than a fundamental question. So clearly, the non-operating adjustments have been a sticking point with investors. I gather from your comments on this earnings call that you're well aware of these dynamics and are making some changes going forward with specifically the guidance range, reflecting potentially the clean base. And so I just -- I kind of wanted to be crystal clear about this. The use of these non-operating contributor. And I appreciate there's an investment offset, but these will be kind of a thing of the past. And we can look at somewhat clean results going forward. Obviously, it was going to be dynamics every quarter, but these sorts of programs will be sort of sunsetted. Is that what I'm hearing? Then I have a fundamental question.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. Thanks, Chris. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've been in really an integration and transformation today, since the integration period or since the merger in 2018. That is complete, and we've moved from the integration phase to an activation phase. And so that causes us to think about how we build a company that is contemporary, as I said, with the current environment and also one that is reflective of a more mature KDP that can deliver consistent returns that are reliable by investors over time. So that's why it made sense to use some of these non-operational benefits in the past when we're in a mode of transforming, integrating. We're also delevering and investing heavily in the business. But as we look forward on here, we're making a significant step change in the use of non-operational benefits in 2023 actually beginning in 2023. And we're committed to continue moving in that direction in the future. So I think the most important thing from an investor perspective is that the $1.78 in EPS, which reflects the midpoint of our 2023 guidance is a good, reliable number that could be the focus of valuation.\nChris Carey: Okay. Very clear. Just on the expectation for gross margin expansion. I guess, I'm trying to frame that in the context of -- you gave an outlook for inflation and also, you're saying that you're going to be investing into marketing. So something like a mid-single-digit inflation. Is that sort of a COGS and SG&A is the right way to think about that inflation overall and then there'll be marketing on top of that? So that's quite a bit of increase. So I'm just trying to frame the gross margin expansion to need to offset that. So any context there would be helpful. Thanks.\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Hi, Chris, this is Sudhanshu Priyadarshi. Yes, you're right, we expect a substantial improvement in our gross margin, but it will not go back to 2019 level. But we said before, we would like to invest in marketing. So we will be reinvesting in marketing. So you will not see the flow through from gross margin to OI all the way. You will see some flow-through, but we expect that we should start investing money in our brands, and we talked during our December fire-side chat. So that's our plan. So yes, you're right, gross margins will improve. But we will reinvest in marketing, so you won't see the -- all of them flowing through to OI.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Bryan Spillane with BoA. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone.\nRobert Gamgort: Good morning, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: Bob, I guess, hey, so my question was just around Coffee Systems, and I appreciate the perspective you gave on kind of the perspective for \u201823. But can you give us a little bit of -- we're getting a lot of questions about holiday sell-through, both in terms of some of the retail disruption, but just whether consumers are making other choices about small appliances at the holidays? And maybe if you could talk a little bit about in the outlook for this year, how much of the brewer decline do you think has just been -- there's been a bit of a pull forward in the last couple of years. How much of it do you think is disruption at retail? Or how much do you think is just a function of consumers being sensitive about how they're spending their discretionary dollars.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. Good question. Let me start with something I said a number of times in the past, especially when we've had quarters where the brewer sales were up significantly, and that is -- we're not in the business of selling brewers. We're in the business of driving household penetration. And while there is a correlation between brewer sales and household penetration, there's not this direct causation that we've talked about a number of times in the past. And what I mean by that is there are three reasons consumers buy brewers. It's a new household. It's a replacement of an existing brewer or it's an upgrade. And so there's a number of factors that you can see brewers sales down, and it has no impact on household penetration, because it means that somebody has delayed an upgrade, for example. So two things to point out in 2022 versus 2021, obviously, in Q4 is we were delivering 3 million new households in 2020 and 2021. So obviously, in 2022 with 2 million households, you would expect to sell fewer brewers. The other part is we have seen a challenged retail environment, and we referred to that in our script, particularly in specialty channels in some mass customers as well. And while we're working with them to continue to drive growth of the whole category and our brewers specifically. We also think it's smart to continue to look for other opportunities to pick up that consumer demand elsewhere, where the consumer demand is moving. A lot of that, as you know, is moving towards e-commerce. Having said all of that, I think your question on consumers making other choices. The reality of it is KDP brewers or cured brewers picked up share of all coffee makers and of small appliances. So it's not a decision to buy something in place as it, but there's clearly been some pressure on small appliances in general. And some of that is the rebound effect post COVID, but some of it is also due to some retail pressure that we described in the prepared remarks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks, good morning, everyone. Bob, just to follow-up on Bryan's question, but very succinctly, as you kind of pull this together, look at household penetration, your confidence in the business, is this -- your Coffee Systems business is the expectation that this grows mid-single-digits longer term. I think that's really important, because it's a key debate for the stock. And then just my follow-up unrelatedly, just on the advertising and marketing increase. Bob, maybe just a little bit more color there on the magnitude of the increased key areas of spend, I think that would be helpful for folks as well. Thank you very much.\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. As we've talked about our long-term target for household penetration is 2 million households per year. We actually delivered slightly more than that in 2022. We did deliver significantly more than that in the previous two years. All our indications this year is the $2 million is still the right number to assume for household penetration going forward. And your question about mid-single-digits going forward, absolutely where we are. That's what we talked about in the December fireside chat. We gave you the context of the long-term trends. And also, we looked at the first half of the COVID period and then the COVID recovery period. And how there's been some shift between there. But 2 million households and mid-single-digits is still we have in view.\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Bob, I can take the -- I can take the marketing question. So as we've said, our marketing spending will increase in 2023, but our learnings and marketing returns will decide which brand and how much we spend. So we don't have a top term marketing target, we will watch our brand formal and elasticity during the year, and then we'll make the decision of which brands we invest in.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks and good morning. So we want to -- I know we want to look forward and you've talked about plans on non-operating items for next year. But I did want to talk about the gross margin performance in the fourth quarter. Because my understanding had been that the expectation was for gross margin expansion and that kind of went the other way and then we had another sale leaseback gain. So I think it's important for people just to understand what went on with gross margins this quarter when that kind of changed versus an expectation for the things to be improving already. Thanks.\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: So Lauren, this is Sudhanshu. So for Q4 specifically, we saw the pricing -- it continued to build, but still lag inflation, especially in the coffee segment. So that's the other issue. But our full-year inflation for last year was 16% that was higher-than-expected. And as Bob mentioned, during our script. So we've seen that relationship improving, but we did not see that in coffee what we were expecting in Q4. So -- but you're seeing that in relationship between pricing and inflation is improving. And that's the reason we are committed that in 2023, our gross margin will expand.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. And is that going to be a beginning in Q1 do you think? Or is it later in the year that, that starts to kick in?\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: It will be later in the year. As we said, we don't buy on part. So it takes six to nine months to see the price included, but you will see that in the second half. And I talked about that in my prepared remarks. So you will see that in the second half, you will see the improvement in gross margin more as we will see the benefit of commodity deflation -- not deflation, but moderating inflation on commodity.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. And look, we have good visibility, obviously, for the early part of the year and what commodity pricing is in the first quarter for -- from a coffee perspective, is where we see the highest inflation and then it improves from there.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brett Cooper at Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.\nBrett Cooper: Thanks. Good morning. You've talked about the underutilization of your bottling system. I was hoping to get a sense of how much of a step adding in brands like NutraBolt is to raising that utilization to your desired levels? Or is there more that needs to be done to get to where you want to be? Thanks.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. I think what we've talked about in the past is that we have a tremendous asset in our direct store -- company-owned direct store distribution system with significant opportunity to run more high-quality volume through that system. When we do that, you get to then you get the cost benefit, right, because you're leveraging that fixed cost against a higher base. And the second part of it is you improve your effectiveness, because what that allows are higher drop sizes and more frequent store visit. So the area where we've had the biggest opportunity was in C-stores. We're incredibly strong in large outlets, but our C-store business has been one where we have the most opportunity that's heavily driven by the fact that we had a gap in energy. And as you know, energy on a dollar basis is the largest segment within C-stores. So C4 is a significant step in that direction. And it allows us to really increase our scale in the C-store area, which has the benefits I described earlier. And we feel like we're just getting started on that. That business has a tremendous trajectory for growth. And as we talked about before, we feel like we're not done yet in that space or some of the other areas where we have white space in our portfolio. So much more to come there, much more opportunity in front of us.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your pod volumes, which were a bit weaker than, I guess, expected in the quarter and did decelerate on a three-year stack basis for the full-year. So I guess I wanted to better understand how you're thinking about this? And then your attach rates which are also declining. And I know you touched on this, but just more color there would be helpful. Just here -- I'd love to hear more about the changes you've seen in consumer behavior, sort of, within the home and then ultimately, why you have the confidence that essentially attach rates might actually improve or accelerate this year? Thank you.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. Bonnie, what I think is most interesting is if we just take a step back and say, let's look at at-home coffee in total. So we're a leader within at-home coffee, but we participate in this bigger category. I think what's most noteworthy in 2022, is there was a volume decline in all forms of at-home coffee globally, and single-serve actually grew its share of coffee consumption in the U.S. So from our perspective, on a relative basis, single-serve continues to outperform within at-home coffee. But at-home coffee volume decline was about 6% for the year. That's pretty notable. Our biggest -- our belief is that the biggest driver of that is consumer mobility. If you look at the first part of COVID, as we talked about in December, you would see acceleration in attach rates. If you looked at it in the recovery period from COVID, you see a deceleration in attach rates. And what happened, especially in the second half of 2022 is that there was this global slowdown in volume of coffee that's driven, we believe, primarily by mobility, but on a secondary basis, it'd be driven by some elasticity, because there was significant pricing in there. Why do we have confidence in this is because the Keurig System continues to outperform year in and year out within at-home coffee. None of us believe that at-home coffee is a long-term problem. In fact, it has significant tailwinds. This is just an adjustment as people are spending less time at home, more time out of home. We know that the number one driver of at-home coffee consumption is time spent at home. And it's as straightforward as that, and we expect to see the recovery in the category of at-home coffee to occur as mobility improves throughout the year.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, guys. On the pricing front, can you talk about how much of your pricing plan for 2023 is carryover pricing from 2022? And how much is new pricing? And then in terms of the new pricing where it's concentrated is it mainly on the beverage side or on the cost side? Are you planning for price increases there as well? Thank you.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. The great majority of the pricing that shows up in our 2023 P&L is carryover from 2022, and I'll remind you that we took extensive price actions in 2022, and they did not flow through to the P&L all the way through in \u201822. So that's happening. We did take some additional pricing actions in the early part of \u201823 on our packaged beverage business to close some of the remaining margin gaps. So that will flow through as we move into the remainder of 2023, but that's all that we have planned right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks.\nMaria Sceppaguercio: Hi, everyone. This is Maria. We are around today to take your questions. We'd love to connect with you afterwards if you have any. Feel free to call as usual. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you, ma'am. This concludes today's conference call. And we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. In 2022, we continue to advance our vision of a modern beverage company by expanding our portfolio to reach more beverage consumers, needs and occasions and by enhancing our unique selling and after-market capabilities to make our brands available at every point of sale. Our full-year financial results were in line with or above our guidance with revenue growing by 11% and adjusted diluted EPS expanding by 5%. Since our Q3 earnings call, we had the opportunity to engage with many of you twice. First, at our early December in- person event, where you met the KDP Management Team and Board of Directors, and again, on our mid -December fireside chat, during which we discussed our investment in Nutrabolt, including the distribution agreement for C4 and answer questions regarding recent trends in the categories in which we compete. Those conversations provided us with a good sense of what's top of mind with our investors, which we will build upon during today's call. I'll start by providing perspective on the macro and category environments we faced in 2022, discuss how we created shareholder value over the past year and offer thoughts on how we see 2023 shaping up both in terms of the macro environment and our strategy to continue winning. Sudhanshu will follow me with specifics on our Q4 and full-year 2022 results, provide more detailed guidance on key metrics for 2023, and discuss the evolution of our capital allocation policy. While it seems like a long time ago, we started 2022 with the lingering effects of supply chain disruption, primarily driven by a final COVID wave that reduced labor availability in late 2021 and early 2022. We felt that impact most acutely in our coffee business where strong 2021 consumer demand had depleted our inventories and in our still beverage portfolio where we faced a range of supply shortages. We implemented supply recovery programs that yielded strong customer service improvements with replenished inventory levels. By Q2, our concerns around COVID and supply chain disruptions were quickly supplanted by industry inflation in ingredients and materials, labor, and transportation. That was outpacing significant pricing. Velocity held up well in the categories in which we compete, which enabled strong revenue growth, driven by both the higher pricing and increased volume, but came at lower margins. Store perspective, we faced total cost inflation in 2022 of 16% far above our expectations going into the year. And we implemented pricing actions across our portfolio that averaged in the low double-digits. Pricing realization was strong and accelerated throughout the year. Yet it consistently lagged the timing of the escalating inflationary impact on our P&L. As we approach the end of the year and enter 2023, we became more focused on the potential impact a recession on our consumers, despite seeing minimal evidence of changing behavior to-date. We are monitoring consumer behavior closely and are taking proactive steps to ensure our brand strength continues into 2023 and beyond. Of course, the wide range of challenges of 2022 is a continuation of the rolling set of obstacles we have navigated since the onset of COVID in 2020. In this context, we have discussed the benefits of our all-weather business model. This is more than a punchy sound bite; it reflects our ability to manage our broad portfolio in unique routes to market to deliver strong and consistent shareholder returns in an unpredictable and changing environment as we did in 2022 and every year since forming KDP in 2018. In addition to delivering our ambitious financial commitments over the past five years, we've also been immersed in an integration and transformation process that created a modern beverage company that today can consistently deliver attractive, high quality, dependable returns with a well-capitalized balance sheet. Toward that end, we have evolved our capital allocation policy to reflect that of a more mature KDP and to be contemporary with a changing macro environment marked by rising interest rates. During the integration and transformation stage, we had a strong focus on rapid deleveraging. Using all available levers available to us, while still investing in building our capabilities and brands. We took advantage of compelling opportunities to monetize non-strategic assets through sale leaseback transactions, which enabled us to simultaneously invest, delever and drive strong returns for our shareholders. As we shift from integration and transformation to activation, we are planning for a step change reduction in the use of non-operational benefits starting this year. That means our underlying operational growth will exceed our adjusted growth in 2023. Of course, our guidance will continue to be for adjusted metrics and we will report results on the same basis we've always done. But we will also highlight operational performance from time-to-time to provide you with a better sense of the underlying strength of our business. Strong cash flow remains a hallmark of KDP. As we discussed in December, we plan to deploy our cash to improve our long-term targeted leverage ratio to 2.5 times or below. While still funding strategic growth projects, and attractive return of cash to shareholders. With the learnings from 2022 in mind, I'll shift to a discussion of our 2023 outlook. Starting with the most pressing industry topic from last year, inflation. Our plan assumes the rate of inflation will moderate to the mid-single-digit range, that translates to a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 30% over the past three years clearly unprecedented in our lifetime. Regarding the inflation outlook for 2023, recent spot price declines of key inputs might lead some to believe this could be industry deflation. The reality is we don't buy on a spot basis and the underlying commodity cost doesn't reflect the total delivered cost to us. Such is certainly the case in coffee where seed prices dropped in late 2022. However, the differential, which includes everything in our fully landed coffee costs, such as broker fees, sea freight and premium coffee up charges was up meaningfully. Labor is another area in which we're continuing to see persistent inflation. To offset the continued impact of inflation, we have upped our game in productivity, reduced our discretionary costs and increased pricing. The realization of 2022 pricing actions will continue to flow into our P&L during 2023. And in some areas, where continued inflation impacts are not yet fully covered by pricing. We've implemented additional revenue growth management actions to address key margin gaps. The combination of moderating inflation and continued pricing realization means that we expect year-over-year improvement in gross margin in 2023, but not yet returning to 2019 levels. With higher gross margins in view for 2023, the conversation shift the demand. A key focus point for us in 2023 is the financial health of American consumers and its impact on price elasticity for the categories in which we compete. Therefore, we believe it's prudent to expect that lower, but still positive of year-over-year pricing realization combined with modest elasticities will yield KDP net revenue growth of approximately 5% in 2023. It's also important to be proactive in ensuring the continued strength of our brands by increasing our investment in growth in 2023. As we are all aware, industry marketing budgets were reduced during COVID and many haven't yet been fully restored. While we have learned to be significantly more efficient with our brand spending, 2023 is the right time to increase our absolute investment behind key segments and brands, as well as the support a strong lineup of innovation. The improvement in our gross margin combined with 5% revenue growth will enable us to deliver year-over-year improvement in operating income growth. Even with our increased brand investments and the headwind of comping significant non-operational benefits in 2022. Taking all of the macro and company specific factors discussed this morning into account, we expect adjusted EPS for 2023 to grow by 6% to 7%. Removing the impact of previously disclosed non-operational items from 2022 implies adjusted EPS growth that is toward the high end of our long-term algorithm. Our expectation for continued strong value creation in 2023 is rooted in the success of our unique and flexible business strategy over the past five years. In cold beverage, our focus is on driving growth. First in core brands through marketing, brand renovation and continued strong end market execution. In 2022, we continue to build upon or hold the significant share gains we achieved over the past few years in total liquid refreshment beverages and key segments such as CSDs and premium water. Second, by filling white space in our portfolio through innovation and partnerships such as our strategic relationship with Nutrabolt for C4 Energy and our Red Bull agreement in Mexico, as well as our expansion into new platforms such as non0alcohol beer with our investment in athletic brewing and better for you drinks in foodservice through our partnership with Tractor Beverage. Third, by enhancing the effectiveness of our omnichannel selling and distribution system, including e-commerce, where we are one of the food and beverage leaders, and our company owned direct store distribution system. Over the past several years, we have built a stronger direct to market -- direct route to market capability through investment in capabilities and tools and acquiring key DSD distributor territories, all of which have driven consistently strong market share performance across our brands and segments. In coffee systems, we are focused on growth. First, by driving household penetration growth for the Keurig system every year. Given the large number of remaining addressable households, we have line of sight to continued household growth well into the future. As we enter 2023, we have built the U.S. installed base of 38 million households, which along with our installed base in Canada consumed more than 13 billion cups of coffee manufactured by KDP annually. Second, by expanding the roster of coffee partners in the Keurig system. 2022, we welcomed back community coffee and added new brands such as BLK & Bold, the first black-owned nationally distributed coffee brand and Intelligentsia, one of specialty coffee's most pioneering and innovative brands. Third, by creating new platforms to drive incremental revenue and profit growth from existing Keurig households such as connected brewers and new beverage formats and occasions. In 2022, we expanded our lineup of connected brewers with the introduction of K -Cafe\u0301 Smart, which has received outstanding consumer and professional reviews, expanded the Keurig app, which works with both connected and non-connected brewers to help consumers make barista quality specialty coffee beverages at home and expanded availability of our Keurig's Slim + ICED brewer and expanded our brew over iced pods. In 2023, iced will be a significant focus area procuring with expanded K-Ice machines and pods supported by dedicated marketing and focused retailer support. And finally, KDP's extraordinary free cash flow enables the potential for incremental shareholder returns through strategic capital allocation including M&A and partnerships, opportunistic share repurchases and growing our dividend within our stated payout ratio of 45% of free cash flow. With that as important context, I'll hand it over to Sudhanshu to discuss 2022 results and our 2023 outlook in more depth. We formed KDP in 2018 as a pure-play beverage company focused on the North American market. In the U.S. alone, there are 1.2 trillion beverage consumption occasions in play every year. Beyond population growth, that number doesn't change much, nor do the fundamental consumer needs for beverages. What has and will continue to change is which beverage formats consumers choose to satisfy their needs and where consumers purchase their beverages. Compared to 2017, we served an additional 6 billion beverage occasions in 2022 through portfolio innovation, renovation and new partnerships. By executing our concept of a modern beverage company, which reflects our holistic view of all beverage opportunities, we've been able to better satisfy consumer needs, leading to our accelerated growth rate. We remain excited about the significant growth opportunities ahead. In 2023 and beyond, we'll continue to leverage our business model to capture even more of the trillion-plus beverage occasions each year in North America. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Hey, Chris. Yes. Thanks, Chris. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've been in really an integration and transformation today, since the integration period or since the merger in 2018. That is complete, and we've moved from the integration phase to an activation phase. And so that causes us to think about how we build a company that is contemporary, as I said, with the current environment and also one that is reflective of a more mature KDP that can deliver consistent returns that are reliable by investors over time. So that's why it made sense to use some of these non-operational benefits in the past when we're in a mode of transforming, integrating. We're also delevering and investing heavily in the business. But as we look forward on here, we're making a significant step change in the use of non-operational benefits in 2023 actually beginning in 2023. And we're committed to continue moving in that direction in the future. So I think the most important thing from an investor perspective is that the $1.78 in EPS, which reflects the midpoint of our 2023 guidance is a good, reliable number that could be the focus of valuation. Good morning, Bryan. Yes. Good question. Let me start with something I said a number of times in the past, especially when we've had quarters where the brewer sales were up significantly, and that is -- we're not in the business of selling brewers. We're in the business of driving household penetration. And while there is a correlation between brewer sales and household penetration, there's not this direct causation that we've talked about a number of times in the past. And what I mean by that is there are three reasons consumers buy brewers. It's a new household. It's a replacement of an existing brewer or it's an upgrade. And so there's a number of factors that you can see brewers sales down, and it has no impact on household penetration, because it means that somebody has delayed an upgrade, for example. So two things to point out in 2022 versus 2021, obviously, in Q4 is we were delivering 3 million new households in 2020 and 2021. So obviously, in 2022 with 2 million households, you would expect to sell fewer brewers. The other part is we have seen a challenged retail environment, and we referred to that in our script, particularly in specialty channels in some mass customers as well. And while we're working with them to continue to drive growth of the whole category and our brewers specifically. We also think it's smart to continue to look for other opportunities to pick up that consumer demand elsewhere, where the consumer demand is moving. A lot of that, as you know, is moving towards e-commerce. Having said all of that, I think your question on consumers making other choices. The reality of it is KDP brewers or cured brewers picked up share of all coffee makers and of small appliances. So it's not a decision to buy something in place as it, but there's clearly been some pressure on small appliances in general. And some of that is the rebound effect post COVID, but some of it is also due to some retail pressure that we described in the prepared remarks. Sure. As we've talked about our long-term target for household penetration is 2 million households per year. We actually delivered slightly more than that in 2022. We did deliver significantly more than that in the previous two years. All our indications this year is the $2 million is still the right number to assume for household penetration going forward. And your question about mid-single-digits going forward, absolutely where we are. That's what we talked about in the December fireside chat. We gave you the context of the long-term trends. And also, we looked at the first half of the COVID period and then the COVID recovery period. And how there's been some shift between there. But 2 million households and mid-single-digits is still we have in view. Yes. And look, we have good visibility, obviously, for the early part of the year and what commodity pricing is in the first quarter for -- from a coffee perspective, is where we see the highest inflation and then it improves from there. Yes. I think what we've talked about in the past is that we have a tremendous asset in our direct store -- company-owned direct store distribution system with significant opportunity to run more high-quality volume through that system. When we do that, you get to then you get the cost benefit, right, because you're leveraging that fixed cost against a higher base. And the second part of it is you improve your effectiveness, because what that allows are higher drop sizes and more frequent store visit. So the area where we've had the biggest opportunity was in C-stores. We're incredibly strong in large outlets, but our C-store business has been one where we have the most opportunity that's heavily driven by the fact that we had a gap in energy. And as you know, energy on a dollar basis is the largest segment within C-stores. So C4 is a significant step in that direction. And it allows us to really increase our scale in the C-store area, which has the benefits I described earlier. And we feel like we're just getting started on that. That business has a tremendous trajectory for growth. And as we talked about before, we feel like we're not done yet in that space or some of the other areas where we have white space in our portfolio. So much more to come there, much more opportunity in front of us. Yes. Bonnie, what I think is most interesting is if we just take a step back and say, let's look at at-home coffee in total. So we're a leader within at-home coffee, but we participate in this bigger category. I think what's most noteworthy in 2022, is there was a volume decline in all forms of at-home coffee globally, and single-serve actually grew its share of coffee consumption in the U.S. So from our perspective, on a relative basis, single-serve continues to outperform within at-home coffee. But at-home coffee volume decline was about 6% for the year. That's pretty notable. Our biggest -- our belief is that the biggest driver of that is consumer mobility. If you look at the first part of COVID, as we talked about in December, you would see acceleration in attach rates. If you looked at it in the recovery period from COVID, you see a deceleration in attach rates. And what happened, especially in the second half of 2022 is that there was this global slowdown in volume of coffee that's driven, we believe, primarily by mobility, but on a secondary basis, it'd be driven by some elasticity, because there was significant pricing in there. Why do we have confidence in this is because the Keurig System continues to outperform year in and year out within at-home coffee. None of us believe that at-home coffee is a long-term problem. In fact, it has significant tailwinds. This is just an adjustment as people are spending less time at home, more time out of home. We know that the number one driver of at-home coffee consumption is time spent at home. And it's as straightforward as that, and we expect to see the recovery in the category of at-home coffee to occur as mobility improves throughout the year. Yes. The great majority of the pricing that shows up in our 2023 P&L is carryover from 2022, and I'll remind you that we took extensive price actions in 2022, and they did not flow through to the P&L all the way through in \u201822. So that's happening. We did take some additional pricing actions in the early part of \u201823 on our packaged beverage business to close some of the remaining margin gaps. So that will flow through as we move into the remainder of 2023, but that's all that we have planned right now."

            "name": "Sudhanshu Priyadarshi",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I joined the company three months ago, because I believed KDP represented a unique investment and value creating opportunity and my conviction has grown significantly as I've targeted to understand the business better. This conviction will be reflected in my perspective on our 2022 results, the important learnings as we look back on the year and the implications for 2023. Starting with coffee systems, before jumping into specific numbers, I'd like to share my perspective on the coffee category. Coffee is an attractive long-term growth category. KDP operates primarily in the at home coffee segment in the U.S. and Canada where we are the industry leader. The at home segment comprises the vast majority of all coffee drinking occasions and single serve is the clear winner, consistently growing share of at home occasions. There has been significant noise between 2019 and 2022 in both the at home and away from home coffee categories, primarily due to shifting consumer mobility and we acknowledge that it has been a challenge for investors to separate the signal from that noise. After significant at home coffee volume growth in 2020 and 2021, due to increased consumer time spent at home, we began to see a deceleration in 2022. This occurred globally in all forms of at home coffee, which is quite unprecedented. There are several factors at play causing this concurrent decline. We believe the primary contributors are a reduction in time spent at home for consumers, which we know correlates with coffee consumption as the elasticity impact of significant pricing actions taken in 2022. Specific to the U.S. consistent with the global trends, volume for the total at home coffee category decreased 6% in IRI with all major forms declining, including bags, cans and single serve. However, single serve coffee outperformed, enabling it to gain share of total at home coffee consumption. KDP's owned and licensed brands demonstrated selective strength in 2022, despite having among the highest price increases in the single sub-segment. With the fourth quarter, representing its highest share position since before COVID. Driving its strength by the strong innovation that originated with consumers and reinstated promotions in the second half as parts supply was restored. We saw a similar trend at play in coffee brewers in the U.S., where smaller plants volume were challenged in 2022 comping against growth in 2020 and 2021 that was primarily fueled by time at home, as well as in part by stimulus checks. Although not immune from this dynamic, curate compatible brewers also gain a share of all coffee makers in 2022. Moving to the financials. For the year, the segment grew net sales 6.2% with pricing up 7% and volume mix down 0.8%. Product revenue also advanced 6.2%, reflecting the benefit of pricing and a 1.4% increase in volume. Brewer volume declined 5.2% in 2022 comping the double-digit growth we have experienced each year since the onset of COVID. As you know, our goal is not brewer sales, but rather household penetration and we added more than 2 million new households to the Keurig system in 2022 modestly above our long-term annual target. Innovation is a key driver of household penetration and we are pleased with the performance of our 2022 brewer innovation slate and excited about what's coming in 2023. While top line growth in profit systems was solid, the challenge in 2022 was operating income which declined 7.5% as inflation exceeded, net realized pricing compressing margins. We expect an improvement in the relationship between inflation and pricing going forward, leading to a year-over-year improvement in gross margin in 2023. But specifically, our 2023 outlook projects KDP coffee systems to deliver 3% to 4% net sales growth and 5% to 7% operating income growth. Removing the impact of non-operational items in 2022, this implies higher coffee systems operating income growth in 2023. We expect a strong recovery in margins, reflecting the strength of KDP's owned and licensed brands and a favorable relationship between pricing and inflation, particularly in the second half of the year, which will be significantly stronger than the first half. While the Keurig system is unique, its scale of $5 billion in net sales and OI margins above 30% are consistent with a best-in -class CPG business. While we continue to manage the business to drive household growth and extract incremental value from our existing installed base, I think it makes sense to access coffee systems using the same conventional metrics as you would any other CPG business. That translates into net sales and operating income performance, the outlook for which we are sharing with you today for the year ahead. Our 2023 outlook reflects the following factors that we believe are most relevant to consider. First, while mobility has recovered significantly from 2020 lows, it still remains below pre-COVID levels and we expect its continued recovery in 2023 to represent a headwind for at home coffee consumption especially in the past half. Second, the industry's pricing actions taken in 2022 will have a carryover benefit in the first half of 2023, which will have a modest negative impact on volumes. As discussed, total at home coffee volumes declined during 2022 and these category trends have continued in early 2023, although single serve importantly continues to outperform. Third, we see a rapidly evolving retail environment for small appliances with challenges in key mass and department and as specifically retailers impacting the availability of our brewers. We are targeting alternative channels such as e-commerce to pick up the slack. However, we believe, is reasonable to expect a modest decline in curate brewer shipments year-over-year in 2023. These factors, which will have an influence on 2023 results, in no way alter our bullish long-term outlook for the coffee category or our expected outperformance for the single serve format. Turning now to our cold beverage business, which performed very well in 2022 and enters 2023 with strong momentum. Beverage Concentrate had an exceptional year in 2022. Net sales grew 16.4% with net pricing up 14.7% and volume mix up 1.7%. Dr Pepper brand drove the performance largely reflecting the expansion of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar and a strong in-market support. Dr Pepper zero sugar retail dollars in volumes each grew in the strong double-digits during 2022, outpacing the Zero Sugar segment, reflecting net price realization, strong velocity growth and incremental distribution gains. Beverage Concentrates adjusted operating income grew 16.9%. This reflected the favorable relationship between pricing and inflation as the shared benefit of bottler pricing actions was only minimally offset by inflation given the margin structure of the business. During the year, we also benefited from the opening of our Newbridge Ireland concentrate facility, which represented a dual source of concentrate manufacturing for KDP. The new facility had a smooth and successful start-up in 2022. Looking ahead to 2023, we continue to be excited about the beverage concentrates business particularly given our strong innovation offerings, including the first quarter launch of Dr Pepper Strawberries and Cream. We expect the segment to post operating income growth in 2023 that moderates versus a strong 17% growth achieved in 2022. This reflects our expectation for a reduced benefit of pricing in response to the expected lower level of year-over-year inflation. Continuing with packaged beverages for the year, we grew net sales 12.4%, with pricing up a strong 12.1% and volume mix up 0.3%. Elasticities for the business remain modest due to the strength of our brand portfolio. This strength is most evident in our in-market performance where we gained share in categories, representing 92% of our U.S. retail sales pace, leading to expansion of our total LRB share. We are pleased with our strong ongoing in-market execution, which has enabled us to maintain the cumulative share gains achieved in CSDs, since 2019 and continue to strengthen our number two share position in premium water driven by significant growth of core hydration, polar and Vita Coco. Our partnership with Polar is a great example of our win-win partnership approach as Polar is now the number two national sparkling water brand in the grocery channel and is gaining ground in all other channels. In the juice category, Mott's continued to be a standout, driving double-digit growth in both pricing and volume for the year and gaining an impressive 3.6 share points in a category in which its primary competitor is private label. Adjusted operating income for packaged beverages grew 1.2% in 2022, as our strong net sales growth and productivity were largely offset by inflation, as well as a negative year-over-year non-operational competition. Similar to Coffee Systems, adjusted operating margin for packaged beverages compressed for the year due to the timing disconnect between inflation and pricing despite our ability to realize more pricing in core beverages than in coffee systems. Importantly, packaged beverages exited the year with strong underlying momentum. Turning to 2023. We expect a strong net sales growth for packaged beverages that moderate versus the 12% growth in 2022 as the impact from carryover and select new pricing actions is expected to be less significant than the pricing benefit realized in 2022. Net sales will also benefit from our recently announced distribution partnership for C4 energy drinks. The integration is well underway and tracking our plans. Packaged beverages has a strong innovation lineup planned for the year beginning with an active first quarter. In CSDs, the highlight will be the Q1 launch of Dr Pepper Strawberries and Cream, which has garnered a strong consumer response, achieving a 1% share of CSDs in the very early stages of the launch. In addition, we just launched CORE Hydration+, a nutrient enhanced water that offers distinct functional benefits and we are launching a new variety for our highly incremental Snapple elements line in March. We plan to increase marketing investments to support the core business and this new innovation. Packaged Beverages operating income is expected to be strong in 2023 with margin expanding, due to a better relationship between pricing and inflation and we expect the segment's underlying performance to be even stronger, driven by gross margin expansion, partially offset by marketing investments. Ending with Latin America beverages. Latin America Beverages had another outstanding year, delivering a strong and balanced net sales growth of 23% with both net pricing and volume mix up significantly. Our performance was led by Pen\u0303afiel, which delivered a strong double-digit sales growth and continued to gain share. Clamato was also a standout with double-digit sales growth and a significant increase in market share. Adjusted operating income for the segment grew 18.5% in 2022, reflecting the strong top line growth and productivity that more than offset inflation and a significant increase in marketing investment. In 2023, we expect continued momentum in Latin America Beverages, reflecting strong commercial plans to drive incremental distribution continued a strong in-market performance and our distribution partnership with Red Bull Mexico. Turning briefly to the consolidated results for the fourth quarter which are addressed in detail in our press release. Consolidated net sales grew more than 12%, reflecting higher net pricing and a modest volume/mix decline. Growth was balanced across our portfolio, with all four segments expanding net sales at a double-digit rate in the quarter. Adjusted gross profit advanced almost 11% and gross margin contracted 80 basis points, but improved sequentially on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted operating income grew 13.2% and adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS in the quarter grew 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 to $0.50. Turning to our 2022 full-year results. Total company net sales grew 11% with growth in both net price and volume mix, reflecting the strength of our portfolio. Adjusted gross profit grew almost 8% and gross margin contracted 170 basis points, due to the timing of pricing and productivity lagging double-digit inflation. Adjusted operating income grew 4%, reflecting a double-digit growth in net sales and a year-over-year benefit from company's strategic asset investment program largely offset by the contraction in gross margin and significant inflation in transportation and warehousing costs. As a result, adjusted operating margin contracted 180 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 5% to $1.68 for the year, consistent with the guidance. Turning now to our balance sheet, cash flow generation and evolve capital allocation policy. Free cash flow conversion was exceptionally in 2022 at 111%, well ahead of our long-term target of approximately 100%. Operating cash flow totaled $2.8 billion for the year and free cash flow grew to $2.7 billion. Our strong cash flow generation is a powerful value creation tool. As Bob discussed, we evolved our capital education policy to reflect changes in the macro environment. With the interest rate increases over the past year, our hurdle rate for deploying cash has increased, and it is appealing to maintain strong liquidity and ample dry powder. As discussed during our December fireside chat, we believe it makes sense to continue to reduce our leverage over time and had established a long-term management leverage target of 2 times to 2.5 times, which compared to 2.8 times at the end of 2022. From a capital allocation perspective, in addition to internal organic growth investments, our top priority is value-enhancing M&A and strategic partnerships, along with opportunistic share repurchases to return value to shareholders and manage share creep, as well as growing our dividend within our 45% stated payout ratio target. Our focus in 2023 will be the integration and expansion of our 2022 partnerships and investments, so we currently do not expect M&A to represent a significant use of cash in the near-term. Our capital allocation action in 2022 already began to demonstrate our updated priorities. During the course of the year, we invested almost $1 billion in attractive new growth platforms, namely our 30% equity stake in Nutrabolt, the acquisition of AT peak and equity investments in athletic brewing and tractor beverages. We also continued to strengthen our DSD network with a number of territory deals to further increase our scale and effectiveness. At the same time, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through our quarterly dividend, which we increased by 6.7% in September, and the opportunistic repurchased of 10.6 million shares. I will close with our outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 constant currency net sales growth of 5% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. The later representing a year-over-year growth improvement versus 2022. Foreign currency translation is expected to approximate 0.5-point headwind to both net sales and adjusted EPS growth. Removing the impact of non-operational items, this implies significantly higher adjusted EPS growth. Included in our guidance are the following assumptions: interest expense in the range of $465 million to $470 million, reflecting the rising interest rate environment and including approximately $45 million related to financing the Nutrabolt transaction. Regarding Nutrabolt, we expect some net sales benefit from our distribution agreement for C4 as previously discussed, 2023 is expected to be a transition and investment year for the partnership, and therefore, we are not expecting any material impact on earnings this year. However, we do expect equity method income from our 30% stake in Nutrabolt to approximate $40 million to $45 million, which offsets the Nutrabolt-related interest expense. This equity method income will flow through non-operating other expense and income. The effective tax rate is estimated at approximately 22%. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $1.42 billion. From a timing standpoint, we expect EPS for the first quarter to be roughly even with a year ago, reflecting our belief that Q1 will have the highest rate of inflation, the largest marketing increase and the smallest productivity benefit of the year. Q1 will also be comping significant non-operational benefits in the year ago period. We expect EPS growth to strengthen in the balance of the year as inflation moderates and productivity benefits ramp. I will now turn it over to Bob for closing comments. Hi, Chris, this is Sudhanshu Priyadarshi. Yes, you're right, we expect a substantial improvement in our gross margin, but it will not go back to 2019 level. But we said before, we would like to invest in marketing. So we will be reinvesting in marketing. So you will not see the flow through from gross margin to OI all the way. You will see some flow-through, but we expect that we should start investing money in our brands, and we talked during our December fire-side chat. So that's our plan. So yes, you're right, gross margins will improve. But we will reinvest in marketing, so you won't see the -- all of them flowing through to OI. Bob, I can take the -- I can take the marketing question. So as we've said, our marketing spending will increase in 2023, but our learnings and marketing returns will decide which brand and how much we spend. So we don't have a top term marketing target, we will watch our brand formal and elasticity during the year, and then we'll make the decision of which brands we invest in. So Lauren, this is Sudhanshu. So for Q4 specifically, we saw the pricing -- it continued to build, but still lag inflation, especially in the coffee segment. So that's the other issue. But our full-year inflation for last year was 16% that was higher-than-expected. And as Bob mentioned, during our script. So we've seen that relationship improving, but we did not see that in coffee what we were expecting in Q4. So -- but you're seeing that in relationship between pricing and inflation is improving. And that's the reason we are committed that in 2023, our gross margin will expand. It will be later in the year. As we said, we don't buy on part. So it takes six to nine months to see the price included, but you will see that in the second half. And I talked about that in my prepared remarks. So you will see that in the second half, you will see the improvement in gross margin more as we will see the benefit of commodity deflation -- not deflation, but moderating inflation on commodity."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Earnings Call for the Third Quarter of 2022. This conference call is being recorded and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call.  I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Steve Alexander. Mr. Alexander, please go ahead.\nSteve Alexander: Thank you. And hello everyone! Thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning we issued our press release for the third quarter of 2022. If you need a copy you can get one on our website in the Investors Section. Consistent with previous quarters, today we\u2019ll be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis which excludes items affecting comparability and presents growth rate on a constant currency basis. The company believes the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which would fall later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company\u2019s control, we do not reconcile our guidance. Here with us today to discuss our results are KDP CEO, Ozan Dokmecioglu, our Interim CFO George Lagoudakis. Also joining us for Q&A, our KDP Executive Chairman Bob Gamgort. And our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Maria Sceppaguercio. And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ozan.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Giving that this is my first earnings call as CEO, I would like to start today\u2019s discussion with my thoughts on the KDP operating model, and a strategic approach that makes us unique in the CPG space. Our focus continues to be on managing our business for a range of potential macro outcomes, and leveraging the all weather business model we have created to drive success. Regardless of the environment, we may face. Our results this quarter, and the consistency of our performance since merger are a testament to the strength of this model, which has continued to perform well in the highly volatile macro environment our industry has faced since the onset of COVID. And, most recently, our portfolio has performed well with significant levels of inflation, and pricing, along with a challenge consumer landscape, demonstrating its recession resistance. With elasticity impacts remaining modest, and our market share positions remaining strong. Our business model starts with an attractive and competitive organic total shareholder return algorithm, which is driven by a flexible and scalable strategy. In cold beverages our strategy is focused on driving growth. In core brands, through marketing, brand renovation and in market execution by filling whitespace in our portfolio through innovation, and partnerships, such as our Polar Seltzer partnership, and the recently announced Red Bull selling and distribution agreement in Mexico, which we will touch on a bit later. And by enhancing the breadth, depth and effectiveness of our omni-channel selling and distribution system, including our company owned direct store distribution system. The investments we have made in selling and distribution over the past several years have built a stronger go to market capability that has driven consistently strong market share performance across all the brands and beverage segments. In coffee systems, we are focused on driving household penetration growth for the Keurig system at the rate of approximately 2 million new households every year. Given the number of remaining addressable new households for the Keurig system, which we estimate at more than 50 million. We have line of sight to household growth well beyond the next 10 years and consumer mobility continued to increase. KDPs, LRB dollar consumption increased more than 11% in the quarter. Growing LRB share in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, reflecting the benefit of pricing that was only modestly offset by volume, which remained quite resilient, with elasticities below the category in both periods. We continue to benefit from healthy categories as strong portfolio of leading brands, and very effective in market execution. The strong performance in the quarter was broad based and led by share gains in premium waters and seltzers, teas, apple juice and fruit drinks. In carbonated soft drinks our performance also continued to be strong, with dollar consumption up 12% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods with our share up year-to-date. We are pleased that we continue to expand on the impressive share gains we generated over the past couple of years. Within carbonated soft drinks our zero sugar innovation continues to perform well. With modulus elasticity impacts, and stronger velocities, then the overall zero sugar and diet category. In premium water, core hydration group dollar consumption 35% in the corner, driving almost two full points of share growth. Snapple led by the success of our Snapple brand refresh, and Snapple elements drove dollar consumption growth of 15% and share growth of almost one full point in the quarter. And in seltzers our partnership with Polar that continues to drive growth for the brand with ACV increasing six points and share gains of two points. Moving to coffee. Before discussing category dynamics, let me quickly share some context on our business and the performance improvements that are now beginning to materialize. You will recall that the combination of consistently strong consumer demand and supply constraints led to a port shortage starting in late 2021. Consequently, we fall back on our demand investment, as did most of our partners and lounge, the coffee supply chain recovery program to increase port output and rebuild finished goods inventories for all parties in the Keurig ecosystem. We completed the program last quarter and have now restored inventories across the ecosystem which enables us along with our partners and customers to resume investments in demand generating programs to drive category growth. As a result, the single server port category continues to recover from supply constraints. We store our consumption up 6% in the quarter, advancing to 7% in September, and off to a good start in quarter 4. There has been considerable noise in the broader at home coffee category numbers well beyond single serve coffee that is worth discussing further. A combination of increased consumer mobility, retail price actions, and the reduction in advertising and promotion spent the latter related to the single service supply challenges negatively impacted at home coffee category demand over the summer. Our analysis suggests that consumer mobility had the outsized impact with mobility returning to more normal patterns once the school year started, we are seeing sequential improvement in at home coffee demand. Importantly, single serve coffee outperformed all other forms of at home coffee during quarter 3. Further away from home coffee category while still down significantly versus pre-COVID levels continues to improve with further runway as returned to office behavior builds. Looking specifically to KDP coffee performance, KDP manufacture port consumption was up 4% on dollar basis in the third quarter, with owned and licensed brand consumption growing by 5%. As the McCaf\u00e9 donut shop and Green Mountain brands posted the strong growth. Performance is ranked during the quarter with year-over-year dollar and volume share advancing sequentially in September versus July and August and continuing to improve into the fourth quarter. KDP continues to maintain its strong leadership position in the category with market share for KDP manufacture ports at approximately 82%. Moving forward, we expect mix to shift for KDP manufactured ports from private label to branded as community coffee comes on board beginning late this year. Turning to brewers. Today, we are confirming that we are on track to add 2 million new households into the Keurig system in 2022, which is consistent with our long term algorithm. As discussed many times, we expect the elevated rate of 3 million new households that we attracted in 2020 and 2021 to normalize post-COVID and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in 2022. Of course, we don\u2019t need to sell as many brewers to support 2 million new households as we did to support 3 million, which explains the 15% decline in brewer shipments in the third quarter. Remember, we are in the household penetration business, not to brewer sales business as the last the break even on brewer sales and generate nearly all of our profits from attracting new consumers into the Keurig ecosystem. Taking a longer term perspective further brewer sales were a healthy 16% above 2019 and on a year-to-date basis brewer shipments are up more than 30% versus the first three quarters of 2019. In addition, single serve brewers continue to hold the number one position in the at home brewers segment and KDP continues to grow share driven by strong innovation across all consumer price points. Finally, our Latin America beverages segment continued to pass exceptionally strong results in the third quarter. Net sales advancing 29% and operating income was up 14%. The latter on top of all the 8% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Leading this strong performance in the quarter were Pe\u00f1afiel, Clamato, Mott\u2019s and Squirt. Earlier this month, we announced a strategic partnership to sell and distribute Red Bull in Mexico starting in quarter four. The majority of the revenue we generate in our Latin America beverage segment is from Mexico. And we are excited to enter into this win-win partnership with Red Bull which will strengthen our position in the energy category, improve our go-to market scale and drive efficiencies over time. And now, I will hand it over to George to cover our third quarter performance in a bit more detail.\nGeorge Lagoudakis: Thanks, Ozan and good morning everyone. I will start with a brief review of our third quarter business and financial highlights and then provide the details on our segment results. As usual, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis. Total company net sales increased 11.8% to $3.6 billion with growth across all segments led by continued exceptional performance of our cold beverage business. Higher net price realization of 12.1% was only slightly offset by a volume mix decline of 0.3%. Adjusted gross profit grew 8.6% in the quarter, reflecting our significant price that is beginning to approach the level of inflation we experienced in Q3 also benefit the performance boosts productivity. As previously discussed we include our highest quarterly year-over-year increase in green coffee costs this year pressuring our gross margin, which declined versus year ago to 54.8%. Adjusted operating income increased 2% in the quarter, as the increase in gross profit was partially offset by increased outbound transportation, warehouse and labor costs, as well as higher marketing investment to support our back half plans. As a result, adjusted operating margin declined 250 basis points to 26.1%. Adjusted net income increased 4.3% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the operating income growth and lower interest expense. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 4.5% in the quarter to $0.46. Free cash flow remains strong at $686 million driving our free cash flow conversion ratio to 105% in the quarter. Turning now to our segment performance in the quarter. Packaged beverage net sales grew 15.6% driven by higher net price realization and volume mix that was driven with a year ago. This impressive volume mix performance reflects this strength of our brands, coupled with effective marketing and strong in market execution. As a result, we continue to hold down multiyear set gain in CSDs. And we gain additional sharing other categories, including premium and flavored water, Seltzer, tea, juice and fruit drinks. In an increasingly challenging economic backdrop our packaging mix capability across our portfolio enable consumers to easily pursue options that fit their budgets. Many were not allowed fastest growing CSV packets by volume in the quarter. Our continue in market effectiveness was supported by highly effective marketing investment during the quarter including the season five launch of the highly successful Dr Pepper Fansville episodic drink. In recognition of which continued brand strength Dr Peppers were recognized by Canada as one of the top 20 most valuable global food and beverage brands. Turning to Snapple. This important brand was a standout in Q3 registering the strongest seller performance in the tech category, led by Snapple elements launched earlier this year, with a matching packaging and bought new favorite elements has driven strong and repeat rates and it\u2019s proving highly incremental to the brand. Adjusted operating income for the packet beverage segment increased 7.9% after accounting for double digit increase in marketing investment, as pricing and productivity more than offset higher inflation in the period. Turning to beverage concentrates which parses strong and balanced growth in the quarter. Net sales advanced 17.3% with favorable net price realization and higher volume mix. The strong net sales performance was fueled by Dr Pepper Canada Dry and Press. Adjusted operating income for the segment increase 21% driven by the strong mid sales growth and lower marketing expense due to time. Coffee system net sales grew 5.2% in the quarter driven by our recent pricing actions and higher quote segments. Volume mix declined the quarter as a 3.5% growth in shipments was more than offset by a decline in brewer shipments. As Ozan mentioned, brewer shipments were down 15% versus last year, but 16% above the pre-COVID period. Adjusted operating income for the quarter decrease 15.7% primarily due to broad based inflation, which included the highest year-over-year green coffee costs this year. Higher price realization and productivity continue to lag inflation, but we expect an improved relationship in Q4 as the year-over-year inflation rate moderate significantly from Q3, and the contribution from previous pricing actions becomes fully realized in the coffee P&L. And finally Latin America beverage net sales advanced an impressive 28.8% balance between higher net price realization and increased volume mix. The strong net sales performance in the quarter was led by Pe\u00f1afiel, Clamato, Mott\u2019s and Squirt. Adjusted operating income increase 13.5% reflecting the strong growth in net sales and productivity, partially offset by inflation, and a significant increase in marketing investment which increase at a faster rate than the sales growth. I would like to spend a moment discussing our expectations for the balance of the year. Our strong executions gives us confidence in our route loop, and we are reaffirming our guidance for full year net sales growth in the low double digit range and adjusted diluted EPS growth in the middle single digit range. Supporting this guidance, we expect the following assumptions. Adjusted interest expense is expected to approximately $425 million. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected at the higher end of our guidance rates of 22% to 22.5%. Diluted weighted sale outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion. With that. Let me hand it back to Ozan for some closing remarks. \nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks, George. Before moving to question and answer, let me spend a moment on recent organizational announcements. On Monday, we announced the appointment of our new CFO, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi who will be joining us on November 14. Sudhanshu is a seasoned global finance, strategy and operations executive with significant goal about experience including in the beverage and retail industries. He will be a strategic partner to our team as we deliver against our commitments, scale our business for growth, and continue to successfully navigate the complex macro environment. We look forward to introducing him to you soon. Earlier this month, we announced a strategic realignment of our supply chain organization to accelerate enterprise wide productivity and speed of decision making. In doing so, we leveraged our strong supply chain bench promoting three experienced supply chain Leaders. With Roger Johnson becoming our new Chief Supply Chain Officer. It all builds on our strong supply chain foundation, and we believe positions as well as we head into 2023. In closing, we believe that our attractive organic growth coupled with our significant inorganic value creation opportunity will enable us to continue to drive strong total shareholder return results over time. We are excited about the talent and structure we are building to continue to execute against our opportunities with excellence.  I will now hand it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question here will come from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nBryan Spillane: So Ozan we got a lot of questions this morning about brewer shipments being down in the quarter, as much as they were. I know, you talked a little bit about this dynamic even earlier at the Barclays conference back in September. But I guess can you help put this into a little bit more context? How this tracked relative to what your expectations were? Maybe about your also just how you\u2019ve planned for holiday this year against this backdrop where there\u2019s certainly going to be less discretionary spending. And maybe within that, just how you\u2019re addressing maybe the value equation of the Keurig system against the backdrop of consumers tightening their belts.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Sure, thank you very much, Bryan. First of all, let me address the your first question on the brewers and the decline. As we have discussed, we remain on track to add 2 million new households into the Keurig system in 2022 which is consistent with our long term trend as we have been talking, and as expected, lower than the elevated rate of 3 million that we experienced in 2020 and 2021, during the period of increase at home COVID behavior. Therefore, it is very logical that we would need to sell fewer brewers in 2022 to support the additional 2 million incremental households, versus the 3 million that we have generated in 2020 again, and in 2021. As we have said many times in the past, shipments and consumption are not comparable over a short period of time, such as one or two quarters. And again, we are not in the number of brewer sales business, as we communicated many times, we don\u2019t generate or make money on the brewers sales. And there were years I\u2019m sure you will remember that we sold much less than what we are targeting this year, for example, and still generated 2 million incremental houses. So what matters is the composition of the annual says that goes to the replacement cycles and several other factors that are at the end generates the incremental household. So that\u2019s very important to note. Now, the second part of your question, in terms of our plans, and how we see the ecosystem and so forth. As we also communicated before, we still see 50 million incremental households that to be recruited into our Keurig ecosystem. That means if you take a long term horizon, minimum 10 years and plus plenty of growth is waiting us around the corner. And that\u2019s what we have been executing against. And then we look to the near end as you ask, the holiday programs, and so forth, as we always do. We have very effective trade and the consumer programs, including and coupled with our innovation, that we have been putting in the marketplace with regards to our brewers in a very successful manner that is ready to have another good Q4 holiday season as well as continued into 2023. Therefore we see absolutely no problem. And there is no any reason for us to deviate from our long term target of creating 2 million incremental households on a year in year out basis. And that\u2019s what we are going to do.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Good morning. I\u2019m just I\u2019m going to ask my real question, but just a kind of put a fine point on your responses now is on to Bryan\u2019s question. Just want to be clear that your expectations for 4Q brewer shipments, and what\u2019s embedded in your guidance is very much in line with this expectation for slower, for the deceleration household penetration because I think, again, it\u2019s the plan versus market reality, I think that people are asking about. So that\u2019s just to that validate that approach. My second and kind of real question was just to talk a little bit about private label performance in ports I mean you spoke a bit about it also in your prepared remarks, but we have started to get some questions there on thing, a little bit of a perk up in private label. So if you could talk about, I guess, participation in private label, how this has an impact or doesn\u2019t in terms of the margin business. And if you expect that private label performance to change at all, going forward, when you\u2019re kind of you\u2019ve two dynamics. One is reinstating, marketing you and your partners on branded coffee, but on the other hand, continue to increase inflation to the consumer. And so perhaps more impetus to trade down. Thanks.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thank you, Lauren. And so I will break your question, I believe into four parts. And the first part, the answer for your first part of the question. Yes, absolutely. And our guidance, not only on our planning stance basis, but in reality as well, that includes to deliver 2 million incremental households for 2022. And we are quite certain on our numbers. As you know, we have the tracking mechanism. And that\u2019s where we are at this point in time. When we step back and look at it with regards to the slowing down the consumption. Obviously, there are quite a bit of noise that we need to do a double click and provide the context. A combination of the increase in mobility especially in the summer months, following the post-COVID environment, along with retail pricing actions, combined with the less investment into advertisement and promotion as well as consumer activities, which the latter one complete the lead due to supply chain port supply issues that we have encountered. And then we got out of it fully at the end of quarter two. So all these combinations, and our analysis also suggests that the mobility increase was the outpaced one, an outsize one that impacted negatively the consumption in terms of the port consumption. However, with the investments coming back, and this life going back to more normal, like the school season kicking in, and also people are starting to go back to more to the offices, we started to see improvement in the consumption. For example, when you look to the market data, in September versus July and August, you will see an improvement. And we are also off to a good start into quarter four, which is October. Therefore, we have reflected all these into our plans for the remainder of the year. And we are quite certain that our growth in the single serve, we\u2019ll continue both from a top line and the bottom line perspective. And as we said in our prepared remarks as well, quarter three had the highest absorption rate in terms of the green coffee beans, which created quite a bit of pressure in our P&L in Q3. The good news is that is behind us. Therefore the inflation rate that we are going to see in quarter four is going to be significantly less versus the first three quarters that we have seen due to the spike of our base last year. Therefore, several factors that will enable us to deliver a very good corner in coffee in quarter four. So that\u2019s the important part. And the last part of your question with regards to the private label. When we actually look to the entirety of our portfolio, we will see that our private label exposure is limited. Especially when you look to the carbonated soft drinks, we have very limited competition coming from the private label. When you look to the fruit juices that is through there\u2019s a healthy amount of competition in the private label yet, as the data, I\u2019m sure that you have looked at it, we continue to increase market share in that category, which we have been really doing well on the basis of our innovation and market execution in the strong brands of portfolio that we have. And on the coffee private label, please remember that we are still the largest producer, and the manufacturers of the single serve K-cup pods for the private label sector as well. So if the private label increases share or there\u2019s a trade down going on, we will still contribute and participate to the economics of that, given that we are still producing a vast majority of the private label K-cup pods. That\u2019s why we believe that our ecosystem is really intact, again, goes back to our old weather business model between the cold beverage and the coffee. And we expect to have a very strong Q4 across the enterprise. Bob would you like to add anything?\nBob Gamgort: Yes. Good morning. I think it\u2019s, as we said over the past four years is always helpful to look at the Keurig system not on a quarter-by-quarter basis but over the long term. There are a lot of fluctuations up and down. But every time you step back and look at the performance of the ecosystem over six months, nine months, or a multiyear basis, the trends become really clear. So let\u2019s go back to that. We\u2019ve always had 2 million households for years our target is those unsaid that gives us more than 10 years line of sight to more than 10 years of very attractive growth as we convert more than 50 million households more than 50% of U.S. population actually. What we saw during COVID are a couple of things that changed. The household penetration went from 2 million to 3 million, we always said it was going to revert back to 2 million. We saw an increase in attachment rate. We said it was going to normalize which it has. We also I would remind you saw a spike in premium coffee brands at the expense of private label and our point of view was that would normalize over time. We\u2019re relatively indifferent to that given that we participate against all of those. The biggest concern that investors had when we talked to them was not that any of what I just said was going to happen, but rather there was some sort of pull forward so that the 3 million would translate into less than 2 million going forward. Whereas we sit here today here\u2019s the good news we\u2019re on our long term trend of 2 million which what we said. Attachment rate is back to normal levels and healthy and the balance between private label and premium and mainstream is back to where it was before and we participate in all of those. The only noise in this period, as Ozan talked about is when you go from 3 million to 2 million, you don\u2019t need to sell as many brewers to support that. But as we said, we\u2019re not in the brewer business, we\u2019re in the household penetration business, and 2 million households is exactly where we want to be. And it sets this up for a very, very good future in this ecosystem.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nNik Modi: Ozan and maybe even Bob I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on the deal environment in terms of valuations, any things that you guys have been looking at that seem attractive, obviously, not getting into the details, but given your commentary historically about, [indiscernible] and balance sheet and the desire to do more deals, I just would love some context on that. And then just a quick follow up on the coffee side, some of the work we\u2019ve done, which suggests, there\u2019s been a fair degree of increasing interaction between pods away from home coffee, like cafes, Starbucks, and packaged bottled coffee, that you can buy at retail. And I was just curious if you had any thoughts on that. Have you looked into that at all? Thanks.\nBob Gamgort: I\u2019ll start with the M&A environment. Ozan you can pick the second part of that question up. As we monitor the M&A environment. And we continue to see what we described previously, as the relatively easy funding situation for high growth companies starting to change and that continues to do so new investment for them is becoming more challenge. If you look at the public valuations as a marker for the few companies in this space that match that high growth criteria, you can see the change in investor sentiment reflected there pretty aggressively. So we continue to see an opportunity for us to be a catalyst. Our goal is always create win-win partnerships, we\u2019re not out there trying to buy something at a low price, we\u2019re really trying to step in, and be able to solve a number of challenges for these high growth businesses, by creating a partnership that works for everybody and take a look at what\u2019s happened just in the recent past with Polar, and beverage AT peak. And now in this call, we\u2019re talking about Red Bull in Mexico. If you think about it every call, we talked about a new piece of news where we\u2019re layering in more strategic businesses or segments into our business. And as that continues to build, it makes us a stronger company going forward. I would also add to that list all of the independent distributor acquisitions that we\u2019ve made over the past couple of years that significantly strengthens our distribution system. So we\u2019re going to continue to do so. I would say that as we continue to engage in these discussions, and we have numerous discussions right now, we\u2019re very clear in our strategic priorities. We\u2019re really confident in our ability to assess the value to KDP and KDP shareholders. And we\u2019re incredibly flexible in our approach to have on how to make these partnerships work. If you look at the track record of our success in creating value and growth for the partners I just described, as well as the continued growth that we have on our long term partners like Evian and Vita Coco and McCafe that is very attractive to emerging beverage companies. And so it allows us to have a seat at the table in a number of these conversations. And we\u2019re very optimistic and we will continue to play out in the way that I described. We\u2019re talking about the interaction, medium coffee.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Absolutely. And actually, I like to double click on that, because it\u2019s very important point. And Nick, that you mentioned, let me start with at home consumption. So at the onset due to the lock downs, and so forth, we have seen a significant increase in our attachment rate with regards to the single source of consumption at home, both in USA and Canada. And over time, if the mobility increasing and as we were expecting and in line with our plans, which is a kind of post COVID scenario, that the attachment rate started to come down. And please bear in mind, before we call it times, our attachment rate has been very, very stable for a long time. Therefore COVID was the only exception that made a spike and then came down more or less to the previous COVID levels as we speak right now. Therefore, that\u2019s an important point to note. At the same time when COVID hit obviously hour away from home office business, which is how we defined for the most part not all but for the most part, also of significant declines. Albeit right now we are seeing improvements but it\u2019s still significantly lower. Again the office coffee business at we have versus the pre-COVID levels. Therefore, we see this as an opportunity, both in quarter four and beyond that along the office habits build back that we will see our fair share in that segment at the same time. So there are quite a bit of interactions between the two. And also, as you said, right now, again, with the mobility increased, especially in some LVC, that the coffee shop products being consumed more as one would expect, with some moderation at the at home consumption. Therefore, as you said, there are quite a bit of intersection points, that when you step back and look at our portfolio, the good news is we are playing in terms of the overall Keurig ecosystem that we manage which is very important, and goes back again, another very strong leg to our all weather business model that we have successfully put together. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. \nChris Carey: Can you just confirm maybe the key drivers of the profit delivery in coffee this quarter, between the green coffee inflation you\u2019re seeing versus other inflation, like other commodities or supply chain inefficiencies? I\u2019m just trying to frame the coffee operating profit performance in the context of pricing which is building and mix which is more favorable for pods in the quarter which should be mixed accretive. And then just connected to that I wonder if you could just maybe frame how you see these coffee margins over the longer term horizon like if this is a structural reset, because maybe the cost of doing business is higher, or this is just about commodity inflation. And you should be catching up to these inflationary headwinds over time and I apologize, this is just a kind of confirmation on the model. But the extra week in Q4 that\u2019s going to land in coffee, would you expect to grow above the impact of the extra week. So I apologize for all that. But thanks for the context.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: No problem. Thank you very much. So I will break up your question into three components. So first of all the major drivers and how are we looking to the profitability of coffee in quarter three. The major determinant and the driver of coffee P&L in Q3 was the absorption rate of the coffee beans, green beans which is obviously our raw material that we use in terms of the negativity that it calls in our P&L. Why? Because when you looked over base last year, you will see, and we alluded to this during our quarter two call as well. Last year, we had several hedges that came off in Q3 which means that our inflationary step up was significantly higher in Q3 with regards to the coffee beans versus the other quarters. The good news that\u2019s behind us. That\u2019s one of the reasons why we have solid plans and we expect to see significant profit improvements in quarter four as well. At the same time, our pricing continues to build up and we believe that in quarter four, we will be in a position that our pricing will fully catching up to the inflationary factors. As you said, the inflation was broad based. It\u2019s not only coffee beans, but across the other materials and the ingredients that we have been using. But our algorithm clearly suggests that Q4 will be a very good inflection point not only for coffee, but for the cold beverage business that we also have and is basically mirrored in coffee P&L we expect to mirror more or less what has happened in the cold beverages as we have been expecting and communicating which was the pricing quarter in quarter out was getting closer to the inflation and at one point that pricing would be fully sufficient to overcome not only the absolutely the impact of the inflation but the margin percent wise as well. And that\u2019s what has happened in our for example when you look to beverage concentrates and the packaged beverages segments that we have announced and we expect that positive trend to continue into quarter four. So coffee is a little behind like a quarter but that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen exactly. And we should not also forget that obviously we are continuing to build the productivity programs and Q4 as has always been the case would be the highest delivery quarter for us at the same time. Therefore, we see Q3 coffee inflationary trends in relation to the pricing in the negative operating income delivery at transitory quarter for us and we expect a very strong quarter for the reasons that I have just articulated. Absolutely, we do not expect any structural issue or reset with regards to the coffee margins going forward. And as I say, we will we see a very strong actual the improvement in quarter four. There is no any reason and, and as we discussed before, obviously, coffee margins is one of the highest in our overall CPG industry as well at the same time. Therefore, we were very pleased, and we are very pleased, and there is no instructional change that we are forecasting for any reason. The last part of your question with regards to the 54th week, extra week in coffee, as we said before, it is true that we have few days, not even a week because of the holiday season and most of the retailers being shut. And the consumption in that, sorry, the sell out in that week, which is the last, very last week of December is the slowest. And it\u2019s almost minimal, not is almost but it is very, very small number that wouldn\u2019t change our profile with regards to the quarter four. It will have a little impact to the growth rates as well. That\u2019s why we have not quantified that number that we spoke before and communicated giving the very minimal impact on our numbers.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nBonnie Herzog: I wanted to circle back to brewers with a question, hoping you could touch on your inventories, which are quite high up 60% this year. So wondering how much of this might have to do with retailer inventory levels of brewers being elevated and then therefore retailers aren\u2019t ordering or buying as many brewers? Is that is something that\u2019s going on? How big of a risk do you believe this is in the next quarter or two for you? And then a quick clarification of your mid single digit EPS guidance for this year. Last quarter you mentioned you expected your second half EPS to be up high single digits driven largely by Q4. So just wanted to verify that high single digits in 2H is still expected or is maybe mid single digit growth more realistic. And that would I guess, result in your full year EPS growth possibly coming in at the low end of mid single digits? So just clarification on that two please. Thanks.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Sure. Thank you, Bonnie. So let me start with the brewers. We need to get the context right in terms of the brewer POS as well as the sellouts. As I explained due to the supply chain issues that we started two encounters late 2021 and impacted a good chunk of the first half of this year as well there were little investments in the category, including the brewers, because simply we didn\u2019t have including our partners, including our retail partners to sell enough. Therefore, that definitely curtailed the demand. So that this is a fact. Now, at the same time giving all the supply chain issues that the whole appliance will has faced in the last two years, we have been continuing to execute and co-manufacturing and bringing to the USA in order to keep our pipelines intact. When you step back and look at the small appliances at the retailers that you will see some longer inventory levels that they are facing. But please make sure that when you do the double click in that number, and you see that the single serve the brewers small appliances, in fact is doing way better than the overall. Small appliances retain number. Therefore, the headlines that we are seeing if we don\u2019t do that double click real is quite a bit of misleading we do not see that kind of inventory long term being carried by the retailers. That\u2019s number one. Second, it is also true that we have a little bit more than, more inventory than the previous years. It just because of two facts first we wanted to be ready for the holiday season that we are facing. And we are also increasing significantly investments behind the ecosystem along with our partners, along with the customer, retailer customers as well. Therefore, right now we are seeing a very good traction that we started in quarter four therefore we are not worried at all with regards to the inventory levels that we have. And always there are ups and downs that we have faced in the last seven years at Keurig business. Therefore the overall system and the brewers including the consumption in relation to the investments is one big circle. And we are pretty mature and intact on that one.\nBob Gamgort: Let me add, I think, Bonnie your question. And Bryan also hinting at potential concerns about the environment in Q4. Let me make a couple of points on the holiday season this year. One of things that we\u2019ve seen is that whenever there\u2019s a challenging economic time, gifting tends to shift from the indulgent or frivolous to functional. And there\u2019s no better functional gift than a Keurig Brewer. We have a wide range of price points from entry level all the way up the premium, we have an incredibly wide range of retail distribution, from e-commerce to all channels of brick and mortar distribution. And we\u2019re already seeing a number of retailers very early, are already pushing Keurig as one of their premium or prime promotions going into the holiday season. And we continue to expect to see more of that. So I know there\u2019s some concerns, as you guys have articulated about inventory levels and purchase power and small appliances. But as Ozan pointed out, if you double click on this, you see that single serve brewers and Keurig, in particular are doing incredibly well. And we expect them to have a strong holiday season. But again, all consistent with driving 2 million households, a penetration, which is what all of this is about.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Exactly. Thanks Bob. And also the second part of your question with regards to the EPS. Yes, quarter four is expected to be the strongest quarter of the year, as we expect to deliver margin improvement and accelerate EPS growth. There are several drivers to that which the full benefits of price realization. And as we announced publicly, we have taken another round of price increase behind our carbonated soft drinks portfolio are the quarter four that we will continue to deliver further top line and contribute to our profitability and also lapping spike in inflation this quarter. If you would remember, last year in quarter four in 2021, we had a big inflation step up which means that we are lapping less increase this year compared to the first three quarters of this year. So that will drive further profitability and the full realization of productivity this year that will accumulated in quarter four, and again, led by supply chain issues that we ran into, especially behind our coffee business. Last year we had several onetime unexpected costs including the customer penalties that we stated publicly as well, that will not happen this year. Therefore, lots of reasons why quarter four will be another strong quarter from the top line as well as especially bottom line perspective and we also expect to deliver a positive margin improvement which would be in a good inflection point for this quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.\nBrett Cooper: Just one quick question I wanted to double click on the supply chain organization change. And I was hoping you can help us understand the rationale for the change whether that change is a leading edge change for the enterprise and then just, I guess help me understand how that nets higher productivity. Thanks.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Absolutely. I mean, we always look for opportunities across our business, either how we operate, the ways of working, that we also align our organization accordingly. As you know, approximately two years ago, we moved a little bit from the functional to more business unit lead organization structure, and these data moves are in support of that move, taking it to the next level, nothing new is around the edges. And now that we have any issues or we have encountered in our supply chain or any unresolved issues that we are trying to tackle. To the contrary, as we have been talking at many different platforms that our supply chain organization as well as its supply chain fundamentals improved drastically across two businesses that we have in the cold beverages, especially in coffee. Therefore, this organizational change is making our supply chain to get even closer to the businesses that we do expect to see faster decision making with at the right time with the right players around, which will eventually impact our productivity programs as well. And a little bit more info on how this change may impact our productivity programs a bit, the first six to nine months because of the supply chain issues that we have faced, especially in coffee but not limited to coffee. In some brands, important brands like Snapple, as we communicated publicly before and by and a little bit in the CSS that we ran into some supply chain issues. In fact, the focus whether we liked it or not that went towards getting collecting all those issues that we have faced, because that\u2019s what we should have been doing. And this, putting those problems behind us. And with the new organization that we made, the small changes now will enable us to focus on much more productivity delivery, either in quarter four or next year as well. So this is the sum up of the impacts that we expect from the latest supply chain changes. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our last question today will come from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. \nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So I also want to have a clarification on the coffee side. I\u2019m sorry for going back to that and then Bob on M&A. First, can you comment a little bit on the sell out for the brewers from a replacement standpoint, which I understand is still bigger than the new households, of course, the razor blade model, we would like more households, but I don\u2019t want to underestimate what\u2019s happening on the future to single serve. And then Bob on the Red Bull distribution agreement in Mexico first, congratulations on that. And should we see more of these in isolation, but or perhaps testing the waters for potentially expanded agreement including the U.S. and if not, given your firepower M&A how we should be thinking about opportunities in energy. Thank you. \nOzan Dokmecioglu: Absolutely. Thanks Andrea. Let me start with the coffee and the brewer part. First of all, we are very pleased and more importantly, the brewer sales exactly in line with what we were expecting. So that\u2019s very important to note. So when we look to the composition of our total sales, as you know, we never broke that apart in terms of so many brews that we sell goes to the replacement and other factors as well. But you are absolutely right replacements have been and will play a much larger role in terms of the percent of our sales in our brewer units. That is a fact. But what is also important as we have been saying the incremental household that we will be driving that has too many levels to that. For example, when we which we did improve the, our brewer qualities, obviously, the life expectancy of the brewers extended, which means that is the replacement cycle got longer which means that we require less brewers to sell. But that still enables us to deliver the 2 million incremental households that we have been delivering very successfully. I\u2019ll bet 3 million both in 2020 and 2021 with no pull forward as well, from 2022, or even beyond the years. Therefore, replacement brewers has been and will be our realities. And we will continue to improve our brewer qualities and expect them to further extend the lifecycle. And also, we have increased and continue to increase our innovation cycle in the brewers , which would enable us to tap to the new consumption occasions and with the new format as well that will further give us the incremental top line as well as the bottom line. Therefore, we are quite pleased with the overall brewer performance that we have put together and feeding our ecosystem. Bob on the Snapple?\nBob Gamgort: Yes , I\u2019ll refer back to our investor day a little over a year ago where we talked about the role of M&A and partnerships. And we said that we had a number of criteria. One is we want to add on to our existing portfolio and leverage the infrastructure we have in place, particularly our DSD system. We were really interested in new platforms, particularly in energy and alcohol, where we saw good whitespace opportunities. And we also talked about we\u2019ve got these incredibly strong businesses in Canada and Mexico that we really don\u2019t talk much about. And we saw opportunities there. So quick, simply, when I look at the new arrangement with Red Bull and Mexico we think about that hits on energy. And it hits on continued expansion in Mexico, [indiscernible] was expansion within Canada. So we\u2019re beginning to add into these opportunity areas that we identified about a year ago in a more aggressive way. And all I will say on the Red Bull Mexico piece is our goal is to do what we do with all of our partnership, which is demonstrate incredibly strong value added for our partners, drive growth for them. And that always leads to more opportunities in the future. And I would expect that that would be the same in the case of this one. Before I think I\u2019m turning it back over to Ozan before I do that I have to in my new role here, I have to say we didn\u2019t get a single question on our cold beverage business today. And I want to give a shout out to our cold beverage team who delivered another incredible quarter of revenue growth, market share performance, record profitability, and they continue to hit it out of the park and they kind of feel left out on some of these calls. So I will acknowledge their strong performance as it shows up in our EPS in our overall financial delivery to KDP. So Ozan back over to you.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Yes, thank you very much. Thank you very much to all of you as well, Steve.\nSteve Alexander: Yes, this is Steve with our team around all day if you have any questions and we thank you all for your time participating on the call today. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ozan Dokmecioglu",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Giving that this is my first earnings call as CEO, I would like to start today's discussion with my thoughts on the KDP operating model, and a strategic approach that makes us unique in the CPG space. Our focus continues to be on managing our business for a range of potential macro outcomes, and leveraging the all weather business model we have created to drive success. Regardless of the environment, we may face. Our results this quarter, and the consistency of our performance since merger are a testament to the strength of this model, which has continued to perform well in the highly volatile macro environment our industry has faced since the onset of COVID. And, most recently, our portfolio has performed well with significant levels of inflation, and pricing, along with a challenge consumer landscape, demonstrating its recession resistance. With elasticity impacts remaining modest, and our market share positions remaining strong. Our business model starts with an attractive and competitive organic total shareholder return algorithm, which is driven by a flexible and scalable strategy. In cold beverages our strategy is focused on driving growth. In core brands, through marketing, brand renovation and in market execution by filling whitespace in our portfolio through innovation, and partnerships, such as our Polar Seltzer partnership, and the recently announced Red Bull selling and distribution agreement in Mexico, which we will touch on a bit later. And by enhancing the breadth, depth and effectiveness of our omni-channel selling and distribution system, including our company owned direct store distribution system. The investments we have made in selling and distribution over the past several years have built a stronger go to market capability that has driven consistently strong market share performance across all the brands and beverage segments. In coffee systems, we are focused on driving household penetration growth for the Keurig system at the rate of approximately 2 million new households every year. Given the number of remaining addressable new households for the Keurig system, which we estimate at more than 50 million. We have line of sight to household growth well beyond the next 10 years and consumer mobility continued to increase. KDPs, LRB dollar consumption increased more than 11% in the quarter. Growing LRB share in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, reflecting the benefit of pricing that was only modestly offset by volume, which remained quite resilient, with elasticities below the category in both periods. We continue to benefit from healthy categories as strong portfolio of leading brands, and very effective in market execution. The strong performance in the quarter was broad based and led by share gains in premium waters and seltzers, teas, apple juice and fruit drinks. In carbonated soft drinks our performance also continued to be strong, with dollar consumption up 12% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods with our share up year-to-date. We are pleased that we continue to expand on the impressive share gains we generated over the past couple of years. Within carbonated soft drinks our zero sugar innovation continues to perform well. With modulus elasticity impacts, and stronger velocities, then the overall zero sugar and diet category. In premium water, core hydration group dollar consumption 35% in the corner, driving almost two full points of share growth. Snapple led by the success of our Snapple brand refresh, and Snapple elements drove dollar consumption growth of 15% and share growth of almost one full point in the quarter. And in seltzers our partnership with Polar that continues to drive growth for the brand with ACV increasing six points and share gains of two points. Moving to coffee. Before discussing category dynamics, let me quickly share some context on our business and the performance improvements that are now beginning to materialize. You will recall that the combination of consistently strong consumer demand and supply constraints led to a port shortage starting in late 2021. Consequently, we fall back on our demand investment, as did most of our partners and lounge, the coffee supply chain recovery program to increase port output and rebuild finished goods inventories for all parties in the Keurig ecosystem. We completed the program last quarter and have now restored inventories across the ecosystem which enables us along with our partners and customers to resume investments in demand generating programs to drive category growth. As a result, the single server port category continues to recover from supply constraints. We store our consumption up 6% in the quarter, advancing to 7% in September, and off to a good start in quarter 4. There has been considerable noise in the broader at home coffee category numbers well beyond single serve coffee that is worth discussing further. A combination of increased consumer mobility, retail price actions, and the reduction in advertising and promotion spent the latter related to the single service supply challenges negatively impacted at home coffee category demand over the summer. Our analysis suggests that consumer mobility had the outsized impact with mobility returning to more normal patterns once the school year started, we are seeing sequential improvement in at home coffee demand. Importantly, single serve coffee outperformed all other forms of at home coffee during quarter 3. Further away from home coffee category while still down significantly versus pre-COVID levels continues to improve with further runway as returned to office behavior builds. Looking specifically to KDP coffee performance, KDP manufacture port consumption was up 4% on dollar basis in the third quarter, with owned and licensed brand consumption growing by 5%. As the McCafe\u0301 donut shop and Green Mountain brands posted the strong growth. Performance is ranked during the quarter with year-over-year dollar and volume share advancing sequentially in September versus July and August and continuing to improve into the fourth quarter. KDP continues to maintain its strong leadership position in the category with market share for KDP manufacture ports at approximately 82%. Moving forward, we expect mix to shift for KDP manufactured ports from private label to branded as community coffee comes on board beginning late this year. Turning to brewers. Today, we are confirming that we are on track to add 2 million new households into the Keurig system in 2022, which is consistent with our long term algorithm. As discussed many times, we expect the elevated rate of 3 million new households that we attracted in 2020 and 2021 to normalize post-COVID and that's exactly what's happening in 2022. Of course, we don't need to sell as many brewers to support 2 million new households as we did to support 3 million, which explains the 15% decline in brewer shipments in the third quarter. Remember, we are in the household penetration business, not to brewer sales business as the last the break even on brewer sales and generate nearly all of our profits from attracting new consumers into the Keurig ecosystem. Taking a longer term perspective further brewer sales were a healthy 16% above 2019 and on a year-to-date basis brewer shipments are up more than 30% versus the first three quarters of 2019. In addition, single serve brewers continue to hold the number one position in the at home brewers segment and KDP continues to grow share driven by strong innovation across all consumer price points. Finally, our Latin America beverages segment continued to pass exceptionally strong results in the third quarter. Net sales advancing 29% and operating income was up 14%. The latter on top of all the 8% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Leading this strong performance in the quarter were Pen\u0303afiel, Clamato, Mott's and Squirt. Earlier this month, we announced a strategic partnership to sell and distribute Red Bull in Mexico starting in quarter four. The majority of the revenue we generate in our Latin America beverage segment is from Mexico. And we are excited to enter into this win-win partnership with Red Bull which will strengthen our position in the energy category, improve our go-to market scale and drive efficiencies over time. And now, I will hand it over to George to cover our third quarter performance in a bit more detail. Thanks, George. Before moving to question and answer, let me spend a moment on recent organizational announcements. On Monday, we announced the appointment of our new CFO, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi who will be joining us on November 14. Sudhanshu is a seasoned global finance, strategy and operations executive with significant goal about experience including in the beverage and retail industries. He will be a strategic partner to our team as we deliver against our commitments, scale our business for growth, and continue to successfully navigate the complex macro environment. We look forward to introducing him to you soon. Earlier this month, we announced a strategic realignment of our supply chain organization to accelerate enterprise wide productivity and speed of decision making. In doing so, we leveraged our strong supply chain bench promoting three experienced supply chain Leaders. With Roger Johnson becoming our new Chief Supply Chain Officer. It all builds on our strong supply chain foundation, and we believe positions as well as we head into 2023. In closing, we believe that our attractive organic growth coupled with our significant inorganic value creation opportunity will enable us to continue to drive strong total shareholder return results over time. We are excited about the talent and structure we are building to continue to execute against our opportunities with excellence.  I will now hand it back to the operator for your questions. Sure, thank you very much, Bryan. First of all, let me address the your first question on the brewers and the decline. As we have discussed, we remain on track to add 2 million new households into the Keurig system in 2022 which is consistent with our long term trend as we have been talking, and as expected, lower than the elevated rate of 3 million that we experienced in 2020 and 2021, during the period of increase at home COVID behavior. Therefore, it is very logical that we would need to sell fewer brewers in 2022 to support the additional 2 million incremental households, versus the 3 million that we have generated in 2020 again, and in 2021. As we have said many times in the past, shipments and consumption are not comparable over a short period of time, such as one or two quarters. And again, we are not in the number of brewer sales business, as we communicated many times, we don't generate or make money on the brewers sales. And there were years I'm sure you will remember that we sold much less than what we are targeting this year, for example, and still generated 2 million incremental houses. So what matters is the composition of the annual says that goes to the replacement cycles and several other factors that are at the end generates the incremental household. So that's very important to note. Now, the second part of your question, in terms of our plans, and how we see the ecosystem and so forth. As we also communicated before, we still see 50 million incremental households that to be recruited into our Keurig ecosystem. That means if you take a long term horizon, minimum 10 years and plus plenty of growth is waiting us around the corner. And that's what we have been executing against. And then we look to the near end as you ask, the holiday programs, and so forth, as we always do. We have very effective trade and the consumer programs, including and coupled with our innovation, that we have been putting in the marketplace with regards to our brewers in a very successful manner that is ready to have another good Q4 holiday season as well as continued into 2023. Therefore we see absolutely no problem. And there is no any reason for us to deviate from our long term target of creating 2 million incremental households on a year in year out basis. And that's what we are going to do. Thank you, Lauren. And so I will break your question, I believe into four parts. And the first part, the answer for your first part of the question. Yes, absolutely. And our guidance, not only on our planning stance basis, but in reality as well, that includes to deliver 2 million incremental households for 2022. And we are quite certain on our numbers. As you know, we have the tracking mechanism. And that's where we are at this point in time. When we step back and look at it with regards to the slowing down the consumption. Obviously, there are quite a bit of noise that we need to do a double click and provide the context. A combination of the increase in mobility especially in the summer months, following the post-COVID environment, along with retail pricing actions, combined with the less investment into advertisement and promotion as well as consumer activities, which the latter one complete the lead due to supply chain port supply issues that we have encountered. And then we got out of it fully at the end of quarter two. So all these combinations, and our analysis also suggests that the mobility increase was the outpaced one, an outsize one that impacted negatively the consumption in terms of the port consumption. However, with the investments coming back, and this life going back to more normal, like the school season kicking in, and also people are starting to go back to more to the offices, we started to see improvement in the consumption. For example, when you look to the market data, in September versus July and August, you will see an improvement. And we are also off to a good start into quarter four, which is October. Therefore, we have reflected all these into our plans for the remainder of the year. And we are quite certain that our growth in the single serve, we'll continue both from a top line and the bottom line perspective. And as we said in our prepared remarks as well, quarter three had the highest absorption rate in terms of the green coffee beans, which created quite a bit of pressure in our P&L in Q3. The good news is that is behind us. Therefore the inflation rate that we are going to see in quarter four is going to be significantly less versus the first three quarters that we have seen due to the spike of our base last year. Therefore, several factors that will enable us to deliver a very good corner in coffee in quarter four. So that's the important part. And the last part of your question with regards to the private label. When we actually look to the entirety of our portfolio, we will see that our private label exposure is limited. Especially when you look to the carbonated soft drinks, we have very limited competition coming from the private label. When you look to the fruit juices that is through there's a healthy amount of competition in the private label yet, as the data, I'm sure that you have looked at it, we continue to increase market share in that category, which we have been really doing well on the basis of our innovation and market execution in the strong brands of portfolio that we have. And on the coffee private label, please remember that we are still the largest producer, and the manufacturers of the single serve K-cup pods for the private label sector as well. So if the private label increases share or there's a trade down going on, we will still contribute and participate to the economics of that, given that we are still producing a vast majority of the private label K-cup pods. That's why we believe that our ecosystem is really intact, again, goes back to our old weather business model between the cold beverage and the coffee. And we expect to have a very strong Q4 across the enterprise. Bob would you like to add anything? Absolutely. And actually, I like to double click on that, because it's very important point. And Nick, that you mentioned, let me start with at home consumption. So at the onset due to the lock downs, and so forth, we have seen a significant increase in our attachment rate with regards to the single source of consumption at home, both in USA and Canada. And over time, if the mobility increasing and as we were expecting and in line with our plans, which is a kind of post COVID scenario, that the attachment rate started to come down. And please bear in mind, before we call it times, our attachment rate has been very, very stable for a long time. Therefore COVID was the only exception that made a spike and then came down more or less to the previous COVID levels as we speak right now. Therefore, that's an important point to note. At the same time when COVID hit obviously hour away from home office business, which is how we defined for the most part not all but for the most part, also of significant declines. Albeit right now we are seeing improvements but it's still significantly lower. Again the office coffee business at we have versus the pre-COVID levels. Therefore, we see this as an opportunity, both in quarter four and beyond that along the office habits build back that we will see our fair share in that segment at the same time. So there are quite a bit of interactions between the two. And also, as you said, right now, again, with the mobility increased, especially in some LVC, that the coffee shop products being consumed more as one would expect, with some moderation at the at home consumption. Therefore, as you said, there are quite a bit of intersection points, that when you step back and look at our portfolio, the good news is we are playing in terms of the overall Keurig ecosystem that we manage which is very important, and goes back again, another very strong leg to our all weather business model that we have successfully put together. Thank you. No problem. Thank you very much. So I will break up your question into three components. So first of all the major drivers and how are we looking to the profitability of coffee in quarter three. The major determinant and the driver of coffee P&L in Q3 was the absorption rate of the coffee beans, green beans which is obviously our raw material that we use in terms of the negativity that it calls in our P&L. Why? Because when you looked over base last year, you will see, and we alluded to this during our quarter two call as well. Last year, we had several hedges that came off in Q3 which means that our inflationary step up was significantly higher in Q3 with regards to the coffee beans versus the other quarters. The good news that's behind us. That's one of the reasons why we have solid plans and we expect to see significant profit improvements in quarter four as well. At the same time, our pricing continues to build up and we believe that in quarter four, we will be in a position that our pricing will fully catching up to the inflationary factors. As you said, the inflation was broad based. It's not only coffee beans, but across the other materials and the ingredients that we have been using. But our algorithm clearly suggests that Q4 will be a very good inflection point not only for coffee, but for the cold beverage business that we also have and is basically mirrored in coffee P&L we expect to mirror more or less what has happened in the cold beverages as we have been expecting and communicating which was the pricing quarter in quarter out was getting closer to the inflation and at one point that pricing would be fully sufficient to overcome not only the absolutely the impact of the inflation but the margin percent wise as well. And that's what has happened in our for example when you look to beverage concentrates and the packaged beverages segments that we have announced and we expect that positive trend to continue into quarter four. So coffee is a little behind like a quarter but that's what's going to happen exactly. And we should not also forget that obviously we are continuing to build the productivity programs and Q4 as has always been the case would be the highest delivery quarter for us at the same time. Therefore, we see Q3 coffee inflationary trends in relation to the pricing in the negative operating income delivery at transitory quarter for us and we expect a very strong quarter for the reasons that I have just articulated. Absolutely, we do not expect any structural issue or reset with regards to the coffee margins going forward. And as I say, we will we see a very strong actual the improvement in quarter four. There is no any reason and, and as we discussed before, obviously, coffee margins is one of the highest in our overall CPG industry as well at the same time. Therefore, we were very pleased, and we are very pleased, and there is no instructional change that we are forecasting for any reason. The last part of your question with regards to the 54th week, extra week in coffee, as we said before, it is true that we have few days, not even a week because of the holiday season and most of the retailers being shut. And the consumption in that, sorry, the sell out in that week, which is the last, very last week of December is the slowest. And it's almost minimal, not is almost but it is very, very small number that wouldn't change our profile with regards to the quarter four. It will have a little impact to the growth rates as well. That's why we have not quantified that number that we spoke before and communicated giving the very minimal impact on our numbers. Sure. Thank you, Bonnie. So let me start with the brewers. We need to get the context right in terms of the brewer POS as well as the sellouts. As I explained due to the supply chain issues that we started two encounters late 2021 and impacted a good chunk of the first half of this year as well there were little investments in the category, including the brewers, because simply we didn't have including our partners, including our retail partners to sell enough. Therefore, that definitely curtailed the demand. So that this is a fact. Now, at the same time giving all the supply chain issues that the whole appliance will has faced in the last two years, we have been continuing to execute and co-manufacturing and bringing to the USA in order to keep our pipelines intact. When you step back and look at the small appliances at the retailers that you will see some longer inventory levels that they are facing. But please make sure that when you do the double click in that number, and you see that the single serve the brewers small appliances, in fact is doing way better than the overall. Small appliances retain number. Therefore, the headlines that we are seeing if we don't do that double click real is quite a bit of misleading we do not see that kind of inventory long term being carried by the retailers. That's number one. Second, it is also true that we have a little bit more than, more inventory than the previous years. It just because of two facts first we wanted to be ready for the holiday season that we are facing. And we are also increasing significantly investments behind the ecosystem along with our partners, along with the customer, retailer customers as well. Therefore, right now we are seeing a very good traction that we started in quarter four therefore we are not worried at all with regards to the inventory levels that we have. And always there are ups and downs that we have faced in the last seven years at Keurig business. Therefore the overall system and the brewers including the consumption in relation to the investments is one big circle. And we are pretty mature and intact on that one. Exactly. Thanks Bob. And also the second part of your question with regards to the EPS. Yes, quarter four is expected to be the strongest quarter of the year, as we expect to deliver margin improvement and accelerate EPS growth. There are several drivers to that which the full benefits of price realization. And as we announced publicly, we have taken another round of price increase behind our carbonated soft drinks portfolio are the quarter four that we will continue to deliver further top line and contribute to our profitability and also lapping spike in inflation this quarter. If you would remember, last year in quarter four in 2021, we had a big inflation step up which means that we are lapping less increase this year compared to the first three quarters of this year. So that will drive further profitability and the full realization of productivity this year that will accumulated in quarter four, and again, led by supply chain issues that we ran into, especially behind our coffee business. Last year we had several onetime unexpected costs including the customer penalties that we stated publicly as well, that will not happen this year. Therefore, lots of reasons why quarter four will be another strong quarter from the top line as well as especially bottom line perspective and we also expect to deliver a positive margin improvement which would be in a good inflection point for this quarter. Thank you. Absolutely. I mean, we always look for opportunities across our business, either how we operate, the ways of working, that we also align our organization accordingly. As you know, approximately two years ago, we moved a little bit from the functional to more business unit lead organization structure, and these data moves are in support of that move, taking it to the next level, nothing new is around the edges. And now that we have any issues or we have encountered in our supply chain or any unresolved issues that we are trying to tackle. To the contrary, as we have been talking at many different platforms that our supply chain organization as well as its supply chain fundamentals improved drastically across two businesses that we have in the cold beverages, especially in coffee. Therefore, this organizational change is making our supply chain to get even closer to the businesses that we do expect to see faster decision making with at the right time with the right players around, which will eventually impact our productivity programs as well. And a little bit more info on how this change may impact our productivity programs a bit, the first six to nine months because of the supply chain issues that we have faced, especially in coffee but not limited to coffee. In some brands, important brands like Snapple, as we communicated publicly before and by and a little bit in the CSS that we ran into some supply chain issues. In fact, the focus whether we liked it or not that went towards getting collecting all those issues that we have faced, because that's what we should have been doing. And this, putting those problems behind us. And with the new organization that we made, the small changes now will enable us to focus on much more productivity delivery, either in quarter four or next year as well. So this is the sum up of the impacts that we expect from the latest supply chain changes. Thank you very much. Absolutely. Thanks Andrea. Let me start with the coffee and the brewer part. First of all, we are very pleased and more importantly, the brewer sales exactly in line with what we were expecting. So that's very important to note. So when we look to the composition of our total sales, as you know, we never broke that apart in terms of so many brews that we sell goes to the replacement and other factors as well. But you are absolutely right replacements have been and will play a much larger role in terms of the percent of our sales in our brewer units. That is a fact. But what is also important as we have been saying the incremental household that we will be driving that has too many levels to that. For example, when we which we did improve the, our brewer qualities, obviously, the life expectancy of the brewers extended, which means that is the replacement cycle got longer which means that we require less brewers to sell. But that still enables us to deliver the 2 million incremental households that we have been delivering very successfully. I'll bet 3 million both in 2020 and 2021 with no pull forward as well, from 2022, or even beyond the years. Therefore, replacement brewers has been and will be our realities. And we will continue to improve our brewer qualities and expect them to further extend the lifecycle. And also, we have increased and continue to increase our innovation cycle in the brewers , which would enable us to tap to the new consumption occasions and with the new format as well that will further give us the incremental top line as well as the bottom line. Therefore, we are quite pleased with the overall brewer performance that we have put together and feeding our ecosystem. Bob on the Snapple? Yes, thank you very much. Thank you very much to all of you as well, Steve."

            "content": "Thanks, Ozan and good morning everyone. I will start with a brief review of our third quarter business and financial highlights and then provide the details on our segment results. As usual, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis. Total company net sales increased 11.8% to $3.6 billion with growth across all segments led by continued exceptional performance of our cold beverage business. Higher net price realization of 12.1% was only slightly offset by a volume mix decline of 0.3%. Adjusted gross profit grew 8.6% in the quarter, reflecting our significant price that is beginning to approach the level of inflation we experienced in Q3 also benefit the performance boosts productivity. As previously discussed we include our highest quarterly year-over-year increase in green coffee costs this year pressuring our gross margin, which declined versus year ago to 54.8%. Adjusted operating income increased 2% in the quarter, as the increase in gross profit was partially offset by increased outbound transportation, warehouse and labor costs, as well as higher marketing investment to support our back half plans. As a result, adjusted operating margin declined 250 basis points to 26.1%. Adjusted net income increased 4.3% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the operating income growth and lower interest expense. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 4.5% in the quarter to $0.46. Free cash flow remains strong at $686 million driving our free cash flow conversion ratio to 105% in the quarter. Turning now to our segment performance in the quarter. Packaged beverage net sales grew 15.6% driven by higher net price realization and volume mix that was driven with a year ago. This impressive volume mix performance reflects this strength of our brands, coupled with effective marketing and strong in market execution. As a result, we continue to hold down multiyear set gain in CSDs. And we gain additional sharing other categories, including premium and flavored water, Seltzer, tea, juice and fruit drinks. In an increasingly challenging economic backdrop our packaging mix capability across our portfolio enable consumers to easily pursue options that fit their budgets. Many were not allowed fastest growing CSV packets by volume in the quarter. Our continue in market effectiveness was supported by highly effective marketing investment during the quarter including the season five launch of the highly successful Dr Pepper Fansville episodic drink. In recognition of which continued brand strength Dr Peppers were recognized by Canada as one of the top 20 most valuable global food and beverage brands. Turning to Snapple. This important brand was a standout in Q3 registering the strongest seller performance in the tech category, led by Snapple elements launched earlier this year, with a matching packaging and bought new favorite elements has driven strong and repeat rates and it's proving highly incremental to the brand. Adjusted operating income for the packet beverage segment increased 7.9% after accounting for double digit increase in marketing investment, as pricing and productivity more than offset higher inflation in the period. Turning to beverage concentrates which parses strong and balanced growth in the quarter. Net sales advanced 17.3% with favorable net price realization and higher volume mix. The strong net sales performance was fueled by Dr Pepper Canada Dry and Press. Adjusted operating income for the segment increase 21% driven by the strong mid sales growth and lower marketing expense due to time. Coffee system net sales grew 5.2% in the quarter driven by our recent pricing actions and higher quote segments. Volume mix declined the quarter as a 3.5% growth in shipments was more than offset by a decline in brewer shipments. As Ozan mentioned, brewer shipments were down 15% versus last year, but 16% above the pre-COVID period. Adjusted operating income for the quarter decrease 15.7% primarily due to broad based inflation, which included the highest year-over-year green coffee costs this year. Higher price realization and productivity continue to lag inflation, but we expect an improved relationship in Q4 as the year-over-year inflation rate moderate significantly from Q3, and the contribution from previous pricing actions becomes fully realized in the coffee P&L. And finally Latin America beverage net sales advanced an impressive 28.8% balance between higher net price realization and increased volume mix. The strong net sales performance in the quarter was led by Pen\u0303afiel, Clamato, Mott's and Squirt. Adjusted operating income increase 13.5% reflecting the strong growth in net sales and productivity, partially offset by inflation, and a significant increase in marketing investment which increase at a faster rate than the sales growth. I would like to spend a moment discussing our expectations for the balance of the year. Our strong executions gives us confidence in our route loop, and we are reaffirming our guidance for full year net sales growth in the low double digit range and adjusted diluted EPS growth in the middle single digit range. Supporting this guidance, we expect the following assumptions. Adjusted interest expense is expected to approximately $425 million. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected at the higher end of our guidance rates of 22% to 22.5%. Diluted weighted sale outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion. With that. Let me hand it back to Ozan for some closing remarks."

            "name": "Bob Gamgort",
            "content": "Yes. Good morning. I think it's, as we said over the past four years is always helpful to look at the Keurig system not on a quarter-by-quarter basis but over the long term. There are a lot of fluctuations up and down. But every time you step back and look at the performance of the ecosystem over six months, nine months, or a multiyear basis, the trends become really clear. So let's go back to that. We've always had 2 million households for years our target is those unsaid that gives us more than 10 years line of sight to more than 10 years of very attractive growth as we convert more than 50 million households more than 50% of U.S. population actually. What we saw during COVID are a couple of things that changed. The household penetration went from 2 million to 3 million, we always said it was going to revert back to 2 million. We saw an increase in attachment rate. We said it was going to normalize which it has. We also I would remind you saw a spike in premium coffee brands at the expense of private label and our point of view was that would normalize over time. We're relatively indifferent to that given that we participate against all of those. The biggest concern that investors had when we talked to them was not that any of what I just said was going to happen, but rather there was some sort of pull forward so that the 3 million would translate into less than 2 million going forward. Whereas we sit here today here's the good news we're on our long term trend of 2 million which what we said. Attachment rate is back to normal levels and healthy and the balance between private label and premium and mainstream is back to where it was before and we participate in all of those. The only noise in this period, as Ozan talked about is when you go from 3 million to 2 million, you don't need to sell as many brewers to support that. But as we said, we're not in the brewer business, we're in the household penetration business, and 2 million households is exactly where we want to be. And it sets this up for a very, very good future in this ecosystem. I'll start with the M&A environment. Ozan you can pick the second part of that question up. As we monitor the M&A environment. And we continue to see what we described previously, as the relatively easy funding situation for high growth companies starting to change and that continues to do so new investment for them is becoming more challenge. If you look at the public valuations as a marker for the few companies in this space that match that high growth criteria, you can see the change in investor sentiment reflected there pretty aggressively. So we continue to see an opportunity for us to be a catalyst. Our goal is always create win-win partnerships, we're not out there trying to buy something at a low price, we're really trying to step in, and be able to solve a number of challenges for these high growth businesses, by creating a partnership that works for everybody and take a look at what's happened just in the recent past with Polar, and beverage AT peak. And now in this call, we're talking about Red Bull in Mexico. If you think about it every call, we talked about a new piece of news where we're layering in more strategic businesses or segments into our business. And as that continues to build, it makes us a stronger company going forward. I would also add to that list all of the independent distributor acquisitions that we've made over the past couple of years that significantly strengthens our distribution system. So we're going to continue to do so. I would say that as we continue to engage in these discussions, and we have numerous discussions right now, we're very clear in our strategic priorities. We're really confident in our ability to assess the value to KDP and KDP shareholders. And we're incredibly flexible in our approach to have on how to make these partnerships work. If you look at the track record of our success in creating value and growth for the partners I just described, as well as the continued growth that we have on our long term partners like Evian and Vita Coco and McCafe that is very attractive to emerging beverage companies. And so it allows us to have a seat at the table in a number of these conversations. And we're very optimistic and we will continue to play out in the way that I described. We're talking about the interaction, medium coffee. Let me add, I think, Bonnie your question. And Bryan also hinting at potential concerns about the environment in Q4. Let me make a couple of points on the holiday season this year. One of things that we've seen is that whenever there's a challenging economic time, gifting tends to shift from the indulgent or frivolous to functional. And there's no better functional gift than a Keurig Brewer. We have a wide range of price points from entry level all the way up the premium, we have an incredibly wide range of retail distribution, from e-commerce to all channels of brick and mortar distribution. And we're already seeing a number of retailers very early, are already pushing Keurig as one of their premium or prime promotions going into the holiday season. And we continue to expect to see more of that. So I know there's some concerns, as you guys have articulated about inventory levels and purchase power and small appliances. But as Ozan pointed out, if you double click on this, you see that single serve brewers and Keurig, in particular are doing incredibly well. And we expect them to have a strong holiday season. But again, all consistent with driving 2 million households, a penetration, which is what all of this is about. Yes , I'll refer back to our investor day a little over a year ago where we talked about the role of M&A and partnerships. And we said that we had a number of criteria. One is we want to add on to our existing portfolio and leverage the infrastructure we have in place, particularly our DSD system. We were really interested in new platforms, particularly in energy and alcohol, where we saw good whitespace opportunities. And we also talked about we've got these incredibly strong businesses in Canada and Mexico that we really don't talk much about. And we saw opportunities there. So quick, simply, when I look at the new arrangement with Red Bull and Mexico we think about that hits on energy. And it hits on continued expansion in Mexico, [indiscernible] was expansion within Canada. So we're beginning to add into these opportunity areas that we identified about a year ago in a more aggressive way. And all I will say on the Red Bull Mexico piece is our goal is to do what we do with all of our partnership, which is demonstrate incredibly strong value added for our partners, drive growth for them. And that always leads to more opportunities in the future. And I would expect that that would be the same in the case of this one. Before I think I'm turning it back over to Ozan before I do that I have to in my new role here, I have to say we didn't get a single question on our cold beverage business today. And I want to give a shout out to our cold beverage team who delivered another incredible quarter of revenue growth, market share performance, record profitability, and they continue to hit it out of the park and they kind of feel left out on some of these calls. So I will acknowledge their strong performance as it shows up in our EPS in our overall financial delivery to KDP. So Ozan back over to you."

Welcome to the Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Earnings Call for the Second Quarter of 2022. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. This conference call is being recorded and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call.  I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Steve Alexander. Mr. Alexander, please go ahead.\nSteve Alexander: Thank you! And hello everyone! Thanks for joining us. Let me start this morning by introducing our new Senior Director of IR, Chethan Mallela who joined us in May. Many of you may know Chethan from his six years working on the sales side with Andrew Lazar of Barclays, followed by IR roles over the past few years at American Eagle Outfitters and Peloton. He is a great addition to our team and we believe you will enjoy working with him.  Earlier this morning we issued our press release for the second quarter of 2022. If you need a copy you can get one on our website in the Investors Section. Consistent with previous quarters, today we'll be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, excluding items affecting comparability.  Beginning last quarter, you may recall that we began excluding the impact of foreign currency translation from our adjusted results. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance.  Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance.  Here with us today to discuss our results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; and Ozan Dokmecioglu, our Current CFO and President of International, who is transitioning to the CEO effective tomorrow, at which time Bob will become Executive Chairman. Also with us is our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand it over to Bob.\nBob Gamgort: Thanks Steve and good morning, everyone! The second quarter was one of significant progress for a company in a macro environment that continues to be challenging on many fronts. Broad based inflation continues to impact industry margin as pricing continues to increase, but it's not yet caught up to inflation. The good news is our brand strength has held up well in the face of new pricing, with modest elasticity impacts across our portfolio during the quarter.  With concerns having shifted to the potential for a recession, it's worth spending a moment on how our categories have performed during previous recessionary periods. During the last significant economic downturn in 2008, 2009, our lead segment, particularly carbonated soft drinks and coffee were among the CPG categories that held up best. These categories are true staples, with regular consumption behaviors and few direct substitutes, and they have the benefit from the trade down effect from out-of-home consumption to in-home consumption that frequently occurs during recession.  As we've done successfully in the past, we will continue to manage KDP against a range of potential macro outcome and believe that the all-weather business model we\u2019ve created positions us well as we continue to operate in a challenging environment with significant uncertainty.  Since the formation of KDP, we have delivered great returns for our shareholders, with a four year total shareholder return in excess of 100%. Well above broad market indices and nearly all food and beverage peers. More notable is that these returns were delivered during our transition from a closely held company to a widely held one. With the public market absorbing approximately 675 million new shares into the fall, equivalent to $25 billion in market cap. With our inclusion last month in the S&P 500, along with our existing position in the NASDAQ 100, we continue to broaden our appeal.  Let me take a few minutes to remind you how the KDP business model creates value, and then let Ozan apply that framework to our Q2 results. KDP is underpinned by an attractive and competitive organic total shareholder return algorithm, driven by a flexible and scalable strategy.  Coffee Systems; our strategy is focused on attracting about 2 million new household every year into the Keurig System. While also driving revenue and profit growth among our 36 million existing Keurig households to new platforms such as connected brewers and new beverage formats and occasion. Given the size of the remaining addressable new households for the Keurig system, which we estimate at more than 50 million, we have line of sight to household growth well beyond the next 10 years.  In cold beverages, our strategies focus on driving growth in core brands through marketing and brand renovation, filling white space in our portfolio through internal innovation and external partnership, and enhancing the effectiveness of our omni-channel selling and distribution system, including our company owned direct store distribution system. The investments we have made in selling and distribution have built a stronger go-to-market capability that has a multiplier effect on our brand investment as evidenced by our consistent share growth.  In addition to our core algorithm, KDP\u2019s extraordinary free cash flow enables the potential for incremental shareholder return through strategic capital allocation. I will elaborate on this later in the call.  Ozan, over to you. \nOzan Dokmecioglu: Good morning everyone! Bob provided an overview of our successful growth strategy, and I want to spend a moment to highlight our quarter two results in the context of our overall strategy.  On a total company basis, net sales advanced 13.5%. With net sales up more than 10% and volume mix up more than 3%, with all four segments posting strong growth. KDP adjusted gross profit increased 10%, while adjusted gross margin declined 180 basis points, reflecting the timing gap that remains between pricing and inflation.  During the quarter we experienced cost of goods sold inflation across all inputs, including ingredient, packaging and manufacturing labor. In addition, we also experienced a much higher rate of inflation in transportation and warehousing. At the time of robust consumer demand and SG&A inflation was also significantly higher.  Taken together, our total inflation for the quarter exceeded 17%, which was more than two percentage points higher than the 15% we experienced in quarter one. As a result, adjusted operating income declined slightly, a significantly higher cost to serve offset the 10% increase in adjusted gross profit in the quarter. All-in, adjusted net income increased approximately 3%, reflecting a lower adjusted tax rate and lower interest expense. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also increased 3% to $0.39, and we closed out the first half of this year very much as expected. Free cash flow for the quarter at $600 million continued to be strong, driving a free cash flow conversion ratio of 108%.  Let's shift to a discussion of segment performance starting with Coffee System. I'm happy to report that our Coffee Supply recovery plan has been completed ahead of schedule, with part manufacturing output restored to levels that will provide full service to our partners and retailors. While that success came at a cost, as we discussed last quarter, it sets us up for a strong second half of the year. For the quarter, Coffee Systems net sales were up 9%, driven by both higher pricing and increased volume mix, reflecting strong sequential improvement in sales.  For the quarter pod sales grew 10%, led by both higher pricing and higher volume mix, while brewer sales grew almost 6%, led by higher pricing that was partially offset by lower volume due to the 29% volume growth comparison in quarter two last year.  Marketing investment in quarter was up slightly. Single-serve coffee category pricing was up nearly 9% during the quarter based on IRi as coffee brands and retailers mitigate the impact of inflation, particularly in coffee with new price actions. We have noted a few industry reports direct linking category volume deceleration in IRi with pricing actions and attempting to draw conclusions on elasticity.  In addition to our typical caviar that syndicated data reflects only about 50% of total pod sales, let me also caution you that there is significant noise in the category numbers in quarter two. Due to the impact of supply chain issues, including out of stocks and significantly reduced category, promotional and marketing support.  There are also some timing impacts from consumer mobility with regard to out-of-home coffee consumption during the quarter. As we move into the second house, we continue to expect a strong dollar consumption growth in the category with some ongoing volume pressure related to increased consumer mobility compared to the prior year. This is consistent with our prior expectations that at-home attachment rates would eventually return to pre-COVID levels and we are continuing to see this occur.  At the same time, we are seeing improvement in office-coffee, which we expect to gradually improve over time. In this dynamic environment we continue to track the relationship between single-served coffee pricing and other forms of coffee, including out-of-home coffee. Despite the increase in single-serve pricing, the gaps between core months have remained consistent as all-forms of coffee have increased in price.  Let me shift to some highlights of coffee system growth drivers. In quarter three, we will nationally launch our new K-Cafe smart brewer, which in one machine, the representation of the cumulative enhancements we have made to curate brewers over the past five years.  The K-Cafe smart is enabled by our connected Brewer ID Technology that recognizes the pod and adjusts the brew for a perfect Cup. It also features multi-screen technology, which enables a wider range of temperature and strength, including our best ever Brew Over Ice coffee delivery yet.  This new brewer also incorporates a new multi speed product to enable consumers to create capuchins, lattes and other specialty coffees, guided by an interactive recipe experience, located in the Keurig App. Taken together, the K-Caf\u00e9 Smart enables consumers to create a coffee shop experience in home, at a fraction of the cost, and with greater appeal to younger households.  With our continued smart technology development, we remain on track to reach 1 million connected households in the next few years, which continues to unlock new platforms such as SMART Auto-Delivery for pods. The enhancement to Keurig System Quality and innovation continue to be recognized by key industry players and we are pleased to announce the addition of two new Super Premium Coffee brands into the system with Intelligentsia and BLK & Bold joining our roster of Keurig partners.  In addition to enabling Keurig system to reach premium consumers, with price points of around $1 per pod, the participation of these events provides a strong endorsement for the quality of the coffee delivered by our new brewers. Last quarter we shared that Community Coffee will also be joining the system as a partner brand. The production of K-Cup pod or Community began this month and our license pods will be available on keurig.com and at retail nationwide later this year. In addition to adding new brands, we have had great success in driving growth in existing brands. McCaf\u00e9 which you will recall joined the Keurig System as a licensed brand a few years ago was the fastest growing brand in Single-Served Coffee this past quarter.  Shifting to cold beverages, we again grew or held market share across the vast majority of our portfolio. In carbonated soft drinks, we grew dollar consumption by 11% in the quarter and are holding on slightly expanding the substantial share gain we achieved over the past two-plus years.  This past July 4 holiday represented the 23rd consecutive holiday period in which KDP grew carbonated soft drinks market share. We are doing this by leveraging the strength and differentiation of our portfolio, successful innovations such as Dr Pepper and Cream Soda which was recently ranked by IRi as the Number 1 food and beverage Pacesetter for 2021, as well as exceptional in market execution and effective marketing.  CORE Hydration and Snapple are two examples of strength in our non-carbonated portfolio. Both of which has been held, backed by supply chain disruptions last year. CORE is the fastest growing brand in the Premium Unflavored Water Category this year with dollar consumption dropped off for the 1% in quarter two. Snapple is benefiting from investment in the Snapple Brand Refresh launched last year, which continues to attract younger consumers and build momentum for the brand, driving dollar market share growth year-to-date.  We have also had great success in driving growth for our partner brands with Polar Seltzer becoming the fastest growing and a suite in sparkling water brand in the category, advancing market share two full share points to 10.3% in the quarter and continuing to grow. In addition, Vita Coco grew over 16% in the quarter, advancing Household penetration by 9% and dollar share by more than 4 points to 54%.  Within cold beverages, packaged beverages net sales were up 13%, driven by both higher pricing and increased volume mix, with elasticity impact remaining modest. Increased marketing investment and strong in-market execution supported continued market share growth in the quarter. For Beverage Concentrates, net sales were up 23%, reflecting higher pricing, including the benefit of favorable timing related to trade accruals and higher volume mix.  Finally, for Latin America Beverages net sales were up an impressive 27%, balanced between higher net pricing and increased volume mix, supported by a significant increase in marketing investment. Elasticity for the segment remained modest. Latin America beverages has been a consistent with strong performance, led by a portfolio with strong brands such as Pe\u00f1afiel, Clamato, Squirt and Mott's. On a two year basis net sales in the quarter increased more than 50%.  During the quarter we announced an agreement to acquire the global rights to the non-alcohol, ready-to-drink cocktail brand Atypique, which is a highly unique offering in the emerging and fast growing non-alcohol coffee segment in Canada. This new platform complements our strong and successful ready-to-drink alcohol portfolio in Canada and provides KDP with incremental growth opportunities in an exciting new category.  We completed our minority investment in Tractor Beverage and signed an exclusive sales agreement to expand innovation in food service channel, leveraging the strength of our fountain foodservice sales team. As we announced last quarter, Tractor offers the first and only certified organic, non-GMO beverage solutions specifically tailored to food service operators.  While these are great examples of the small but strategic investments, let me turn it over to Bob to provide some commentary on the broader capital allocation and M&A opportunity for the KDP, which will be one of his key focus areas as Executive Chairman. \nBob Gamgort : We have built a business that has been pressure tested by macro volatility and prices, and has emerged stronger and nimbler than ever. In the past four years we had distinguished ourselves as strong operators, with the great majority of our team members solely focused on running the business with excellence. Value of that approach is reflected in our industry leading TSR since merger, and our attractive forward-looking organic algorithm.  We also know we have an opportunity to enhance organic shareholder returns through the strategic deployment of our discretionary free cash flow. We have a proven capability to build new brands and create exceptional value for KDP and our partners by adding new brands into our growth machine.  Look no further than the examples discussed during today's call such as CORE, Polar, Vita Coco and McCaf\u00e9. Therefore it\u2019s logical for us to consider M&A as our leading opportunity in capital allocation. We employ a disciplined and rigorous process in our deal evaluation, which balances risk versus reward and understands the true underlying value of any new business to us.  We also consider a range of structures to enable us to expand our brand portfolio with M&A being one, but not the only past the filling white space. It's no secret that historically when our disciplined approach has faced lofty valuation expectations from sellers, the outcome has been fewer acquisitions and more strategic partnership for KDP. We are good with that as we know that no deal for an alternative partnership structure is far better than an overpriced acquisition. The environment for high growth companies has shifted in recent months and we are encouraged with the conversations that we're having with several potential partners. We believe that our proven success in creating value for our partners, combined with a more challenging investor environment for these entrepreneurs has begun to narrow the bid ask spread. Time will tell if that improves action ability.  All potential M&A investments compete against the asset this team knows best, which is the value of our own equities. As noted in our press release, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $34.51 per share. We see opportunistic share buybacks and investment in our internal growth projects as attractive uses of our capital.  Finally, we believe the size of our discretionary cash flow, which is expected to be $5 billion over the next 3 years, distinguishes us as a unique investment opportunity.  Ozan will now provide some commentary on our outlook for the balance of the year before we moved to Q&A. \nOzan Dokmecioglu : As indicated in our press release, we are including our guidance for full year constant currency net sales growth to the low double digit range, while reaffirming adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the mid-single digit range. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share growth in the second half to reach the high single digit range, driven by strong performance in the fourth quarter, leading to meet single digit growth for the year.  Supporting this guidance, we continue to expect the following unchanged assumptions. Adjusted interest expense is expected to approximate $430 million. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected in the 22% to 22.5% range and diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion, assuming no additional share buybacks.  Finally, given the current environment, I want to share some detailed perspective on our expectations for the second half. At this point in the year we are lastly covered on input costs and have good line of sight to price realization. Quarter four is expected to be the strongest of the year in terms of earnings per share delivery, while quarter three is expected to look much like quarter two.  The primary driver of the phasing of our second half results is the timing relationship between pricing and inflation. You will recall that inflation in quarter one was 15%, which advanced to more than 17% in quarter two. We expect inflation to be even higher in quarter three, largely driven by our Green Coffee positions. Because we are getting the benefit of more pricing in our quarter three P&L, we expect to offset this incremental inflation to deliver EPS growth for the quarter.  In quarter four we expect the rate of inflation versus the prior year to be roughly half the rate of quarter three. As a reminder, we will be lapping the significant spike in inflation we experience in quarter four last year and we realize the full benefits of pricing already taken, which will enable us to offset inflation and deliver margin improvement in the fourth quarter.  Finally, I want to acknowledge that tomorrow I will assume the CEO role of KDP. I'm honored to take on the leadership of this great company, including our 27,000 dedicated employees and I greatly appreciate the endorsement and support of Bob, our Board of Directors and our Executive Leadership Team.  Looking ahead, I couldn't be more excited about the growth potential I see for KDP in this new chapter. We have the opportunity to leverage all the progress we've made since the merger to further strength our brands, enhance our go-to-market capabilities, build our world class team. Doing this will enabled us flawlessly to executive our strategic plan, while standing ready to proactively capitalize on new opportunities that come our way and face whatever macro challenges arise, just as we did in our last chapter. The KDP team has distinguished itself as flexible, nimble and fast and it is these key attributes that will again differentiate us moving forward.  I will now hand it back to the operator for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks operator. Good morning, everyone.\nA - Bob Gamgort: Good morning, Bryan.\nA - Maria Sceppaguercio: Good morning, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: Two questions for me. One, Ozan as we\u2019re kind of looking into the back half of the year and just thinking about pricing and inflation, are there plans for further price increases [Technical Difficulty] or cold beverages in the back half of the year or have you pretty much [Technical Difficulty] put in all the price that you need to cover inflation, then I have a follow up. \nA - Ozan Dokmecioglu: Yeah, good morning and thanks Bryan for the question. I mean, first of all it is also important to note that \u2013 because as you know pricing obviously goes hand-in-hand with inflation and what's going on in the macroeconomic environment.  So we are largely covered on the input cost side and also we have a good line of sight into the price realization for the remainder of the year, so it's a very clear for us. So at the same time, as we have announced several times, there is starting throughout 2021 as well as early this year, as well as early quarter too.  We have taken several pricing actions across our portfolio, both in the Coffee Systems, as well as the Cold Beverages. So those pricing activities went through and as you know, we don't necessarily talk with regards to future action plans in terms of the detailed pricing action plans, but as we have done previously, depending on how the macroeconomic situation is going to trend, along with the inflation, we are ready to take further action plans as well as activate several other levers that we have been managing our business.  As you know, we don\u2019t necessarily just focus or fixate on one lever. We have multiple levers in our business starting with the volume, combined with the mix management and obviously productivity delivery in relation to the pricing and our business investment. So we have several levers available for us in order to pool and continue to weather the storm as we have been doing the last four years.  Therefore if the macroeconomic situation changes along with the expectations that we have, we will take the necessary measures in order to put further pricing. \nBryan Spillane: Thanks Ozan. And then Bob, just a question for you. Just to pick up on the comments you made about the M&A environment, and you know I guess my question is, when you're thinking about or looking at high growth companies you know a year ago or two years ago, you know there\u2019s a lot of focus on revenue model, revenue multiples, TAMs and like profit and cash flow were sort of taking a backseat I think in terms of a lot of the valuation discussions that were being had.  So has that changed also? Like if you're looking at high growth companies, is there may be more of a consideration now in terms of profitability and cash flow than maybe where those seller's expectations were and how they were trying to value the businesses before. \nBob Gamgort: Yeah. I mean Bryan from our respective we've always focused on profiting cash and what we looked at in any potential partnership where there\u2019s an acquisition or a seed investment is what's the long term growth of that business, and then in our business model, what kind of profit and cash could we generate off of that once we put it in place and have the synergies and access to the resources of those companies. For us, the valuation has always been based on long term profit and cash. Having said that, we were in theory competing against people who were just looking at revenue multiples, and you know as recent as a year ago we had conversations with potential sellers who are talking about valuations they were getting from stats or the fact that they could go out to the IPO market. Those are very different valuation models in what we're looking at. So as we said, we remain disciplined, we always have \u2013 we'd rather have an alternative partnership structure as we\u2019ve done with Polar and Vita Coco and McCaf\u00e9. We're up for acquisitions and we've done some of those which have performed well in our business, but we\u2019re not going to overpay and we've never been caught up in valuing anything on a multiple sales. \nBryan Spillane: Alright, thanks Bob! Thanks Ozan!\nA - Bob Gamgort: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nBonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nBob Gamgort: Good morning!\nBonnie Herzog : I have a question on your coffee business. I guess I'd be curious to hear you know some more color on the consumer and whether you're seeing any signs of down trading within the home actually that could affect your pod attach rates going forward.  You know during the quarter I think your pod attach rate decelerated a bit. So wondering you know how big of a risk you see for lower coffee pod consumption in an economic slowdown with you know thinking about the possibility that consumers start brewing ground coffee in their homes, even if they do owned you know one of your brewers, or you know Bob thinking about your comments. Do you expect you know something like that to be more than offset by incremental consumers switching back to consuming coffee in their home. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. \nA - Bob Gamgort: Yeah, so the first part is household penetration is the biggest driver of growth in our coffee system more than attachment rate. So as we\u2019ve talked about, we had 3 million households per year for the past two years. We saw that as above our long term trend of 2 million households and so our expectation you know continues to be that 2 million is the right growth rate for us on household penetration.  Attachment rate has been remarkably consistent over the long term. The only difference is during COVID we saw an increase in attachment rate that has been working down gradually from that peak to pre-COVID levels, and there's a little bit of noise even in this quarter of a bigger re-opening where people are going out of homes, and that's actually been \u2013 as strong as our business has been, that's actually been a negative factor that's been weighing against our strong growth that we've had and that's just about \u2013 in our opinion that\u2019s just about done. We're almost back to fully open. Interestingly the one area that hasn\u2019t reopened fully are offices, and so still in front of us is the opportunity to recapture even more growth in our office coffee business. With regard to tradeoffs, we have studied this a number of different ways and I referenced in our prepared remarks that we went back and looked at the last recession across all CPG categories. Coffee and CSDs are among the most resilient if not the most resilient in all of CPG for the reasons that I talked about, and we don't see any tradeoff in between coffee, forms of coffee within the home.  You see over the quarter, a slight increase in private label pods, and some reduction in premium pods. If you recall during COVID the reverse is true. So it's almost a reversion back to the long term trends, and even if that does happen, remember, we make the great majority of private label pods, so this is a business that\u2019s well protected against all forms within single-serve and honestly, we do not see tradeoffs between other forms of coffee. And if there is a real recessionary impact, we know that people go from out-of-home consumption to in-home consumption, which would be a net positive for us. \nBonnie Herzog : Alright, it makes sense. Thank you so much.\nA - Bob Gamgort: Okay, thanks Bonnie. \nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jeffries. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy: Great! Thanks. Good morning everyone.\nA - Bob Gamgort: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin Grundy: You must have touched on SG&A \u2013 good morning Bob. SG&A came in a bit higher. I think there was some mention of higher marketing spending in PB [ph], I think to a lesser extent in coffee, so sort of a near term dynamic to that. Maybe talk about what you're coping with in that line item SG&A and then within that investment levels. And then Ozan and for both of you, Bob as well, what's the right level for advertising and marketing. I mean you guys reduced as did many others within the industry during COVID. At one point it was 6% as a percent of sales. We\u2019re still kind of stacking in the low 4% area. Maybe just comment on what the right level is longer term and when you expect to get back to that? Thank you. \nA - Ozan Dokmecioglu: Yeah, thanks Kevin. So I will start with the first part of your question. When you look to our SG&A line, in fact there are quite a bit of pluses or minuses, and it's a line that a lot of cost elements actually get together and we consolidate. So let me try to expand a little bit, provide for or shedding a little bit further light. First of all, we have the transportation and warehousing expenses that are included in that line, which obviously has been one of the most volatile and inflationary spending line item for us, and TNW, Transportation and Warehouse represents almost the biggest increase factor in the SG&A line that you are looking at. And the second big bucket that we have in that SG&A line is as you said, advertisement and promotion, and we had some good levels of increase in our investments behind our brands, so that also included in that line. And also the whole labor across our company with the exception of manufacturing or production related, which is core elements of cost of goods sold.  That leaves us with all the frontline employees we have, including our DSD, including our merchandizing, including our white collar, and as you know labor especially on the frontline has been one of the most pressurized line items throughout the year starting last year, so that increase is also included. And the remainder of all the overheads, whatever left that are included in that line that tended having any inflationary factor. And as you see, there are so many pluses or minuses in that line, but I think these are the four factors that do explain the majority of the increase in that line. Bob, onto you.\nBob Gamgort: Yeah, talking about the marketing piece, you know COVID forced a wide number changes in the way we do business and obviously I\u2019m not going to recap all of those. Some of those experiences were good learnings that we want to continue in the future, some of them are saying, okay, we want to go back to the way things were. So I think it's really reset the level of marketing spend that\u2019s required. We were all forced to work with lower marketing spend. It caused us to be much more sensitive about return on investment and dial up our understanding in terms of a precision marketing perspective, and I think the best evidence that we were able to do that successfully is the strength of our brand portfolio. I mean that's really where the proof is in the end. So for us it became much more a focus on which brands we want to support in the portfolio at critical levels, what tactics do we want to use, and then how do we use all of the data that\u2019s now available, to be able to target more precisely and course correct and it's worked pretty well. As we say all that, if you think about the strat plan that we took you through in Investor Day, our long term plan is to continue and increase marketing over time. The reason is because we have more ideas for growth than we're supporting right now and that's a great position to be in, and so I think as we continue to whether all of the pluses and minuses of inflation and recession and the volatility over the \u2013 you know the past three years is nothing like any of us experienced over our careers, we will increase our marketing spend overtime. But as we sit here today, the strength of our brands really speaks to our ability to navigate this environment. \nKevin Grundy: Very good. Thank you both. \nA - Bob Gamgort: Okay. \nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great! Thanks! Good morning, everyone.\nA - Bob Gamgort: Good morning.\nQ - Lauren Lieberman: I wanted to talk a bit about brewer sales and you called out the brewer volumes were down 4% versus that, I think it was 29% comparison, so you know to some extent very much as expected, but of course retailers have been signalling you know challenges with small household appliances, discretionary items of the sort. So just wanted to get your perspective on brewer sales for the balance of the year, knowing again you've got some pretty big comparisons.  What you're seeing if anything from retailers in terms of push back on inventory and you know about \u2013 I know you referenced again the traditional run rate of 2 million households per year, but does that still feel feasible? Is it an on average rate over time. Is that really a feasible addition in this economic environment, thanks \u2013 for this year in particular. \nA - Bob Gamgort: Yeah, let me start with the last part, because that is the most important part, which is household penetration, and it feels like every year we get asked questions about why this is the year we can't do 2 million households. And so I would say there's no indication, whether it's COVID, COVID recovery, recession, inflationary environment that our ability to add 2 million households per year is very steady, its strong and we have a ton of confidence in that, and that leads us to more than 10 years of household penetration growth at the size of the available market, so that area I think we're in good shape on. The second point I would make and we say this even when we have incredibly strong brewer sales quarters. The correlation between brewer sales and household penetration is loose. There's some correlation over time; it's not what you might think, and clearly on a quarter-to- quarter basis there's zero correlation. And we did point out just last year, we added 3 million new households to the system and we sold more than 11 million brewers. That tells you that the majority of brewers sold are replacements or upgrades and we certainly have been giving people reason to upgrade with the addition of new features and benefits and new design. So with that in context, when we said 3 million household a year ago, 2 million this year, 11 million brewers a year ago, year-to-date our brewer sales are down approximately 5%, and we\u2019re up on a two year basis or at the same time period in the 30% to 40% range.  You know we're taking pricing on brewers, but we see inflation there like everything else. Would I expect some elasticity effect? Definitely! But I see it not impacting household penetration. I see it as impacting some of the upgrade cycles, which we\u2019re perfectly fine with. As you know we don't really make money on brewers. It's really in service and household penetration and coffee consumption, so all of our core assumptions are very much intact. \nQ - Lauren Lieberman: Fantastic! Thank you! And then just the one question though on retail inventory levels, pushback from retailers and get to just topical, would love to hear your perspective on that.\nA - Bob Gamgort: Yeah, it is definitely an issue, and as you know the shift in consumer behavior caught many of them by surprise and so they are overstocked with goods that have long lead times that are not selling, but we're in a category that sells incredibly well. As I said, we're talking about 5% volume change off of 11 million units. This is still a very good growth and profit opportunity. Again, most of the brewers \u2013 most of the retailers that sell brewers also sell pods and they know that every time they convert household over from drip coffee maker to single-serve, the great majority of those future pod purchases go to the retailer who sold the brewers, and is a significant trade up in profitability for them. So this is not the area they are looking to cut back on the inventory right now. This is one \u2013 still one of the best growth and profit drivers in their entire store, but this is not where they are focusing. \nQ - Lauren Lieberman: Okay, fantastic! Thanks so much!\nA - Bob Gamgort: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. \nChris Carey : Hi! Good morning. \nA - Bob Gamgort: Good morning.\nChris Carey : My question is specifically on coffee pricing. So just looking at pricing in the coffee segment in the quarter, it does look like partner and private label pricing remains pretty minimal to KDP even though we can see these partner and private label operators raising pricing much more substantially and track channels. Can you maybe just give any commentary on when you think the overall pricing within the coffee segment will be more consistent with the pricing that we're seeing in the overall category, which is quite a bit higher? Then I just have a quick follow up. \nOzan Dokmecioglu: Sure, thanks for the question Chris. Probably it would be verified focus on our own, let\u2019s say owned and licensed products in terms of the pricing and how much we are seeing through the realization. As I was articulating a couple of minutes ago, we have taken a few pricing actions across our portfolios and in coffee, which is owned and licensed brands that we control obviously the pricing and the full \u2013 for the economics of it, including our brewers as Bob just that. So we have taken a few pricing actions last year which was in 2021 and early this year in quarter one and towards the end of quarter two as well.  And when you look to the numbers that we have announced for example on the quarter, you would see that almost 6% of the price realization that we have successfully achieved across our coffee portfolio. And when you look to the either IRi or recent data you will see several action plans that the other industry players decided to take place.  And when you look to the private label part, which is also important, but as Bod said, let\u2019s make sure that we remind ourselves that we still produce for the most part of the private label category, that we also contribute to the economic benefits off that at the same time.  Private label initially was a little slow to take the pricing actions, but when you look to the latest data, it is \u2013 that path also has gone up. Therefore, overall we are very happy with the resiliency of our owned and licensed brands that have shown and how the consumption is moving across the portfolio with regards to the pricing actions.  And as we have seen, there are \u2013 besides the single-sever, the other segments or the sub-segments of coffee have also taken the pricing in line with more or less what's going on, especially with regards to the coffee bean prices. \nBob Gamgort: Let me just add one things to it, just as a reminder of a concept that we discussed in the past which I will admit is a bit complex, and that is the fact that our pricing realization on our P&L understates that gap between what you're seeing at retail and what we're seeing, in large part \u2013 not the only reason, but in large part because we're not responsible for the Green Coffee purchases of our partners.  So the biggest inflationary impact within coffee right now is the Green Coffee impact. Our partners take that on their P&L. We are just doing the conversion for them and so what happens is, it understate what feels like our pricing realization relative to the market, because a big part of the cost structure does not flow through our P&L. \nChris Carey : That\u2019s very helpful. Then just a quick follow-up on coffee as well. The expectation last quarter was for pod shipments to remain below consumption. It does feel like high volumes came in out of expectations this quarter. Did you catch up quicker than you had thought? Are you in a better position going into the back half than you were thinking at the end of last quarter, and is there any over shipment dynamics that we should be keeping in mind as we go into the back half as well. So thanks for just contextualizing the supply chain and the pipeline as well. \nBob Gamgort: Yeah, it\u2019s means the good news is, as we said in our markets is that our coffee recovery was accelerated. We made an investment to do so. It cost us on the P&L to do so, but we're in a position as we exited Q2, where we have good inventories, full service to our partners and our retailors, and what that enabled us to do is to catch up in the second quarter on some of that missed opportunity in the first quarter, and so we said that we were going to be below consumption in the first half, and then above consumption in the second half. We\u2019ve largely caught up in the second quarter as a result of that. So going forward our consumption and shipments should be largely balanced. \nChris Carey : Okay thanks a lot. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.\nBrett Cooper: Thanks, just two questions from me. On coffee, can you update us on South Carolina, how much capacity that opens up to you and how that fits into your ability to bring new customers? And then second question Bob, you company M&A is just focused primarily on portfolio expansion relative to prior comments, which were large. Just wanted to check in on how [Audio Gap] relative to just an example? Thanks.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: So, thanks for the question Brett. So let me take the first part with regards to the South Carolina coffee plant that we have been building. As we said previously, Spartanburg is now planned for 2023 and as a reminder, as we also spoke before, we begun in fact production of the cake-up on our first line in June 2021. But let\u2019s make sure that this is a large facility that will take multi-year startups due to the several lines that we are putting. And as we discussed before, there was some slow ramping up due to 100% related to coffee \u2013 COVID, excuse me, issues that primarily our line manufacturer that ran into in Europe that we have agreed to buy.  Therefore, lowest times are being catching up as we speak right now, when we are still in schedule to put the lines, some of the lines into service, starting 2023 onwards, which was in-line with our expectations. \nBob Gamgort: Yeah, I think on the M&A question, your point is correct, and that the conversation that we just had was primarily on portfolio white space, but I would say that our total landscape that we\u2019re looking out across the whole M&A opportunity is portfolio white space, new platforms, geographic expansion and new capability that\u2019s very consistent with what we talked about Investor Day, still is the case. And you know my examples of our two most recent small, but very strategic add-ons into peak is both filling in white space, it\u2019s also Canada and we've got these great Canadian Mexican businesses that we can add to through M&A.  And then Tractor is a great example as well, because again it\u2019s a while space yeah, but it really leverages new capabilities and new strength in our fountain foodservice business. We\u2019ve got the capabilities that we can built with scale. So we look across that entire landscape and are finding that you know as I said in my remarks are in quite a few I think very productive conversations. \nOperator: Was there a follow-up Mr. Cooper? \nBrett Cooper : No. Thank you. \nBob Gamgort: Alright, thanks Brett. \nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. \nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. I have a question and two follow-ups please. First for Bob, how are the pod rates of growth away from home versus home phasing. And then, can you speak about the volume mix, but now more focused on the Packaged Beverage business. Are you seeing any signs of a more cautious consumer on the premium water side, and as you exit the quarter any signs of increased velocity. And I understand you don't break down volume mix, but in this environment perhaps mix is running faster than volumes in this scenario and in any signs of reversal ahead of us.  And the one for Ozan, just so I'll put it out there, on the phasing of margins that you provided, the mass of the guidance implies that obviously both gross margin and EBITDA margin will likely down in Q3 year-over-year, but perhaps you know to make the math work for the guidance you mean flat in Q4. Just want to make sure that we got it right. Thank you. \nBob Gamgort: Yeah, let me start with the cold beverage, right, in terms of any trade down or any change in behavior, we are not seeing anything right now. I mean theoretically as we move into recession you would see small outlets, convenient channels being more pressured, gas prices always do that and you know you\u2019d see more sensitivity around packs and sizes. But if there's any change its very, very small right now. So nothing that we would be able to report that\u2019s concrete based on the data. It's all things that may happen in the future.  With regard to coffee, we don't specifically break out our away from home business as the side, but it's been a heavy drag on our business since the beginning of COVID. In fact we gave some to you back. We gave some very specific numbers about how much it was down and how much of a drag that put on our total growth.  The recovery on that has been incremental quarter-by-quarter, but we\u2019re still well below pre-COVID levels on your away-from-home business, so that represents a future upside to us. And the mobility that I was talking about before is really people consuming In-Home versus consuming out-of-home, in other words like a coffee shop, and that\u2019s still recovering back to the COVID levels, but it's all built into our expectations and all of our guidance reflects everything I just talked about there. \nAndrea Teixeira: You want to talk about the margin piece?\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Yes exactly. So it's important to reiterate what I just said a few minutes ago, that we are on the input cost size, we are largely covered for the remainder of the year, which we do also have a good line of sight with regards to the price realization, so these are three important points. And when we step back and look at it, because you asked the question on the margins, this is important in relation, the inflation and the pricing and the whole productivity equation. In quarter one, inflation came in at 15%. As we just spoke, quarter two inflation came in at 17% and we also expect quarter three to be the, to be a little higher than in quarter two. So we are getting a more pricing benefit in Q3 due to the actions that we have successfully implemented, that would be \u2013 that would help us to offset these further inflation headwinds that we are expecting to happen in our business.  At the same time, we also expect quarter four inflation to be more or less half rate versus what we have seen in Q3 versus last year. Why? Because last year in quarter four, in 2021 we have seen a significant spike across the board in most of our input costs that drove a big inflationary number, so we are lapping against that one. So that\u2019s very important to figure that out as well.  So what does this leave us? This leaves us that we will realize the full benefits of pricing that we have already taken, which will enable us to offset the inflation and the deliver the margin growth in quarter four. That would be our expectations in order to sum up by second half, as well as they split it in quarter three and the quarter four. \nAndrea Teixeira: Super helpful. Just one classification, the rate or the index that Bob had said away-from-home, is that still about 80% of what it was back just prior to COVID? \nBob Gamgort: We haven\u2019t talked about that specifically, so. \nAndrea Teixeira: Okay, that\u2019s fare. Thank you, I\u2019ll pass it on. \nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nSteve Powers: Hey! Thanks, good morning. Two questions from me. The first one, the first one of Beverage Concentrates, maybe a little bit of clarification. I was hoping you could parse out more of the underlying run rate in realized pricing versus the trade of accrual impacts this quarter. You know a clarification if that trade accrual impacted something that we should expect will reverse or if it's discreet this quarter. \nOzan Dokmecioglu: No, hi Steve! Let me take the Beverage Concentrates unit specific trade accrual question. First of all, it would be helpful to talk about that. The trade accruals are basically part of our normal daily lives. Some quarter is plus, some quarter is negative. And obviously we do our best in order to estimate as close as possible, but as you know, because of all these ever changing macroeconomic situations, really making it difficult to get almost 100% procession, first of all that\u2019s the reason of the trade accrual. And the trade accrual timing also accounted, let\u2019s say for more than or around half of the price realization that we have experienced in quarter two and as we have seen in our numbers.  Do we expect this to trade, to come back as a negative in the other quarters? No, absolutely that's not the expectation or that\u2019s not the reality of what's going to happen. \nSteve Powers: Okay, perfect! That's helpful. And then I guess, I think Bob or Ozan either one, just to build on Lauren\u2019s question on household penetration, I think you addressed 2022 comprehensively. As you said you get asked every year, so just looking ahead to the extent that consumer confidence and discretionary spending continues to come under pressure. I guess I'm just curious how the playbook changes on household acquisitions in a truer recessionary environment? Whether that comes in terms of just a more precise value messaging, a different emphasis on the assortment of brewers you might bring to market or however you think about that playbook in a recession to the extent that it is different. \nBob Gamgort: Yes, excellent question. You see that our capabilities here, we have a wide range of price points on brewers and we have a wide range of price points on pods and we cover the entry level price point all the way up to now Super Premium as we talked about on the call, dollar per pod coffee all the way down to entry level price points which is around $0.30 per cup. And the same applied to brewers, where we have brewers that are now around $50 right, they used to be below $50, but due to inflation around $50, all the way up to about $200 to $250. So we are able to take that range and have the right mix by retailer and target consumers with the appropriate price points.  The other point is that, if you think about these new brewers that we are introducing, that are much more capable of producing specialty coffee and actually iced coffee, we're able to deliver messages that you have a valued message to them. Because the price comparison between cups and ground is one things, but the price comparison between cups and out-of-home coffee is dramatic; it's 5x to 10x, the cost to go out-of-home.  So the more that we\u2019re able to allow consumers to replicate the coffee shop experience in-home, it actually allows us a dial up that\u2019s away from home to in-home value messaging in our communications is very compelling. So we have a number of options within our tool kit and it's exactly the way we\u2019re thinking about it, the way that you laid it out. \nSteve Powers: Yeah, okay, thank you very much, that helps. I appreciate it. \nBob Gamgort: Okay.\nOperator: The last question today will come from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead. \nRobert Ottenstein: Great! Thank you very much. Just wondering if you can give us an update on the CFO search and maybe remind us you know what you're looking for in terms of experience and skill set. And then there's also been some other management changes, maybe just kind of give us a sense of you know what the team looks like today? The kind of changes that you've made and how you see the organization from a senior management perspective going forward? Thank you. \nOzan Dokmecioglu: Yeah, good morning, Robert. So let me take the CFO part and a couple of follow-up to your questions on that line. First of all, we are aware, we wanted to be with regards to the CFO search, and as we said before, we are looking forward to recruit a world class CFO that not only will manage the today\u2019s complexity and the size of our business for the \u2013 but for also the future that we are building, the modern beverage company. So that\u2019s important and it\u2019s going well.  At the same time, I am also happy to say and we are fortunate to have a deep bench of talent and have a very skilled and experience executive. In fact George is sitting next to me today on this call, and George Lagoudakis as we have announced publicly stepping in on as Interim CFO. So that\u2019s very important to note. So there in no any gap and we carry the experience, as well as the necessary knowledge to perform the duties without creating any gap.  With regards to the other positions that we may be looking for, as well as the internal promotions that took place, at this point in time lets be clear on one thing; we do not have any open position. We have people on the jobs that we will be either looking for external or the promotions that took place on an internal basis, and there will be a healthy handle where when we have the external candidates in place. So it's not a situation that someone left the positions open and we are looking to recruit externally. So that's important to make sure that the continuity is 100% there. \nRobert Ottenstein: And then just in terms of the CFO, I mean there\u2019s CFO's who are more financially oriented and other ones that are more operationally oriented. Any thoughts along those lines? \nOzan Dokmecioglu: I mean it is \u2013 absolutely, I agree with you. It is important to focus on the CFO and the necessary credentials and the knowledge and the experience, but there's also another factor that we should not forget, which would be the overall financing team that supports the CFO. When we step back and look at it to the several, the several finance leadership team executives that we have KDP today, all those roles being occupied and serviced by the really world class expertise.  Therefore we do have a very strong finance team below the CFO, which definitely helpful to perform the CFO activities, and we are not necessarily looking for to grab or find one specific expertise. What matters for us is to be able to operate on a cross functional basis across our company, and most importantly contribute to the growth agenda of our company that we are very excited given all the opportunities that lie ahead of us. \nRobert Ottenstein: Terrific! Thank you very much. \nOzan Dokmecioglu: You\u2019re welcome. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the company for any closing remarks. \nBob Gamgort : Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for joining this morning. If you do have any questions or follow ups, Chethan and I are around all day. Please reach out; we\u2019ll be happy to talk to you and answer any questions. Thank you very much. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Steve and good morning, everyone! The second quarter was one of significant progress for a company in a macro environment that continues to be challenging on many fronts. Broad based inflation continues to impact industry margin as pricing continues to increase, but it's not yet caught up to inflation. The good news is our brand strength has held up well in the face of new pricing, with modest elasticity impacts across our portfolio during the quarter.  With concerns having shifted to the potential for a recession, it's worth spending a moment on how our categories have performed during previous recessionary periods. During the last significant economic downturn in 2008, 2009, our lead segment, particularly carbonated soft drinks and coffee were among the CPG categories that held up best. These categories are true staples, with regular consumption behaviors and few direct substitutes, and they have the benefit from the trade down effect from out-of-home consumption to in-home consumption that frequently occurs during recession.  As we've done successfully in the past, we will continue to manage KDP against a range of potential macro outcome and believe that the all-weather business model we've created positions us well as we continue to operate in a challenging environment with significant uncertainty.  Since the formation of KDP, we have delivered great returns for our shareholders, with a four year total shareholder return in excess of 100%. Well above broad market indices and nearly all food and beverage peers. More notable is that these returns were delivered during our transition from a closely held company to a widely held one. With the public market absorbing approximately 675 million new shares into the fall, equivalent to $25 billion in market cap. With our inclusion last month in the S&P 500, along with our existing position in the NASDAQ 100, we continue to broaden our appeal.  Let me take a few minutes to remind you how the KDP business model creates value, and then let Ozan apply that framework to our Q2 results. KDP is underpinned by an attractive and competitive organic total shareholder return algorithm, driven by a flexible and scalable strategy.  Coffee Systems; our strategy is focused on attracting about 2 million new household every year into the Keurig System. While also driving revenue and profit growth among our 36 million existing Keurig households to new platforms such as connected brewers and new beverage formats and occasion. Given the size of the remaining addressable new households for the Keurig system, which we estimate at more than 50 million, we have line of sight to household growth well beyond the next 10 years.  In cold beverages, our strategies focus on driving growth in core brands through marketing and brand renovation, filling white space in our portfolio through internal innovation and external partnership, and enhancing the effectiveness of our omni-channel selling and distribution system, including our company owned direct store distribution system. The investments we have made in selling and distribution have built a stronger go-to-market capability that has a multiplier effect on our brand investment as evidenced by our consistent share growth.  In addition to our core algorithm, KDP's extraordinary free cash flow enables the potential for incremental shareholder return through strategic capital allocation. I will elaborate on this later in the call.  Ozan, over to you. We have built a business that has been pressure tested by macro volatility and prices, and has emerged stronger and nimbler than ever. In the past four years we had distinguished ourselves as strong operators, with the great majority of our team members solely focused on running the business with excellence. Value of that approach is reflected in our industry leading TSR since merger, and our attractive forward-looking organic algorithm.  We also know we have an opportunity to enhance organic shareholder returns through the strategic deployment of our discretionary free cash flow. We have a proven capability to build new brands and create exceptional value for KDP and our partners by adding new brands into our growth machine.  Look no further than the examples discussed during today's call such as CORE, Polar, Vita Coco and McCafe\u0301. Therefore it's logical for us to consider M&A as our leading opportunity in capital allocation. We employ a disciplined and rigorous process in our deal evaluation, which balances risk versus reward and understands the true underlying value of any new business to us.  We also consider a range of structures to enable us to expand our brand portfolio with M&A being one, but not the only past the filling white space. It's no secret that historically when our disciplined approach has faced lofty valuation expectations from sellers, the outcome has been fewer acquisitions and more strategic partnership for KDP. We are good with that as we know that no deal for an alternative partnership structure is far better than an overpriced acquisition. The environment for high growth companies has shifted in recent months and we are encouraged with the conversations that we're having with several potential partners. We believe that our proven success in creating value for our partners, combined with a more challenging investor environment for these entrepreneurs has begun to narrow the bid ask spread. Time will tell if that improves action ability.  All potential M&A investments compete against the asset this team knows best, which is the value of our own equities. As noted in our press release, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $34.51 per share. We see opportunistic share buybacks and investment in our internal growth projects as attractive uses of our capital.  Finally, we believe the size of our discretionary cash flow, which is expected to be $5 billion over the next 3 years, distinguishes us as a unique investment opportunity.  Ozan will now provide some commentary on our outlook for the balance of the year before we moved to Q&A. Yeah. I mean Bryan from our respective we've always focused on profiting cash and what we looked at in any potential partnership where there's an acquisition or a seed investment is what's the long term growth of that business, and then in our business model, what kind of profit and cash could we generate off of that once we put it in place and have the synergies and access to the resources of those companies. For us, the valuation has always been based on long term profit and cash. Having said that, we were in theory competing against people who were just looking at revenue multiples, and you know as recent as a year ago we had conversations with potential sellers who are talking about valuations they were getting from stats or the fact that they could go out to the IPO market. Those are very different valuation models in what we're looking at. So as we said, we remain disciplined, we always have \u2013 we'd rather have an alternative partnership structure as we've done with Polar and Vita Coco and McCafe\u0301. We're up for acquisitions and we've done some of those which have performed well in our business, but we're not going to overpay and we've never been caught up in valuing anything on a multiple sales. Good morning! Yeah, talking about the marketing piece, you know COVID forced a wide number changes in the way we do business and obviously I'm not going to recap all of those. Some of those experiences were good learnings that we want to continue in the future, some of them are saying, okay, we want to go back to the way things were. So I think it's really reset the level of marketing spend that's required. We were all forced to work with lower marketing spend. It caused us to be much more sensitive about return on investment and dial up our understanding in terms of a precision marketing perspective, and I think the best evidence that we were able to do that successfully is the strength of our brand portfolio. I mean that's really where the proof is in the end. So for us it became much more a focus on which brands we want to support in the portfolio at critical levels, what tactics do we want to use, and then how do we use all of the data that's now available, to be able to target more precisely and course correct and it's worked pretty well. As we say all that, if you think about the strat plan that we took you through in Investor Day, our long term plan is to continue and increase marketing over time. The reason is because we have more ideas for growth than we're supporting right now and that's a great position to be in, and so I think as we continue to whether all of the pluses and minuses of inflation and recession and the volatility over the \u2013 you know the past three years is nothing like any of us experienced over our careers, we will increase our marketing spend overtime. But as we sit here today, the strength of our brands really speaks to our ability to navigate this environment. Let me just add one things to it, just as a reminder of a concept that we discussed in the past which I will admit is a bit complex, and that is the fact that our pricing realization on our P&L understates that gap between what you're seeing at retail and what we're seeing, in large part \u2013 not the only reason, but in large part because we're not responsible for the Green Coffee purchases of our partners.  So the biggest inflationary impact within coffee right now is the Green Coffee impact. Our partners take that on their P&L. We are just doing the conversion for them and so what happens is, it understate what feels like our pricing realization relative to the market, because a big part of the cost structure does not flow through our P&L. Yeah, it's means the good news is, as we said in our markets is that our coffee recovery was accelerated. We made an investment to do so. It cost us on the P&L to do so, but we're in a position as we exited Q2, where we have good inventories, full service to our partners and our retailors, and what that enabled us to do is to catch up in the second quarter on some of that missed opportunity in the first quarter, and so we said that we were going to be below consumption in the first half, and then above consumption in the second half. We've largely caught up in the second quarter as a result of that. So going forward our consumption and shipments should be largely balanced. Yeah, I think on the M&A question, your point is correct, and that the conversation that we just had was primarily on portfolio white space, but I would say that our total landscape that we're looking out across the whole M&A opportunity is portfolio white space, new platforms, geographic expansion and new capability that's very consistent with what we talked about Investor Day, still is the case. And you know my examples of our two most recent small, but very strategic add-ons into peak is both filling in white space, it's also Canada and we've got these great Canadian Mexican businesses that we can add to through M&A.  And then Tractor is a great example as well, because again it's a while space yeah, but it really leverages new capabilities and new strength in our fountain foodservice business. We've got the capabilities that we can built with scale. So we look across that entire landscape and are finding that you know as I said in my remarks are in quite a few I think very productive conversations. Alright, thanks Brett. Yeah, let me start with the cold beverage, right, in terms of any trade down or any change in behavior, we are not seeing anything right now. I mean theoretically as we move into recession you would see small outlets, convenient channels being more pressured, gas prices always do that and you know you'd see more sensitivity around packs and sizes. But if there's any change its very, very small right now. So nothing that we would be able to report that's concrete based on the data. It's all things that may happen in the future.  With regard to coffee, we don't specifically break out our away from home business as the side, but it's been a heavy drag on our business since the beginning of COVID. In fact we gave some to you back. We gave some very specific numbers about how much it was down and how much of a drag that put on our total growth.  The recovery on that has been incremental quarter-by-quarter, but we're still well below pre-COVID levels on your away-from-home business, so that represents a future upside to us. And the mobility that I was talking about before is really people consuming In-Home versus consuming out-of-home, in other words like a coffee shop, and that's still recovering back to the COVID levels, but it's all built into our expectations and all of our guidance reflects everything I just talked about there. We haven't talked about that specifically, so. Yes, excellent question. You see that our capabilities here, we have a wide range of price points on brewers and we have a wide range of price points on pods and we cover the entry level price point all the way up to now Super Premium as we talked about on the call, dollar per pod coffee all the way down to entry level price points which is around $0.30 per cup. And the same applied to brewers, where we have brewers that are now around $50 right, they used to be below $50, but due to inflation around $50, all the way up to about $200 to $250. So we are able to take that range and have the right mix by retailer and target consumers with the appropriate price points.  The other point is that, if you think about these new brewers that we are introducing, that are much more capable of producing specialty coffee and actually iced coffee, we're able to deliver messages that you have a valued message to them. Because the price comparison between cups and ground is one things, but the price comparison between cups and out-of-home coffee is dramatic; it's 5x to 10x, the cost to go out-of-home.  So the more that we're able to allow consumers to replicate the coffee shop experience in-home, it actually allows us a dial up that's away from home to in-home value messaging in our communications is very compelling. So we have a number of options within our tool kit and it's exactly the way we're thinking about it, the way that you laid it out. Okay. Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for joining this morning. If you do have any questions or follow ups, Chethan and I are around all day.

            "name": "A - Ozan Dokmecioglu",
            "content": "Yeah, good morning and thanks Bryan for the question. I mean, first of all it is also important to note that \u2013 because as you know pricing obviously goes hand-in-hand with inflation and what's going on in the macroeconomic environment.  So we are largely covered on the input cost side and also we have a good line of sight into the price realization for the remainder of the year, so it's a very clear for us. So at the same time, as we have announced several times, there is starting throughout 2021 as well as early this year, as well as early quarter too.  We have taken several pricing actions across our portfolio, both in the Coffee Systems, as well as the Cold Beverages. So those pricing activities went through and as you know, we don't necessarily talk with regards to future action plans in terms of the detailed pricing action plans, but as we have done previously, depending on how the macroeconomic situation is going to trend, along with the inflation, we are ready to take further action plans as well as activate several other levers that we have been managing our business.  As you know, we don't necessarily just focus or fixate on one lever. We have multiple levers in our business starting with the volume, combined with the mix management and obviously productivity delivery in relation to the pricing and our business investment. So we have several levers available for us in order to pool and continue to weather the storm as we have been doing the last four years.  Therefore if the macroeconomic situation changes along with the expectations that we have, we will take the necessary measures in order to put further pricing. Yeah, thanks Kevin. So I will start with the first part of your question. When you look to our SG&A line, in fact there are quite a bit of pluses or minuses, and it's a line that a lot of cost elements actually get together and we consolidate. So let me try to expand a little bit, provide for or shedding a little bit further light. First of all, we have the transportation and warehousing expenses that are included in that line, which obviously has been one of the most volatile and inflationary spending line item for us, and TNW, Transportation and Warehouse represents almost the biggest increase factor in the SG&A line that you are looking at. And the second big bucket that we have in that SG&A line is as you said, advertisement and promotion, and we had some good levels of increase in our investments behind our brands, so that also included in that line. And also the whole labor across our company with the exception of manufacturing or production related, which is core elements of cost of goods sold.  That leaves us with all the frontline employees we have, including our DSD, including our merchandizing, including our white collar, and as you know labor especially on the frontline has been one of the most pressurized line items throughout the year starting last year, so that increase is also included. And the remainder of all the overheads, whatever left that are included in that line that tended having any inflationary factor. And as you see, there are so many pluses or minuses in that line, but I think these are the four factors that do explain the majority of the increase in that line. Bob, onto you."

            "name": "A - Bob Gamgort",
            "content": "Good morning, Bryan. Okay, thank you. Yeah, so the first part is household penetration is the biggest driver of growth in our coffee system more than attachment rate. So as we've talked about, we had 3 million households per year for the past two years. We saw that as above our long term trend of 2 million households and so our expectation you know continues to be that 2 million is the right growth rate for us on household penetration.  Attachment rate has been remarkably consistent over the long term. The only difference is during COVID we saw an increase in attachment rate that has been working down gradually from that peak to pre-COVID levels, and there's a little bit of noise even in this quarter of a bigger re-opening where people are going out of homes, and that's actually been \u2013 as strong as our business has been, that's actually been a negative factor that's been weighing against our strong growth that we've had and that's just about \u2013 in our opinion that's just about done. We're almost back to fully open. Interestingly the one area that hasn't reopened fully are offices, and so still in front of us is the opportunity to recapture even more growth in our office coffee business. With regard to tradeoffs, we have studied this a number of different ways and I referenced in our prepared remarks that we went back and looked at the last recession across all CPG categories. Coffee and CSDs are among the most resilient if not the most resilient in all of CPG for the reasons that I talked about, and we don't see any tradeoff in between coffee, forms of coffee within the home.  You see over the quarter, a slight increase in private label pods, and some reduction in premium pods. If you recall during COVID the reverse is true. So it's almost a reversion back to the long term trends, and even if that does happen, remember, we make the great majority of private label pods, so this is a business that's well protected against all forms within single-serve and honestly, we do not see tradeoffs between other forms of coffee. And if there is a real recessionary impact, we know that people go from out-of-home consumption to in-home consumption, which would be a net positive for us. Okay, thanks Bonnie. Good morning, Kevin. Okay. Good morning. Yeah, let me start with the last part, because that is the most important part, which is household penetration, and it feels like every year we get asked questions about why this is the year we can't do 2 million households. And so I would say there's no indication, whether it's COVID, COVID recovery, recession, inflationary environment that our ability to add 2 million households per year is very steady, its strong and we have a ton of confidence in that, and that leads us to more than 10 years of household penetration growth at the size of the available market, so that area I think we're in good shape on. The second point I would make and we say this even when we have incredibly strong brewer sales quarters. The correlation between brewer sales and household penetration is loose. There's some correlation over time; it's not what you might think, and clearly on a quarter-to- quarter basis there's zero correlation. And we did point out just last year, we added 3 million new households to the system and we sold more than 11 million brewers. That tells you that the majority of brewers sold are replacements or upgrades and we certainly have been giving people reason to upgrade with the addition of new features and benefits and new design. So with that in context, when we said 3 million household a year ago, 2 million this year, 11 million brewers a year ago, year-to-date our brewer sales are down approximately 5%, and we're up on a two year basis or at the same time period in the 30% to 40% range.  You know we're taking pricing on brewers, but we see inflation there like everything else. Would I expect some elasticity effect? Definitely! But I see it not impacting household penetration. I see it as impacting some of the upgrade cycles, which we're perfectly fine with. As you know we don't really make money on brewers. It's really in service and household penetration and coffee consumption, so all of our core assumptions are very much intact. Yeah, it is definitely an issue, and as you know the shift in consumer behavior caught many of them by surprise and so they are overstocked with goods that have long lead times that are not selling, but we're in a category that sells incredibly well. As I said, we're talking about 5% volume change off of 11 million units. This is still a very good growth and profit opportunity. Again, most of the brewers \u2013 most of the retailers that sell brewers also sell pods and they know that every time they convert household over from drip coffee maker to single-serve, the great majority of those future pod purchases go to the retailer who sold the brewers, and is a significant trade up in profitability for them. So this is not the area they are looking to cut back on the inventory right now. This is one \u2013 still one of the best growth and profit drivers in their entire store, but this is not where they are focusing. Sure. Good morning."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Ozan Dokmecioglu",
            "content": "Good morning everyone! Bob provided an overview of our successful growth strategy, and I want to spend a moment to highlight our quarter two results in the context of our overall strategy.  On a total company basis, net sales advanced 13.5%. With net sales up more than 10% and volume mix up more than 3%, with all four segments posting strong growth. KDP adjusted gross profit increased 10%, while adjusted gross margin declined 180 basis points, reflecting the timing gap that remains between pricing and inflation.  During the quarter we experienced cost of goods sold inflation across all inputs, including ingredient, packaging and manufacturing labor. In addition, we also experienced a much higher rate of inflation in transportation and warehousing. At the time of robust consumer demand and SG&A inflation was also significantly higher.  Taken together, our total inflation for the quarter exceeded 17%, which was more than two percentage points higher than the 15% we experienced in quarter one. As a result, adjusted operating income declined slightly, a significantly higher cost to serve offset the 10% increase in adjusted gross profit in the quarter. All-in, adjusted net income increased approximately 3%, reflecting a lower adjusted tax rate and lower interest expense. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also increased 3% to $0.39, and we closed out the first half of this year very much as expected. Free cash flow for the quarter at $600 million continued to be strong, driving a free cash flow conversion ratio of 108%.  Let's shift to a discussion of segment performance starting with Coffee System. I'm happy to report that our Coffee Supply recovery plan has been completed ahead of schedule, with part manufacturing output restored to levels that will provide full service to our partners and retailors. While that success came at a cost, as we discussed last quarter, it sets us up for a strong second half of the year. For the quarter, Coffee Systems net sales were up 9%, driven by both higher pricing and increased volume mix, reflecting strong sequential improvement in sales.  For the quarter pod sales grew 10%, led by both higher pricing and higher volume mix, while brewer sales grew almost 6%, led by higher pricing that was partially offset by lower volume due to the 29% volume growth comparison in quarter two last year.  Marketing investment in quarter was up slightly. Single-serve coffee category pricing was up nearly 9% during the quarter based on IRi as coffee brands and retailers mitigate the impact of inflation, particularly in coffee with new price actions. We have noted a few industry reports direct linking category volume deceleration in IRi with pricing actions and attempting to draw conclusions on elasticity.  In addition to our typical caviar that syndicated data reflects only about 50% of total pod sales, let me also caution you that there is significant noise in the category numbers in quarter two. Due to the impact of supply chain issues, including out of stocks and significantly reduced category, promotional and marketing support.  There are also some timing impacts from consumer mobility with regard to out-of-home coffee consumption during the quarter. As we move into the second house, we continue to expect a strong dollar consumption growth in the category with some ongoing volume pressure related to increased consumer mobility compared to the prior year. This is consistent with our prior expectations that at-home attachment rates would eventually return to pre-COVID levels and we are continuing to see this occur.  At the same time, we are seeing improvement in office-coffee, which we expect to gradually improve over time. In this dynamic environment we continue to track the relationship between single-served coffee pricing and other forms of coffee, including out-of-home coffee. Despite the increase in single-serve pricing, the gaps between core months have remained consistent as all-forms of coffee have increased in price.  Let me shift to some highlights of coffee system growth drivers. In quarter three, we will nationally launch our new K-Cafe smart brewer, which in one machine, the representation of the cumulative enhancements we have made to curate brewers over the past five years.  The K-Cafe smart is enabled by our connected Brewer ID Technology that recognizes the pod and adjusts the brew for a perfect Cup. It also features multi-screen technology, which enables a wider range of temperature and strength, including our best ever Brew Over Ice coffee delivery yet.  This new brewer also incorporates a new multi speed product to enable consumers to create capuchins, lattes and other specialty coffees, guided by an interactive recipe experience, located in the Keurig App. Taken together, the K-Cafe\u0301 Smart enables consumers to create a coffee shop experience in home, at a fraction of the cost, and with greater appeal to younger households.  With our continued smart technology development, we remain on track to reach 1 million connected households in the next few years, which continues to unlock new platforms such as SMART Auto-Delivery for pods. The enhancement to Keurig System Quality and innovation continue to be recognized by key industry players and we are pleased to announce the addition of two new Super Premium Coffee brands into the system with Intelligentsia and BLK & Bold joining our roster of Keurig partners.  In addition to enabling Keurig system to reach premium consumers, with price points of around $1 per pod, the participation of these events provides a strong endorsement for the quality of the coffee delivered by our new brewers. Last quarter we shared that Community Coffee will also be joining the system as a partner brand. The production of K-Cup pod or Community began this month and our license pods will be available on keurig.com and at retail nationwide later this year. In addition to adding new brands, we have had great success in driving growth in existing brands. McCafe\u0301 which you will recall joined the Keurig System as a licensed brand a few years ago was the fastest growing brand in Single-Served Coffee this past quarter.  Shifting to cold beverages, we again grew or held market share across the vast majority of our portfolio. In carbonated soft drinks, we grew dollar consumption by 11% in the quarter and are holding on slightly expanding the substantial share gain we achieved over the past two-plus years.  This past July 4 holiday represented the 23rd consecutive holiday period in which KDP grew carbonated soft drinks market share. We are doing this by leveraging the strength and differentiation of our portfolio, successful innovations such as Dr Pepper and Cream Soda which was recently ranked by IRi as the Number 1 food and beverage Pacesetter for 2021, as well as exceptional in market execution and effective marketing.  CORE Hydration and Snapple are two examples of strength in our non-carbonated portfolio. Both of which has been held, backed by supply chain disruptions last year. CORE is the fastest growing brand in the Premium Unflavored Water Category this year with dollar consumption dropped off for the 1% in quarter two. Snapple is benefiting from investment in the Snapple Brand Refresh launched last year, which continues to attract younger consumers and build momentum for the brand, driving dollar market share growth year-to-date.  We have also had great success in driving growth for our partner brands with Polar Seltzer becoming the fastest growing and a suite in sparkling water brand in the category, advancing market share two full share points to 10.3% in the quarter and continuing to grow. In addition, Vita Coco grew over 16% in the quarter, advancing Household penetration by 9% and dollar share by more than 4 points to 54%.  Within cold beverages, packaged beverages net sales were up 13%, driven by both higher pricing and increased volume mix, with elasticity impact remaining modest. Increased marketing investment and strong in-market execution supported continued market share growth in the quarter. For Beverage Concentrates, net sales were up 23%, reflecting higher pricing, including the benefit of favorable timing related to trade accruals and higher volume mix.  Finally, for Latin America Beverages net sales were up an impressive 27%, balanced between higher net pricing and increased volume mix, supported by a significant increase in marketing investment. Elasticity for the segment remained modest. Latin America beverages has been a consistent with strong performance, led by a portfolio with strong brands such as Pen\u0303afiel, Clamato, Squirt and Mott's. On a two year basis net sales in the quarter increased more than 50%.  During the quarter we announced an agreement to acquire the global rights to the non-alcohol, ready-to-drink cocktail brand Atypique, which is a highly unique offering in the emerging and fast growing non-alcohol coffee segment in Canada. This new platform complements our strong and successful ready-to-drink alcohol portfolio in Canada and provides KDP with incremental growth opportunities in an exciting new category.  We completed our minority investment in Tractor Beverage and signed an exclusive sales agreement to expand innovation in food service channel, leveraging the strength of our fountain foodservice sales team. As we announced last quarter, Tractor offers the first and only certified organic, non-GMO beverage solutions specifically tailored to food service operators.  While these are great examples of the small but strategic investments, let me turn it over to Bob to provide some commentary on the broader capital allocation and M&A opportunity for the KDP, which will be one of his key focus areas as Executive Chairman. As indicated in our press release, we are including our guidance for full year constant currency net sales growth to the low double digit range, while reaffirming adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the mid-single digit range. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share growth in the second half to reach the high single digit range, driven by strong performance in the fourth quarter, leading to meet single digit growth for the year.  Supporting this guidance, we continue to expect the following unchanged assumptions. Adjusted interest expense is expected to approximate $430 million. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected in the 22% to 22.5% range and diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion, assuming no additional share buybacks.  Finally, given the current environment, I want to share some detailed perspective on our expectations for the second half. At this point in the year we are lastly covered on input costs and have good line of sight to price realization. Quarter four is expected to be the strongest of the year in terms of earnings per share delivery, while quarter three is expected to look much like quarter two.  The primary driver of the phasing of our second half results is the timing relationship between pricing and inflation. You will recall that inflation in quarter one was 15%, which advanced to more than 17% in quarter two. We expect inflation to be even higher in quarter three, largely driven by our Green Coffee positions. Because we are getting the benefit of more pricing in our quarter three P&L, we expect to offset this incremental inflation to deliver EPS growth for the quarter.  In quarter four we expect the rate of inflation versus the prior year to be roughly half the rate of quarter three. As a reminder, we will be lapping the significant spike in inflation we experience in quarter four last year and we realize the full benefits of pricing already taken, which will enable us to offset inflation and deliver margin improvement in the fourth quarter.  Finally, I want to acknowledge that tomorrow I will assume the CEO role of KDP. I'm honored to take on the leadership of this great company, including our 27,000 dedicated employees and I greatly appreciate the endorsement and support of Bob, our Board of Directors and our Executive Leadership Team.  Looking ahead, I couldn't be more excited about the growth potential I see for KDP in this new chapter. We have the opportunity to leverage all the progress we've made since the merger to further strength our brands, enhance our go-to-market capabilities, build our world class team. Doing this will enabled us flawlessly to executive our strategic plan, while standing ready to proactively capitalize on new opportunities that come our way and face whatever macro challenges arise, just as we did in our last chapter. The KDP team has distinguished itself as flexible, nimble and fast and it is these key attributes that will again differentiate us moving forward.  I will now hand it back to the operator for your questions. Sure, thanks for the question Chris. Probably it would be verified focus on our own, let's say owned and licensed products in terms of the pricing and how much we are seeing through the realization. As I was articulating a couple of minutes ago, we have taken a few pricing actions across our portfolios and in coffee, which is owned and licensed brands that we control obviously the pricing and the full \u2013 for the economics of it, including our brewers as Bob just that. So we have taken a few pricing actions last year which was in 2021 and early this year in quarter one and towards the end of quarter two as well.  And when you look to the numbers that we have announced for example on the quarter, you would see that almost 6% of the price realization that we have successfully achieved across our coffee portfolio. And when you look to the either IRi or recent data you will see several action plans that the other industry players decided to take place.  And when you look to the private label part, which is also important, but as Bod said, let's make sure that we remind ourselves that we still produce for the most part of the private label category, that we also contribute to the economic benefits off that at the same time.  Private label initially was a little slow to take the pricing actions, but when you look to the latest data, it is \u2013 that path also has gone up. Therefore, overall we are very happy with the resiliency of our owned and licensed brands that have shown and how the consumption is moving across the portfolio with regards to the pricing actions.  And as we have seen, there are \u2013 besides the single-sever, the other segments or the sub-segments of coffee have also taken the pricing in line with more or less what's going on, especially with regards to the coffee bean prices. So, thanks for the question Brett. So let me take the first part with regards to the South Carolina coffee plant that we have been building. As we said previously, Spartanburg is now planned for 2023 and as a reminder, as we also spoke before, we begun in fact production of the cake-up on our first line in June 2021. But let's make sure that this is a large facility that will take multi-year startups due to the several lines that we are putting. And as we discussed before, there was some slow ramping up due to 100% related to coffee \u2013 COVID, excuse me, issues that primarily our line manufacturer that ran into in Europe that we have agreed to buy.  Therefore, lowest times are being catching up as we speak right now, when we are still in schedule to put the lines, some of the lines into service, starting 2023 onwards, which was in-line with our expectations. Thank you. Yes exactly. So it's important to reiterate what I just said a few minutes ago, that we are on the input cost size, we are largely covered for the remainder of the year, which we do also have a good line of sight with regards to the price realization, so these are three important points. And when we step back and look at it, because you asked the question on the margins, this is important in relation, the inflation and the pricing and the whole productivity equation. In quarter one, inflation came in at 15%. As we just spoke, quarter two inflation came in at 17% and we also expect quarter three to be the, to be a little higher than in quarter two. So we are getting a more pricing benefit in Q3 due to the actions that we have successfully implemented, that would be \u2013 that would help us to offset these further inflation headwinds that we are expecting to happen in our business.  At the same time, we also expect quarter four inflation to be more or less half rate versus what we have seen in Q3 versus last year. Why? Because last year in quarter four, in 2021 we have seen a significant spike across the board in most of our input costs that drove a big inflationary number, so we are lapping against that one. So that's very important to figure that out as well.  So what does this leave us? This leaves us that we will realize the full benefits of pricing that we have already taken, which will enable us to offset the inflation and the deliver the margin growth in quarter four. That would be our expectations in order to sum up by second half, as well as they split it in quarter three and the quarter four. No, hi Steve! Let me take the Beverage Concentrates unit specific trade accrual question. First of all, it would be helpful to talk about that. The trade accruals are basically part of our normal daily lives. Some quarter is plus, some quarter is negative. And obviously we do our best in order to estimate as close as possible, but as you know, because of all these ever changing macroeconomic situations, really making it difficult to get almost 100% procession, first of all that's the reason of the trade accrual. And the trade accrual timing also accounted, let's say for more than or around half of the price realization that we have experienced in quarter two and as we have seen in our numbers.  Do we expect this to trade, to come back as a negative in the other quarters? No, absolutely that's not the expectation or that's not the reality of what's going to happen. Yeah, good morning, Robert. So let me take the CFO part and a couple of follow-up to your questions on that line. First of all, we are aware, we wanted to be with regards to the CFO search, and as we said before, we are looking forward to recruit a world class CFO that not only will manage the today's complexity and the size of our business for the \u2013 but for also the future that we are building, the modern beverage company. So that's important and it's going well.  At the same time, I am also happy to say and we are fortunate to have a deep bench of talent and have a very skilled and experience executive. In fact George is sitting next to me today on this call, and George Lagoudakis as we have announced publicly stepping in on as Interim CFO. So that's very important to note. So there in no any gap and we carry the experience, as well as the necessary knowledge to perform the duties without creating any gap.  With regards to the other positions that we may be looking for, as well as the internal promotions that took place, at this point in time lets be clear on one thing; we do not have any open position. We have people on the jobs that we will be either looking for external or the promotions that took place on an internal basis, and there will be a healthy handle where when we have the external candidates in place. So it's not a situation that someone left the positions open and we are looking to recruit externally. So that's important to make sure that the continuity is 100% there. I mean it is \u2013 absolutely, I agree with you. It is important to focus on the CFO and the necessary credentials and the knowledge and the experience, but there's also another factor that we should not forget, which would be the overall financing team that supports the CFO. When we step back and look at it to the several, the several finance leadership team executives that we have KDP today, all those roles being occupied and serviced by the really world class expertise.  Therefore we do have a very strong finance team below the CFO, which definitely helpful to perform the CFO activities, and we are not necessarily looking for to grab or find one specific expertise. What matters for us is to be able to operate on a cross functional basis across our company, and most importantly contribute to the growth agenda of our company that we are very excited given all the opportunities that lie ahead of us. You're welcome."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Earnings Call for the First Quarter of 2022. This conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's; Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Steve Alexander. Mr. Alexander please go ahead. \nSteve Alexander: Thank you and hello everyone. Thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we issued our press release for the first quarter of 2022. If you need a copy, you can get one on our website in the Investors section. Consistent with previous quarters, today we'll be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, excluding items affecting comparability.  Beginning with this quarter we will also exclude the impact of foreign currency translation from our adjusted results. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability is not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance.  Here with us today to discuss our first quarter 2022 results are; KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our CFO, Ozan Dokmecioglu; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio.  And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC.  And with that I'll hand it over to Bob. \nBob Gamgort: Thanks Steve and good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results reflect different stories of challenges faced and progress achieved across our portfolio. One common thread however is, the continued strong consumer demand for our brands as demonstrated by consumption growth and share expansion. In Coffee Systems the story is one of accelerated supply recovery to enable us to fuel the continued strong growth of the Keurig System, following our addition of six million new households in the past two years.  As discussed previously the December-January Omicron wave caused widespread labor outages that resulted in supply shortfalls in coffee pods, at a time when consumer demand was at a record high. As the first quarter progressed, we accelerated our efforts to rebuild pod manufacturing capacity, increase finished goods inventories and improve service levels.  Our first coffee pricing actions intended to mitigate inflation in Latin America Beverages. Even though we\u2019re still in the peak portion of the inflation curve the timing of pricing is lagging inflation which leads the pressure on margin. Looking forward we believe there will be an inflection point in which high current costs begin to lap elevated year ago costs, leading to lower year-over-year inflation comparison.  At the same time pricing actions will have caught up which we expect will lead to margin recovery. As we look forward, we believe our cold beverage portfolio will continue to perform well throughout the balance of the year and we are confident that our coffee production output and inventory levels will have fully recovered by the end of Q2. Therefore, we have increased our 2022 full year guidance for net sales from mid-single digits to high single digits, while maintaining our EPS guidance at mid-single-digit growth.  Looking at Q1 earnings and EPS, Ozan will discuss the key drivers of results in the quarter. But the biggest headlines are the relationship between inflation and pricing and the investments we've made in the business, particularly in coffee. Taken together we delivered modest net earnings growth and adjusted EPS in-line with a year ago. During the quarter inflation which was significant across the board particularly for inputs such as coffee, resins, aluminum and sweeteners, as well as transportation and labor approached 15% which is higher than we expected entering the year.  Within our segments, Packaged Beverages again reported another standout quarter with net sales advancing 13% on volume growth of 5% and pricing up 8%. In-market performance also remained very strong with market share growth registered in almost 90% of our cold beverage portfolio led by continued strength of CSDs, along with seltzers, coconut waters, teas, apple juice and fruit drinks.  Performance of Snapple and Core continued to improve from the material availability issues faced in 2021 with both brands posting improved market share results in the quarter and upcoming innovation and marketing plans for this summer expected to accelerate this progress. Bai continues to recover from supply issues last year, posting consumption growth for the past four consecutive quarters. Margins for Packaged Beverages were impacted by escalating inflation which outpaced the timing of pricing, as well as ongoing transportation and labor challenges. We expect new pricing actions already announced to the trade to be in market, late in the second quarter.  In Coffee Systems, we undershipped consumption with negative KDP net sales for the quarter, comparing to 3.6% K-Cup pod consumption growth as measured by IRI. You'll recall from our fourth quarter discussion that record consumer demand for K-Cup pods was challenged by production shortfalls, as Omicron-related labor availability issues combined with the delayed start-up of our new Spartanburg manufacturing facility pressured our capacity. We prioritized our service recovery during the quarter to partners and customers at the expense of our owned and licensed brands to rebuild our internal inventory levels. While that was the right decision from a Keurig ecosystem perspective, it came at a significant cost to KDP in terms of both revenue and profit. We made significant progress during the quarter in restoring our coffee supply chain with K-Cup pod production, finished goods inventory and customer service all improving by double-digits. We now expect a full inventory recovery by the end of Q2, enabling Coffee Systems to return to normal service levels in the second half of this year. Supporting this recovery is new manufacturing equipment we expect to come online as the year progresses, which will ensure supply to meet strong consumer demand in the second half of this year and in 2023. As we continue to work on coffee recovery and rebuild our finished goods inventory in the second quarter, we expect pod shipments to remain below consumption. That trend is expected to reverse in the second half of the year with shipments outpacing consumption, as improved internal inventory positions will enable us to refill customer and partner inventories and return to driving our owned and licensed brands through marketing and promotion programs. This will result in a much improved top and bottom line performance for Coffee Systems in the second half of this year. Pricing in coffee has also increased to mitigate the impact of inflation. Single-serve coffee category pricing increased 5.4% in the quarter, as pricing actions continued to flow through at retail. KDP-manufactured brands pricing advanced 6.7% in the quarter. Given the escalating inflationary pressures, we recently announced another round of pricing that will be in market late in the second quarter. While navigating through the well-discussed macro challenges over the past two years, we have also maintained our focus on driving long-term sustainable growth through innovation, renovation and partnerships across the full KDP portfolio. Although these topics have received less airtime in our recent conversations, I'd like to take a few minutes to do so now starting in Coffee Systems. You'll recall that in 2021, we debuted a new platform for Keurig with the launch of the K-Supreme Plus SMART connected brewer. This is the first of many new connected brewers to come including the K-Cafe smart later this year. Consumer response to our connected brewer continues to be positive and we believe that we will have more than one million connected households in the next few years. In 2021, we also launched our popular Brew Over Ice feature on one of our smallest footprint brewers, our K-Slim + ICED coffeemaker, which debuted as a Target and keurig.com exclusive. More than half of K-Slim + ICED purchasers were households completely new to the Keurig system. We will be expanding retail availability of this model late this summer. Next week, we are launching the new K-Cafe Essentials model, our first brewer less than $100 that offers coffee lattes and cappuccinos through a built-in milk frother. This brewer has scored an average 4.8 out of five stars in our consumer and influencer review programs and we look forward to its debut as a Walmart exclusive. In terms of coffee innovation, in January, we launched a Snickers-flavored K-Cup pod under The Original Donut Shop brand as an expansion of our flavored platform. This new product is already a top-selling variety where distributed with a national rollout planned for later this year. Lastly we are pleased to announce the Community Coffee the largest family-owned retail coffee brand in the US will be returning as a Keurig partner brand at the end of this year. The relaunch of our partnership after a five year hiatus is a testament to the quality, innovation, service and consumer insights the Keurig ecosystem can provide to coffee brands. We look forward to working together with Community -- the Community team to help accelerate their brand growth. Shifting to cold beverages. We're excited to announce that we have agreed to make a minority equity investment in Tractor Beverage to expand innovation in the fountain and foodservice channels. Available nationally in Chipotle restaurants since 2020, Tractor offers the first and only certified organic non-GMO beverage solution, specifically tailored to foodservice operators. To enable Tractor to achieve widespread distribution across multiple food service channels, we have also agreed to enter into an exclusive sales agreement with Tractor that leverages the strength of our fountain foodservice sales team. KDP cold beverage innovation and renovation continues to be robust and we have recently launched Snapple zero sugar; and Snapple Elements, a new line of teas and juice drinks inspired by the elements fire, rain and air. Snapple Elements line is made from all-natural ingredients with no artificial flavors or sweeteners and less sugar than traditional Snapple beverages. Snapple zero sugar is a rebranding of Diet Snapple, similar to what we've done with several key CSD brands, resulting in increased velocity. During the quarter, we launched two new CSDs, Simple 7UP, a new 7UP line with clean simple ingredients and reduced sugar; as well as Sunkist mango orange to expand our fast-growing Sunkist brand lineup. Finally, returning this summer as a limited-time offer is a fan favorite Dr Pepper Dark Berry, including zero sugar variety. The launch will feature promotional packaging tied to this summer's release of Jurassic World Dominion. I'll now turn it over to Ozan to take you through more highlights of the quarter.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thanks, Bob and good morning everyone. I will start with a brief review of our first quarter business and financial highlights and then turn to our outlook for 2022. As usual, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis. And as Steve mentioned, beginning this quarter, our adjusted results now exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. As mentioned earlier, our top line was again quite strong for the quarter, as Packaged Beverages advanced a significant 13%, along with very strong growth for Beverage Concentrates and Latin America Beverages. As expected, Coffee Systems net sales declined in the quarter, as the segment prioritized shipments to branded and private label partners and to rebuilding inventory, which improved sequentially in the quarter. All in, net sales advanced 6.1% to $3.1 billion, with net price realization up 6.3% and volume mix down slightly. Excluding Coffee Systems, net sales advanced 12.8% and volume mix was up 4.6%. On a two-year basis, net sales for the first quarter increased 17.5% versus 2020 with all four segments growing. Adjusted gross profit was up 1% in the quarter, benefiting from the impacts of the significant pricing actions we put in place and productivity savings. Escalating inflationary pressures, combined with ongoing supply chain disruption and labor constraints were significant offsets, as the timing of pricing continues to lag inflation. As a result, adjusted gross margin declined 280 basis points versus year ago to 52.7%. Adjusted operating income declined 1.2% in the quarter, reflecting the significant impact of inflation, including the ongoing impacts of macro supply chain and labor challenges, partially offset by our strategic asset investment and other benefits that enabled continued investment in the business. Adjusted operating margin declined 170 basis points to 23.8%. On a two-year, basis adjusted operating income increased 6.7% versus 2020. Despite the inflationary pressures, we maintained our investment in brand marketing. In fact, while we reduced the spending in Coffee Systems due to supply limitations, we increased marketing spending in our cold beverage brands by 7%. During the quarter, we also made significant investments to accelerate coffee recovery and get us back to normalized inventory positions and service levels to realize our full growth potential in the second half of 2022. Those investments were focused on additional labor, warehousing and transportation capacity. As Bob mentioned, we prioritized partner and customer brands over our owned and licensed brands for the long-term benefit of the ecosystem, but with a short-term profit and revenue hit to us in the quarter. These incremental investments were paid for in part by a $38 million benefit in the quarter from our strategic asset investment program, along with a $28 million benefit in non-cash stock compensation expense and a $28 million benefit in legal fees. Adjusted net income in the quarter increased approximately 1%, primarily reflecting lower interest expense, partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.33 in the quarter, essentially even with year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter at $632 million continued to be strong, driving a free cash flow conversion ratio of over 133%. During the quarter, further strengthening our cash position, we received a $350 million settlement from the successful resolution of our litigation against BodyArmor, which was used to reduce financial obligations. At the end of the quarter, unrestricted cash on hand totaled $592 million. As announced earlier this month, we completed a $3 billion strategic refinancing given the current interest rate environment. Since the time of the merger nearly four years ago, we have generated significant cash flow and rapidly delevered. This strategic refinancing further strengthens our balance sheet and liquidity profile with extended maturities and more favorable rates that will lower our interest expense. Turning now to our segment performance in the quarter. Packaged Beverages again delivered double-digit net sales growth with the first quarter up more than 13% driven by favorable net price realization and higher volume mix, the latter reflecting continued market share expansion and strong in-market execution across the portfolio. On a two-year basis net sales increased an impressive 21% versus 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 16.9% reflecting the strong net sales growth and productivity combined with the strategic asset investment program benefit of $38 million.  These benefits were significantly offset by the unfavorable impacts of escalating inflation and macro supply chain disruption and labor constraints that drove higher-than-anticipated costs to serve the continued strong consumer demand we experienced. Beverages Concentrates also posted double-digit net sales growth approximating 10% in the quarter led by favorable net price realization and higher volume mix. The volume mix performance was driven by higher fountain foodservice volume due to improving, but still recovering consumer mobility in restaurant and hospitality channels. On a two-year basis, net sales advanced almost 17% in this segment. Adjusted operating income increased 3.3% in the quarter driven by the strong net sales growth meaningfully offset by the impacts of escalating inflation and a significant increase in marketing investment. Latin America Beverages also posted double-digit growth in net sales approximating 18%, essentially, balanced between higher net price realization and increased volume mix. On a two year basis Latin America net sales increased an impressive 26% versus 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 13% reflecting the strong growth in net sales, partially offset by broad-based inflation and a significant increase in marketing investment. And finally, Coffee Systems net sales in the quarter declined 4.3%. This reflects the impact of rebuilding our internal inventory positions combined with prioritizing shipments to branded and private label partners for which we receive lower revenue recognition per pod than we do with our owned and licensed brands. In addition, Coffee Systems faced a significant comparison to the first quarter last year where net sales increased 17%. On a two year basis, Coffee Systems net sales increased 12% versus 2020. We achieved higher Coffee Systems net price realization of 3.2% in the quarter, which was driven by pricing actions taken primarily on our owned and licensed pods in late 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 combined with sequentially lower retailer fines incurred in the first quarter. Lower volume mix in the quarter of 7.5% reflected comparison to the strong 19.5% growth in the year ago period and the impact of our coffee recovery program. Consequently, pod and brewer shipment volume declined 5.2% versus a year ago comping the strong growth of 14% and 61%, respectively in the year ago period. Adjusted operating income decreased 24% in the quarter. While this performance reflected the higher net price realization we achieved it continued to lag inflation and the cost of our recovery plan. This plan which will continue through the second quarter accelerated customer service recovery to partners and retail customers quickly. However, it added significant costs during the quarter. I would like to spend a moment discussing our expectations as the year unfolds in the context of the first quarter. We expected the first quarter to be our most challenging period this year due to the timing dynamic between inflation and pricing and in comparison to quarter one last year before inflation spiked, coupled with our need to invest heavily in coffee supply. With the first quarter now behind us we continue to believe it will prove to be the toughest this year. During the quarter, we delivered strong brand growth, implemented new pricing actions, and delivered significant improvements in coffee production, customer service levels, and inventory. As we look ahead, we expect continued strong revenue growth, driven by innovation, renovation, partnerships and are pleased that we will be in the position to invest in marketing to restore full demand to our coffee business in the second half as inventories are rebuilt. As discussed this morning, accelerating coffee recovery and investing in our cold beverage marketing came at a cost in quarter one. However, we have the flexibility to leverage our strategic asset investment program and other one-time benefits to cover these investments. This puts us in position for accelerated revenue growth in second half, including unconstrained growth in coffee. Looking ahead inflation still looms as the greatest challenge and has proven difficult to forecast even for the experts. We continue to lock in coverage on all items where possible have implemented additional pricing and are ready to add more pricing if required. We have and will continue to protect our marketing investment as we believe brand strength and stability to lessen pricing elasticity is a key competitive advantage for KDP. As discussed on the last call, we also see the strategic asset investment program as an ongoing effective tool to drive marketing investment in an environment marked by significant cost pressures. Our confidence in our topline led us to increase our guidance for full year net sales growth to the high single-digit range while reaffirming our full year guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digit range. Supporting this guidance we continue to expect the following unchanged assumptions. Adjusted interest expense is expected to approximate $430 million including the benefit of our recent strategic refinancing, which was planned early this year. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected in the range of 22% to 22.5%. Diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion. Finally, while we don't provide quarterly guidance, given the current environment, I want to share that we expect the second quarter to show modest sequential adjusted earnings per share improvement versus the first quarter with more meaningful improvement in the second half. Specifically, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to strengthen during the year reaching the high single-digit range in the second half which would put us on our long-term algorithm for the period translating to mid-single-digit growth for the full year. With that, let me hand it back to Bob for some closing remarks. \nBob Gamgort: Before moving to Q&A I want to recognize Steve Alexander for his recent promotion to Vice President of Investor Relations. Many of you on this call have had the opportunity to work with Steve during his 15 years with KDP and Dr Pepper Snapple and have benefited from his strong understanding of the beverage industry. And finally, earlier this month, we announced that I will be transitioning my CEO role to Ozan at the end of July and I will remain Executive Chairman for the following two years. This transition was designed to ensure continuity of leadership and strategic direction for KDP as well as to enable dedicated focus on the new and very significant inorganic value-creation opportunity we have in front of us. I have tremendous confidence in Ozan based on working side by side with him over the past six years and I'm excited about the opportunity to continue to partner with him, the KDP executive team, and the KDP Board of Directors over the next few years. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Hi, thanks operator. Good morning everyone and congratulations to Bob to you to Ozan and Steve on all your new roles.\nBob Gamgort: Thanks Bryan.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Thank you.\nBryan Spillane: So the I guess my question -- I have a couple of questions just around Coffee Systems. One is just -- you talked about new capacity coming online. So just want to make sure we're clear about when that will be. And at what point in the year do you think that service levels will be optimized, right? Are we still six months out a year out? Just at what point do we think service levels will be normal? \nOzan Dokmecioglu: Again, good morning, Bryan. Thanks for the question. Let me start with your first question with regards to the coffee capacity and the production availability. As we announced during -- starting actually mid of last year, we were expecting some slowdown ramping up our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in the K-Cups in Spartanburg slowing down. But during our last call, we also announced that Spartanburg will be turned on primarily in 2023. So that was our stance. In the meantime, we've also gone through a significant consumption demand coming from our consumers. And as we always do starting last year onward, we actually acquired new production lines utilizing the existing technology that we have. And we are commissioning them as part of our ramp-up plans. Therefore, two-third of that capacity already went in and one-third is also going to coming online in the upcoming quarters. Therefore, we feel good where we are with regards to managing our overall coffee production capacity. And also just to add you also asked the question when we will be feeling good in terms of restoring the capacity that we will be requiring and needing. And as we spoke to during our prepared remarks, we have seen sequential monthly improvements of restoring our production capacity. That includes inventory. That includes our service levels to our partners, to our retailers as well as our owned and licensed. And we expect actually to fully restore our capacity including all those spaces sometime in quarter two. Therefore, we feel very good where we are and it took a few quarters to go back to the levels that we were requiring for. \nBryan Spillane: Thanks, Ozan. And just one follow-up just staying with coffee and pricing. We've fielded a lot of questions about consumers potentially trading down and demand elasticity. But maybe Bob could you talk a little bit about how you see pods as a relative value to coffee away from home? And is that really maybe the more sort of tangible comp especially since, coffee away from home the prices and the inflation there has been pretty meaningful. So just trying to understand if we should when we're looking at elasticities and cross-elasticities is it really away from home more so than people maybe trading up and down within the coffee aisle?\nBob Gamgort: Yes. Well I'll start Bryan with in-home, which we think is very relevant and we can talk a little bit about away from home. But we put in this strategic pricing investment over a number of years and we've had a lot of investor questions about this as well. So if you go back to 2016, before we implemented it, the cost per cup which is the relevant measure of K-Cup pods versus bag coffee for example was a $0.30 per cup premium. We lowered that to $0.20 per cup during the -- during that investment and we saw tremendous consumer response. Now we're moving up in price, but the game as you point out is really a relative game. And if you look at now the difference today between K-Cup pods and bags it's still $0.20. So we're maintaining that $0.20 differential while we're taking our pricing up which we think is the most relevant comparison. With regard to away from home, it's hard to come back with an exact number to be able to measure that against but we know that we're talking about an average price per pod or price per cup of $0.50 for K-Cup versus $0.30 for bag coffee. You're talking about a multiple of that somewhere between five and 10x depending on what you buy out at retail and that gap continues to get wider and wider. And so we see as people get concerned about pricing clearly, there's a trade-off from away from home to in-home which benefits the entire category. But our price gaps versus other forms of roast and ground coffee have stayed the same at that lower level that we guided to in 2018 2019. \nBryan Spillane: Great. Thank you.\nBob Gamgort: Okay.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. \nBonnie Herzog: Hi. Thank you and congratulations from me as well for everyone. I have a few questions this morning on your guidance. I guess, first on the top line your updated guide implies top line growth in the high single-digit range for the remaining quarters this year plus some. So I guess what gives you guys the confidence that your top line can accelerate? Especially since -- I'm thinking about your Q1 results, which were driven entirely by price realization, so I guess I'm asking about this in the context of the increasing pressures on consumers and kind of a little bit of what you just touched on as it relates to elasticities. And then on the bottom line, I guess, I'm trying to understand how you're factoring in some of the one-time items such as benefits from the gain on litigation settlement that you called out and continued sales leasebacks. I guess it seems like these did help to drive your slight EPS beat in the quarter. So how should we think about these items for the rest of the year? And how many points of growth do you expect from one-time items in your EPS guide? Thank you.\nBob Gamgort: Okay. I'll start with the top line and then I'll ask Ozan to pick up the second part of your question there. With regard to the top line, you have to pull apart the quarterly results by coffee and all other. And the all other businesses outside of coffee, so that's LAB, BC and Packaged Beverages, were up -- all up double digits. And they were up in terms of pricing, but also volume. In fact volume was up fairly substantially across those. So our confidence is not that it's just all pricing driven, as we're seeing really strong growth in both. And our expectation is that that continues. We talked about more pricing being implemented. Of course, we've built our model around elasticities and the kind of elasticities we've seen and we expect going forward. So that's where we get the confidence on the cold side. The coffee side of the business, which was a significant drag on growth in the quarter, we know, will recover substantially in the second half of the year, for a couple of reasons. One is, we made substantial investment in the first quarter to accelerate our coffee recovery. And part of those one-time benefits you talked about, were used to fund those investments and Ozan will talk about that in a minute. But that puts us -- that acceleration puts us in great shape, because as Ozan just said, we believe our customer service levels will be back to normal by the end of the second quarter, which means that we can have unconstrained sales in the second half of the year. We've been pulling back on shipments. We've also been pulling back on promotion and advertising in the first quarter. So we can go back to unconstrained demand for coffee in the second half of the year. And then the other point on coffee is, we're undershipping consumption for the first half of the year. That flips around in the second half of the year. And we have the opportunity with the increased internal inventories to restock customers, partners and then again be able to turn on the promotion and marketing. So the combination of all of those leads us to the confidence that the second half of the year will be in that high single-digit range that we guided. Ozan, do you want to talk about the investment we made off of some of those discrete benefits?\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Absolutely, absolutely. And thanks for your best wishes as well, Bonnie. So let me start with the strategic asset investment program which we also define as one-time benefits that we have incurred. First of all, as you would remember, we have been implementing these initiatives since 2019. So there is no new news or no new initiative or implementation with regards to that. So over time, we have leveraged, as I was saying, the strategic asset investment program to cover investment and the significant inflationary and macro challenges. So this is important to understand the sources and the use cases. Then we also have occasional benefits that we can utilize in exceptional times, like, this that allow us to continue to protect investment in the growth of our business, which is super important to us, so we can continue to innovate and support our brands, which is one of the reasons why our elasticities have held up to this point very nicely. Going forward, as opportunities arise, we expect to use the strategic asset investment program as an effective tool or the single factor to drive marketing and other investments when required. Exact timing of these transactions is not predictable, because we take an overall holistic perspective and on an annual basis. So that's the important part. And I'd like to take the opportunity to expand for a little -- for five seconds on the other two one-times that you have mentioned, which one of them was the stock comp benefit. Now that we have almost four years of history as a public company, we have transited to estimating our restricted stock for futures raised, as opposed to actual events, which is in line with industry practice. So both practices are 100% in line with the US GAAP, as well as how our peer group is treating this type of expenses. And on the legal fees, over the past few years, we recognize as ongoing expense costs related to our litigation against BODYARMOR. And with the settlement agreement in our favor, we simply recognize the return of our legal fees to ongoing results and that will be it. Thank you.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Thanks so much. So I was curious to talk a little bit about the go-forward in terms of the announced management changes. I mean, Bob, as you move into an Executive Chairman role, I'd love to hear a little bit about how you'll be spending your time. I know it was in the release you talked about M&A, but just where your focus areas will be. We've talked about the big kind of checkbook that you, as a company, will have at your discretion. So curious about how you'll be focusing those efforts a little bit more. And then Ozan, I mean, you and Bob have been partners since the start. But curious also as you're thinking about the path forward, things that you think you can add where you can add value in a different way than you already have been in your current position. Thanks.\nBob Gamgort: Sure. Bonnie [ph], for me, first, there's really three areas of focus as we go forward. One is continuing to lead the Board, as we've evolved the Board overtime from being closely held to widely held and that also will continue to evolve somewhat over time. And so that's an important part of my role. Second part of it is working with Ozan on the executive team to make sure that the transition is seamless, and that we continue the great momentum that we have on the organic delivery of our business and I have a ton of confidence in that. And then the third part is, to give some time and space for me to work on the inorganic opportunities in particular M&A. Wouldn't be a surprise to anyone that the last 2.5 years or so have been very intensely operationally focused, very much managing it seems like everybody in the industry from one crisis to the next. And while that's critically important and is the right priority it doesn't leave a lot of time to think about and work on the strategic aspects of the business that require a significant amount of time, investment, patience even relationship building to be able to do that properly. And so, I'm certainly looking forward to being able to have more space against that, while always being available to Ozan and the team to jump in and help as needed over the next couple of years.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Yeah. Also thanks to you as well Lauren. So, I'm sure you all know that, we have a robust strategic plan as we have all taken you through back during our Investor Day October 1st last year. And obviously I have been one of the important architects of that plan along with Bob, along with the executive leadership team as well as our Board and I'm 100% behind that strategic stance. And when you do a double click you would see that, we have great growth opportunities in Coffee Systems, doubling our business overtime by recruiting new households as well as tapping to our innovation both in the brewers as well as the coffee beverages side. And we still have some white spaces that we can fill in. When we look to the cold beverages again, we have great growth trajectory in front of us so be it via distribution making it -- making our distribution more effective more impactful as well as efficient. As Bob was saying, we have quite a bit of still white spaces in select brand groups that will get us to new consumption occasions. That includes perhaps some geographical dimensions. And Bob was also saying M&A. Therefore as you see, it's a full package in terms of the growth trajectory that we have in front of us which makes us obviously very excited and motivated. And our job is to continue to execute very successfully against this strategic planning stance and deliver the business goals that we put on us.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone and I wanted to extend my congratulations as well. First I think just housekeeping maybe on Ozan's replacement at the CFO position. Maybe just are you looking internally for that? Are you looking externally for that? I suspect it is both. Maybe just comment on sort of what attributes you're looking for that candidate maybe timing. But the broader question I have is really around investment levels. I think this is to kind of pick up a little bit on what Bonnie was getting at before excuse me just how you're balancing that with EPS growth. Because Bob, you've been really clear about your commitment to how seriously you take the EPS growth targets and the delivery has been very, very good since the merger in what's been a really volatile environment. But with the onetime items now providing some help the question is really around balance. And number one like, what's in the outlook for brand support now? And what's your willingness to sort of commit to those brand levels, or is there some element that you're possibly willing to pull back if needed to hit the EPS growth target? So just the question is really around balance what's in the guidance and your willingness to pull back if needed to deliver against the EPS growth target. Thanks for all that. I know there's a lot there.\nBob Gamgort: All right. Ozan, why don't you start off? And I'll pick up the second part.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Yeah, absolutely, and again, thank you very much as well Kevin. So, on the CFO search as we announced publicly the decision was to go outside and recruit a world-class CFO. And for the fact that -- in order to deal with the complexity of our company, but also and more importantly to bring a CFO that will be able to navigate through the future growth plus the existing complexity of our company. And that's what we are looking for. And the search has already started. And we believe that we will manage the time lines that we have communicated previously in terms of being able to recruit.\nBob Gamgort: Yeah. On your second question, I think the simple answer is we take all of our commitments seriously. And we put commitments out there in a balanced manner. So think about what we delivered over the first three years as a public company. We delivered a 15% EPS CAGR, while we accelerated growth so we beat our growth targets. At the same time we were more competitive in the marketplace as evidenced by all the share gains that we had across the board as well as accelerated household penetration on the Keurig system and we put in place a foundation that's now scalable as we move into the future. So all of those were delivered. As you could imagine, when we put that commitment out there in 2018 the world looked very different than it has over the past three years, yet we've been able to balance across all of those without optimizing one metric at the expense of the other. We were able to deliver balanced performance and that's exactly the way we look at it going forward. So one thing, I would point out is that early back in October 1, we saw a lot of challenges in the macro environment in 2022. And therefore, we said that, we would be on mid-single-digit EPS growth in 2022. We're pleased that, we did that given what has materialized since then. And now we're in this mode of balancing investment and growth. And you can see we've taken our growth expectations up. It's not just pricing driven it's volume and pricing. And we make investments in brands. As we mentioned, on our Q1 call our cold business investment in marketing was up during the quarter. Even though it was incredibly challenging quarter we spent more. And the one-timers you're talking about I would suggest we not focus on any one quarter. You have to look at those type of \u2013 I put those mostly in the category of normal business especially when you look at it over time. And we're just incredibly transparent about those. And any time they hit in one quarter we tend to over focus on those. And then we don't talk about them as a group when they're not or it's an unfavorable comparison versus a year ago. We never get any questions about those. So just look at it over the period of a year. The fact that, we have some of these items to double down on investments in our brands, as well as in accelerating our coffee recovery, allows us to have the confidence in the balanced delivery that we committed to.\nKevin Grundy: Very good. Thank you, both. Good luck.\nBob Gamgort: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning.\nBob Gamgort: Good morning, Chris.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Good morning.\nChris Carey: I just wanted to follow-up quickly on the M&A commentary Bob with your new role and then I'll ask a question on coffee. Just around M&A and priorities clearly the Tractor investment is on the smaller side, but potentially interesting over a long time period. Historically, you talked about reticence for large-scale M&A. So would we expect these types of deals to be more on your radar, or are you open to larger deals, if the category or geography fits? So kind of following up on the prior line of thinking there and then just on the coffee side of the business, I think you said that, your owned portfolio pricing was in the 6% range which is ahead of what you did in the quarter with coffee. Were there any service charges that impacted you in the quarter? And can you just expand on the partner brand pricing and when you would expect total Coffee Systems pricing to better approximate what you're doing from an owned perspective? Really, what I'm trying to get at there is just if you're pricing and whether the rest of the category is following and you're not expanding price gaps too much. Thank you so much.\nBob Gamgort: Sure. First thing is, our reticence I think is the word you used on large deals was not on large deals. Our reticence is on overpaying for large deals. And so it's not about the size. It's about the multiple. And I think that, we're in an environment now where we're seeing all kinds of valuations shift. And people \u2013 our investors are more in favor of paying for cash flow and earnings than just multiple of sales with no earnings potential in them. So that may represent some interesting opportunities. But what I would point out is that, the way we think about inorganic is across the range of partnerships like we just announced with Community, which is a huge win for Community, and a huge win for us to be working together again. And we don't need to own that business by any means to have the benefits of that. And likewise by partnering with us they win as well. We can make seed investments as we announced today on Tractor Beverage, which is small today but we will certainly accelerate it. And it's in a unique channel in fountain foodservice, which is one that we are incredibly strong, but yet haven't done a deal like this in that channel before. And then we're also looking at mid- and larger-scale M&A as well. And so we have \u2013 I would say, we have a consistent dialogue with a large number of potential partners. I can't get into the details of that, but the fact that we are in this position when we talk about businesses like Community and Tractor is good evidence that of how we think about being proactive and creative in our partnerships. With regard to coffee pricing, again, the category is up 5% or a little over 5% and we were up a little bit more than that. Again, I wouldn't overreact to any one move in the quarter. Sometimes that's mix. Actually if you break it apart further the area that has moved late is private label within pods. So premium brands have actually moved substantially. The mainstream brands where we're a heavy participant in with our owned and licensed have all moved about the same level. There was a late move in private label. But they can't avoid the price of coffee and now you're seeing pricing coming up on that. So we're not seeing any distortion in the gaps between private label mainstream and premium and pods sticking for any time period.\nChris Carey : Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi. Good morning, everyone and I will echo all the congrats and best wishes to Bob, Ozan and Steve. So, I wanted to just break down a bit on the new guidance. And for -- isn't that conservative still given that volumes will likely recover from here on the under-shipment comments in hot beverages in perhaps call it low-single at this point? And then, your price/mix should accelerate from the 6% that you posted so far. Isn't there potentially like an upside for that, or we should be thinking in the high single and with the visibility that you have now in terms of costs you're not ready to -- it's too early in the year to call a little bit better EPS given that -- given the puts and takes ahead of you? Appreciate that.\nOzan Dokmecioglu: Yeah. First of all, good morning, and thank you very much Andrea. With regards to your top -- and you also touched to the bottom line as well. So let me try to break it up. You are right we feel very bullish with regards to our top line as Bob explained the reasons. And on the basis of that, we have increased our guidance from mid to high-single-digit top line growth expectations, and there are so many proof points with regards to that. And coffee will be one of the important determinants of, especially second half kicking in after we reinstate and put all the supply chain disruptions that we have had. So -- and we are also planning to take a second round of pricing in most of our portfolio by early summer, which would be more or less in line with the peer group and the market players that we have all announced to the trade. Of course, there will be some different timing with regards to the implementation, but we feel very good with regards to our price expectations and what do all those mean and translate to our top line growth. Having said that, there's a reason why everyone is taking pricing which is the inflation factor that came in and continuing to come in higher than everyone's expectation. For example, when we step back and look and just to remind our previous communications 2021 approximately inflation came in as we announced around 7%. And we also said during our Q4 2021 call, which was like a couple of months ago, that we expect 2022 inflation to trend around low-teens. But in reality in Q1 we have faced approximately 15% inflationary pressure, which was higher than what we were expecting. And I'm sure you have heard what all other industry players have been saying, which is essentially in line with what I'm articulating right now. Therefore, true we are taking pricing. True at the same time our volumes continue to increase, coupled with our very strong in-market execution and you can see the proof point in our market share, which is around 80% of our LRB that we have either maintained or continued to gain market share. Therefore, really strong performance and delivery all around. But inflation is not stopping and we are still seeing a lag in relation of the pricing and the inflation. As you know, no one can take an anticipated inflation and pricing accordingly which on a pure math basis this means margins will continue to be under pressure as well as there will be a lag. But we also believe that towards quarter three and probably more in quarter four of this year, there will be we expect on the basis of our assumptions again an inflection point in terms of the pricing catching up to cost. And that's where the margin expansion actually will kick in from a pure math and algorithm perspective. Therefore, we believe that we have a good robust algorithm that we put out there. Inflation is real. Inflation is -- has been higher than what we were expecting. And it's nothing to do with our coverage whether we can cover or not, because there are some input cost elements that we cannot cover, no one can cover, for example, rPET, for example polypropylene that we use with regards to the material of the K-Cup pods and some parts of the transportation and labor. So you see, it's not like one or two. Therefore this is continuous levers that we pull in order to run our business as well as deliver against our algorithm. And of course, if we do see some opportunity to do better as you all know we are not going to hold back. But we think we have a good algorithm right now a balanced one that keeps us to continue to invest behind our brands and business.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, Ozan. That\u2019s fair.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge. Your line is open.\nBrett Cooper: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations to all. I had two questions if you don't mind. You've spoken about building the infrastructure to be a bigger company. I was hoping you can expand on the most important pillars that you've built or have in place that allows for that leverage. And then the second one is, you have a scaled e-commerce business in coffee, both direct to consumer and third party. So just from the outside we can't always see what's going on. I was hoping you can provide us an update on the progress you've made in preparing for the move in your cold beverage business to e-commerce and/or evolving the customer relationship to a more digital one. Thanks.\nBob Gamgort: Sure. A couple of things, Brett. First of all, on the scalability piece that you talk about, I think there are three big areas in which we've set up a business at scale. I think one is just management structure. So, we've got a management team that has the bandwidth to take on more than they have today. And our focus on North America, I think gives us a bit of an advantage here. Having managed global businesses in my past to be able to focus in one region where you have common consumers, common customers, yet a significant amount of white space for expansion is an advantage for management to be able to continue to take on more without being distracted. I think the second area where we've made significant investment in is in our distribution capabilities. And we talk about a wide range of them. But if you think about today, we announced an expansion in our fountain foodservice business. We talked about on a number of calls, Dr Pepper is the most available CSD in fountain foodservice. So we've got a really strong team but they've had a relatively small set of brands and businesses to sell. Now we're equipping them with a new brand in partnership with Tractor, where they're able to get into new territory with GMO-free organic and some really unique products to be able to expand. So it expands their toolkit. There's a good example of a great foundation that we can now scale. DSD is a very important area for us. We've made significant investment over the past three years, increased tools and capabilities. But also we've expanded our DSD breadth and depth by acquiring close to 25 independent distributors to be able to boost our system. And obviously anything that you can scale within DSD improves both your effectiveness as well as your efficiency. And then as you touched on e-comm is a really interesting area. When we put the two companies together and we showed how we were bringing the best of both to share across the business, one of the conversation was about e-comm. But in 2018 e-comm and beverage didn't seem like a big idea. Certainly it was a very significant idea during COVID. And it's one that on the cold side of the business has to build over \u2013 will build over time but it has to be through click and collect and regional delivery. Shipping liquids by UPS and FedEx is not a great business model over the long term. But we see that area rapidly evolving and we're in a really good position. Part of enabling us to do exactly that required us to go back and redefine and renegotiate a number of our distribution agreements that were not contemplated in an environment of e-comm and we've been very successful in doing that over the past now four years to set ourselves up so that we have a win-win with our distribution partners, our independent partners and yet we're able to drive e-comm to the benefit of the consumer as well as us and our partners. With regard to our coffee business, you're 100% right, we have a scaled business in e-comm. We've been very agnostic in terms of where our brands are sold on e-comm. So we're very supportive of Amazon, of walmart.com on any type of retailer.com. We share our information with them. We try to make them better. So it's not that we're in competition with them at all. In fact we know the consumers want to go online but they want to buy it from their preferred retailer. And so we enable that by doing what I just said. With regard to keurig.com we have focused it on auto reorder or reorder, and that's its primary reason for being. And also it's a good place to find SKUs that are small that are favorites of a small group of consumers who can't find them at normal retailers. We'll sell everything on there. Obviously, that's been a challenge during the supply recovery phase. We will get back to that again. And so that's a big part of it. And as you think about the one comment I made in my remarks about connected brewers and the fact that we believe that we'll have 1 million connected brewers in the next few years, that really adds additional power to an auto reorder business because you go from replenishing based on shipments to replenishment based on consumption and that is a whole different level of convenience for the consumer. And so that's why we're really bullish on that business over the long term as well.\nBrett Cooper: Great. Thanks.\nBob Gamgort: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'll hand the call back to Steve Alexander for any closing remarks. \nSteve Alexander: Great. Thank you, operator. Thanks everyone for joining us today. Maria and I are around all day. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out. We'll get back to you. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ozan Dokmecioglu",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob and good morning everyone. I will start with a brief review of our first quarter business and financial highlights and then turn to our outlook for 2022. As usual, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis. And as Steve mentioned, beginning this quarter, our adjusted results now exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. As mentioned earlier, our top line was again quite strong for the quarter, as Packaged Beverages advanced a significant 13%, along with very strong growth for Beverage Concentrates and Latin America Beverages. As expected, Coffee Systems net sales declined in the quarter, as the segment prioritized shipments to branded and private label partners and to rebuilding inventory, which improved sequentially in the quarter. All in, net sales advanced 6.1% to $3.1 billion, with net price realization up 6.3% and volume mix down slightly. Excluding Coffee Systems, net sales advanced 12.8% and volume mix was up 4.6%. On a two-year basis, net sales for the first quarter increased 17.5% versus 2020 with all four segments growing. Adjusted gross profit was up 1% in the quarter, benefiting from the impacts of the significant pricing actions we put in place and productivity savings. Escalating inflationary pressures, combined with ongoing supply chain disruption and labor constraints were significant offsets, as the timing of pricing continues to lag inflation. As a result, adjusted gross margin declined 280 basis points versus year ago to 52.7%. Adjusted operating income declined 1.2% in the quarter, reflecting the significant impact of inflation, including the ongoing impacts of macro supply chain and labor challenges, partially offset by our strategic asset investment and other benefits that enabled continued investment in the business. Adjusted operating margin declined 170 basis points to 23.8%. On a two-year, basis adjusted operating income increased 6.7% versus 2020. Despite the inflationary pressures, we maintained our investment in brand marketing. In fact, while we reduced the spending in Coffee Systems due to supply limitations, we increased marketing spending in our cold beverage brands by 7%. During the quarter, we also made significant investments to accelerate coffee recovery and get us back to normalized inventory positions and service levels to realize our full growth potential in the second half of 2022. Those investments were focused on additional labor, warehousing and transportation capacity. As Bob mentioned, we prioritized partner and customer brands over our owned and licensed brands for the long-term benefit of the ecosystem, but with a short-term profit and revenue hit to us in the quarter. These incremental investments were paid for in part by a $38 million benefit in the quarter from our strategic asset investment program, along with a $28 million benefit in non-cash stock compensation expense and a $28 million benefit in legal fees. Adjusted net income in the quarter increased approximately 1%, primarily reflecting lower interest expense, partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.33 in the quarter, essentially even with year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter at $632 million continued to be strong, driving a free cash flow conversion ratio of over 133%. During the quarter, further strengthening our cash position, we received a $350 million settlement from the successful resolution of our litigation against BodyArmor, which was used to reduce financial obligations. At the end of the quarter, unrestricted cash on hand totaled $592 million. As announced earlier this month, we completed a $3 billion strategic refinancing given the current interest rate environment. Since the time of the merger nearly four years ago, we have generated significant cash flow and rapidly delevered. This strategic refinancing further strengthens our balance sheet and liquidity profile with extended maturities and more favorable rates that will lower our interest expense. Turning now to our segment performance in the quarter. Packaged Beverages again delivered double-digit net sales growth with the first quarter up more than 13% driven by favorable net price realization and higher volume mix, the latter reflecting continued market share expansion and strong in-market execution across the portfolio. On a two-year basis net sales increased an impressive 21% versus 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 16.9% reflecting the strong net sales growth and productivity combined with the strategic asset investment program benefit of $38 million.  These benefits were significantly offset by the unfavorable impacts of escalating inflation and macro supply chain disruption and labor constraints that drove higher-than-anticipated costs to serve the continued strong consumer demand we experienced. Beverages Concentrates also posted double-digit net sales growth approximating 10% in the quarter led by favorable net price realization and higher volume mix. The volume mix performance was driven by higher fountain foodservice volume due to improving, but still recovering consumer mobility in restaurant and hospitality channels. On a two-year basis, net sales advanced almost 17% in this segment. Adjusted operating income increased 3.3% in the quarter driven by the strong net sales growth meaningfully offset by the impacts of escalating inflation and a significant increase in marketing investment. Latin America Beverages also posted double-digit growth in net sales approximating 18%, essentially, balanced between higher net price realization and increased volume mix. On a two year basis Latin America net sales increased an impressive 26% versus 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 13% reflecting the strong growth in net sales, partially offset by broad-based inflation and a significant increase in marketing investment. And finally, Coffee Systems net sales in the quarter declined 4.3%. This reflects the impact of rebuilding our internal inventory positions combined with prioritizing shipments to branded and private label partners for which we receive lower revenue recognition per pod than we do with our owned and licensed brands. In addition, Coffee Systems faced a significant comparison to the first quarter last year where net sales increased 17%. On a two year basis, Coffee Systems net sales increased 12% versus 2020. We achieved higher Coffee Systems net price realization of 3.2% in the quarter, which was driven by pricing actions taken primarily on our owned and licensed pods in late 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 combined with sequentially lower retailer fines incurred in the first quarter. Lower volume mix in the quarter of 7.5% reflected comparison to the strong 19.5% growth in the year ago period and the impact of our coffee recovery program. Consequently, pod and brewer shipment volume declined 5.2% versus a year ago comping the strong growth of 14% and 61%, respectively in the year ago period. Adjusted operating income decreased 24% in the quarter. While this performance reflected the higher net price realization we achieved it continued to lag inflation and the cost of our recovery plan. This plan which will continue through the second quarter accelerated customer service recovery to partners and retail customers quickly. However, it added significant costs during the quarter. I would like to spend a moment discussing our expectations as the year unfolds in the context of the first quarter. We expected the first quarter to be our most challenging period this year due to the timing dynamic between inflation and pricing and in comparison to quarter one last year before inflation spiked, coupled with our need to invest heavily in coffee supply. With the first quarter now behind us we continue to believe it will prove to be the toughest this year. During the quarter, we delivered strong brand growth, implemented new pricing actions, and delivered significant improvements in coffee production, customer service levels, and inventory. As we look ahead, we expect continued strong revenue growth, driven by innovation, renovation, partnerships and are pleased that we will be in the position to invest in marketing to restore full demand to our coffee business in the second half as inventories are rebuilt. As discussed this morning, accelerating coffee recovery and investing in our cold beverage marketing came at a cost in quarter one. However, we have the flexibility to leverage our strategic asset investment program and other one-time benefits to cover these investments. This puts us in position for accelerated revenue growth in second half, including unconstrained growth in coffee. Looking ahead inflation still looms as the greatest challenge and has proven difficult to forecast even for the experts. We continue to lock in coverage on all items where possible have implemented additional pricing and are ready to add more pricing if required. We have and will continue to protect our marketing investment as we believe brand strength and stability to lessen pricing elasticity is a key competitive advantage for KDP. As discussed on the last call, we also see the strategic asset investment program as an ongoing effective tool to drive marketing investment in an environment marked by significant cost pressures. Our confidence in our topline led us to increase our guidance for full year net sales growth to the high single-digit range while reaffirming our full year guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digit range. Supporting this guidance we continue to expect the following unchanged assumptions. Adjusted interest expense is expected to approximate $430 million including the benefit of our recent strategic refinancing, which was planned early this year. Adjusted effective tax rate is expected in the range of 22% to 22.5%. Diluted weighted shares outstanding are estimated to be approximately 1.43 billion. Finally, while we don't provide quarterly guidance, given the current environment, I want to share that we expect the second quarter to show modest sequential adjusted earnings per share improvement versus the first quarter with more meaningful improvement in the second half. Specifically, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to strengthen during the year reaching the high single-digit range in the second half which would put us on our long-term algorithm for the period translating to mid-single-digit growth for the full year. With that, let me hand it back to Bob for some closing remarks. Thank you. Again, good morning, Bryan. Thanks for the question. Let me start with your first question with regards to the coffee capacity and the production availability. As we announced during -- starting actually mid of last year, we were expecting some slowdown ramping up our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in the K-Cups in Spartanburg slowing down. But during our last call, we also announced that Spartanburg will be turned on primarily in 2023. So that was our stance. In the meantime, we've also gone through a significant consumption demand coming from our consumers. And as we always do starting last year onward, we actually acquired new production lines utilizing the existing technology that we have. And we are commissioning them as part of our ramp-up plans. Therefore, two-third of that capacity already went in and one-third is also going to coming online in the upcoming quarters. Therefore, we feel good where we are with regards to managing our overall coffee production capacity. And also just to add you also asked the question when we will be feeling good in terms of restoring the capacity that we will be requiring and needing. And as we spoke to during our prepared remarks, we have seen sequential monthly improvements of restoring our production capacity. That includes inventory. That includes our service levels to our partners, to our retailers as well as our owned and licensed. And we expect actually to fully restore our capacity including all those spaces sometime in quarter two. Therefore, we feel very good where we are and it took a few quarters to go back to the levels that we were requiring for. Absolutely, absolutely. And thanks for your best wishes as well, Bonnie. So let me start with the strategic asset investment program which we also define as one-time benefits that we have incurred. First of all, as you would remember, we have been implementing these initiatives since 2019. So there is no new news or no new initiative or implementation with regards to that. So over time, we have leveraged, as I was saying, the strategic asset investment program to cover investment and the significant inflationary and macro challenges. So this is important to understand the sources and the use cases. Then we also have occasional benefits that we can utilize in exceptional times, like, this that allow us to continue to protect investment in the growth of our business, which is super important to us, so we can continue to innovate and support our brands, which is one of the reasons why our elasticities have held up to this point very nicely. Going forward, as opportunities arise, we expect to use the strategic asset investment program as an effective tool or the single factor to drive marketing and other investments when required. Exact timing of these transactions is not predictable, because we take an overall holistic perspective and on an annual basis. So that's the important part. And I'd like to take the opportunity to expand for a little -- for five seconds on the other two one-times that you have mentioned, which one of them was the stock comp benefit. Now that we have almost four years of history as a public company, we have transited to estimating our restricted stock for futures raised, as opposed to actual events, which is in line with industry practice. So both practices are 100% in line with the US GAAP, as well as how our peer group is treating this type of expenses. And on the legal fees, over the past few years, we recognize as ongoing expense costs related to our litigation against BODYARMOR. And with the settlement agreement in our favor, we simply recognize the return of our legal fees to ongoing results and that will be it. Thank you. Yeah. Also thanks to you as well Lauren. So, I'm sure you all know that, we have a robust strategic plan as we have all taken you through back during our Investor Day October 1st last year. And obviously I have been one of the important architects of that plan along with Bob, along with the executive leadership team as well as our Board and I'm 100% behind that strategic stance. And when you do a double click you would see that, we have great growth opportunities in Coffee Systems, doubling our business overtime by recruiting new households as well as tapping to our innovation both in the brewers as well as the coffee beverages side. And we still have some white spaces that we can fill in. When we look to the cold beverages again, we have great growth trajectory in front of us so be it via distribution making it -- making our distribution more effective more impactful as well as efficient. As Bob was saying, we have quite a bit of still white spaces in select brand groups that will get us to new consumption occasions. That includes perhaps some geographical dimensions. And Bob was also saying M&A. Therefore as you see, it's a full package in terms of the growth trajectory that we have in front of us which makes us obviously very excited and motivated. And our job is to continue to execute very successfully against this strategic planning stance and deliver the business goals that we put on us. Yeah, absolutely, and again, thank you very much as well Kevin. So, on the CFO search as we announced publicly the decision was to go outside and recruit a world-class CFO. And for the fact that -- in order to deal with the complexity of our company, but also and more importantly to bring a CFO that will be able to navigate through the future growth plus the existing complexity of our company. And that's what we are looking for. And the search has already started. And we believe that we will manage the time lines that we have communicated previously in terms of being able to recruit. Good morning. Yeah. First of all, good morning, and thank you very much Andrea. With regards to your top -- and you also touched to the bottom line as well. So let me try to break it up. You are right we feel very bullish with regards to our top line as Bob explained the reasons. And on the basis of that, we have increased our guidance from mid to high-single-digit top line growth expectations, and there are so many proof points with regards to that. And coffee will be one of the important determinants of, especially second half kicking in after we reinstate and put all the supply chain disruptions that we have had. So -- and we are also planning to take a second round of pricing in most of our portfolio by early summer, which would be more or less in line with the peer group and the market players that we have all announced to the trade. Of course, there will be some different timing with regards to the implementation, but we feel very good with regards to our price expectations and what do all those mean and translate to our top line growth. Having said that, there's a reason why everyone is taking pricing which is the inflation factor that came in and continuing to come in higher than everyone's expectation. For example, when we step back and look and just to remind our previous communications 2021 approximately inflation came in as we announced around 7%. And we also said during our Q4 2021 call, which was like a couple of months ago, that we expect 2022 inflation to trend around low-teens. But in reality in Q1 we have faced approximately 15% inflationary pressure, which was higher than what we were expecting. And I'm sure you have heard what all other industry players have been saying, which is essentially in line with what I'm articulating right now. Therefore, true we are taking pricing. True at the same time our volumes continue to increase, coupled with our very strong in-market execution and you can see the proof point in our market share, which is around 80% of our LRB that we have either maintained or continued to gain market share. Therefore, really strong performance and delivery all around. But inflation is not stopping and we are still seeing a lag in relation of the pricing and the inflation. As you know, no one can take an anticipated inflation and pricing accordingly which on a pure math basis this means margins will continue to be under pressure as well as there will be a lag. But we also believe that towards quarter three and probably more in quarter four of this year, there will be we expect on the basis of our assumptions again an inflection point in terms of the pricing catching up to cost. And that's where the margin expansion actually will kick in from a pure math and algorithm perspective. Therefore, we believe that we have a good robust algorithm that we put out there. Inflation is real. Inflation is -- has been higher than what we were expecting. And it's nothing to do with our coverage whether we can cover or not, because there are some input cost elements that we cannot cover, no one can cover, for example, rPET, for example polypropylene that we use with regards to the material of the K-Cup pods and some parts of the transportation and labor. So you see, it's not like one or two. Therefore this is continuous levers that we pull in order to run our business as well as deliver against our algorithm. And of course, if we do see some opportunity to do better as you all know we are not going to hold back. But we think we have a good algorithm right now a balanced one that keeps us to continue to invest behind our brands and business."

            "name": "Bob Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks Steve and good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results reflect different stories of challenges faced and progress achieved across our portfolio. One common thread however is, the continued strong consumer demand for our brands as demonstrated by consumption growth and share expansion. In Coffee Systems the story is one of accelerated supply recovery to enable us to fuel the continued strong growth of the Keurig System, following our addition of six million new households in the past two years.  As discussed previously the December-January Omicron wave caused widespread labor outages that resulted in supply shortfalls in coffee pods, at a time when consumer demand was at a record high. As the first quarter progressed, we accelerated our efforts to rebuild pod manufacturing capacity, increase finished goods inventories and improve service levels.  Our first coffee pricing actions intended to mitigate inflation in Latin America Beverages. Even though we're still in the peak portion of the inflation curve the timing of pricing is lagging inflation which leads the pressure on margin. Looking forward we believe there will be an inflection point in which high current costs begin to lap elevated year ago costs, leading to lower year-over-year inflation comparison.  At the same time pricing actions will have caught up which we expect will lead to margin recovery. As we look forward, we believe our cold beverage portfolio will continue to perform well throughout the balance of the year and we are confident that our coffee production output and inventory levels will have fully recovered by the end of Q2. Therefore, we have increased our 2022 full year guidance for net sales from mid-single digits to high single digits, while maintaining our EPS guidance at mid-single-digit growth.  Looking at Q1 earnings and EPS, Ozan will discuss the key drivers of results in the quarter. But the biggest headlines are the relationship between inflation and pricing and the investments we've made in the business, particularly in coffee. Taken together we delivered modest net earnings growth and adjusted EPS in-line with a year ago. During the quarter inflation which was significant across the board particularly for inputs such as coffee, resins, aluminum and sweeteners, as well as transportation and labor approached 15% which is higher than we expected entering the year.  Within our segments, Packaged Beverages again reported another standout quarter with net sales advancing 13% on volume growth of 5% and pricing up 8%. In-market performance also remained very strong with market share growth registered in almost 90% of our cold beverage portfolio led by continued strength of CSDs, along with seltzers, coconut waters, teas, apple juice and fruit drinks.  Performance of Snapple and Core continued to improve from the material availability issues faced in 2021 with both brands posting improved market share results in the quarter and upcoming innovation and marketing plans for this summer expected to accelerate this progress. Bai continues to recover from supply issues last year, posting consumption growth for the past four consecutive quarters. Margins for Packaged Beverages were impacted by escalating inflation which outpaced the timing of pricing, as well as ongoing transportation and labor challenges. We expect new pricing actions already announced to the trade to be in market, late in the second quarter.  In Coffee Systems, we undershipped consumption with negative KDP net sales for the quarter, comparing to 3.6% K-Cup pod consumption growth as measured by IRI. You'll recall from our fourth quarter discussion that record consumer demand for K-Cup pods was challenged by production shortfalls, as Omicron-related labor availability issues combined with the delayed start-up of our new Spartanburg manufacturing facility pressured our capacity. We prioritized our service recovery during the quarter to partners and customers at the expense of our owned and licensed brands to rebuild our internal inventory levels. While that was the right decision from a Keurig ecosystem perspective, it came at a significant cost to KDP in terms of both revenue and profit. We made significant progress during the quarter in restoring our coffee supply chain with K-Cup pod production, finished goods inventory and customer service all improving by double-digits. We now expect a full inventory recovery by the end of Q2, enabling Coffee Systems to return to normal service levels in the second half of this year. Supporting this recovery is new manufacturing equipment we expect to come online as the year progresses, which will ensure supply to meet strong consumer demand in the second half of this year and in 2023. As we continue to work on coffee recovery and rebuild our finished goods inventory in the second quarter, we expect pod shipments to remain below consumption. That trend is expected to reverse in the second half of the year with shipments outpacing consumption, as improved internal inventory positions will enable us to refill customer and partner inventories and return to driving our owned and licensed brands through marketing and promotion programs. This will result in a much improved top and bottom line performance for Coffee Systems in the second half of this year. Pricing in coffee has also increased to mitigate the impact of inflation. Single-serve coffee category pricing increased 5.4% in the quarter, as pricing actions continued to flow through at retail. KDP-manufactured brands pricing advanced 6.7% in the quarter. Given the escalating inflationary pressures, we recently announced another round of pricing that will be in market late in the second quarter. While navigating through the well-discussed macro challenges over the past two years, we have also maintained our focus on driving long-term sustainable growth through innovation, renovation and partnerships across the full KDP portfolio. Although these topics have received less airtime in our recent conversations, I'd like to take a few minutes to do so now starting in Coffee Systems. You'll recall that in 2021, we debuted a new platform for Keurig with the launch of the K-Supreme Plus SMART connected brewer. This is the first of many new connected brewers to come including the K-Cafe smart later this year. Consumer response to our connected brewer continues to be positive and we believe that we will have more than one million connected households in the next few years. In 2021, we also launched our popular Brew Over Ice feature on one of our smallest footprint brewers, our K-Slim + ICED coffeemaker, which debuted as a Target and keurig.com exclusive. More than half of K-Slim + ICED purchasers were households completely new to the Keurig system. We will be expanding retail availability of this model late this summer. Next week, we are launching the new K-Cafe Essentials model, our first brewer less than $100 that offers coffee lattes and cappuccinos through a built-in milk frother. This brewer has scored an average 4.8 out of five stars in our consumer and influencer review programs and we look forward to its debut as a Walmart exclusive. In terms of coffee innovation, in January, we launched a Snickers-flavored K-Cup pod under The Original Donut Shop brand as an expansion of our flavored platform. This new product is already a top-selling variety where distributed with a national rollout planned for later this year. Lastly we are pleased to announce the Community Coffee the largest family-owned retail coffee brand in the US will be returning as a Keurig partner brand at the end of this year. The relaunch of our partnership after a five year hiatus is a testament to the quality, innovation, service and consumer insights the Keurig ecosystem can provide to coffee brands. We look forward to working together with Community -- the Community team to help accelerate their brand growth. Shifting to cold beverages. We're excited to announce that we have agreed to make a minority equity investment in Tractor Beverage to expand innovation in the fountain and foodservice channels. Available nationally in Chipotle restaurants since 2020, Tractor offers the first and only certified organic non-GMO beverage solution, specifically tailored to foodservice operators. To enable Tractor to achieve widespread distribution across multiple food service channels, we have also agreed to enter into an exclusive sales agreement with Tractor that leverages the strength of our fountain foodservice sales team. KDP cold beverage innovation and renovation continues to be robust and we have recently launched Snapple zero sugar; and Snapple Elements, a new line of teas and juice drinks inspired by the elements fire, rain and air. Snapple Elements line is made from all-natural ingredients with no artificial flavors or sweeteners and less sugar than traditional Snapple beverages. Snapple zero sugar is a rebranding of Diet Snapple, similar to what we've done with several key CSD brands, resulting in increased velocity. During the quarter, we launched two new CSDs, Simple 7UP, a new 7UP line with clean simple ingredients and reduced sugar; as well as Sunkist mango orange to expand our fast-growing Sunkist brand lineup. Finally, returning this summer as a limited-time offer is a fan favorite Dr Pepper Dark Berry, including zero sugar variety. The launch will feature promotional packaging tied to this summer's release of Jurassic World Dominion. I'll now turn it over to Ozan to take you through more highlights of the quarter. Before moving to Q&A I want to recognize Steve Alexander for his recent promotion to Vice President of Investor Relations. Many of you on this call have had the opportunity to work with Steve during his 15 years with KDP and Dr Pepper Snapple and have benefited from his strong understanding of the beverage industry. And finally, earlier this month, we announced that I will be transitioning my CEO role to Ozan at the end of July and I will remain Executive Chairman for the following two years. This transition was designed to ensure continuity of leadership and strategic direction for KDP as well as to enable dedicated focus on the new and very significant inorganic value-creation opportunity we have in front of us. I have tremendous confidence in Ozan based on working side by side with him over the past six years and I'm excited about the opportunity to continue to partner with him, the KDP executive team, and the KDP Board of Directors over the next few years. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Thanks Bryan. Yes. Well I'll start Bryan with in-home, which we think is very relevant and we can talk a little bit about away from home. But we put in this strategic pricing investment over a number of years and we've had a lot of investor questions about this as well. So if you go back to 2016, before we implemented it, the cost per cup which is the relevant measure of K-Cup pods versus bag coffee for example was a $0.30 per cup premium. We lowered that to $0.20 per cup during the -- during that investment and we saw tremendous consumer response. Now we're moving up in price, but the game as you point out is really a relative game. And if you look at now the difference today between K-Cup pods and bags it's still $0.20. So we're maintaining that $0.20 differential while we're taking our pricing up which we think is the most relevant comparison. With regard to away from home, it's hard to come back with an exact number to be able to measure that against but we know that we're talking about an average price per pod or price per cup of $0.50 for K-Cup versus $0.30 for bag coffee. You're talking about a multiple of that somewhere between five and 10x depending on what you buy out at retail and that gap continues to get wider and wider. And so we see as people get concerned about pricing clearly, there's a trade-off from away from home to in-home which benefits the entire category. But our price gaps versus other forms of roast and ground coffee have stayed the same at that lower level that we guided to in 2018 2019. Okay. Okay. I'll start with the top line and then I'll ask Ozan to pick up the second part of your question there. With regard to the top line, you have to pull apart the quarterly results by coffee and all other. And the all other businesses outside of coffee, so that's LAB, BC and Packaged Beverages, were up -- all up double digits. And they were up in terms of pricing, but also volume. In fact volume was up fairly substantially across those. So our confidence is not that it's just all pricing driven, as we're seeing really strong growth in both. And our expectation is that that continues. We talked about more pricing being implemented. Of course, we've built our model around elasticities and the kind of elasticities we've seen and we expect going forward. So that's where we get the confidence on the cold side. The coffee side of the business, which was a significant drag on growth in the quarter, we know, will recover substantially in the second half of the year, for a couple of reasons. One is, we made substantial investment in the first quarter to accelerate our coffee recovery. And part of those one-time benefits you talked about, were used to fund those investments and Ozan will talk about that in a minute. But that puts us -- that acceleration puts us in great shape, because as Ozan just said, we believe our customer service levels will be back to normal by the end of the second quarter, which means that we can have unconstrained sales in the second half of the year. We've been pulling back on shipments. We've also been pulling back on promotion and advertising in the first quarter. So we can go back to unconstrained demand for coffee in the second half of the year. And then the other point on coffee is, we're undershipping consumption for the first half of the year. That flips around in the second half of the year. And we have the opportunity with the increased internal inventories to restock customers, partners and then again be able to turn on the promotion and marketing. So the combination of all of those leads us to the confidence that the second half of the year will be in that high single-digit range that we guided. Ozan, do you want to talk about the investment we made off of some of those discrete benefits? Sure. Bonnie [ph], for me, first, there's really three areas of focus as we go forward. One is continuing to lead the Board, as we've evolved the Board overtime from being closely held to widely held and that also will continue to evolve somewhat over time. And so that's an important part of my role. Second part of it is working with Ozan on the executive team to make sure that the transition is seamless, and that we continue the great momentum that we have on the organic delivery of our business and I have a ton of confidence in that. And then the third part is, to give some time and space for me to work on the inorganic opportunities in particular M&A. Wouldn't be a surprise to anyone that the last 2.5 years or so have been very intensely operationally focused, very much managing it seems like everybody in the industry from one crisis to the next. And while that's critically important and is the right priority it doesn't leave a lot of time to think about and work on the strategic aspects of the business that require a significant amount of time, investment, patience even relationship building to be able to do that properly. And so, I'm certainly looking forward to being able to have more space against that, while always being available to Ozan and the team to jump in and help as needed over the next couple of years. All right. Ozan, why don't you start off? And I'll pick up the second part. Yeah. On your second question, I think the simple answer is we take all of our commitments seriously. And we put commitments out there in a balanced manner. So think about what we delivered over the first three years as a public company. We delivered a 15% EPS CAGR, while we accelerated growth so we beat our growth targets. At the same time we were more competitive in the marketplace as evidenced by all the share gains that we had across the board as well as accelerated household penetration on the Keurig system and we put in place a foundation that's now scalable as we move into the future. So all of those were delivered. As you could imagine, when we put that commitment out there in 2018 the world looked very different than it has over the past three years, yet we've been able to balance across all of those without optimizing one metric at the expense of the other. We were able to deliver balanced performance and that's exactly the way we look at it going forward. So one thing, I would point out is that early back in October 1, we saw a lot of challenges in the macro environment in 2022. And therefore, we said that, we would be on mid-single-digit EPS growth in 2022. We're pleased that, we did that given what has materialized since then. And now we're in this mode of balancing investment and growth. And you can see we've taken our growth expectations up. It's not just pricing driven it's volume and pricing. And we make investments in brands. As we mentioned, on our Q1 call our cold business investment in marketing was up during the quarter. Even though it was incredibly challenging quarter we spent more. And the one-timers you're talking about I would suggest we not focus on any one quarter. You have to look at those type of \u2013 I put those mostly in the category of normal business especially when you look at it over time. And we're just incredibly transparent about those. And any time they hit in one quarter we tend to over focus on those. And then we don't talk about them as a group when they're not or it's an unfavorable comparison versus a year ago. We never get any questions about those. So just look at it over the period of a year. The fact that, we have some of these items to double down on investments in our brands, as well as in accelerating our coffee recovery, allows us to have the confidence in the balanced delivery that we committed to. Okay. All right. Thank you. Good morning, Chris. Sure. First thing is, our reticence I think is the word you used on large deals was not on large deals. Our reticence is on overpaying for large deals. And so it's not about the size. It's about the multiple. And I think that, we're in an environment now where we're seeing all kinds of valuations shift. And people \u2013 our investors are more in favor of paying for cash flow and earnings than just multiple of sales with no earnings potential in them. So that may represent some interesting opportunities. But what I would point out is that, the way we think about inorganic is across the range of partnerships like we just announced with Community, which is a huge win for Community, and a huge win for us to be working together again. And we don't need to own that business by any means to have the benefits of that. And likewise by partnering with us they win as well. We can make seed investments as we announced today on Tractor Beverage, which is small today but we will certainly accelerate it. And it's in a unique channel in fountain foodservice, which is one that we are incredibly strong, but yet haven't done a deal like this in that channel before. And then we're also looking at mid- and larger-scale M&A as well. And so we have \u2013 I would say, we have a consistent dialogue with a large number of potential partners. I can't get into the details of that, but the fact that we are in this position when we talk about businesses like Community and Tractor is good evidence that of how we think about being proactive and creative in our partnerships. With regard to coffee pricing, again, the category is up 5% or a little over 5% and we were up a little bit more than that. Again, I wouldn't overreact to any one move in the quarter. Sometimes that's mix. Actually if you break it apart further the area that has moved late is private label within pods. So premium brands have actually moved substantially. The mainstream brands where we're a heavy participant in with our owned and licensed have all moved about the same level. There was a late move in private label. But they can't avoid the price of coffee and now you're seeing pricing coming up on that. So we're not seeing any distortion in the gaps between private label mainstream and premium and pods sticking for any time period. Sure. A couple of things, Brett. First of all, on the scalability piece that you talk about, I think there are three big areas in which we've set up a business at scale. I think one is just management structure. So, we've got a management team that has the bandwidth to take on more than they have today. And our focus on North America, I think gives us a bit of an advantage here. Having managed global businesses in my past to be able to focus in one region where you have common consumers, common customers, yet a significant amount of white space for expansion is an advantage for management to be able to continue to take on more without being distracted. I think the second area where we've made significant investment in is in our distribution capabilities. And we talk about a wide range of them. But if you think about today, we announced an expansion in our fountain foodservice business. We talked about on a number of calls, Dr Pepper is the most available CSD in fountain foodservice. So we've got a really strong team but they've had a relatively small set of brands and businesses to sell. Now we're equipping them with a new brand in partnership with Tractor, where they're able to get into new territory with GMO-free organic and some really unique products to be able to expand. So it expands their toolkit. There's a good example of a great foundation that we can now scale. DSD is a very important area for us. We've made significant investment over the past three years, increased tools and capabilities. But also we've expanded our DSD breadth and depth by acquiring close to 25 independent distributors to be able to boost our system. And obviously anything that you can scale within DSD improves both your effectiveness as well as your efficiency. And then as you touched on e-comm is a really interesting area. When we put the two companies together and we showed how we were bringing the best of both to share across the business, one of the conversation was about e-comm. But in 2018 e-comm and beverage didn't seem like a big idea. Certainly it was a very significant idea during COVID. And it's one that on the cold side of the business has to build over \u2013 will build over time but it has to be through click and collect and regional delivery. Shipping liquids by UPS and FedEx is not a great business model over the long term. But we see that area rapidly evolving and we're in a really good position. Part of enabling us to do exactly that required us to go back and redefine and renegotiate a number of our distribution agreements that were not contemplated in an environment of e-comm and we've been very successful in doing that over the past now four years to set ourselves up so that we have a win-win with our distribution partners, our independent partners and yet we're able to drive e-comm to the benefit of the consumer as well as us and our partners. With regard to our coffee business, you're 100% right, we have a scaled business in e-comm. We've been very agnostic in terms of where our brands are sold on e-comm. So we're very supportive of Amazon, of walmart.com on any type of retailer.com. We share our information with them. We try to make them better. So it's not that we're in competition with them at all. In fact we know the consumers want to go online but they want to buy it from their preferred retailer. And so we enable that by doing what I just said. With regard to keurig.com we have focused it on auto reorder or reorder, and that's its primary reason for being. And also it's a good place to find SKUs that are small that are favorites of a small group of consumers who can't find them at normal retailers. We'll sell everything on there. Obviously, that's been a challenge during the supply recovery phase. We will get back to that again. And so that's a big part of it. And as you think about the one comment I made in my remarks about connected brewers and the fact that we believe that we'll have 1 million connected brewers in the next few years, that really adds additional power to an auto reorder business because you go from replenishing based on shipments to replenishment based on consumption and that is a whole different level of convenience for the consumer. And so that's why we're really bullish on that business over the long term as well. Okay. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the Fourth Quarter of 2023. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce the company's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, you may begin.\nJane Gelfand: Thank you, and hello, everyone. We appreciate your attention, recognizing that many of you are also attending an industry conference. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our fourth quarter and full year results, which we will discuss during this conference call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements which reflect KDP's judgments, assumptions and analysis only as of today. Our actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting KDP's business. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements discussed today. For more information, please refer to our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K, which will be filed with the SEC later this morning. We will also discuss non-GAAP measures of our performance. Definitions and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics are included in our earnings release. We will also speak about the concept of underlying performance, which removes the impact of nonoperational items in the current and prior years. These items include gains on asset sale leaseback transactions, reimbursement of litigation expenses related to the successful resolution of our body armor lawsuit, a business interruption insurance recovery and the change in accounting policy for stock compensation. Here with us today to discuss our results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; Chief Operating Officer; Tim Cofer; and Chief Financial Officer and President, International, Sudanshu Priyadarshi. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a year of significant progress for KDP as we grew share across the majority of our business, entered multiple high-growth white spaces, such as ready-to-drink coffee and sport hydration through highly capital-efficient partnerships, began to rebuild margins while simultaneously driving high-quality reinvestment, returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders, including a 7.5% dividend increase in the opportunistic repurchase of 22 million shares and delivered our financial outlook, while significantly improving the composition of our earnings and strengthening our balance sheet. . Full year constant currency net sales grew nearly 5% and EPS advanced 6%. On an underlying basis, our EPS growth was even stronger and in the double digits as we largely eliminated the contribution from nonoperational gains that benefited the prior year. Pricing actions and a near doubling of year-over-year productivity savings, more than offset continued inflationary pressure, supporting earnings growth even as we funded a double-digit increase in marketing. Our 2023 performance demonstrated the resilience inherent in our broad portfolio with continued momentum in U.S. refreshment beverages and international offsetting short-term pressures in U.S. coffee. We also initiated a thoughtful succession process that balances continuity and new perspectives across the company's most senior leaders. Tim and our refreshed executive team have merged seamlessly are building momentum and add to my confidence in KDP's future success. Our hard work in 2023 sharpened our strategic road map and bolstered our capabilities and financial profile providing a platform for growth and value creation in 2024 and over the long term. Moving now to our fourth quarter results. A primary focus for us last year have been rebuilding our margin structure. We made impressive gains in Q4, driving the strongest quarterly gross margin expansion in our history and the fastest rate of operating margin improvement in multiple years. This improvement was broad-based across each of our segments and enabled us to deliver EPS above the outlook we shared last quarter despite the impact of some transitory top line headwinds. Q4 constant currency net sales grew 1.1%, with net price realization more than offsetting a volume/mix decline. This result is not representative of our ongoing momentum and was, in part, weighed down by short-term factors in our U.S. coffee business that we do not expect to persist. We have good visibility to mid-single-digit consolidated net sales growth in 2024, which Sudhanshu will address in a few minutes. Q4 gross margin expanded 450 basis points, translating to gross profit dollar growth of 10% and helping to fund increased investments. Operating income increased at a high single-digit rate and EPS grew in the double digits. Notably, normalizing for nonoperational items in 2022, our Q4 underlying EPS growth rate was in the high teens. We continue to enjoy strong momentum in U.S. refreshment beverages. Net sales grew at a high single-digit rate in Q4, led by still very healthy net price realization and manageable elasticities with volume mix declining only modestly in the period, redouble focus on productivity and cost discipline along with strong C4 energy partnership execution, translated this topline to double-digit operating income growth. Q4 segment margins expanded meaningfully even as marketing continued to grow. As we observed back in October, though consumers remain largely resilient, value is a key shopping consideration. Many consumers are making trade-off decisions to manage stretch household budgets. As a result, value-oriented channels, such as club stores continue to outperform and consumers are inclined to shop more during deal periods such as holiday weeks. Our U.S. refreshment beverages business model is well suited to a dynamic macro environment. The breadth of the beverage occasions we serve and the depth of our distribution allow us to spot changing consumer trends with speed. We then flex our plans to deliver on the key tenets of our growth strategy, driving category growth, market share gains and white space expansion regardless of the operating environment. Fourth quarter was no exception with dollar sales growth and share gains across 85% of our U.S. refreshment beverages business. CSDs grew nicely, led by Dr. Pepper, which was the largest market share gainer among the top 10 category brands for both the quarter and the year. During Q4, we once again activated our Fansville marketing campaign, the fuel awareness and drive demand. And despite Dr Pepper's existing scale, we grew incremental display and ACV for key varieties and pack sizes. Dr. Pepper, strawberries and cream also remained highly resonant, finishing 2023 as the #1 innovation launch in the CSD category. In other parts of our portfolio, we leverage revenue growth management to ensure we are offering consumers continued compelling value across all channels and formats. For instance, in Q4, we deployed more multipacks and tailored promotional and merchandising strategies by channel for core hydration and Avion. As a result, our premium water portfolio grew retail dollars and notched market share gains, overcoming some consumer trade down to mainstream water. Our pursuit of white space opportunities continued in Q4, wrapping up a very active year. We exited the first year of our sales and distribution partnership for C4 Energy with momentum. C4 commands less than a 3% share in energy today with meaningful upside ahead, and we have strong commercial plans to add significant further scale in 2024. We also just started shipping electrically through the KDP system, which will build our exposure to the fast-growing sports hydration category and multicultural consumers. A full innovation slate adds to our 2024 excitement. These include the launch of Dr. Pepper Creamy Coconut, just in time for the summer season. Canada Dry Fruit/CSD, Apple Mini bottles, the restage of Buy Wonder Water, 4 hydration partnering with Teen USA Symnastics and the national U.S. rollout of Penafiel, our powerhouse mineral water brand from Mexico. We intend to leverage continued U.S. refreshment beverages top line growth to drive a balance of reinvestment and bottom line delivery in 2024. Over the past year, our commercial and supply chain teams have grown increasingly integrated, yielding significant efficiencies. As a result, our productivity savings run rate step changed in 2023, and we began 2024 with healthy carryover savings and a robust pipeline of additional projects to support P&L flow-through. In U.S. coffee, we continue to control the controllables in the context of a still sluggish at-home coffee category. Our Q4 pod shipment trends improved relative to Q3, and we delivered another quarter of strong segment margin recovery and underlying operating income growth. We also ended this year having added approximately 2 million new households to the Keurig ecosystem in line with our target. That said, net sales declined 10% year-over-year as some short-term dynamics weighed on Q4 segment performance. As Sudhanshu will describe in detail, a combination of transient factors accounted for roughly half of the top line decline, and we expect these to dissipate in 2024. Bigger picture, volume consumption in the at-home coffee category declined about 3% in 2023 in IRi tracked channels gradually recovering from a mid-single-digit decline in 2022. Q4 category trends were largely consistent with the full year. In both the quarter and the year, single-serve coffee continued to grow as a percent of total at-home coffee servings. And Keuring compatible brewers also gained meaningful share. 2023, 4 out of 10 brewers sold were Keuring compatible. And in Q4, that ratio approached 50%. These are clear indications of our ecosystem's ongoing appeal to coffee drinking households. While at-home coffee category consumption is taking longer than we anticipated to return to growth to the back half of '23 was clearly stronger than the first, and we expect the gradual recovery to continue. Our 2024 U.S. coffee strategy incorporates a balance between long-term growth initiatives and short-term actions that address current macro realities. We will continue with high-quality brand and ecosystem building activities to drive incremental household penetration, increased pod usage among existing and new households and accelerate growth in ready-to-drink coffee. At the same time, we will emphasize affordability through revenue growth management initiatives such as engineering brewers to hit important entry price points. and highlighting the relative value of consuming coffee-at-home versus in coffee shops. For higher income consumers, we continue to build out super premium solutions. These actions should support a broader at-home coffee recovery and ultimately help return the single-serve category to its long-term growth trend. Even so, we are building our 2024 financial plans around more prudent category growth assumptions. With more than 50 million coffee drinking households in the U.S. yet to convert to single-serve, there is significant runway to steadily grow penetration. We have an ambitious vision of Keuring future, some of which we will begin to share publicly starting this spring. At the annual Houseware Show in a few weeks, we will preview an exciting pipeline of disruptive innovation of Keuring brewers, and we will be making a public announcement about these innovation plans shortly before that event. Our 2024 pod program is equally robust. Innovation will span cold and hot occasions and a spectrum of brews and flavors. Along with incremental promotional and marketing support, these new products will directly bolster our owned and licensed brands. Products like refreshers will benefit our indulgent donut shop brand, while our high-profile collaboration with Kevin Costner will elevate Green Mountain. This is Costner's first brand campaign in 30 years and will feature the co-creation of a unique set of blends and integrated marketing events to highlight our shared passion for coffee quality and sustainability. We remain focused on building out the super premium tier of pods, which reinforces Keurig's reputation for quality and supports premiumization in the category. Our latest activities began in Q4 with the introduction of lock alone licensed pods and continue in early 2024 with the conversion of Lavazza to a licensed relationship, which will unlock more growth and efficiencies for the brand. Our ready-to-drink coffee efforts are also gaining momentum. In Q4, we commenced our sales and distribution partnership for lock-on ready-to-drink coffee now with renovated products and packaging. Wrapping up on U.S. coffee, while we are not satisfied with our 2023 performance, we are taking steps to support a stronger 2024. We are acting as a category leader to revive long-term category growth, thinking expansively and disruptively with the vision, capabilities and willingness to invest in the future growth opportunities for ourselves and on behalf of our partners. In other words, we are being open-minded and ambitious and positioning KDP to benefit from an at-home coffee category rebound, while also planning 2024 in a measured way. Moving now to our International segment. Revenue grew at a double-digit rate on a reported basis and high single-digit rate in constant currency with continued balance between pricing and volume mix. As with our other segments, operating income grew faster than net sales, resulting in significant margin expansion. Our performance reflected healthy growth across country markets. Our results were led by strong trends across our cold beverages portfolio, primarily driven by Penafiel and Clamato in Latin America, Canada Dry and Dr. Pepper CSDs in Canada, and our continued expansion of our ready-to-drink alcohol and alcohol alternatives products. In our international coffee business, we delivered strong household penetration growth in 2023 and this will remain a 2024 priority. For that aim, we recently inked an agreement to make sure the official coffee maker of the NFL in Canada, capitalizing on the sports growing popularity. Our international momentum is supported by broad-based capability investments, including in areas such as distribution and consumer insights. As in the U.S., our DSD system in Latin America represents a competitive advantage. During 2023, we bolstered our reach by expanding our routes and building out more dedicated coolers at retail and plan to do so again in 2024. Meanwhile, our innovation pipeline marries local expertise and enterprise-wide insights. For instance, the launch of Schweppes mocktails in LatAm will build on our experience in ready-to-drink low and no alcohol products in Canada. While the upcoming introductions of Dr. Pepper Dark Berry in Mexico, an expansion of 0 CSDs in Canada, leverage successful playbooks out of the U.S. Since merger, we have grown our international business at a strong double-digit CAGR from slightly over $1 billion in annual sales to almost $2 billion. We continue to see outsized growth potential in this segment, and it will remain a meaningful contributor to KDP's total results in 2024 and beyond. Wrapping up, 2023 represented another year of delivering on our commitments while also advancing key strategic priorities. The operating environment is as ever demanding but our all-weather business model and energized teams are up to the challenge. Our focus remains on sustainably and thoughtfully extending our leadership position in the beverage industry while consistently delivering strong and predictable financial outcomes, including a return to our long-term algorithm in 2024. On March 19, we will be hosting a webcasted investor event to dive deeper into our strategy and the multiple value creation opportunities we see across the business. We hope many of you will join or tune in. I will now turn the call briefly over to Tim, after which Sudhanshu will walk us through the detailed financial results and outlook.\nTimothy Cofer: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. After joining KDP in November, I've spent the past 3 months fully immersing myself in the business as Chief Operating Officer, and in preparation for the CEO succession later this spring. My onboarding has exposed me to nearly every aspect of KDP, and most importantly, to its people. At the top of that list, Bob, Sudhanshu, our Board of Directors and the broader executive leadership team, with whom I've already forged strong and collaborative partnerships. I've spent time in multiple KDP locations from our headquarters in Dallas and Boston to the front lines of DSD retail as well as our cold and coffee manufacturing plants. I've met with many of our customers and partners and above all, listen to the valuable feedback from our employees. I also had an active hand in developing the 2024 plan that we're sharing with you today, and I echo Bob's confidence in KDP's ability to continue to deliver and create value for our shareholders. The investor event in a few weeks will be my first opportunity to share a more comprehensive view of my observations on the beverage industry, KDP as a market leader and our strategy to extend that leadership in the years ahead. I look forward to kicking off a deeper discussion at that time. For now, let me just say that I'm equally impressed by KDP's current strength as I am excited about the company's future potential. We are a leader in a very attractive industry. We steward many iconic brands that consumers love. Our commercial and distribution capabilities are differentiated. We are a preferred partner and have demonstrated an ability to evolve our portfolio in a way that broadens growth exposure and accomplishes it with capital responsibility. Finally, one of our greatest strengths is that we act with a challenger mindset. This is an important cultural element that attracted me to KDP and one which we plan to build upon going forward. Although Keurig Dr. Pepper is still a young company, our track record of strong and consistent financial delivery over a historically dynamic past 5 years is testament to our resilience and potential. I'm honored to build on such a formidable foundation and look forward to partnering with the Board and my colleagues to drive the next chapter of KDP's success. We have strong alignment and our commitment to deliver value to all stakeholders, including our shareholders. We're fortunate to have many long-term investors who have supported KDP since the merger, and we look forward to delivering for all of you in the years ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Sudhanshu.\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I will focus my remarks this morning primarily on our quarter 4 results and the 2024 outlook. Our Q4 performance demonstrated strong execution in a dynamic operating environment. We further rebuilt our margin structure, invested to seed future growth opportunities and delivered a strong EPS growth that was slightly ahead of our outlook. . Fourth quarter net revenue advanced 1.7%, with 1.1% constant currency growth. Net price realization increased 4.8%, which was partially offset by a 3.7% decline in volume mix. We enjoyed strong momentum across approximately 70% of our business namely in U.S. refreshment beverages and international, but our top line growth was pressured by temporary headwinds in U.S. coffee. Gross margin expanded a record 450 basis points year-over-year, driven by a favorable net impact of pricing, productivity savings and moderating inflation. We also earned performance incentives relative to our strong commercial execution of the C4 partnership, which contributed approximately 100 basis points to gross margin. SG&A deleveraged 170 basis points, in part reflecting a double-digit increase in marketing. Total company operating income grew 6.5%, which, along with modest below-the-line leverage drove 10% EPS growth. Excluding the year-over-year reduction in nonoperational gains, EPS would have grown in the high teens. In 2023, we essentially eliminated nonoperational benefits. We now move into 2024, looking to build on this solid earnings base. Moving to the segments. U.S. Refreshment Beverages grew net sales 6.8%, led by 7.5 percentage points of pricing. Volume/mix declined a modest 0.7% with manageable elasticities, broad market share gains and a healthy growth contribution from C4 Energy. As Bob discussed, in 2024, we will build on our commercial momentum with a robust slate of innovation though our cadence of launches differ slightly from last year. For instance, our Dr Pepper Creamy coconut rollout will begin in quarter 2 and gain steam into the summer as opposed to the very successful launch of strawberries increased in quarter 1, 2023. While the calendar difference is made temporarily weigh on our market share comparison early in 2024, we remain confident in another great year for U.S. substation Beverages relative market performance. Segment operating income grew 20.2% in the quarter and margins expanded 360 basis points. This growth reflected the net sales momentum, a favorable impact of productivity net of inflation and the C4 performance incentives partially offset by higher marketing. In U.S. coffee, we made good progress across multiple dimensions. Share gains for the single subsegment, and for Keuring continued. We executed a successful holiday approval program to end the year with 40 million Keuring households and the segment margins came in at the highest level in 10 quarters. These markers survive, we do not view the headline 9.9% net-well decline in quarter 4 as overly indicative. With pricing, a positive contributor, just shy of 1%, segment sales were pulled down by a 10.7% decrease in volume mix. Let me deconstruct drivers to give you a sense of why we see roughly half of the decline as transient. Brewer revenue decreased 21%, primarily due to a 14% decline in brewer shipments and reflecting a return of normal seasonal shipment patterns against a steadier point of sales trends. Looking at the back half in total is more telling with brewer shipments in line with point-of-sale purchases. As context, full year approval shipments in 2023 were 13% higher than pre-pandemic shipments in 2019, representing a 3% CAGR. Pod revenue declined 7% in the period, even with the continued impact from previously discussed private label exits, pod shipment trends sequentially improved as expected, down 3% in quarter 4 versus 8% last quarter. Pod revenue in the period was also unfavorably impacted by mix, given a lower percentage of sales from on in-licensed brand relative to last year. The temporary headwinds in quarter 4 included the brewer decline, private label exits and a modest impact of lapping an extra week last year. Though quarter 1 will continue to reflect still sluggish category dynamics, we do expect these discrete factors to be less impactful beginning next quarter. Moving to segment operating profit and margins. Although quarter 4 operating income dollars declined 2.8% year-over-year, this was entirely due to the impact of lapping more than $50 million in nonoperational benefits. On an underlying basis, our operating income grew in the double digits. U.S. coffee operating margin expanded 260 basis points relative to the prior year. Drivers of this expansion included an improving relationship between pricing and inflation, continuous productivity benefits and overall cost discipline. In 2024, reinvestment will be an important priority in the segment and will source from these margin tailwinds. International segment net sales grew 11.5% in the fourth quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 6.5%, with pricing up 3.6% and volume mix growing 2.9%. We continue to deliver strong results across markets, despite tough year-over-year comparisons in Mexico from lapping the World Cup last year. Segment operating income increased a very strong 25.6% on a reported basis and 19.8% in constant currency terms, thanks to pricing, operating leverage and productivity mating favorably against iteration. As President of our International segment, I see a tremendous multiyear top and bottom line growth opportunities across this business, including in 2024. Moving to balance sheet and cash flow. Our ongoing cash generation remains strong. However, we chose to deploy a significant component of our 2023 cash flow to strategically reduce our supplier financing program, a decision that optically weighed on our free cash flow even as it to strengthen our balance sheet. Put another way, our free cash flow for the year measured just north of $900 million, but included a $1.6 million use of cash from accounts payable, primarily due to our discretionary decision around the supplier financing program. Our business remains highly cash generative and on an ongoing basis, we continue to expect conversion commensurate with other leading beverage players. However, we will be below this long-term level in 2024 due to a continued a bit more modest impact from reducing supplier financing. How we intend to allocate our capital remains very much intact. Our priorities include making organic and inorganic investments to support our growth further strengthening our balance sheet, consistent with our long-term net leverage target of 2 to 2.5x and returning cash to shareholders through a steadily growing dividend and opportunistic share buybacks. In any given year, we may over-index to 1 or more of our priorities based on short-term opportunities, but over time, we will take a balanced approach. For example, direct shareholder returns were a focus area during 2023, representing a cash deployment of over $1.8 billion. We saw value in our stock and repurchased 22 million shares during the year, including more than 8 million shares in quarter 4, with over $2.9 billion remaining on our buyback authorization, we will continue to be opportunistic. We also raised our dividend 7.5% during 2023, marking our third consecutive annual increase. Moving now to our 2024 guidance. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit constant currency net sales growth and high single-digit EPS growth in 2024, consistent with our long-term algorithm. Based on our current FX outlook, we expect reported results to also incorporate roughly 50 basis points, top and bottom line currency headwind in 2024. Our plans reflect continued strong momentum in our U.S. Refreshment Beverages and international segments, while contemplating a relatively muted contribution from U.S. coffee. New strategic partnerships will contribute approximately 200 basis points to overall top line growth which will also benefit from the combination of carryover pricing and selected new price actions consistent with a more normalized inflationary environment. We are projecting another year of robust productivity savings to help offset this more normal level of inflation. Even with planned reinvestments in our brand and capabilities, we expect healthy operating profit growth, reflecting net sales growth and full year operating margin expansion. However, we also anticipate some below-the-line headwinds primarily in interest expense. This will constrain some of the operating profit flow through to EPS, though we retain good visibility to bottom line growth within our high single-digit target range in 2024. Our full year outlook includes the following below-the-line assumptions. Interest expense in a $560 million to $580 million range, an effective tax rate of approximately 22% and approximately $1.4 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. From a phasing perspective, we expect our top and bottom line momentum to build throughout the year. This quarterly EPS flow is typical for us and accounts for our innovation and investment calendar as well as building contributions from electrolyte and lacalome in the back half. Reflecting these dynamics and a slower start to the year in U.S. coffee, we forecast first quarter net sales and EPS growth in the low single digits. In closing, 2023 was a significant year for KDP. We grew share across most of our portfolio, increased gross margin through efficient pricing and record productivity, invested in key growth factors, improved the composition of our earnings profile and to strengthen our balance sheet. We expanded into attractive bite spaces through capital-efficient strategic partnerships and return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. Our 2023 performance was the product of hard work and strong execution across our whole organization, which enabled us to achieve a good set of operating and financial outcomes that were in line with our original projections. Our results also underscore our proven ability to deliver consistently and predictively in a dynamic operating environment. We have strong confidence that we will do so again in 2024. With that, I will now turn the call back to Bob to close.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Sudhanshu. Five years out from having played a key part in creating KDP, my excitement about its future continues to build. Our performance track record speaks for itself. In the 5 years since merger, net sales have grown at a 6% CAGR and EPS at an 11% CAGR. We have generated almost $11 billion in cumulative free cash with roughly half redeployed to bolster the business through transformational capital investments and disciplined M&A and partnership deals, which further enhance KDP's growth profile. . We returned the other half to shareholders, enhancing our TSR delivery. We are looking forward to seeing many of you in mid-March and to sharing more about our go-forward strategic road map. KDP's priorities are very clear. They reinforce our role as a disruptive and dynamic force within the beverage industry and lend visibility to continued delivery against our attractive long-term growth algorithm. My confidence is made all the stronger, given the refreshed management team now in place with Tim's vision and energy already taking root and propelling KDP into its next chapter. Thank you for dialing in during a busy day of cagny, we are now happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: So Bob, you mentioned that you're building your '24 operating assumptions based on category growth expectations that are more prudent. Can you maybe just unpack that a bit more? And I would be particularly curious on what your expectations are for the U.S. coffee business sounds like 1Q is still going to be sluggish, but it does also seem that you need the category growth to improve in order to kind of hit your organic sales outlook. So just any thoughts on specifically when you think that inflection will happen would be helpful?\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. All 3 of us on the call today have been very involved in the development of the 2024 plan. I think as we said right upfront, there's no expectations in the plan of any significant change in the macro environment. And we talked about our expectations around coffee being quite muted as we think about 2024. We focused our energies really on what we have in our control which we've talked about a number of times. I think given that Tim will be taking over in Q2 and he's been very much involved with the team in developing AOP, it may be helpful for you guys to hear from Tim about why we have conviction on the outlook that we provided today.\nTimothy Cofer: Yes. Thanks, Bob. Peter. As Bob said, I think we do have good visibility into the mid-single-digit net sales growth, '24 outlook that we've shared with you today, and it really reflects 3 primary elements, and I'll start with Refreshment Beverages. We had a strong '23 and expect to continue positive momentum into '24. I think it will be characterized by a more normalized pricing environment that includes both some carryover and select targeted new actions. That will drive a more balanced price and vol mix equation. . We've got a strong innovation lineup again, and Bob referenced some of those initiatives earlier in the prepared remarks, all supported by strong digital marketing and in-store activation, and we will benefit from our recent expansion into higher growth of white spaces, including electrolyte in sports hydration, which is fully incremental, and the continued scaling of our C4 platform and energy space in partnership. Second, we think we have continued significant runway in international. And we've demonstrated a double-digit CAGR since the merger. As Bob mentioned earlier, it's a much bigger part of the mix. We've nearly doubled the business since merger at almost $2 billion. And we expect that solid momentum to continue in '24. And that brings us to coffee. The 21st elements really give us time for U.S. coffee to recover on the top line. And so the overall mid-single-digit sales guidance reflects relatively muted contribution expectations from U.S. coffee we expect coffee vol/mix recovery. We expect sequential improvement throughout the year. We've got some good programming and good new ideas, partnerships, La Colombe, Luvata conversions on the premium side, new marketing campaigns on Green Mountain and Original Donut Shop, some strong innovation, including refresher and extension in our ICE platforms, all the while in this economic environment, reinforcing our quality, a variety and importantly, our strong value proposition relative to coffee shop alternatives.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChris Carey: Just following up on coffee. Can you maybe just help frame the visibility that you have on operating profit and operating profit margins and the vision if the top line remains muted as you expect, that would assume that's in line with your expectations, but it has been quite a volatile experience over the last several years. So what if things get worse, do you have enough buffer to be able to invest behind maintaining the sequential improvement even if still muted in 2024, while maintaining your your profit expectations for the year, so any context there would be helpful?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. Chris, let me just give you just a bigger picture context on the top line, and then I'll ask Sudhanshu to talk to you about the margins. and it's all under that umbrella of controlling the controllables. We have good visibility on the margins. If you look at the very long-term trends on at-home coffee and single-serve in particular, you talked about is volatility. It was a situation where the category went straight up during COVID due to time spent at home and then it moved down from that peak. So it's been slow moving. We talked about it quarter-to-quarter. It actually hasn't been that volatile. It's just been slower in recovery than any of us expected. Just to reiterate a couple of comments about the category. We're not happy with the the pace of the rebound, but it is sequentially getting better. It is interesting that we're seeing this trend globally in nearly every developed market, any other trend that seems to consistently hold up is that the single-serve segment outperforms all other forms of coffee. And so we're seeing this gradual improvement, the untracked channels perform better than the track channels. And given that the pace of that, while sequential has been gradual, that's why our planning expectations going forward, we think are quite reasonable and prudent. Now that's an area we don't fully control, we influence it through our innovation and marketing. We do have a lot of visibility and control of the margins. So Sudhanshu, you want to talk about that side of the equation? .\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Thanks, Bob. And Chris, as you saw this in second half, that gives you a proof point of how we have rebuilt margin first half, we were at 30% operating income margin, in Q3, we did 33%, in Q4, we did 36%. And we said that it took us multiple years to come down from the peak margin, it will take us multiple years to get the margin to pull back. But at the same time, in 2023, we took structural action to support our prior U.S. coffee margin. We talked about renegotiating partners contract. We made progress on Spartenburg. And in 2024, we expect for the full year, coffee margin progress on an annual basis, but I wouldn't rely on second half margin as an ongoing margin for coffee. And we also need to factor in the balancing between 2 priorities. One is supporting category and top line recovery, but we feel good about coffee margin expansion for 2024. .\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.\nBrett Cooper: A question for you on LRB brand partnerships. I was hoping you could stick to the evolution of your capability to onboard brands. I don't know, maybe using recent additions versus those that you started earlier any tangible evidence you have with respect to those benefits you get on your own brands to bring those on? And then just the environment for partnership additions that we sit in today?\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. So we've got good experience now. in onboarding a number of brands. And I'm not going to recite all of the ones that we've had over the past 4 or 5 years. But the most recent additions, which have happened or in process of being onboarded right now, of course, C4 La Colombe ready-to-drink coffee and Electrolit. As we've developed -- as we've brought brands on board, we've learned quite a bit about how to exit them out of their current distribution system quickly and efficiently, and then how to onboard them both into our national account planning process all the way down through our inventory planning and merchandising and delivery at a store-by-store level. So we've developed a playbook that we use. It's the same team who has onboarded all of these brands. And when we are in a position where we have an agreement with a partner, we bring all the commercial teams together. We spent a couple of days and we have this down to really a science. The tangible evidence of that, I would point to C4 where you could see there was not only 0 slippage in terms of its performance during an onboarding, which is a fear in most situations where you're transitioning from one distribution system to another, we picked up immediately and improved the performance as soon as it came into our system. And you can see that in terms of increased availability, both breadth and depth of availability. You can see it in the merchandising quality, and you can also see it in the display and promotional activity. And obviously, those are all the leading indicators, the lagging indicator that's critically important is the share gain. So we have the same bullishness as we're bringing La Colombe up to speed right now. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Electrolit just started shipping through our system is going incredibly well right now. So I think we've got a great example -- many good examples of how we get better and better at that. In terms of what does the environment look like. The track record we have now of every brand partner brand that has come into our system that has seen a marked improvement in performance and growth and even brands that have been in our system for a very long period of time, our longest partner brand is Vita Coco and the fact that they continue to grow as well. has created a great sense of attraction for other brands who are outside of the system to try to get in. That puts us in a position to be very thoughtful and disciplined about where we want to do this. and also to be able to construct deals that are truly win-win over the long term. And we think the hallmark of this is that from an investment and growth perspective is that we're able to leverage the strength of the business improvement that we can offer partners to construct deals that are highly attractive to us, very capital efficient, give us exposure to higher growth segments and the proof in terms of the benefits to the partner or in the results that I just talked about.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So Bob, I just wanted to return to top line in the at-home coffee category in the single-serve segment. You obviously covered 2024, but just can you take more of a look backwards at 2023 and some of the recovery being weaker than expected? Is it just the COVID drop-off you referenced earlier or are there other factors that drove some of that softness? And then just turning to the long term. So any perspective on if anything structurally changed here in the single-serve party segment? How you think about the growth opportunity post-2024?\nRobert Gamgort: We've felt a lot of time studying the coffee segment since the COVID peak and then the anticipated recovery since then. I think Chris mentioned before that there was some volatility in the top line. I was thinking about this question, the volatility was really driven by our expectations of a rebound and are not happening. If you look at the actual trends underneath it, they've been pretty steady, unfortunately, on the upside, much slower than we had originally anticipated. I always start with the total at-home coffee category because single-serve mirrors that, except it just performs better than total at-home coffee. So there's nothing fundamental about single-serve. It's really in the context of total coffee. This is an interesting category. And similar to many I have worked on in my career. It's a universal product. It's a very high frequency consumption pattern. And in situations like that, you can see that minor changes in consumer behavior can really move the needle. And again, we're not talking about volume changes of plus 10%, minus 10%, we're talking a much smaller ranges within there. But given the size of that business to us, it has an impact on us. Mobility was clearly a factor that's not debatable. But if it was all mobility, we would have seen a faster rebound than that. And so as we go through this process of understanding it and our peers do the same globally and you can listen to their insights from their calls as well, you can see that there's really no single issue. It's a lot of little things that have contributed to it. And I think the best news in that is that as all of us in the coffee industry have done the deep-dive diagnostics to understand, is there something structurally that's changed? Is there a significant consumer behavior or perceptual change? I'm happy to tell the answer is no, that the equity and beliefs around coffee and the attractiveness of coffee even to the younger generation is as good as it's ever been. So for us, we keep doing what we're doing, which is driving the category through innovation and marketing. And as I mentioned, again, in my prepared remarks, we're going to be debuting some real breakthrough innovation in the near future. We look forward to being able to do that. And we're also making sure that we are targeting affordability in the short term. We know that there's quite a bifurcation in U.S. households. The higher income households are increasing their consumption of premium products. And so it's important for us to have premium brewers and a super premium coffee line because we want to be attractive and competitive with that segment. But we also know that the mid- and lower income consumers have become more value seeking. And therefore, we're very much focused on ensuring that we always have an entry-level price point brewer or 2 out there. We focus on the cost per cup and talking about that more overtly in comparison to the price benefit we offer versus away from home coffee and, of course, being more selective in targeting promotions and price pack architecture. So we're happy to see the improvement we wish in the category, which the pace was faster. We've taken very prudent a very prudent approach to our assumptions for 2024 to let that happen naturally and be able to deliver good results as it does.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: So I appreciate the explanation on perhaps volume in the shift that you mentioned, Rob, but can you comment more about the price mix for the coffee parts? How much of that was from what you just said, you want to focus on affordability? And -- or is that effect of life that you have been seeing more of a structural shift from on to partner brands? And related to that, what should investors expect in terms of the cadence of the pod recovery or perhaps becoming as bad as we progress through the year?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes, I'll answer the last part first, in terms of the cadence, you're seeing it happen, right? You see the sequential improvement on there. We don't have anything that would indicate that the continuation of that is anything but a good assumption. I think when you take a look at mix, mix, just remind you, mix gets very noisy when we analyze it quarter-by-quarter. There are a couple of factors in mix. On the brewer side, we had a mix scenario where we sold more of entry-level lower-priced brewers. We're indifferent from a household penetration perspective, but it does have an impact on the revenue side as you -- we say a 0 impact on the profit side of the business. . If you take a look at it within Pod, you do see that the owned and licensed pods were lower as a percent of total sales during the quarter and that the 1 licensed products have a higher revenue contribution. In our last earnings call, we talked about that the category had gotten a bit more promotional. It's not a surprise when the category consumption is soft. You can expect to see individual players promote more to try to gain a share advantage. Remember, we are really focused on category growth because we have about 80% of the category. So that's not a big of a focus for us. But when the price gaps become so far out of line, we have to address them on our owned and licensed portfolio. And we said that we were going to do that in the fourth quarter, which is what we've done, and it just takes time for that to catch up. But our expectation is that the promotional and marketing activity and the innovation activity that we put in place on owned at license will bear fruit for us in 2024.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi.\nFilippo Falorni: Just wanted to go back to assumptions for category growth, but on the U.S. refreshment beverage side. Clearly, we've seen normalization in pricing and volumes have been a little bit weaker to start the year. Maybe can you give us a sense of what you're assuming for refreshment beverages for your core business, excluding the partnerships?\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. When we take a look at 2024, we're coming off of a couple of years of incredibly strong category growth that was driven by unprecedented levels of pricing and really healthy elasticities in the face of that pricing that's not a good expectation for the long term. So when we think about 2024, we think it reverting back towards the long-term patterns that we've seen for LRB in the individual segments. And that means more balance between price and volume mix. . Two specific things to call out when you think about our business with regard to 2024 and why we have confidence in our guide, and Tim went through that in great detail. But with regard to U.S. refresh and beverages, I would call out that partnerships are an important part of our growth engine. And you can expect those are -- contributed about 200 basis points towards growth as we think about 2024. And then the only other comment I would make is the phasing of the growth in U.S. refreshment beverage is slightly more second half focused, and that's driven by 2 things. The timing of Dr. Pepper innovation is a bit later this year. And you know that Dr. Pepper innovation has a material impact on our growth for our LRB. And then the other part, too, is the ramp-up of Electrolit, which is happening right now, and we'll pick up steam as we move throughout the year. but that's already a very substantial business that will be coming fully into our system. And as we've been able to do with C4 and other partner brands, we expect to be able to work with them to step up the performance to an even higher level, and so as that builds, that will have a much more significant impact on our growth rate in the second half of the year. But as I said, on a category basis, I think you should start thinking towards the longer-term trends that we saw pre-COVID and pre the inflationary time period to be a good guide for how we think about the category.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.\nJane Gelfand: Thank you, Betsy, and thanks, everyone. We appreciate your time and attention this morning. And as always, the Investor Relations team is here to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Timothy Cofer",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. After joining KDP in November, I've spent the past 3 months fully immersing myself in the business as Chief Operating Officer, and in preparation for the CEO succession later this spring. My onboarding has exposed me to nearly every aspect of KDP, and most importantly, to its people. At the top of that list, Bob, Sudhanshu, our Board of Directors and the broader executive leadership team, with whom I've already forged strong and collaborative partnerships. I've spent time in multiple KDP locations from our headquarters in Dallas and Boston to the front lines of DSD retail as well as our cold and coffee manufacturing plants. I've met with many of our customers and partners and above all, listen to the valuable feedback from our employees. I also had an active hand in developing the 2024 plan that we're sharing with you today, and I echo Bob's confidence in KDP's ability to continue to deliver and create value for our shareholders. The investor event in a few weeks will be my first opportunity to share a more comprehensive view of my observations on the beverage industry, KDP as a market leader and our strategy to extend that leadership in the years ahead. I look forward to kicking off a deeper discussion at that time. For now, let me just say that I'm equally impressed by KDP's current strength as I am excited about the company's future potential. We are a leader in a very attractive industry. We steward many iconic brands that consumers love. Our commercial and distribution capabilities are differentiated. We are a preferred partner and have demonstrated an ability to evolve our portfolio in a way that broadens growth exposure and accomplishes it with capital responsibility. Finally, one of our greatest strengths is that we act with a challenger mindset. This is an important cultural element that attracted me to KDP and one which we plan to build upon going forward. Although Keurig Dr. Pepper is still a young company, our track record of strong and consistent financial delivery over a historically dynamic past 5 years is testament to our resilience and potential. I'm honored to build on such a formidable foundation and look forward to partnering with the Board and my colleagues to drive the next chapter of KDP's success. We have strong alignment and our commitment to deliver value to all stakeholders, including our shareholders. We're fortunate to have many long-term investors who have supported KDP since the merger, and we look forward to delivering for all of you in the years ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Sudhanshu. Yes. Thanks, Bob. Peter. As Bob said, I think we do have good visibility into the mid-single-digit net sales growth, '24 outlook that we've shared with you today, and it really reflects 3 primary elements, and I'll start with Refreshment Beverages. We had a strong '23 and expect to continue positive momentum into '24. I think it will be characterized by a more normalized pricing environment that includes both some carryover and select targeted new actions. That will drive a more balanced price and vol mix equation. . We've got a strong innovation lineup again, and Bob referenced some of those initiatives earlier in the prepared remarks, all supported by strong digital marketing and in-store activation, and we will benefit from our recent expansion into higher growth of white spaces, including electrolyte in sports hydration, which is fully incremental, and the continued scaling of our C4 platform and energy space in partnership. Second, we think we have continued significant runway in international. And we've demonstrated a double-digit CAGR since the merger. As Bob mentioned earlier, it's a much bigger part of the mix. We've nearly doubled the business since merger at almost $2 billion. And we expect that solid momentum to continue in '24. And that brings us to coffee. The 21st elements really give us time for U.S. coffee to recover on the top line. And so the overall mid-single-digit sales guidance reflects relatively muted contribution expectations from U.S. coffee we expect coffee vol/mix recovery. We expect sequential improvement throughout the year. We've got some good programming and good new ideas, partnerships, La Colombe, Luvata conversions on the premium side, new marketing campaigns on Green Mountain and Original Donut Shop, some strong innovation, including refresher and extension in our ICE platforms, all the while in this economic environment, reinforcing our quality, a variety and importantly, our strong value proposition relative to coffee shop alternatives."

            "name": "Robert Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a year of significant progress for KDP as we grew share across the majority of our business, entered multiple high-growth white spaces, such as ready-to-drink coffee and sport hydration through highly capital-efficient partnerships, began to rebuild margins while simultaneously driving high-quality reinvestment, returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders, including a 7.5% dividend increase in the opportunistic repurchase of 22 million shares and delivered our financial outlook, while significantly improving the composition of our earnings and strengthening our balance sheet. . Full year constant currency net sales grew nearly 5% and EPS advanced 6%. On an underlying basis, our EPS growth was even stronger and in the double digits as we largely eliminated the contribution from nonoperational gains that benefited the prior year. Pricing actions and a near doubling of year-over-year productivity savings, more than offset continued inflationary pressure, supporting earnings growth even as we funded a double-digit increase in marketing. Our 2023 performance demonstrated the resilience inherent in our broad portfolio with continued momentum in U.S. refreshment beverages and international offsetting short-term pressures in U.S. coffee. We also initiated a thoughtful succession process that balances continuity and new perspectives across the company's most senior leaders. Tim and our refreshed executive team have merged seamlessly are building momentum and add to my confidence in KDP's future success. Our hard work in 2023 sharpened our strategic road map and bolstered our capabilities and financial profile providing a platform for growth and value creation in 2024 and over the long term. Moving now to our fourth quarter results. A primary focus for us last year have been rebuilding our margin structure. We made impressive gains in Q4, driving the strongest quarterly gross margin expansion in our history and the fastest rate of operating margin improvement in multiple years. This improvement was broad-based across each of our segments and enabled us to deliver EPS above the outlook we shared last quarter despite the impact of some transitory top line headwinds. Q4 constant currency net sales grew 1.1%, with net price realization more than offsetting a volume/mix decline. This result is not representative of our ongoing momentum and was, in part, weighed down by short-term factors in our U.S. coffee business that we do not expect to persist. We have good visibility to mid-single-digit consolidated net sales growth in 2024, which Sudhanshu will address in a few minutes. Q4 gross margin expanded 450 basis points, translating to gross profit dollar growth of 10% and helping to fund increased investments. Operating income increased at a high single-digit rate and EPS grew in the double digits. Notably, normalizing for nonoperational items in 2022, our Q4 underlying EPS growth rate was in the high teens. We continue to enjoy strong momentum in U.S. refreshment beverages. Net sales grew at a high single-digit rate in Q4, led by still very healthy net price realization and manageable elasticities with volume mix declining only modestly in the period, redouble focus on productivity and cost discipline along with strong C4 energy partnership execution, translated this topline to double-digit operating income growth. Q4 segment margins expanded meaningfully even as marketing continued to grow. As we observed back in October, though consumers remain largely resilient, value is a key shopping consideration. Many consumers are making trade-off decisions to manage stretch household budgets. As a result, value-oriented channels, such as club stores continue to outperform and consumers are inclined to shop more during deal periods such as holiday weeks. Our U.S. refreshment beverages business model is well suited to a dynamic macro environment. The breadth of the beverage occasions we serve and the depth of our distribution allow us to spot changing consumer trends with speed. We then flex our plans to deliver on the key tenets of our growth strategy, driving category growth, market share gains and white space expansion regardless of the operating environment. Fourth quarter was no exception with dollar sales growth and share gains across 85% of our U.S. refreshment beverages business. CSDs grew nicely, led by Dr. Pepper, which was the largest market share gainer among the top 10 category brands for both the quarter and the year. During Q4, we once again activated our Fansville marketing campaign, the fuel awareness and drive demand. And despite Dr Pepper's existing scale, we grew incremental display and ACV for key varieties and pack sizes. Dr. Pepper, strawberries and cream also remained highly resonant, finishing 2023 as the #1 innovation launch in the CSD category. In other parts of our portfolio, we leverage revenue growth management to ensure we are offering consumers continued compelling value across all channels and formats. For instance, in Q4, we deployed more multipacks and tailored promotional and merchandising strategies by channel for core hydration and Avion. As a result, our premium water portfolio grew retail dollars and notched market share gains, overcoming some consumer trade down to mainstream water. Our pursuit of white space opportunities continued in Q4, wrapping up a very active year. We exited the first year of our sales and distribution partnership for C4 Energy with momentum. C4 commands less than a 3% share in energy today with meaningful upside ahead, and we have strong commercial plans to add significant further scale in 2024. We also just started shipping electrically through the KDP system, which will build our exposure to the fast-growing sports hydration category and multicultural consumers. A full innovation slate adds to our 2024 excitement. These include the launch of Dr. Pepper Creamy Coconut, just in time for the summer season. Canada Dry Fruit/CSD, Apple Mini bottles, the restage of Buy Wonder Water, 4 hydration partnering with Teen USA Symnastics and the national U.S. rollout of Penafiel, our powerhouse mineral water brand from Mexico. We intend to leverage continued U.S. refreshment beverages top line growth to drive a balance of reinvestment and bottom line delivery in 2024. Over the past year, our commercial and supply chain teams have grown increasingly integrated, yielding significant efficiencies. As a result, our productivity savings run rate step changed in 2023, and we began 2024 with healthy carryover savings and a robust pipeline of additional projects to support P&L flow-through. In U.S. coffee, we continue to control the controllables in the context of a still sluggish at-home coffee category. Our Q4 pod shipment trends improved relative to Q3, and we delivered another quarter of strong segment margin recovery and underlying operating income growth. We also ended this year having added approximately 2 million new households to the Keurig ecosystem in line with our target. That said, net sales declined 10% year-over-year as some short-term dynamics weighed on Q4 segment performance. As Sudhanshu will describe in detail, a combination of transient factors accounted for roughly half of the top line decline, and we expect these to dissipate in 2024. Bigger picture, volume consumption in the at-home coffee category declined about 3% in 2023 in IRi tracked channels gradually recovering from a mid-single-digit decline in 2022. Q4 category trends were largely consistent with the full year. In both the quarter and the year, single-serve coffee continued to grow as a percent of total at-home coffee servings. And Keuring compatible brewers also gained meaningful share. 2023, 4 out of 10 brewers sold were Keuring compatible. And in Q4, that ratio approached 50%. These are clear indications of our ecosystem's ongoing appeal to coffee drinking households. While at-home coffee category consumption is taking longer than we anticipated to return to growth to the back half of '23 was clearly stronger than the first, and we expect the gradual recovery to continue. Our 2024 U.S. coffee strategy incorporates a balance between long-term growth initiatives and short-term actions that address current macro realities. We will continue with high-quality brand and ecosystem building activities to drive incremental household penetration, increased pod usage among existing and new households and accelerate growth in ready-to-drink coffee. At the same time, we will emphasize affordability through revenue growth management initiatives such as engineering brewers to hit important entry price points. and highlighting the relative value of consuming coffee-at-home versus in coffee shops. For higher income consumers, we continue to build out super premium solutions. These actions should support a broader at-home coffee recovery and ultimately help return the single-serve category to its long-term growth trend. Even so, we are building our 2024 financial plans around more prudent category growth assumptions. With more than 50 million coffee drinking households in the U.S. yet to convert to single-serve, there is significant runway to steadily grow penetration. We have an ambitious vision of Keuring future, some of which we will begin to share publicly starting this spring. At the annual Houseware Show in a few weeks, we will preview an exciting pipeline of disruptive innovation of Keuring brewers, and we will be making a public announcement about these innovation plans shortly before that event. Our 2024 pod program is equally robust. Innovation will span cold and hot occasions and a spectrum of brews and flavors. Along with incremental promotional and marketing support, these new products will directly bolster our owned and licensed brands. Products like refreshers will benefit our indulgent donut shop brand, while our high-profile collaboration with Kevin Costner will elevate Green Mountain. This is Costner's first brand campaign in 30 years and will feature the co-creation of a unique set of blends and integrated marketing events to highlight our shared passion for coffee quality and sustainability. We remain focused on building out the super premium tier of pods, which reinforces Keurig's reputation for quality and supports premiumization in the category. Our latest activities began in Q4 with the introduction of lock alone licensed pods and continue in early 2024 with the conversion of Lavazza to a licensed relationship, which will unlock more growth and efficiencies for the brand. Our ready-to-drink coffee efforts are also gaining momentum. In Q4, we commenced our sales and distribution partnership for lock-on ready-to-drink coffee now with renovated products and packaging. Wrapping up on U.S. coffee, while we are not satisfied with our 2023 performance, we are taking steps to support a stronger 2024. We are acting as a category leader to revive long-term category growth, thinking expansively and disruptively with the vision, capabilities and willingness to invest in the future growth opportunities for ourselves and on behalf of our partners. In other words, we are being open-minded and ambitious and positioning KDP to benefit from an at-home coffee category rebound, while also planning 2024 in a measured way. Moving now to our International segment. Revenue grew at a double-digit rate on a reported basis and high single-digit rate in constant currency with continued balance between pricing and volume mix. As with our other segments, operating income grew faster than net sales, resulting in significant margin expansion. Our performance reflected healthy growth across country markets. Our results were led by strong trends across our cold beverages portfolio, primarily driven by Penafiel and Clamato in Latin America, Canada Dry and Dr. Pepper CSDs in Canada, and our continued expansion of our ready-to-drink alcohol and alcohol alternatives products. In our international coffee business, we delivered strong household penetration growth in 2023 and this will remain a 2024 priority. For that aim, we recently inked an agreement to make sure the official coffee maker of the NFL in Canada, capitalizing on the sports growing popularity. Our international momentum is supported by broad-based capability investments, including in areas such as distribution and consumer insights. As in the U.S., our DSD system in Latin America represents a competitive advantage. During 2023, we bolstered our reach by expanding our routes and building out more dedicated coolers at retail and plan to do so again in 2024. Meanwhile, our innovation pipeline marries local expertise and enterprise-wide insights. For instance, the launch of Schweppes mocktails in LatAm will build on our experience in ready-to-drink low and no alcohol products in Canada. While the upcoming introductions of Dr. Pepper Dark Berry in Mexico, an expansion of 0 CSDs in Canada, leverage successful playbooks out of the U.S. Since merger, we have grown our international business at a strong double-digit CAGR from slightly over $1 billion in annual sales to almost $2 billion. We continue to see outsized growth potential in this segment, and it will remain a meaningful contributor to KDP's total results in 2024 and beyond. Wrapping up, 2023 represented another year of delivering on our commitments while also advancing key strategic priorities. The operating environment is as ever demanding but our all-weather business model and energized teams are up to the challenge. Our focus remains on sustainably and thoughtfully extending our leadership position in the beverage industry while consistently delivering strong and predictable financial outcomes, including a return to our long-term algorithm in 2024. On March 19, we will be hosting a webcasted investor event to dive deeper into our strategy and the multiple value creation opportunities we see across the business. We hope many of you will join or tune in. I will now turn the call briefly over to Tim, after which Sudhanshu will walk us through the detailed financial results and outlook. Thanks, Sudhanshu. Five years out from having played a key part in creating KDP, my excitement about its future continues to build. Our performance track record speaks for itself. In the 5 years since merger, net sales have grown at a 6% CAGR and EPS at an 11% CAGR. We have generated almost $11 billion in cumulative free cash with roughly half redeployed to bolster the business through transformational capital investments and disciplined M&A and partnership deals, which further enhance KDP's growth profile. . We returned the other half to shareholders, enhancing our TSR delivery. We are looking forward to seeing many of you in mid-March and to sharing more about our go-forward strategic road map. KDP's priorities are very clear. They reinforce our role as a disruptive and dynamic force within the beverage industry and lend visibility to continued delivery against our attractive long-term growth algorithm. My confidence is made all the stronger, given the refreshed management team now in place with Tim's vision and energy already taking root and propelling KDP into its next chapter. Thank you for dialing in during a busy day of cagny, we are now happy to take your questions. Sure. All 3 of us on the call today have been very involved in the development of the 2024 plan. I think as we said right upfront, there's no expectations in the plan of any significant change in the macro environment. And we talked about our expectations around coffee being quite muted as we think about 2024. We focused our energies really on what we have in our control which we've talked about a number of times. I think given that Tim will be taking over in Q2 and he's been very much involved with the team in developing AOP, it may be helpful for you guys to hear from Tim about why we have conviction on the outlook that we provided today. Yes. Chris, let me just give you just a bigger picture context on the top line, and then I'll ask Sudhanshu to talk to you about the margins. and it's all under that umbrella of controlling the controllables. We have good visibility on the margins. If you look at the very long-term trends on at-home coffee and single-serve in particular, you talked about is volatility. It was a situation where the category went straight up during COVID due to time spent at home and then it moved down from that peak. So it's been slow moving. We talked about it quarter-to-quarter. It actually hasn't been that volatile. It's just been slower in recovery than any of us expected. Just to reiterate a couple of comments about the category. We're not happy with the the pace of the rebound, but it is sequentially getting better. It is interesting that we're seeing this trend globally in nearly every developed market, any other trend that seems to consistently hold up is that the single-serve segment outperforms all other forms of coffee. And so we're seeing this gradual improvement, the untracked channels perform better than the track channels. And given that the pace of that, while sequential has been gradual, that's why our planning expectations going forward, we think are quite reasonable and prudent. Now that's an area we don't fully control, we influence it through our innovation and marketing. We do have a lot of visibility and control of the margins. So Sudhanshu, you want to talk about that side of the equation? . Sure. So we've got good experience now. in onboarding a number of brands. And I'm not going to recite all of the ones that we've had over the past 4 or 5 years. But the most recent additions, which have happened or in process of being onboarded right now, of course, C4 La Colombe ready-to-drink coffee and Electrolit. As we've developed -- as we've brought brands on board, we've learned quite a bit about how to exit them out of their current distribution system quickly and efficiently, and then how to onboard them both into our national account planning process all the way down through our inventory planning and merchandising and delivery at a store-by-store level. So we've developed a playbook that we use. It's the same team who has onboarded all of these brands. And when we are in a position where we have an agreement with a partner, we bring all the commercial teams together. We spent a couple of days and we have this down to really a science. The tangible evidence of that, I would point to C4 where you could see there was not only 0 slippage in terms of its performance during an onboarding, which is a fear in most situations where you're transitioning from one distribution system to another, we picked up immediately and improved the performance as soon as it came into our system. And you can see that in terms of increased availability, both breadth and depth of availability. You can see it in the merchandising quality, and you can also see it in the display and promotional activity. And obviously, those are all the leading indicators, the lagging indicator that's critically important is the share gain. So we have the same bullishness as we're bringing La Colombe up to speed right now. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Electrolit just started shipping through our system is going incredibly well right now. So I think we've got a great example -- many good examples of how we get better and better at that. In terms of what does the environment look like. The track record we have now of every brand partner brand that has come into our system that has seen a marked improvement in performance and growth and even brands that have been in our system for a very long period of time, our longest partner brand is Vita Coco and the fact that they continue to grow as well. has created a great sense of attraction for other brands who are outside of the system to try to get in. That puts us in a position to be very thoughtful and disciplined about where we want to do this. and also to be able to construct deals that are truly win-win over the long term. And we think the hallmark of this is that from an investment and growth perspective is that we're able to leverage the strength of the business improvement that we can offer partners to construct deals that are highly attractive to us, very capital efficient, give us exposure to higher growth segments and the proof in terms of the benefits to the partner or in the results that I just talked about. We've felt a lot of time studying the coffee segment since the COVID peak and then the anticipated recovery since then. I think Chris mentioned before that there was some volatility in the top line. I was thinking about this question, the volatility was really driven by our expectations of a rebound and are not happening. If you look at the actual trends underneath it, they've been pretty steady, unfortunately, on the upside, much slower than we had originally anticipated. I always start with the total at-home coffee category because single-serve mirrors that, except it just performs better than total at-home coffee. So there's nothing fundamental about single-serve. It's really in the context of total coffee. This is an interesting category. And similar to many I have worked on in my career. It's a universal product. It's a very high frequency consumption pattern. And in situations like that, you can see that minor changes in consumer behavior can really move the needle. And again, we're not talking about volume changes of plus 10%, minus 10%, we're talking a much smaller ranges within there. But given the size of that business to us, it has an impact on us. Mobility was clearly a factor that's not debatable. But if it was all mobility, we would have seen a faster rebound than that. And so as we go through this process of understanding it and our peers do the same globally and you can listen to their insights from their calls as well, you can see that there's really no single issue. It's a lot of little things that have contributed to it. And I think the best news in that is that as all of us in the coffee industry have done the deep-dive diagnostics to understand, is there something structurally that's changed? Is there a significant consumer behavior or perceptual change? I'm happy to tell the answer is no, that the equity and beliefs around coffee and the attractiveness of coffee even to the younger generation is as good as it's ever been. So for us, we keep doing what we're doing, which is driving the category through innovation and marketing. And as I mentioned, again, in my prepared remarks, we're going to be debuting some real breakthrough innovation in the near future. We look forward to being able to do that. And we're also making sure that we are targeting affordability in the short term. We know that there's quite a bifurcation in U.S. households. The higher income households are increasing their consumption of premium products. And so it's important for us to have premium brewers and a super premium coffee line because we want to be attractive and competitive with that segment. But we also know that the mid- and lower income consumers have become more value seeking. And therefore, we're very much focused on ensuring that we always have an entry-level price point brewer or 2 out there. We focus on the cost per cup and talking about that more overtly in comparison to the price benefit we offer versus away from home coffee and, of course, being more selective in targeting promotions and price pack architecture. So we're happy to see the improvement we wish in the category, which the pace was faster. We've taken very prudent a very prudent approach to our assumptions for 2024 to let that happen naturally and be able to deliver good results as it does. Yes, I'll answer the last part first, in terms of the cadence, you're seeing it happen, right? You see the sequential improvement on there. We don't have anything that would indicate that the continuation of that is anything but a good assumption. I think when you take a look at mix, mix, just remind you, mix gets very noisy when we analyze it quarter-by-quarter. There are a couple of factors in mix. On the brewer side, we had a mix scenario where we sold more of entry-level lower-priced brewers. We're indifferent from a household penetration perspective, but it does have an impact on the revenue side as you -- we say a 0 impact on the profit side of the business. . If you take a look at it within Pod, you do see that the owned and licensed pods were lower as a percent of total sales during the quarter and that the 1 licensed products have a higher revenue contribution. In our last earnings call, we talked about that the category had gotten a bit more promotional. It's not a surprise when the category consumption is soft. You can expect to see individual players promote more to try to gain a share advantage. Remember, we are really focused on category growth because we have about 80% of the category. So that's not a big of a focus for us. But when the price gaps become so far out of line, we have to address them on our owned and licensed portfolio. And we said that we were going to do that in the fourth quarter, which is what we've done, and it just takes time for that to catch up. But our expectation is that the promotional and marketing activity and the innovation activity that we put in place on owned at license will bear fruit for us in 2024. Sure. When we take a look at 2024, we're coming off of a couple of years of incredibly strong category growth that was driven by unprecedented levels of pricing and really healthy elasticities in the face of that pricing that's not a good expectation for the long term. So when we think about 2024, we think it reverting back towards the long-term patterns that we've seen for LRB in the individual segments. And that means more balance between price and volume mix. . Two specific things to call out when you think about our business with regard to 2024 and why we have confidence in our guide, and Tim went through that in great detail. But with regard to U.S. refresh and beverages, I would call out that partnerships are an important part of our growth engine. And you can expect those are -- contributed about 200 basis points towards growth as we think about 2024. And then the only other comment I would make is the phasing of the growth in U.S. refreshment beverage is slightly more second half focused, and that's driven by 2 things. The timing of Dr. Pepper innovation is a bit later this year. And you know that Dr. Pepper innovation has a material impact on our growth for our LRB. And then the other part, too, is the ramp-up of Electrolit, which is happening right now, and we'll pick up steam as we move throughout the year. but that's already a very substantial business that will be coming fully into our system. And as we've been able to do with C4 and other partner brands, we expect to be able to work with them to step up the performance to an even higher level, and so as that builds, that will have a much more significant impact on our growth rate in the second half of the year. But as I said, on a category basis, I think you should start thinking towards the longer-term trends that we saw pre-COVID and pre the inflationary time period to be a good guide for how we think about the category."

            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I will focus my remarks this morning primarily on our quarter 4 results and the 2024 outlook. Our Q4 performance demonstrated strong execution in a dynamic operating environment. We further rebuilt our margin structure, invested to seed future growth opportunities and delivered a strong EPS growth that was slightly ahead of our outlook. . Fourth quarter net revenue advanced 1.7%, with 1.1% constant currency growth. Net price realization increased 4.8%, which was partially offset by a 3.7% decline in volume mix. We enjoyed strong momentum across approximately 70% of our business namely in U.S. refreshment beverages and international, but our top line growth was pressured by temporary headwinds in U.S. coffee. Gross margin expanded a record 450 basis points year-over-year, driven by a favorable net impact of pricing, productivity savings and moderating inflation. We also earned performance incentives relative to our strong commercial execution of the C4 partnership, which contributed approximately 100 basis points to gross margin. SG&A deleveraged 170 basis points, in part reflecting a double-digit increase in marketing. Total company operating income grew 6.5%, which, along with modest below-the-line leverage drove 10% EPS growth. Excluding the year-over-year reduction in nonoperational gains, EPS would have grown in the high teens. In 2023, we essentially eliminated nonoperational benefits. We now move into 2024, looking to build on this solid earnings base. Moving to the segments. U.S. Refreshment Beverages grew net sales 6.8%, led by 7.5 percentage points of pricing. Volume/mix declined a modest 0.7% with manageable elasticities, broad market share gains and a healthy growth contribution from C4 Energy. As Bob discussed, in 2024, we will build on our commercial momentum with a robust slate of innovation though our cadence of launches differ slightly from last year. For instance, our Dr Pepper Creamy coconut rollout will begin in quarter 2 and gain steam into the summer as opposed to the very successful launch of strawberries increased in quarter 1, 2023. While the calendar difference is made temporarily weigh on our market share comparison early in 2024, we remain confident in another great year for U.S. substation Beverages relative market performance. Segment operating income grew 20.2% in the quarter and margins expanded 360 basis points. This growth reflected the net sales momentum, a favorable impact of productivity net of inflation and the C4 performance incentives partially offset by higher marketing. In U.S. coffee, we made good progress across multiple dimensions. Share gains for the single subsegment, and for Keuring continued. We executed a successful holiday approval program to end the year with 40 million Keuring households and the segment margins came in at the highest level in 10 quarters. These markers survive, we do not view the headline 9.9% net-well decline in quarter 4 as overly indicative. With pricing, a positive contributor, just shy of 1%, segment sales were pulled down by a 10.7% decrease in volume mix. Let me deconstruct drivers to give you a sense of why we see roughly half of the decline as transient. Brewer revenue decreased 21%, primarily due to a 14% decline in brewer shipments and reflecting a return of normal seasonal shipment patterns against a steadier point of sales trends. Looking at the back half in total is more telling with brewer shipments in line with point-of-sale purchases. As context, full year approval shipments in 2023 were 13% higher than pre-pandemic shipments in 2019, representing a 3% CAGR. Pod revenue declined 7% in the period, even with the continued impact from previously discussed private label exits, pod shipment trends sequentially improved as expected, down 3% in quarter 4 versus 8% last quarter. Pod revenue in the period was also unfavorably impacted by mix, given a lower percentage of sales from on in-licensed brand relative to last year. The temporary headwinds in quarter 4 included the brewer decline, private label exits and a modest impact of lapping an extra week last year. Though quarter 1 will continue to reflect still sluggish category dynamics, we do expect these discrete factors to be less impactful beginning next quarter. Moving to segment operating profit and margins. Although quarter 4 operating income dollars declined 2.8% year-over-year, this was entirely due to the impact of lapping more than $50 million in nonoperational benefits. On an underlying basis, our operating income grew in the double digits. U.S. coffee operating margin expanded 260 basis points relative to the prior year. Drivers of this expansion included an improving relationship between pricing and inflation, continuous productivity benefits and overall cost discipline. In 2024, reinvestment will be an important priority in the segment and will source from these margin tailwinds. International segment net sales grew 11.5% in the fourth quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 6.5%, with pricing up 3.6% and volume mix growing 2.9%. We continue to deliver strong results across markets, despite tough year-over-year comparisons in Mexico from lapping the World Cup last year. Segment operating income increased a very strong 25.6% on a reported basis and 19.8% in constant currency terms, thanks to pricing, operating leverage and productivity mating favorably against iteration. As President of our International segment, I see a tremendous multiyear top and bottom line growth opportunities across this business, including in 2024. Moving to balance sheet and cash flow. Our ongoing cash generation remains strong. However, we chose to deploy a significant component of our 2023 cash flow to strategically reduce our supplier financing program, a decision that optically weighed on our free cash flow even as it to strengthen our balance sheet. Put another way, our free cash flow for the year measured just north of $900 million, but included a $1.6 million use of cash from accounts payable, primarily due to our discretionary decision around the supplier financing program. Our business remains highly cash generative and on an ongoing basis, we continue to expect conversion commensurate with other leading beverage players. However, we will be below this long-term level in 2024 due to a continued a bit more modest impact from reducing supplier financing. How we intend to allocate our capital remains very much intact. Our priorities include making organic and inorganic investments to support our growth further strengthening our balance sheet, consistent with our long-term net leverage target of 2 to 2.5x and returning cash to shareholders through a steadily growing dividend and opportunistic share buybacks. In any given year, we may over-index to 1 or more of our priorities based on short-term opportunities, but over time, we will take a balanced approach. For example, direct shareholder returns were a focus area during 2023, representing a cash deployment of over $1.8 billion. We saw value in our stock and repurchased 22 million shares during the year, including more than 8 million shares in quarter 4, with over $2.9 billion remaining on our buyback authorization, we will continue to be opportunistic. We also raised our dividend 7.5% during 2023, marking our third consecutive annual increase. Moving now to our 2024 guidance. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit constant currency net sales growth and high single-digit EPS growth in 2024, consistent with our long-term algorithm. Based on our current FX outlook, we expect reported results to also incorporate roughly 50 basis points, top and bottom line currency headwind in 2024. Our plans reflect continued strong momentum in our U.S. Refreshment Beverages and international segments, while contemplating a relatively muted contribution from U.S. coffee. New strategic partnerships will contribute approximately 200 basis points to overall top line growth which will also benefit from the combination of carryover pricing and selected new price actions consistent with a more normalized inflationary environment. We are projecting another year of robust productivity savings to help offset this more normal level of inflation. Even with planned reinvestments in our brand and capabilities, we expect healthy operating profit growth, reflecting net sales growth and full year operating margin expansion. However, we also anticipate some below-the-line headwinds primarily in interest expense. This will constrain some of the operating profit flow through to EPS, though we retain good visibility to bottom line growth within our high single-digit target range in 2024. Our full year outlook includes the following below-the-line assumptions. Interest expense in a $560 million to $580 million range, an effective tax rate of approximately 22% and approximately $1.4 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. From a phasing perspective, we expect our top and bottom line momentum to build throughout the year. This quarterly EPS flow is typical for us and accounts for our innovation and investment calendar as well as building contributions from electrolyte and lacalome in the back half. Reflecting these dynamics and a slower start to the year in U.S. coffee, we forecast first quarter net sales and EPS growth in the low single digits. In closing, 2023 was a significant year for KDP. We grew share across most of our portfolio, increased gross margin through efficient pricing and record productivity, invested in key growth factors, improved the composition of our earnings profile and to strengthen our balance sheet. We expanded into attractive bite spaces through capital-efficient strategic partnerships and return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. Our 2023 performance was the product of hard work and strong execution across our whole organization, which enabled us to achieve a good set of operating and financial outcomes that were in line with our original projections. Our results also underscore our proven ability to deliver consistently and predictively in a dynamic operating environment. We have strong confidence that we will do so again in 2024. With that, I will now turn the call back to Bob to close. Thanks, Bob. And Chris, as you saw this in second half, that gives you a proof point of how we have rebuilt margin first half, we were at 30% operating income margin, in Q3, we did 33%, in Q4, we did 36%. And we said that it took us multiple years to come down from the peak margin, it will take us multiple years to get the margin to pull back. But at the same time, in 2023, we took structural action to support our prior U.S. coffee margin. We talked about renegotiating partners contract. We made progress on Spartenburg. And in 2024, we expect for the full year, coffee margin progress on an annual basis, but I wouldn't rely on second half margin as an ongoing margin for coffee. And we also need to factor in the balancing between 2 priorities. One is supporting category and top line recovery, but we feel good about coffee margin expansion for 2024. ."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the Third Quarter Of 2023. This conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, please go ahead.\nJane Gelfand: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued two press releases, the first, detailing our third quarter 2023 results and the second, announcing our sales and distribution partnership with Grupo PiSA for Electrolit. During today's call and consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our Q3 performance on an adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis while not in accordance with GAAP, provides investors with meaningful comparisons and appropriate insight into our business and operating performance trends. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance. We'll also speak about the concept of underlying performance, which removes the impact of nonoperational items in the current and prior years. These items include gains on asset sale-leaseback transactions, reimbursement of litigation expenses related to the successful resolution of our BodyArmor lawsuit, a business interruption insurance recovery, and a change in accounting policy for stock compensation. Finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. Here with us today to discuss our results our KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; and our Chief Financial Officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi.  I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort : Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our Q3 results. KDP's diversified beverage portfolio and strong execution continue to support consistent delivery of our company goals and commitments, even as the operating environment around us remains dynamic. In Q3, healthy organic sales growth and significant gross margin progress fueled reinvestment and bottom-line growth, reinforcing the ability to our full year outlook, which remains unchanged. Third quarter constant currency net sales grew 4.1%. As expected, net price realization moderated from the first half but remain the primary top-line growth driver, while volume mix strengthened sequentially. Our performance reflected continued share gains in U.S. Refreshment Beverages, gradual recovery in U.S. coffee segment results, and strong momentum in our International business. Gross profit margin expanded significantly, up 100 basis points year-over-year and the largest improvement in four years, reflecting an improved balance between ongoing inflation, pricing and productivity. Gross profit growth enabled us to continue reinvesting in the business, including increased marketing for the third consecutive quarter, while simultaneously driving bottom line growth which was slightly above the expectations we shared with you back in July. As we move through Q4 and plan for next year, we expect our revenue growth drivers to continue to normalize as pricing moderates relative to recent history and volume mix continues to improve. To be clear, pricing is expected to remain a key part of the top-line equation, especially considering that inflation is likely to persist, albeit at more moderate levels than over the last couple of years. Simultaneously, our focus will be on supporting volume mix by balancing margin flexibility between reinvestment and future top-line growth and earnings flow-through. Let me take a step back and frame how we assess consumer health, our portfolio, and our strategy in the macro environment. The consumer remains healthy with demand resilient and category elasticity is manageable. Even so, consumers are closely calibrating where and how they shop? For instance, growth in club and other value-oriented channels has accelerated while the convenience of e-commerce and pickup and delivery services continues to resonate well after any pandemic-related uplift would have normalized. Consumers remain responsive to high-quality innovation and activation, but price and package architecture is another increasingly important dimension, including smaller pack sizes that hit key price points and multipacks that offer value and convenience. On the margin, we also see some migration of lower to middle-income households towards at-home meal and beverage occasions, which should benefit our more essential categories like CSDs and coffee. The business is well positioned against this backdrop, thanks to a compelling all-weather growth model. The ability to seamlessly meet the consumer across all beverage need states and to service those occasions across all channels is at the heart of why we formed this modern beverage company. Since then, we've made even more progress as we significantly grew the portfolio reach and strengthen our internal capabilities. Looking forward, our distribution prowess across retail is broad-based with very strong in-market execution yet we also enjoy a scaled online business, particularly on the coffee side. Our robust 2024 innovation pipeline has been well received by the trade and spans product, format, and packaging news. It captures a combination of value and premium price points as well as low and no calorie and indulgent beverages. We also continue to price nimbly across the entirety of our portfolio, including by leveraging our strong mix management capabilities. In short, the consumer is resilient but choiceful and KDP is positioned to drive attractive top-line growth through a combination of volume, mix, and price levers. Our successful growth model rests on our exclusive focus on North American beverages and a winning strategy. It begins with KDP's powerful twin distribution assets, our multichannel cold beverage distribution system, including DSD, and an installed base of nearly 40 million active households using the Keurig system. This is an unparalleled combination in the industry, which enhanced by strong R&D and commercial backbone, enables us to grow our categories, and gain share across our base business, and further build out our portfolio through high-value M&A and partnerships with counterparties who increasingly seek us out. When we fill in category white spaces, such as through our announcement today of the partnership with Electrolit, fuels a virtuous cycle of growth, investment, and growing returns on that investment. As the new brand scale and our portfolio expands, our capabilities get stronger. Drop sizes get bigger, our merchandising gets more impactful, we service each store and household more frequently and our commercial and consumer relationships tighten. This enables further investment in growth that begins to cycle anew. We have proven this model over multiple years. In U.S. Refreshment Beverages, we have consistently outperformed our categories, growing dollar share in at least 75% of our business in all but two quarters since the beginning of 2019. We also entered multiple strategic white spaces within the past 12 months such as ready-to-drink coffee, energy, and after today's announcement, sports hydration, all were achieved in a very capital-efficient manner. The growth path ahead is increasingly evident with both owned and partner brands. The latter, where our relationships are strategic and long-term, growth and mix are positive, and our economics are attractive. Coffee, the single-serve segment has continued to steadily gain share of at-home coffee, cementing Keurig's leadership position with this important category. At the same time, we are expanding our total coffee strategy to encompass iced, ready-to-drink, and other forms of coffee within and beyond the K-Cup format. And in Canada and Mexico, we have leveraged similar strategies across our Refreshment Beverages and coffee business as well as deeply experienced local teams to build a combined business approaching $2 billion in revenue, with a mid-20s operating margin. As a result, our International segment has become a scaled contributor to the overall portfolio with significant growth runway ahead. I'll now briefly discuss how this strategy played out in Q3, with Sudhanshu to follow with greater detail and guidance. In U.S. Refreshment Beverages, 82% of our business outpaced category growth in the quarter. CSD business is healthy. Dr Pepper building on the momentum of strawberries and cream earlier in the year, with a successful sixth season of the iconic Fansville marketing campaign. Other brands such as Canada Dry and Squirt also saw strong gains. And Polar's momentum continued in sparkling water, where it now commands the number two volume share position. CORE and Evian remains strong drivers in premium waters with CORE, in particular, seeing great traction from our partnership with U.S. gymnastics. That said, work to do elsewhere in the still portfolio including with buy, is undergoing a significant restage and reformulation next year. Importantly, our partnership with Nutrabolt on C4 is proceeding very well. In Q3, C4's market share and earned display accelerated while velocities remain strong across those regions where KDP has taken control of the brand throughout the market. Even as the C4 rollout continues in its first year, we have significant room for future growth in energy, where KDP's market share is only 3%, and C4 has tremendous potential. With the Electrolit announcement today, we are extending our portfolio into the large and important sport hydration category, another quickly growing mix accretive white space for KDP. Electrolit is a brand that has established a strong regional foothold, thanks to its unique product attributes, scientific heritage, and extremely loyal customer base. The brand is the market leader in sports hydration in Mexico, and that popularity extends to the U.S. where Electrolit enjoys broad multicultural appeal but over-indexes with Hispanic consumers. Though it has good scale today in the U.S. and already generates more than $400 million in retail sales, representing more than a tenfold increase over the past five years, Electrolit has significant upside potential. We are excited to partner with Grupo PiSA, Electrolit's parent company, to meaningfully expand the brand's distribution breadth and depth in the U.S. and across all channels while also leveraging KDP's commercial expertise to further enhance the brand's position at retail. With C4, Lock alone, and Electrolit having entered our portfolio over the last 12 months, we have meaningfully increased the growth potential for each of these brands while extending a positive halo on the rest of our business. For example, our total volume in chain convenience stores will increase by approximately 50% after incorporating these brands, providing scale and efficiency benefits across the entirety of our portfolio. This is the virtuous cycle that I described just a few minutes ago and which will continue to fuel KDP's success. Turning now to U.S. coffee, where our back half is focused on driving segment margin improvement in the context of gradually improving at-home coffee category volumes. With visible progress on both fronts, let's address each in turn. I'll start with the segment margin improvement. We have a greater ability to control in the short term than we do with category trends. Q3, we began to deliver against our objective with a strong inflection in segment margins and operating income, which meaningfully improved both sequentially and year-over-year. Importantly, we expect the margin improvements to continue. We previously said that delayed pricing would flow through our partner brands, and it has. We have now strengthened the pricing protocols across these long-term partnerships and do not expect any significant lag between inflation and pricing to recur in the future. Plus, commodity cost headwinds are now moderating and productivity is building across the segment, enhancing our visibility to continuing to grow the bottom line even with ongoing reinvestment. Moving to category performance. At-home coffee category volume growth accelerated relative to Q2 but the pace of recovery is admittedly gradual. From Q2 to Q3, volume trends across the broader category strengthened by about 100 basis points in measured channels though volumes are still modestly lower year-over-year. Single-serve continues to gain share of at-home coffee with our proprietary data, which is more comprehensive spanning both measured and untracked channels, indicating that Q3 Keurig's compatible pod consumption volume was approximately flat versus a year ago, proving from down approximately 3% in Q2. These green shoots are encouraging, and we will continue to nurture them as the single-serve market share leader. During the quarter, we saw our competitors begin to lean more aggressively into price promotions in the single-serve category, resulting in some share shifts across the various brands in the ecosystem. As a reminder, because we manufacture nearly 80% of all Keurig compatible pods in the U.S., we tend to participate even share changes occur between our branded and private label partner brands and our owned and licensed brands. Nevertheless, we must responsibly manage our owned and licensed brands price gaps within the category and intend to stay nimble to the changing operating conditions around us. Importantly, as we choose to surgically respond to the recent price activity, we expect segment margins to accelerate in Q4. We also do not expect the competitive pricing activity to meaningfully accelerate at-home coffee category buying, which we know are far more responsive to high-quality activities that influence consumer choice and lean into emerging trends. As the single-serve leader, KDP will continue to drive category growth as we always have through innovation, renovation, and white space expansion that build penetration with new households and increased usage among our existing consumers. With 90 million U.S. households drinking coffee at home, of which fewer than 40 million are actively using Keurig brewers, there is a significant multiyear opportunity ahead. In 2024, we will continue to pursue that growth through new consumables like cold brew, expanded ice varieties, and refreshers. New brands like La Colombe, which, by the way, begins to ship in ready-to-drink and K-Cup format starting in Q4, significantly new innovation in brewers, all supported by strong marketing and brand activation activity, including exciting new collaborations across our owned and licensed brands. Moving on to our International performance in Q3, which remained impressive with revenue growth once again, in double digits and continued segment margin expansion. Both our Coffee and Refreshment Beverages businesses performed well. Canada, the ready-to-drink alcohol and no alcohol segment is growing, and we are contributing to that growth. ATP gained significant share as velocity and distribution built and a blast from the past, vodka-based Tahiti Treat RTD generated exceptional consumer demand. In Mexico, our powerhouse Pena CL and Squirt brands, both grew at a double-digit rate, leveraging our strong go-to-market and DSD capabilities behind which we continue best. In Mexico, like in the U.S., we have significant growth potential ahead across both our core portfolio and through partnerships as we leverage these unique distribution assets. KDP's strong balance sheet and cash generation profile are powerful enablers of our broader growth strategy with today's Electrolit announcement yet another example of how we can grow our portfolio and market reach in a highly capital-efficient manner. As a result, our financial policy approach can be flexible and dynamic. This year, we are deploying some of our cash flow to strategically reduce our supplier financing program. Simultaneously, we announced a 7.5% increase in our annual dividend furthering our track record of regularly growing dividend income for our shareholders. With over $3 billion remaining on our share buyback authorization and having already repurchased 24 million shares of KDP stock over the last two years, we have substantial flexibility to opportunistically lean in when we see compelling value in the business we know best. Wrapping up, our third quarter results represented another period of consistent delivery against our commitments. Our top-line growth was strong and resilient and we reinvested in our brands and differentiated capabilities. We also achieved important proof points in our margin recovery journey this quarter as visible in our consolidated gross margin progress, and in U.S. Coffee segment results. Our Q3 results provide enhanced visibility to our unchanged 2023 outlook for constant currency net sales growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. We expect to close out 2023 having significantly improved our composition of earnings profile, lending further support to our aspiration to be on algorithm in 2024. I'll now turn it over to Sudhanshu.\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi : Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Our consolidated third quarter results were solid. Top-line growth was resilient, and supported future momentum by reinvesting in the business and we delivered modest EPS upside relative to the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Revenue advanced 5.1% to $3.8 billion with healthy constant currency sales growth of 4.1%. Pricing remained the primary growth driver, contributing 5.5 points as expected by the moderation from the second quarter as prior year pricing actions were lapped. Volume mix strengthened sequentially, posting a modest 1.4% decline year-over-year. Gross profit margin inflected positively in the quarter and expanded a strong 100 basis points year-over-year as pricing and efficiency gains begin to offset input cost inflation. Total SG&A deleveraged 130 basis points year-over-year, reflecting our focus to reinvest in our brands and capabilities while combating sustained inflation. SG&A saw another quarter of double-digit increases in marketing spending, while transportation, warehousing and other corporate costs such as labor remains headwinds. Adjusted operating income grew 3.1%, which, combined with below-the-line leverage, resulted in mid-single-digit EPS growth to $0.48, slightly ahead of the guidance we shared last quarter. We achieved this result without the benefit of any nonoperational gains in the quarter as we continue to make progress on reinforcing our earnings base looking out to next year. Moving to the segments. U.S. Refreshment Beverages grew net sales 5.9%, led by 7.1 percentage points of pricing. The price contribution moderated quarter-over-quarter as anticipated as we begin to anniversary some of the last year's pricing activity. Volume mix declined 1.2%, reflecting outperformance versus our categories across the vast majority of our portfolio and the growth contribution from C4 Energy. As Bob said, we expect price to remain a continued driver of the top-line growth algorithm in quarter four and into next year, even as growth rebalances across volume, mix, and pricing contributions. Consumer is resilient, category elasticities are manageable and inflation to moderating remains a headwind. Segment operating income grew 6.1% in the quarter and segment margins were approximately flat year-over-year. This performance reflected the favorable impact of pricing and productivity, net of inflation, offset by increased investment in marketing. In U.S. Coffee, net sales decreased 3.2%, improving versus the second quarter trough as expected. Pricing sequentially strengthened and contributed 3.1 percentage points of growth. Some of this reflected pricing that lagged realized inflation across our partner portfolio and is now flowing through after a delay. In future cycles, we expect the pricing pass-through necessary to offset inflation to be more seamless. Volume mix declined 6.3% year-over-year in quarter three. Brewers grew 8% as we moved past destocking in the first half and shift in for the important holiday period. For the back half, as a whole, we expect brewer shipments to track point-of-sale strength, which remains softer in today's macro environment and are still declining in the mid to high single digits compared to last year. Importantly, Keurig brewers continue to gain share within the coffee maker category and we still expect to finish the year having grown penetration to approximately 40 million households in the Keurig ecosystem as compared to approximately 38 million at the end of 2022. All shipments declined 8%, similar to last quarter. However, by our measure, category consumption volume in single serve were flat year-over-year across all channels, a sequential improvement relative to quarter two. As we previewed would happen last quarter, shipments lagged category consumption in the period due primarily to two factors: First, the competition against a year ago channel inventory build; and second, the volume impact from our decision to exit certain low-margin private label contracts. We anticipate a smaller combined impact from these factors in quarter four and expect all shipments to sequentially strengthen relative to quarter three. Office segment operating income grew 5.7% and operating margins expanded strongly. At near 33%, segment operating margins increased 280 basis points versus the prior year and also compared very favorably relative to 30.4% in the first half. The significant infection was driven by pricing, productivity, and moderating inflation, and we expect it to sustain. As Bob mentioned, the part of the expected revenue recovery is slightly altered relative to our original plan due to some prudent price arrangement in a competitive environment. Nevertheless, margin trends are expected to accelerate further in quarter four. Fundamental progress is expected to drive continued solid operating income growth year-over-year even as we lap a difficult comparison given nonoperational benefits partially contributed to U.S. Coffee operating income last year. International segment sales increased 20.8% in the third quarter against a double-digit growth tempera in the year-ago period. Constant currency sales growth was very strong at 12.9%, with volume mix increasing 9% and pricing up 3.9%. Our top-line momentum are broad-based across Mexico and Canada. Segment operating income grew very strongly at 39.4% on a reported basis and 31.7% in constant currency terms, thanks to operating leverage and efficiency gains netting favorably against inflation. And anticipated, our free cash flow conversion strengthened sequentially in the third quarter to $459 million, reflecting the combination of profit growth and moderating working capital users and consistent with our expectation for free cash flow conversion to strengthen in the second half. Our capital allocation approach remains unchanged. Our priorities include organic and inorganic investments to support our growth, further strengthening our balance sheet, consistent with our long-term net leverage ratio target of 2 times to 2.5 times, and returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and opportunistic share buybacks. We dynamically adjust between these priorities on an ongoing basis. In quarter three, we closed on the highly strategic La Colombe partnerships first introduced in July, which included a $300 million equity investment. Today, we announced another important partnership with Grupo PiSA to sell, distribute and merchandise Electrolit in the U.S. This is a meaningful step forward into sports hydration for KDP and establishes another mix accretive growth platform, even as it comes with minimal capital commitments. As Bob pointed out, with entries into energy, RTD coffee, and sports hydration over the past 12 months, we have penetrated three large and important white spaces for a relatively modest capital outlay of less than $1.3 billion. We also have the ability and desire to continue to return cash to our shareholders. In September, we announced a 7.5% increase, marking our third consecutive year of growing our dividend and representing a cumulative 43% increase over that time. Our CRE purchases will remain opportunistic and we have demonstrated a willingness step in when our share price becomes dislocated from the long-term value we expect to create. The approximately $3.2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization, we will continue to assess the market for such opportunities. Moving now to guidance. We are reaffirming our consolidated outlook for 2023 and continue to target constant currency net sales growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. Our EPS outlook assumes minimal benefits from nonoperational items in 2023, implying double-digit EPS growth on an underlying basis. Our guidance for below-the-line items is consistent with last quarter. For the year, we continue to expect interest expense in a $470 million to $475 million range, effective tax rate of 22% and approximately $1.41 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We expect a strong end to the year in quarter four with similar top-line dynamics in quarter three and even a stronger gross margin expansion. At the same time, we will be lapping approximately $67 million of nonoperational gains in last year's fourth quarter, primarily concentrated in the U.S. Coffee segment, which creates a challenging comparison. Blending these factors together, we expect Q4 adjusted EPS of approximately $0.54 or 8% year-over-year growth. On an underlying basis, this represents strong double-digit EPS growth. With that, I will now turn the call back to Bob for closing comments.\nRobert Gamgort : Thanks, Sudhanshu. I'd like to close by saying how excited we all are that Tim Cofer has joined KDP as Chief Operating Officer on November 6. From there, we are looking forward to a smooth CEO transition between Tim and me in Q2 next year in continuity as I serve as KDP's Executive Chairman thereafter. Upon joining KDP, Tim's immediate focus will be immersing himself in the business. He will also partner with Sudhanshu, the full executive leadership team, and me to drive our annual operating planning process for 2024. A lot of robust work is underway, and we expect to provide you with a detailed outlook when we report our Q4 results. For now, let me just say that our entire organization is focused on delivering a strong finish to 2023. We expect that Tim will join Sudhanshu and me in this forum in February and I know you will enjoy meeting him after that. I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. You may now go ahead.\nDrew Levine : Hi, good morning. This is Drew Levine on for Andrea. Thank you for taking my question. So, I just wanted to ask on U.S. Coffee. If you could talk more specifically to the trends during the quarter, both in tracked and untracked channels, if the recovery is sort of playing out sequentially as you expected, and what we could think about the exit rate for September and October being? And then secondarily, I think the expectation was for pod volumes to perhaps see moderating declines in the quarter. They were pretty flat. So, anything changed incrementally during the quarter from a pod shipment perspective? Thank you.\nRobert Gamgort : Sure, Drew. Thanks for the question. On our last call, we talked about drivers of improved coffee performance going forward. One was margin improvement and the other one was rebound in the total at-home coffee category. And so that goes beyond single-serve to all forms of coffee consumed at home. Obviously, as you saw in the results, we've received the -- or we've experienced the inflection that we expected in the margin side, and that's largely under our control and big driver of our performance. The category is experiencing sequential improvement. But admittedly, it is gradual. When we take a look at consumption of single-serve and we use our proprietary data, which looks at tracked and untracked channels and remember, the track channels represent roughly 60% of total consumption, we're seeing that the volumes are flat, which is an improvement sequentially, but a bit slower than we expected. And so that's really the core of any shipment shortfall versus expectations is really driven by the category. I would remind you, within that, the single-serve and KDP continues to grow share within that category. The theme that we've talked about before about controlling the controllables margin share performance all are really quite good. The challenge is really this total at-home coffee category, which is moving in the right direction, albeit at a slower pace. My last comment on that is what we're experiencing on at-home coffee in the U.S. is not unique to the U.S. It's a trend that we're seeing in most developed markets as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your may now go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian : So, just to follow up, do you expect the category will continue to recover going forward sequentially from here? Can we get back to growth going forward? And maybe can you detail what's driven the acceleration in untracked channels and how sustainable that is going forward? And then just second, if you could take a bit of a lookout to 2024, you mentioned on algo for the total company. Does that apply to the coffee business in terms of a more normalized organic sales growth and profit growth pace as you look out to 2024? Thanks.\nRobert Gamgort : Sure. I think that when you take a look at the shipment -- or the trajectory of the coffee category, I think it speaks for itself. We talked a lot about mobility as a big driver, and we certainly weren't the only ones that were looking at that. So, mobility is no longer a factor. It's gone back to a more normalized environment. And so, I think that the trajectory that we're seeing right now on improved coffee consumption will continue. The drivers of that, I think it's -- there are multiple contributors to the slower but steady improvement in the category, including really a change in work routines, where you're looking at more hybrid work. The afternoon occasion, for example, changes on that. On the margins, we could see some impact from pricing and inflation and also some of the trends in cold coffee, which also indexes to out-of-home. But there's nothing structural going on right now. And you can imagine, we spent a lot of time digging into the fundamental consumer drivers of coffee. The tailwinds are incredibly strong. the movement towards improving growth looks to be right in front of us here. But we're being honest in saying that the total at-home coffee category has been more gradual than we originally expected, although we don't -- like I said, we don't see anything structural. With regard to the untracked channels, why is that stronger? It's really driven by club and e-commerce. E-commerce, which was growing prior to the pandemic, accelerated significantly during the pandemic, and it really has shown no signs of pulling back from that. And we talked before about the importance of e-commerce in our total business, but you can imagine when you look at individual segments, that single-serve coffee is really an ideal segment for e-commerce. It's lightweight, high value, long shelf life, not fragile to ship. So, you can really have a quite a good business on e-commerce. In addition to that, remember, we've been increasing our own subscription business and services to the consumer. And as we put more smart brewers out there, and allows for smart consumption-based reordering, I think that e-commerce will continue to grow. And I think club is an overall consumer shift towards that channel. It represents a good value. I also think that some of the changing away from home coffee trends, meaning office coffee trends have also benefit the club channel as well as people in small and midsized offices are picking up their supplies there as well as in e-commerce. And then with regard to 2024, I mean, we've given you our macro outlook. We're not going to break it down by individual segments. The one thing I would say that I believe is important is this gradual or more gradual rebound in coffee is something that we've been able to factor in our thought process as we think about our total company algorithm. And obviously, it's something that we've digested and built it into our expectations.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Maybe Bob, maybe to just pick up on that last point, and maybe a little bit higher level, just thinking about the consumer. As we've gone through this earnings season, it's -- there just seems like economizing behavior in a lot of different forms has kind of Bob more as we've moved through the back half of this year and Hershey talked a little bit about it this morning as well. And so, can you give perspective on two things. One, just how you're thinking or how KDP is thinking about the consumer next year, stronger, weaker, and how maybe you're adjusting your plans across all businesses for that? And then the second, just because it's been so topical, just kind of how you -- how KDP is digesting all of the sort of information about GLP-1? And is that something you're beginning to factor into your longer-term plans?\nRobert Gamgort : Yes. Thank you, Brian. Thanks for those questions. Our -- we plan our business on a range of outcomes. We've said that before. We've been very watchful of the consumer and concerned about trade-down behaviors as a result of financial pressures. As we said, the consumer today remains incredibly resilient but we're thoughtful about how that might shift into the future. We look across our entire portfolio, we have the ability to shift across formats, mix, channels, price pack architecture on both the refreshment beverage side and the cold beverage side -- I mean, on the coffee side, to be able to react to any of those changes. But as of right now, we haven't really seen that. There is a potential cascade that happens where you could talk about within traditional retail where consumer looks to lower-priced items and shops in more value-oriented channels. There's another piece as well, which is a cascade from away from home to in-home. And some of the surveys that I've looked at recently is if you are pinched -- these are consumer surveys, if you're pinched, what do you give up first? And what the consumer gives up first is dining out of home and travel. And so, I think that what happens is that moves those occasions in home where we benefit from them. And if you could take a look at the broad portfolio across all formats, but also specifically within coffee, we've been working really hard to provide similar options to produce specialty coffee, cold coffee, coffee any form that they get out of home in home. And so, I actually think that's a benefit for the category going forward. So, the conclusion is nothing as we sit here today. Very possible in the future and certainly in our range of planning, but lots of flexibility for us to deal with it and potentially some upside on certain segments, including coffee. With regard to GLP-1, we've had the opportunity to look at every trend possible from a consumer perspective for opportunities and risk. We've spent a lot of time digging into the most robust data that's available, and I would caution everybody that the data that is actually available is really limited at this point. What we would want to see as an industry, before you go with any conclusions, is you'd want to see known GLP-1 users and be able to match their behavioral data over time. Self-reported data, survey data, trying to figure out who might be a GLP-1 consumer is really dangerous. The data that we're able to get into, which is quite limited on actual GLP users and their known consumption for us is neutral, may even be different than that by meaning more positive, but let me just say neutral right now. And here are the facts, and I think it actually makes sense with just playing good sense, which is there's no evidence that people drink less in terms of beverages. So, unless you believe the consumption of tap water is going up, there's no indication of that, and somebody in the beverage industry is picking up those sales. Are mix shift possible? Absolutely, but we haven't seen anything significant in the data that we have in front of us within the world of beverage. And I would remind you that we have a very, very broad portfolio. And in fact, more than 60% of our products as in our corporate responsibility portfolio are classified as positive nutrition. So, it's very similar to the conversation on recession. Consumers don't drink less if they change their mix in terms of which formats and types of beverages they consume. We have one of those occasions. And also, we have the ability to innovate should we choose to. We've had some questions on coffee. Specifically, all the data that we can see right now, there's no impact on coffee consumption as a result of that. So, when we step back, we are surprised by the reaction. And quite honestly, we're surprised that the conversation is about food and beverage. We don't participate in the food industry, but I can tell you in the beverage industry, I really think that there's little to be concerned about here. Having said that, we're going to continue to study. We'll get more robust data. We'll be able to see what I said before, which is known GLP-1 users and their actual consumption patterns over time. And I think the picture will become much clearer, but that's our conclusion today.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your may now go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein : Thank you, very much. Two questions. First, congratulations on the deal with Electrolit. When I was at NAX [ph], a month or so ago, it was all the rage. A lot of talk about it. Can you just -- you mentioned that it was accretive to your mix. Can you talk about what that means? Because I would have thought this is just a distributor margin that you're getting. So maybe talk to us about the impact on your business? And then the second question is -- and this is kind of outdated. If you go back before Keurig and you talked to the old management team about the smaller pack sizes, Dr. Pepper was lagging, and there was a little bit of pushback saying that going into this different variety of pack sizes and can sizes would add unneeded complexity. And I know a hell of a lot has changed since then. I'm just wondering where you are in terms of your manufacturing and canning capabilities today in terms of meeting that greater variety of pack sizes?\nRobert Gamgort : Yes. So, Robert, I'm glad that you saw Electrolit at NAX and the excitement about. This is a business that we've been tracking for some time, and we've been really impressed with their strong growth. The fact that their consumer target is multicultural. And it's a perfect example as we've discussed with C4, with La Colombe, with Polar, where we can take a brand that is very strong and has a clear consumer base and opportunity and help them grow through expanded distribution, proof merchandising, and access to our RGM capabilities, category management capabilities, and more. And so, this one, I think, is another one of these win-win structures. When we think about Electrolit coming into our business and its implications on 2024, clearly, it's a contributor to revenue growth. Similar to what we talked about with C4, in its first year of incorporation, we don't think about it as much of a driver of profit growth. But when you get into its second year, it will be able to contribute profitability and we'll provide framing around that at that time. And that's because we make significant investments in the first year to get the brand on board. And also, as we discussed earlier, this gives us a wonderful opportunity to put more investment in our -- market system to be able to improve coverage with the fact that we now have larger job sizes and increased frequency. And as we said a number of times, that benefits all brands within our system. The fact that we put in the prepared remarks about the 50% growth in large outlet C-stores for us is a very significant consideration here in terms of our ability to cover our convenience stores for our entire portfolio. So, this is yet another great example of how we're able to build our capabilities. Your point about smaller pack sizes, yes, the other world has changed quite a bit. we have substantial distribution, and we have good manufacturing flexibility on small pack sizes. We see them as an incremental driver of growth. They happen to also be margin accretive. They're very much in line with consumer trends where if someone wants to treat themselves and a portion of our portfolio is in the treat need state that we give them an opportunity to do so in a smaller pack size. And that's been the case in other CP industries. And as we think about our manufacturing base going forward, flexibility in formats and pack sizes is a critical capability that we continue to invest in to give us the optionality of price pack architecture moving forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. You may now go ahead.\nBonnie Herzog : Bob, I was hoping you could give us some more color on the exiting of certain private label contracts in terms of maybe how big these customers are and if there's an expectation for more to come. And then you called out a tough comparison on your pod volumes in the quarter, given the trade inventory builds in the year-ago period. So just trying to understand how big of an impact do you think that was? And could you just confirm, I thought you said that you're already starting to see pod volumes improve in Q4? Thanks.\nRobert Gamgort : Yes. So, on the first one on the exit of some private label partners, that really began in Q2. I mean, the best way for you to size it is you can take a look at the track data for the most part and just see KDP manufactured share and it's going to show you we're unlicensed versus licensed private level is. And I don't think that that's -- it's not -- it's definitely not a driver of profitability. And it's a minor contributor to revenue, but it's the right thing to do over the long term. We offer significant value to our partners. And we're also the driver and the player who invest in brewer innovation, brewer launches, which is the catalyst for the entire industry. And from time to time, in these negotiations, we find partners on the other side who don't want to pay for the value added. And we -- there's a point in which we don't drop price because we know that we add that value. And I would also point out that in almost every circumstance, both partners have come back to us over the long term because they miss with they have from KDP. So, you'll see it in the tracked channels, and I don't think it's a big deal. Second part of the question was about the -- you asked a bit about inventory, and that's really a question about the gap between shipments and consumption. The best way to characterize that is that if we tell you that the category rebound is going in the right direction, but not at the pace that any of us expected, when I say any of us, anybody who operates in the coffee industry and develop markets globally, then there's always going to be a disconnect between shipments and consumption. And there may be some shipments ahead of consumption based on those expectations. That happened. That's normalizing. Expect that gap to narrow further in Q4. So, to me, that's a lagging indicator. It's a contributor to the shipment piece, which is worthy for a conversation in this quarter. But over the long term, the pieces to really watch our, how's the at-home coffee category performing because that really drives everything. How is our share being total single-serve and total KDP share of at-home coffee, that continues to expand? And then the last part of it is our margin against that volume, which also is very high and improving. The combination of those three really does create value. But again, it's created some short-term disruption as we get out of this got of this -- still the after-effects of the rebound from the pandemic piece.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. You may now go ahead.\nChris Carey : I know you're not going to specify what drove the margin improvement in the quarter specifically. But can you maybe frame the relative contribution of pricing, of productivity, of easing commodity inflation, maybe it was even a benefit? And also, you've been quite adamant that the mix impact of your own portfolio underperforming is not as great as what is sometimes debated. And so, I wonder how that impacted the quarter as well, and you're clearly looking for an acceleration in margins in Q4. And I think really what I'm trying to do is get some confidence that while pod volumes could be volatile within your portfolio, they could be volatile. But as you go into next year, here's why we're going to continue to have visibility on margins even if shipments or otherwise are a bit different than maybe what we would expect one quarter or two quarters out, right? So really trying to help frame the Q3 margins and to kind of get some help on the go forward.\nRobert Gamgort : Yes. Let me talk about the margin inflection that we've seen in the quarter, and we talked about prior to that. And then I'll ask Sudhanshu to take a look at where we are on -- from a segment OI perspective and a forward outlook on that. We had a number of conversations in the past, as you'll recall, about the gap between pricing to partners and private label versus the inflation that was -- that we were experiencing that had never been contemplated in the years in which we had the prior years in which we had signed those agreements. And remember, that's very different than pricing that you see at retail, just to be clear because I know when I say pricing, people immediately go to retail pricing. What I'm talking about is the contractual pricing that we have with partners and private label, who then in turn set their own retail pricing as a result of that. And so, we said that there was a lag, but it would flow through. It's flowing through. We have great visibility to it going forward, to answer your question, because it's contractual. And I think the other point to make, and it's an emphasis of the prepared remarks, is that we've now adjusted all of those agreements going forward, and we don't expect a substantial lag to -- between pricing and inflation to occur in the future. So, lessons learned from the past, a bit of pain that we had to incur over the past couple of years, but that's all catching up right now, and you're seeing that flowing through. In addition to that partner and private label pricing flowing through, we're also seeing some moderation in inflation, and we're experiencing an increase in productivity. As we said a couple of times, when we were in a supply chain disruption mode, and we were trying to get every case out the door, productivity takes a backseat. We're in really good shape on our supply chain from a capacity standpoint. And we have the ability now to focus on productivity and dial that up. So, it's a combination of partner private label pricing, productivity, and moderating inflation that is contributing to the margin inflection you're seeing now and also our confidence and visibility into the future. But Sudhanshu, why don't to take up a minute and talk more about that last piece?\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Thanks, Bob. Chris, if you think through -- think about Q4 and beyond, in Q4, we are expecting a sequential improvement in pod shipment as category is gradually recovering. We also plan to have margin expansion in quarter four higher than quarter three. We talked about that before. And we will also see a solid operating income growth in quarter four, even stronger underlying. As you all know, we had a lot of nonoperating benefit in coffee. So, you will have a stronger underlying growth because we're planning minimal nonoperating thing. As you think through 2024, our plan is to continue to gradually rebuild margin in the coffee category started with quarter three. You saw we went from 30% roughly in the first half to 33%. Q4 will expand further, and you will see this gradual buildup or rebuild up our margin in 2024.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jane Gelfand for any closing remarks.\nJane Gelfand: Thanks, Anthony, and thank you, everyone. We appreciate your time and attention this morning. And as always, the Investor Relations team is available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our Q3 results. KDP's diversified beverage portfolio and strong execution continue to support consistent delivery of our company goals and commitments, even as the operating environment around us remains dynamic. In Q3, healthy organic sales growth and significant gross margin progress fueled reinvestment and bottom-line growth, reinforcing the ability to our full year outlook, which remains unchanged. Third quarter constant currency net sales grew 4.1%. As expected, net price realization moderated from the first half but remain the primary top-line growth driver, while volume mix strengthened sequentially. Our performance reflected continued share gains in U.S. Refreshment Beverages, gradual recovery in U.S. coffee segment results, and strong momentum in our International business. Gross profit margin expanded significantly, up 100 basis points year-over-year and the largest improvement in four years, reflecting an improved balance between ongoing inflation, pricing and productivity. Gross profit growth enabled us to continue reinvesting in the business, including increased marketing for the third consecutive quarter, while simultaneously driving bottom line growth which was slightly above the expectations we shared with you back in July. As we move through Q4 and plan for next year, we expect our revenue growth drivers to continue to normalize as pricing moderates relative to recent history and volume mix continues to improve. To be clear, pricing is expected to remain a key part of the top-line equation, especially considering that inflation is likely to persist, albeit at more moderate levels than over the last couple of years. Simultaneously, our focus will be on supporting volume mix by balancing margin flexibility between reinvestment and future top-line growth and earnings flow-through. Let me take a step back and frame how we assess consumer health, our portfolio, and our strategy in the macro environment. The consumer remains healthy with demand resilient and category elasticity is manageable. Even so, consumers are closely calibrating where and how they shop? For instance, growth in club and other value-oriented channels has accelerated while the convenience of e-commerce and pickup and delivery services continues to resonate well after any pandemic-related uplift would have normalized. Consumers remain responsive to high-quality innovation and activation, but price and package architecture is another increasingly important dimension, including smaller pack sizes that hit key price points and multipacks that offer value and convenience. On the margin, we also see some migration of lower to middle-income households towards at-home meal and beverage occasions, which should benefit our more essential categories like CSDs and coffee. The business is well positioned against this backdrop, thanks to a compelling all-weather growth model. The ability to seamlessly meet the consumer across all beverage need states and to service those occasions across all channels is at the heart of why we formed this modern beverage company. Since then, we've made even more progress as we significantly grew the portfolio reach and strengthen our internal capabilities. Looking forward, our distribution prowess across retail is broad-based with very strong in-market execution yet we also enjoy a scaled online business, particularly on the coffee side. Our robust 2024 innovation pipeline has been well received by the trade and spans product, format, and packaging news. It captures a combination of value and premium price points as well as low and no calorie and indulgent beverages. We also continue to price nimbly across the entirety of our portfolio, including by leveraging our strong mix management capabilities. In short, the consumer is resilient but choiceful and KDP is positioned to drive attractive top-line growth through a combination of volume, mix, and price levers. Our successful growth model rests on our exclusive focus on North American beverages and a winning strategy. It begins with KDP's powerful twin distribution assets, our multichannel cold beverage distribution system, including DSD, and an installed base of nearly 40 million active households using the Keurig system. This is an unparalleled combination in the industry, which enhanced by strong R&D and commercial backbone, enables us to grow our categories, and gain share across our base business, and further build out our portfolio through high-value M&A and partnerships with counterparties who increasingly seek us out. When we fill in category white spaces, such as through our announcement today of the partnership with Electrolit, fuels a virtuous cycle of growth, investment, and growing returns on that investment. As the new brand scale and our portfolio expands, our capabilities get stronger. Drop sizes get bigger, our merchandising gets more impactful, we service each store and household more frequently and our commercial and consumer relationships tighten. This enables further investment in growth that begins to cycle anew. We have proven this model over multiple years. In U.S. Refreshment Beverages, we have consistently outperformed our categories, growing dollar share in at least 75% of our business in all but two quarters since the beginning of 2019. We also entered multiple strategic white spaces within the past 12 months such as ready-to-drink coffee, energy, and after today's announcement, sports hydration, all were achieved in a very capital-efficient manner. The growth path ahead is increasingly evident with both owned and partner brands. The latter, where our relationships are strategic and long-term, growth and mix are positive, and our economics are attractive. Coffee, the single-serve segment has continued to steadily gain share of at-home coffee, cementing Keurig's leadership position with this important category. At the same time, we are expanding our total coffee strategy to encompass iced, ready-to-drink, and other forms of coffee within and beyond the K-Cup format. And in Canada and Mexico, we have leveraged similar strategies across our Refreshment Beverages and coffee business as well as deeply experienced local teams to build a combined business approaching $2 billion in revenue, with a mid-20s operating margin. As a result, our International segment has become a scaled contributor to the overall portfolio with significant growth runway ahead. I'll now briefly discuss how this strategy played out in Q3, with Sudhanshu to follow with greater detail and guidance. In U.S. Refreshment Beverages, 82% of our business outpaced category growth in the quarter. CSD business is healthy. Dr Pepper building on the momentum of strawberries and cream earlier in the year, with a successful sixth season of the iconic Fansville marketing campaign. Other brands such as Canada Dry and Squirt also saw strong gains. And Polar's momentum continued in sparkling water, where it now commands the number two volume share position. CORE and Evian remains strong drivers in premium waters with CORE, in particular, seeing great traction from our partnership with U.S. gymnastics. That said, work to do elsewhere in the still portfolio including with buy, is undergoing a significant restage and reformulation next year. Importantly, our partnership with Nutrabolt on C4 is proceeding very well. In Q3, C4's market share and earned display accelerated while velocities remain strong across those regions where KDP has taken control of the brand throughout the market. Even as the C4 rollout continues in its first year, we have significant room for future growth in energy, where KDP's market share is only 3%, and C4 has tremendous potential. With the Electrolit announcement today, we are extending our portfolio into the large and important sport hydration category, another quickly growing mix accretive white space for KDP. Electrolit is a brand that has established a strong regional foothold, thanks to its unique product attributes, scientific heritage, and extremely loyal customer base. The brand is the market leader in sports hydration in Mexico, and that popularity extends to the U.S. where Electrolit enjoys broad multicultural appeal but over-indexes with Hispanic consumers. Though it has good scale today in the U.S. and already generates more than $400 million in retail sales, representing more than a tenfold increase over the past five years, Electrolit has significant upside potential. We are excited to partner with Grupo PiSA, Electrolit's parent company, to meaningfully expand the brand's distribution breadth and depth in the U.S. and across all channels while also leveraging KDP's commercial expertise to further enhance the brand's position at retail. With C4, Lock alone, and Electrolit having entered our portfolio over the last 12 months, we have meaningfully increased the growth potential for each of these brands while extending a positive halo on the rest of our business. For example, our total volume in chain convenience stores will increase by approximately 50% after incorporating these brands, providing scale and efficiency benefits across the entirety of our portfolio. This is the virtuous cycle that I described just a few minutes ago and which will continue to fuel KDP's success. Turning now to U.S. coffee, where our back half is focused on driving segment margin improvement in the context of gradually improving at-home coffee category volumes. With visible progress on both fronts, let's address each in turn. I'll start with the segment margin improvement. We have a greater ability to control in the short term than we do with category trends. Q3, we began to deliver against our objective with a strong inflection in segment margins and operating income, which meaningfully improved both sequentially and year-over-year. Importantly, we expect the margin improvements to continue. We previously said that delayed pricing would flow through our partner brands, and it has. We have now strengthened the pricing protocols across these long-term partnerships and do not expect any significant lag between inflation and pricing to recur in the future. Plus, commodity cost headwinds are now moderating and productivity is building across the segment, enhancing our visibility to continuing to grow the bottom line even with ongoing reinvestment. Moving to category performance. At-home coffee category volume growth accelerated relative to Q2 but the pace of recovery is admittedly gradual. From Q2 to Q3, volume trends across the broader category strengthened by about 100 basis points in measured channels though volumes are still modestly lower year-over-year. Single-serve continues to gain share of at-home coffee with our proprietary data, which is more comprehensive spanning both measured and untracked channels, indicating that Q3 Keurig's compatible pod consumption volume was approximately flat versus a year ago, proving from down approximately 3% in Q2. These green shoots are encouraging, and we will continue to nurture them as the single-serve market share leader. During the quarter, we saw our competitors begin to lean more aggressively into price promotions in the single-serve category, resulting in some share shifts across the various brands in the ecosystem. As a reminder, because we manufacture nearly 80% of all Keurig compatible pods in the U.S., we tend to participate even share changes occur between our branded and private label partner brands and our owned and licensed brands. Nevertheless, we must responsibly manage our owned and licensed brands price gaps within the category and intend to stay nimble to the changing operating conditions around us. Importantly, as we choose to surgically respond to the recent price activity, we expect segment margins to accelerate in Q4. We also do not expect the competitive pricing activity to meaningfully accelerate at-home coffee category buying, which we know are far more responsive to high-quality activities that influence consumer choice and lean into emerging trends. As the single-serve leader, KDP will continue to drive category growth as we always have through innovation, renovation, and white space expansion that build penetration with new households and increased usage among our existing consumers. With 90 million U.S. households drinking coffee at home, of which fewer than 40 million are actively using Keurig brewers, there is a significant multiyear opportunity ahead. In 2024, we will continue to pursue that growth through new consumables like cold brew, expanded ice varieties, and refreshers. New brands like La Colombe, which, by the way, begins to ship in ready-to-drink and K-Cup format starting in Q4, significantly new innovation in brewers, all supported by strong marketing and brand activation activity, including exciting new collaborations across our owned and licensed brands. Moving on to our International performance in Q3, which remained impressive with revenue growth once again, in double digits and continued segment margin expansion. Both our Coffee and Refreshment Beverages businesses performed well. Canada, the ready-to-drink alcohol and no alcohol segment is growing, and we are contributing to that growth. ATP gained significant share as velocity and distribution built and a blast from the past, vodka-based Tahiti Treat RTD generated exceptional consumer demand. In Mexico, our powerhouse Pena CL and Squirt brands, both grew at a double-digit rate, leveraging our strong go-to-market and DSD capabilities behind which we continue best. In Mexico, like in the U.S., we have significant growth potential ahead across both our core portfolio and through partnerships as we leverage these unique distribution assets. KDP's strong balance sheet and cash generation profile are powerful enablers of our broader growth strategy with today's Electrolit announcement yet another example of how we can grow our portfolio and market reach in a highly capital-efficient manner. As a result, our financial policy approach can be flexible and dynamic. This year, we are deploying some of our cash flow to strategically reduce our supplier financing program. Simultaneously, we announced a 7.5% increase in our annual dividend furthering our track record of regularly growing dividend income for our shareholders. With over $3 billion remaining on our share buyback authorization and having already repurchased 24 million shares of KDP stock over the last two years, we have substantial flexibility to opportunistically lean in when we see compelling value in the business we know best. Wrapping up, our third quarter results represented another period of consistent delivery against our commitments. Our top-line growth was strong and resilient and we reinvested in our brands and differentiated capabilities. We also achieved important proof points in our margin recovery journey this quarter as visible in our consolidated gross margin progress, and in U.S. Coffee segment results. Our Q3 results provide enhanced visibility to our unchanged 2023 outlook for constant currency net sales growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. We expect to close out 2023 having significantly improved our composition of earnings profile, lending further support to our aspiration to be on algorithm in 2024. I'll now turn it over to Sudhanshu. Thanks, Sudhanshu. I'd like to close by saying how excited we all are that Tim Cofer has joined KDP as Chief Operating Officer on November 6. From there, we are looking forward to a smooth CEO transition between Tim and me in Q2 next year in continuity as I serve as KDP's Executive Chairman thereafter. Upon joining KDP, Tim's immediate focus will be immersing himself in the business. He will also partner with Sudhanshu, the full executive leadership team, and me to drive our annual operating planning process for 2024. A lot of robust work is underway, and we expect to provide you with a detailed outlook when we report our Q4 results. For now, let me just say that our entire organization is focused on delivering a strong finish to 2023. We expect that Tim will join Sudhanshu and me in this forum in February and I know you will enjoy meeting him after that. I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Sure, Drew. Thanks for the question. On our last call, we talked about drivers of improved coffee performance going forward. One was margin improvement and the other one was rebound in the total at-home coffee category. And so that goes beyond single-serve to all forms of coffee consumed at home. Obviously, as you saw in the results, we've received the -- or we've experienced the inflection that we expected in the margin side, and that's largely under our control and big driver of our performance. The category is experiencing sequential improvement. But admittedly, it is gradual. When we take a look at consumption of single-serve and we use our proprietary data, which looks at tracked and untracked channels and remember, the track channels represent roughly 60% of total consumption, we're seeing that the volumes are flat, which is an improvement sequentially, but a bit slower than we expected. And so that's really the core of any shipment shortfall versus expectations is really driven by the category. I would remind you, within that, the single-serve and KDP continues to grow share within that category. The theme that we've talked about before about controlling the controllables margin share performance all are really quite good. The challenge is really this total at-home coffee category, which is moving in the right direction, albeit at a slower pace. My last comment on that is what we're experiencing on at-home coffee in the U.S. is not unique to the U.S. It's a trend that we're seeing in most developed markets as well. Sure. I think that when you take a look at the shipment -- or the trajectory of the coffee category, I think it speaks for itself. We talked a lot about mobility as a big driver, and we certainly weren't the only ones that were looking at that. So, mobility is no longer a factor. It's gone back to a more normalized environment. And so, I think that the trajectory that we're seeing right now on improved coffee consumption will continue. The drivers of that, I think it's -- there are multiple contributors to the slower but steady improvement in the category, including really a change in work routines, where you're looking at more hybrid work. The afternoon occasion, for example, changes on that. On the margins, we could see some impact from pricing and inflation and also some of the trends in cold coffee, which also indexes to out-of-home. But there's nothing structural going on right now. And you can imagine, we spent a lot of time digging into the fundamental consumer drivers of coffee. The tailwinds are incredibly strong. the movement towards improving growth looks to be right in front of us here. But we're being honest in saying that the total at-home coffee category has been more gradual than we originally expected, although we don't -- like I said, we don't see anything structural. With regard to the untracked channels, why is that stronger? It's really driven by club and e-commerce. E-commerce, which was growing prior to the pandemic, accelerated significantly during the pandemic, and it really has shown no signs of pulling back from that. And we talked before about the importance of e-commerce in our total business, but you can imagine when you look at individual segments, that single-serve coffee is really an ideal segment for e-commerce. It's lightweight, high value, long shelf life, not fragile to ship. So, you can really have a quite a good business on e-commerce. In addition to that, remember, we've been increasing our own subscription business and services to the consumer. And as we put more smart brewers out there, and allows for smart consumption-based reordering, I think that e-commerce will continue to grow. And I think club is an overall consumer shift towards that channel. It represents a good value. I also think that some of the changing away from home coffee trends, meaning office coffee trends have also benefit the club channel as well as people in small and midsized offices are picking up their supplies there as well as in e-commerce. And then with regard to 2024, I mean, we've given you our macro outlook. We're not going to break it down by individual segments. The one thing I would say that I believe is important is this gradual or more gradual rebound in coffee is something that we've been able to factor in our thought process as we think about our total company algorithm. And obviously, it's something that we've digested and built it into our expectations. Yes. Thank you, Brian. Thanks for those questions. Our -- we plan our business on a range of outcomes. We've said that before. We've been very watchful of the consumer and concerned about trade-down behaviors as a result of financial pressures. As we said, the consumer today remains incredibly resilient but we're thoughtful about how that might shift into the future. We look across our entire portfolio, we have the ability to shift across formats, mix, channels, price pack architecture on both the refreshment beverage side and the cold beverage side -- I mean, on the coffee side, to be able to react to any of those changes. But as of right now, we haven't really seen that. There is a potential cascade that happens where you could talk about within traditional retail where consumer looks to lower-priced items and shops in more value-oriented channels. There's another piece as well, which is a cascade from away from home to in-home. And some of the surveys that I've looked at recently is if you are pinched -- these are consumer surveys, if you're pinched, what do you give up first? And what the consumer gives up first is dining out of home and travel. And so, I think that what happens is that moves those occasions in home where we benefit from them. And if you could take a look at the broad portfolio across all formats, but also specifically within coffee, we've been working really hard to provide similar options to produce specialty coffee, cold coffee, coffee any form that they get out of home in home. And so, I actually think that's a benefit for the category going forward. So, the conclusion is nothing as we sit here today. Very possible in the future and certainly in our range of planning, but lots of flexibility for us to deal with it and potentially some upside on certain segments, including coffee. With regard to GLP-1, we've had the opportunity to look at every trend possible from a consumer perspective for opportunities and risk. We've spent a lot of time digging into the most robust data that's available, and I would caution everybody that the data that is actually available is really limited at this point. What we would want to see as an industry, before you go with any conclusions, is you'd want to see known GLP-1 users and be able to match their behavioral data over time. Self-reported data, survey data, trying to figure out who might be a GLP-1 consumer is really dangerous. The data that we're able to get into, which is quite limited on actual GLP users and their known consumption for us is neutral, may even be different than that by meaning more positive, but let me just say neutral right now. And here are the facts, and I think it actually makes sense with just playing good sense, which is there's no evidence that people drink less in terms of beverages. So, unless you believe the consumption of tap water is going up, there's no indication of that, and somebody in the beverage industry is picking up those sales. Are mix shift possible? Absolutely, but we haven't seen anything significant in the data that we have in front of us within the world of beverage. And I would remind you that we have a very, very broad portfolio. And in fact, more than 60% of our products as in our corporate responsibility portfolio are classified as positive nutrition. So, it's very similar to the conversation on recession. Consumers don't drink less if they change their mix in terms of which formats and types of beverages they consume. We have one of those occasions. And also, we have the ability to innovate should we choose to. We've had some questions on coffee. Specifically, all the data that we can see right now, there's no impact on coffee consumption as a result of that. So, when we step back, we are surprised by the reaction. And quite honestly, we're surprised that the conversation is about food and beverage. We don't participate in the food industry, but I can tell you in the beverage industry, I really think that there's little to be concerned about here. Having said that, we're going to continue to study. We'll get more robust data. We'll be able to see what I said before, which is known GLP-1 users and their actual consumption patterns over time. And I think the picture will become much clearer, but that's our conclusion today. Yes. So, Robert, I'm glad that you saw Electrolit at NAX and the excitement about. This is a business that we've been tracking for some time, and we've been really impressed with their strong growth. The fact that their consumer target is multicultural. And it's a perfect example as we've discussed with C4, with La Colombe, with Polar, where we can take a brand that is very strong and has a clear consumer base and opportunity and help them grow through expanded distribution, proof merchandising, and access to our RGM capabilities, category management capabilities, and more. And so, this one, I think, is another one of these win-win structures. When we think about Electrolit coming into our business and its implications on 2024, clearly, it's a contributor to revenue growth. Similar to what we talked about with C4, in its first year of incorporation, we don't think about it as much of a driver of profit growth. But when you get into its second year, it will be able to contribute profitability and we'll provide framing around that at that time. And that's because we make significant investments in the first year to get the brand on board. And also, as we discussed earlier, this gives us a wonderful opportunity to put more investment in our -- market system to be able to improve coverage with the fact that we now have larger job sizes and increased frequency. And as we said a number of times, that benefits all brands within our system. The fact that we put in the prepared remarks about the 50% growth in large outlet C-stores for us is a very significant consideration here in terms of our ability to cover our convenience stores for our entire portfolio. So, this is yet another great example of how we're able to build our capabilities. Your point about smaller pack sizes, yes, the other world has changed quite a bit. we have substantial distribution, and we have good manufacturing flexibility on small pack sizes. We see them as an incremental driver of growth. They happen to also be margin accretive. They're very much in line with consumer trends where if someone wants to treat themselves and a portion of our portfolio is in the treat need state that we give them an opportunity to do so in a smaller pack size. And that's been the case in other CP industries. And as we think about our manufacturing base going forward, flexibility in formats and pack sizes is a critical capability that we continue to invest in to give us the optionality of price pack architecture moving forward. Yes. So, on the first one on the exit of some private label partners, that really began in Q2. I mean, the best way for you to size it is you can take a look at the track data for the most part and just see KDP manufactured share and it's going to show you we're unlicensed versus licensed private level is. And I don't think that that's -- it's not -- it's definitely not a driver of profitability. And it's a minor contributor to revenue, but it's the right thing to do over the long term. We offer significant value to our partners. And we're also the driver and the player who invest in brewer innovation, brewer launches, which is the catalyst for the entire industry. And from time to time, in these negotiations, we find partners on the other side who don't want to pay for the value added. And we -- there's a point in which we don't drop price because we know that we add that value. And I would also point out that in almost every circumstance, both partners have come back to us over the long term because they miss with they have from KDP. So, you'll see it in the tracked channels, and I don't think it's a big deal. Second part of the question was about the -- you asked a bit about inventory, and that's really a question about the gap between shipments and consumption. The best way to characterize that is that if we tell you that the category rebound is going in the right direction, but not at the pace that any of us expected, when I say any of us, anybody who operates in the coffee industry and develop markets globally, then there's always going to be a disconnect between shipments and consumption. And there may be some shipments ahead of consumption based on those expectations. That happened. That's normalizing. Expect that gap to narrow further in Q4. So, to me, that's a lagging indicator. It's a contributor to the shipment piece, which is worthy for a conversation in this quarter. But over the long term, the pieces to really watch our, how's the at-home coffee category performing because that really drives everything. How is our share being total single-serve and total KDP share of at-home coffee, that continues to expand? And then the last part of it is our margin against that volume, which also is very high and improving. The combination of those three really does create value. But again, it's created some short-term disruption as we get out of this got of this -- still the after-effects of the rebound from the pandemic piece. Yes. Let me talk about the margin inflection that we've seen in the quarter, and we talked about prior to that. And then I'll ask Sudhanshu to take a look at where we are on -- from a segment OI perspective and a forward outlook on that. We had a number of conversations in the past, as you'll recall, about the gap between pricing to partners and private label versus the inflation that was -- that we were experiencing that had never been contemplated in the years in which we had the prior years in which we had signed those agreements. And remember, that's very different than pricing that you see at retail, just to be clear because I know when I say pricing, people immediately go to retail pricing. What I'm talking about is the contractual pricing that we have with partners and private label, who then in turn set their own retail pricing as a result of that. And so, we said that there was a lag, but it would flow through. It's flowing through. We have great visibility to it going forward, to answer your question, because it's contractual. And I think the other point to make, and it's an emphasis of the prepared remarks, is that we've now adjusted all of those agreements going forward, and we don't expect a substantial lag to -- between pricing and inflation to occur in the future. So, lessons learned from the past, a bit of pain that we had to incur over the past couple of years, but that's all catching up right now, and you're seeing that flowing through. In addition to that partner and private label pricing flowing through, we're also seeing some moderation in inflation, and we're experiencing an increase in productivity. As we said a couple of times, when we were in a supply chain disruption mode, and we were trying to get every case out the door, productivity takes a backseat. We're in really good shape on our supply chain from a capacity standpoint. And we have the ability now to focus on productivity and dial that up. So, it's a combination of partner private label pricing, productivity, and moderating inflation that is contributing to the margin inflection you're seeing now and also our confidence and visibility into the future. But Sudhanshu, why don't to take up a minute and talk more about that last piece?"

            "name": "Sudhanshu Priyadarshi",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Our consolidated third quarter results were solid. Top-line growth was resilient, and supported future momentum by reinvesting in the business and we delivered modest EPS upside relative to the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Revenue advanced 5.1% to $3.8 billion with healthy constant currency sales growth of 4.1%. Pricing remained the primary growth driver, contributing 5.5 points as expected by the moderation from the second quarter as prior year pricing actions were lapped. Volume mix strengthened sequentially, posting a modest 1.4% decline year-over-year. Gross profit margin inflected positively in the quarter and expanded a strong 100 basis points year-over-year as pricing and efficiency gains begin to offset input cost inflation. Total SG&A deleveraged 130 basis points year-over-year, reflecting our focus to reinvest in our brands and capabilities while combating sustained inflation. SG&A saw another quarter of double-digit increases in marketing spending, while transportation, warehousing and other corporate costs such as labor remains headwinds. Adjusted operating income grew 3.1%, which, combined with below-the-line leverage, resulted in mid-single-digit EPS growth to $0.48, slightly ahead of the guidance we shared last quarter. We achieved this result without the benefit of any nonoperational gains in the quarter as we continue to make progress on reinforcing our earnings base looking out to next year. Moving to the segments. U.S. Refreshment Beverages grew net sales 5.9%, led by 7.1 percentage points of pricing. The price contribution moderated quarter-over-quarter as anticipated as we begin to anniversary some of the last year's pricing activity. Volume mix declined 1.2%, reflecting outperformance versus our categories across the vast majority of our portfolio and the growth contribution from C4 Energy. As Bob said, we expect price to remain a continued driver of the top-line growth algorithm in quarter four and into next year, even as growth rebalances across volume, mix, and pricing contributions. Consumer is resilient, category elasticities are manageable and inflation to moderating remains a headwind. Segment operating income grew 6.1% in the quarter and segment margins were approximately flat year-over-year. This performance reflected the favorable impact of pricing and productivity, net of inflation, offset by increased investment in marketing. In U.S. Coffee, net sales decreased 3.2%, improving versus the second quarter trough as expected. Pricing sequentially strengthened and contributed 3.1 percentage points of growth. Some of this reflected pricing that lagged realized inflation across our partner portfolio and is now flowing through after a delay. In future cycles, we expect the pricing pass-through necessary to offset inflation to be more seamless. Volume mix declined 6.3% year-over-year in quarter three. Brewers grew 8% as we moved past destocking in the first half and shift in for the important holiday period. For the back half, as a whole, we expect brewer shipments to track point-of-sale strength, which remains softer in today's macro environment and are still declining in the mid to high single digits compared to last year. Importantly, Keurig brewers continue to gain share within the coffee maker category and we still expect to finish the year having grown penetration to approximately 40 million households in the Keurig ecosystem as compared to approximately 38 million at the end of 2022. All shipments declined 8%, similar to last quarter. However, by our measure, category consumption volume in single serve were flat year-over-year across all channels, a sequential improvement relative to quarter two. As we previewed would happen last quarter, shipments lagged category consumption in the period due primarily to two factors: First, the competition against a year ago channel inventory build; and second, the volume impact from our decision to exit certain low-margin private label contracts. We anticipate a smaller combined impact from these factors in quarter four and expect all shipments to sequentially strengthen relative to quarter three. Office segment operating income grew 5.7% and operating margins expanded strongly. At near 33%, segment operating margins increased 280 basis points versus the prior year and also compared very favorably relative to 30.4% in the first half. The significant infection was driven by pricing, productivity, and moderating inflation, and we expect it to sustain. As Bob mentioned, the part of the expected revenue recovery is slightly altered relative to our original plan due to some prudent price arrangement in a competitive environment. Nevertheless, margin trends are expected to accelerate further in quarter four. Fundamental progress is expected to drive continued solid operating income growth year-over-year even as we lap a difficult comparison given nonoperational benefits partially contributed to U.S. Coffee operating income last year. International segment sales increased 20.8% in the third quarter against a double-digit growth tempera in the year-ago period. Constant currency sales growth was very strong at 12.9%, with volume mix increasing 9% and pricing up 3.9%. Our top-line momentum are broad-based across Mexico and Canada. Segment operating income grew very strongly at 39.4% on a reported basis and 31.7% in constant currency terms, thanks to operating leverage and efficiency gains netting favorably against inflation. And anticipated, our free cash flow conversion strengthened sequentially in the third quarter to $459 million, reflecting the combination of profit growth and moderating working capital users and consistent with our expectation for free cash flow conversion to strengthen in the second half. Our capital allocation approach remains unchanged. Our priorities include organic and inorganic investments to support our growth, further strengthening our balance sheet, consistent with our long-term net leverage ratio target of 2 times to 2.5 times, and returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and opportunistic share buybacks. We dynamically adjust between these priorities on an ongoing basis. In quarter three, we closed on the highly strategic La Colombe partnerships first introduced in July, which included a $300 million equity investment. Today, we announced another important partnership with Grupo PiSA to sell, distribute and merchandise Electrolit in the U.S. This is a meaningful step forward into sports hydration for KDP and establishes another mix accretive growth platform, even as it comes with minimal capital commitments. As Bob pointed out, with entries into energy, RTD coffee, and sports hydration over the past 12 months, we have penetrated three large and important white spaces for a relatively modest capital outlay of less than $1.3 billion. We also have the ability and desire to continue to return cash to our shareholders. In September, we announced a 7.5% increase, marking our third consecutive year of growing our dividend and representing a cumulative 43% increase over that time. Our CRE purchases will remain opportunistic and we have demonstrated a willingness step in when our share price becomes dislocated from the long-term value we expect to create. The approximately $3.2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization, we will continue to assess the market for such opportunities. Moving now to guidance. We are reaffirming our consolidated outlook for 2023 and continue to target constant currency net sales growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. Our EPS outlook assumes minimal benefits from nonoperational items in 2023, implying double-digit EPS growth on an underlying basis. Our guidance for below-the-line items is consistent with last quarter. For the year, we continue to expect interest expense in a $470 million to $475 million range, effective tax rate of 22% and approximately $1.41 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We expect a strong end to the year in quarter four with similar top-line dynamics in quarter three and even a stronger gross margin expansion. At the same time, we will be lapping approximately $67 million of nonoperational gains in last year's fourth quarter, primarily concentrated in the U.S. Coffee segment, which creates a challenging comparison. Blending these factors together, we expect Q4 adjusted EPS of approximately $0.54 or 8% year-over-year growth. On an underlying basis, this represents strong double-digit EPS growth. With that, I will now turn the call back to Bob for closing comments. Thanks, Bob. Chris, if you think through -- think about Q4 and beyond, in Q4, we are expecting a sequential improvement in pod shipment as category is gradually recovering. We also plan to have margin expansion in quarter four higher than quarter three. We talked about that before. And we will also see a solid operating income growth in quarter four, even stronger underlying. As you all know, we had a lot of nonoperating benefit in coffee. So, you will have a stronger underlying growth because we're planning minimal nonoperating thing. As you think through 2024, our plan is to continue to gradually rebuild margin in the coffee category started with quarter three. You saw we went from 30% roughly in the first half to 33%. Q4 will expand further, and you will see this gradual buildup or rebuild up our margin in 2024."

This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, please go ahead.\nJane Gelfand: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our second quarter results. Consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends. While the exclusion of items affecting comparability and the use of constant currency growth rates are not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation tables included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance. We will also speak about the concept of underlying performance, which removes the impact of non-operational items in the current and prior years. These items include gains on asset sale leaseback transactions, reimbursement of litigation expenses related to the successful resolution of our BODYARMOR lawsuit, a business interruption insurance recovery and a change in accounting policy for stock compensation. Finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. Here with us today to discuss our results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; Chief Financial Officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio.  I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. KDP\u2019s second quarter once again demonstrated our portfolio\u2019s resilience and ability to consistently deliver on our total company commitments. Our solid performance was driven by strength in U.S. refreshment beverages, encouraging developments in U.S. coffee and continued momentum in international.  Consolidated Q2 results were healthy with strong revenue momentum and sequentially accelerating operating income and EPS growth.  Net sales advanced more than 6% supported by net price realization, modest category elasticities and good share performance across much of our portfolio. For the first time since Q3 2021, reported gross margins expanded as an improving balance between pricing, inflation and productivity began to emerge. Gross profit dollar growth funded marketing increases across all segments, and help to offset continued cost pressures in transportation, warehousing, and labor.  As we forecasted, we're in the early stages of a margin recovery that we expect become more visible in the back half.  Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we are raising our 2023 net sales growth outlook to 5% to 6%, while our full year EPS Outlook is optically unchanged, it in fact represents greater than originally anticipated underlying rule with an enhanced composition to our earnings profile. As Sudhanshu will discuss in more detail, we now expect minimal non-operational items in 2023 setting KDP up for strong and sustainable earnings base from which to grow in 2024 and beyond.  U.S. refreshment beverage\u2019s performance in Q2 was outstanding double-digit revenue growth and strong operating margin expansion. Similar to last quarter, category growth and our own momentum remained pricing-le. Limited volume elasticities across the portfolio. Though demand is resilient, we are mindful of the various pressures facing our consumers, and are proactively meeting our needs to product, and package innovation along with strong in-market execution.  These elements come together, we see market share gains. Q2 these were most notable across our CSDs sparkling water, coconut water and juice portfolios. Even as price realization begins to moderate in the back half, we remain confident in our ability to drive attractive organic growth by creating value among three key dimensions.  First, by driving growth in core brands through marketing and brand renovation. Second by filling portfolio white spaces via innovation and external partnerships; and third, by enhancing the effectiveness of our omni-channel selling and distribution system. We delivered on each of these dimensions in Q2.  Focusing first on our core brands. For the second consecutive quarter, Dr. Pepper was the largest share gainer in the CSD category, bolstered by the success of Strawberries & Cream, and the continued strong momentum of Dr. Pepper Zero Sugar, which was once again maybe top two food and beverage product in IRI Circana\u2019s New Product Pacesetter Innovation Ranking.  Keurig also continue to outperform driven by its multicultural appeal and unsweetened sparkling waters, our partnership with Polar have now boosted the brand to the #2 volume share position nationally. We also brought significant excitement or choose categories were mocked in a wine puncher driving innovation and gaining share.  When it comes to the partnerships our C4 distribution transition is proceeding well. 2023 is a year of transition and investment and though it is still early days in our distribution rollout we are driving gains across multiple metrics and remain confident in the growth potential of C4. KDP distributed geographies, total points of distribution increased nearly 60% versus prior year and waited weeks on display across large format food outlets are up nearly 50% relative to the beginning of 2023.  These gains translated into continued velocity and share momentum for C4, and accelerated the brand's already strong revenue growth even further. Clearly, our partnership approach continues to create win-win outcomes, making this model increasingly attractive to other high potential companies including La Colombe, which I'll speak more about shortly.  The effectiveness of our selling and distribution engine underpins our success across all the examples I cited. One would acknowledge the hard work our teams have done to drive improvement across the system where it shows signs of strain during the pandemic. Customer service levels have now significantly improved relative to where we were during the COVID period, and in some cases exceed pre-pandemic comparisons.  But our work here is never complete. These strides are leading to even tighter in-store and on-shelf execution as our market share momentum demonstrates.  Turning now to US Coffee, we're exiting Q2, we saw several encouraging developments that are expected to benefit segment performance over the coming quarters. On our last earnings call I identified three key tenets underpinning our expectations in this segment.  First, an at-home coffee category momentum would begin to recover in the back half, as mobility comparison ease. Second that we would add approximately two million new households to Keurig\u2019s ecosystem in 2023, aided by BrewID & Pod innovation and the addition of new brands.  And third, that segment operating margins would improve meaningfully in the back half supported by a better balance between pricing, inflation and productivity. We had even more visibility to these elements playing out today with Q2 marking an expected trough in both top-line growth and margins.  Let's address each point in turn. First, as anticipated, at home coffee category momentum began to improve toward the end of the second quarter. This continue to do so in July.  Lot of time our consumers are spending at home this year versus last is continuing to normalize. Since we believe time spent at home is the single largest variable driving at home coffee consumption, it follows that volume trends are recovering too. We are observing this across broader at-home coffee within which single-serve continues to gain share.  Category recovery is very clear when looking at publicly syndicated data. In Q1, Keurig compatible Pod volumes good proxy for the total single-serve category declined nearly 4% across measured channels. Q2 these declines moderated to less than 2% with improvement particularly notable towards the end of the quarter.  For the last four weeks, category volumes are flat to up slightly. Notably, category and KDP volume performance has been even stronger in non-track channels such as e-commerce and Unmeasured Club. Category trend is a positive leading indicator for our business and we would expect sequential improvement in net sales growth in the back half.  That said, we are prepared for our volume growth to lag the single-serve category in the shorter term, as we focus on optimizing profitability. Pricing across all sub- segments of our K-Cup K- portfolio Is now more fully flowing through our financials including from our partner breadth consistent with our previous expectation that pricing would catch up to inflation, but a delay We also exited some of our lowest margin private-label contracts.  Both of these elements are now filtering through our results and the syndicated data. Longer-term, our growth in U.S. coffee will remain underpinned by driving incremental household penetration for the Keurig system and increasing revenues from our existing 38 million active households, which brings me to the second tenet of our coffee outlook, driving incremental household penetration.  In Q2, we furthered this growth strategy by elevating our presence in cold coffee, which is an important trend among younger consumers. This spring, we nationally expanded the K-Iced Brewer platform, especially formulated Ice K-Cup pods. Strong marketing and activation activities across all media and digital channels, including a special limited edition Rolling Stone\u2019s K-Iced brewer that sold out in less than 24 hours.  These Innovations are off to a very strong start with the K-Iced Brewer family performing extremely well and our ice pods proving highly incremental to our base business. Just last week, we announced a strategic partnership with La Colombe, super premium and award-winning coffee brand with wide appeal and untapped potential.  Partnership which includes an equity investment, a sales and distribution agreement for RTD Coffee and a K-Cup pod licensing agreement is a compelling example of our ability to add value to a single partner across both hot and cold beverages, which KDP is uniquely positioned to deliver. Our collaboration with La Colombe will encompass several exciting strategic avenues.  We will leverage our sales and distribution capabilities to scale La Colombe across major retail classes of trade. Along with the Pete's brand, we're creating a ready to drink coffee platform, which will enable us to better serve the needs of our consumers and retail customers in this important category. We will also work closely with La Colombe to formulate and introduce the brand into the Keurig ecosystem in a K-Cup format.  Here too, we are building a super premium platform as La Colombe joined several recently added brands like Intelligentsia, BLK & Bold, and Philz. Additionally, La Colombe is a vertically integrated model and specialized manufacturing knowledge are other differentiated elements that could enhance our collaboration over time.  In short, this partnership has strong value creation potential that when unlocked will benefit both KDP and LA Colombe to our joint ownership model.  Now moving to the third element, driving our coffee outlook. We continue to expect segment margins for the U.S. coffee segment to meaningfully improve both sequentially and year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. Multiple factors led the segment margin contraction over the last few years and several elements including sequential favorability in pricing, commodity costs and productivity are now starting to come together to facilitate a margin rebuild.  Pricing to offset cumulative inflation across our K-Cup portfolio including for partner and private-label brands will now more fully flow through starting in Q3. Commodity cost pressures including in green coffee and packaging are also projected to ease. Efficiency benefits should ramp up throughout the year as we have redoubled our productivity efforts following a period focus on mitigating supply chain disruptions. We will work to further enhance these elements going forward with the expected back half margin inflection and important marker for future profit growth.  Our International segment continues to perform well, even as it begins to lapse double-digit growth in the year ago period. In Q2, Canadian volume momentum was fueled by non-alcoholic and low alcohol beverages where we have multiple brands like Atypique and Labatt's is gaining share. This is an exciting set of emerging categories where we plan to leverage our learnings across markets.  Execution also remains strong in our Canadian coffee business where KDP manufactured Pod\u2019s grew consumption dollars in gained market share during the period.  In Mexico, our DSD network continues to strengthen, which is supporting broad based share momentum across our LRB portfolio and the ongoing rollout of our partnership with Red Bull. Across the portfolio, Pen UCL and its aide extensions into flavored sparkling waters, as well as our CSD brands continue to perform very well.  Wrapping up, our consolidated Q2 results are yet another illustration of our modern beverage company working to deliver strong, consistent and predictable company performance. We continue to develop our business for the long term to investments in innovation, partnerships and capabilities, while demonstrating our ability to work through shorter-term normalization in coffee.  We also continue to deploy our cash to create value for shareholders. It\u2019s all this via the equity investment in La Colombe and through the opportunistic repurchase of KDP\u2019s shares, which continued through Q2 as our share price remain dislocated. We are raising our 2023 outlook for constant currency net sales growth, do 5% to 6% and reaffirming our guidance for adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7% with an improving composition of our earnings profile.  We now expect only minimal non-operational benefits within the frameworks of this guidance implying double-digit adjusted EPS growth on an underlying basis. I'll now turn it over to Sudhanshu to discuss Q2 results and our balance of year outlook in greater detail. \nSudhanshu Priyadarshi : Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our concentrated quarter two results which represented another quarter of strong sales growth with reported gross margin expansion both sequentially and year-over-year and significant reinvestment in marketing. Reported sales advanced 6.6%, to $3.8 billion with 6.1% organic growth, reflecting strong pricing and a modest decline in volume mix.  Consolidated top-line momentum, was driven by U.S. refreshment beverages and international segments, partially offset by a trough quarter in U.S. coffee which we anticipated.  Reported gross margin expanded slightly year-over-year to 54.8% as we made progress in offsetting ongoing inflection. This is an important change in trend past in the nearly two years. Even with continued cost pressures across transportation, warehousing and labor, we reinvested significantly in marketing, with increases across each segment.  As a result, total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 40 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating income grew 4.4%, and additional below the line leverage helped drive adjusted EPS of $0.42, 7.7% above prior year.  We continued to deploy our cash in accordance with our evolved capital allocation priorities. Over the past four quarters, we have opportunistically repurchased nearly 22 million KDP shares, including 7 million shares in quarter two in recognition of a significant long-term opportunity in our stock. Combined with our quarterly dividend, we have returned approximately $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders over this timeframe.  In addition, since the merger, we have evolved our ownership structure to that of the modern beverage company we are today, increasing KDP\u2019s public float from 13% in 2018 to 73% today. This includes the exit of Mondel\u0113z which earlier this month completed its final sale of the long-term strategic equity stake it took as part of the KGM Tech private in 2016.  During the quarter, we continued to persistently invest in promising partnership and M&A opportunities, namely the $300 million investment we made in La Colombe announced last week. KDP\u2019s successful track record in the scaling beverage brands and strengthening our leadership positions across our key categories make us a sought-after partner for high potential companies and brand owners.  We remain discerning and disciplined at all such opportunities seeking out only those that has compelling the strategic merit create win-win outcomes for both parties and provide significant value creation potential.  Turning now to segment performance. U.S. refreshment beverages sales grew an impressive 11.8%, led by 12 percentage points from pricing with virtually no volume mix impact. This resilient volume mix performance continue to reflect the strength of our portfolio, ongoing market share gains, manageable. category elasticities in the face of significant pricing and the contribution from C4 energy.  Segment operating income increased 18.1% and segment margins expanded 150 basis points as pricing and productivity benefits more than offset commodity, manufacturing and labor inflation and an increase in marketing investments.  In US coffee, sales declined by 0.7%, with positive pricing more than offset by anticipated volume expression which I will further explain now.  Focusing first on the consumable parts business, as Bob indicated, we are encouraged by the improving consumption volume trends in the single subcategory exiting the first half. We see this category trend as the leading indicator for the direction of our business.  Further, in quarter two, our reported Pod shipment declines had yet to reflect any improvement due to three primary factors. First, a category volume recovery began later in the period and therefore had a limited impact on quarterly results.  Second , we lapped a period last year when we were replenishing retailer and partner inventories after supplying to disruptions creating a difficult shipment compression; and third, our conjunction and shipment volume were impacted by our decision to exit some low value private-label contracts. We expect some lingering impact to our shipment volume from factors two entry as we move into quarter three. Even so revenue trends are projected to sequentially strengthen driven by positive pricing and moderating volume declines.  On a trailing 12 month basis, brewer shipments declined 11% year-over-year. For perspective, our brewer volume is still 18% higher than the comparable 12-month period ending quarter two 2019, which represents a clean pre-pandemic compression. The point here is that, despite all the volatility of the last several years, the surging demand during the height of COVID and the later stages of normalization we are working through, demand for Keurig ecosystem is greater today than it was four years ago among both consumers and retail partners.  Our Q2 brewer shipment declined 10.9%, a sequential improvement relative to quarter one and were impacted by the same factors we discussed last quarter. With improved softer discretionary demand for smaller appliances, including brewers which saw mid-single-digit consumption declines and additional, albeit moderating pressures from trade inventory rebalancing.  After two quarters of inventory adjustments, we believe these are that largely behind us looking out to the back half. Importantly, Keurig branded brewers gained share of all of coffee makers sold in quarter two, which recently launched KI brewers seen good traction in the market. We will further support these new brewers and highly incremental ice bars in the back half as we continue to expand our cold coffee platform and offerings.  US coffee operating income contracted 14.6% at 30.1% segment margins were similar to quarter one level, but 310 basis points lower year-over-year. Versus the prior year, this performance reflected a continued unfavorable relationship between pricing and inflation, as well a significant investment in higher marketing in part to support our ice innovation launches.  Looking to the back half of the year in U.S. coffee, we forecast a gradual recovery in revenue growth, coupled with significantly improved margins. This combination underpins our outlook or a strong rebound in segment, operating income with positive growth in quarter three to be followed by very attractive gains in quarter four.  Our international segment performance in quarter two remains strong even as we lapped tougher years ago completions. Net sales increased 10.9% on a reported basis with constant currency growth up 7%. Net price realization contributed 6.1% and volume mix was up 0.9% year-over-year. Segment operating income grew 11.5% on a reported basis and 7.7% in constant currency, reflecting the benefit of the growth in net sales and increase productivity, partially offset by inflationary pressures and a significant increase in marketing investment.  Turning briefly to cash flow. Free cash flow totaled almost $300 million in the second quarter. As we enter the seasonally more cash generative back half, we would expect our absolute levels of free cash flow as well as free cash conversion to meaningfully improve from here. This brings me to our consolidated outlook for 2023, which we updated in our press release this morning.  Our outlook for constant currency net sales growth is now higher at 5% to 6% and we continue to expect adjusted EPS to grow 6% to 7%. While our EPS outlook is unchanged on the surface, expected profile of our earnings is now further improved relative to our guidance earlier this year.  Specifically, you\u2019ll recall that 2022 benefited from several non-operational items and at the start of this year we expected to reduce the use of these items by approximately 50% in 2023. I am pleased to share that our EPS forecast now includes only minimal such benefits. As a result, on an underlying basis, I our EPS growth is now projected to be in the double-digits versus our prior expectations for a high-single-digit gain.  This very strong underlying performance demonstrates the earnings power inherent in KDP\u2019s model. It is also effectively and increase to our 2023 growth outlook and will preclude any further upside to EPS expectations for this year while setting us up for a strong and sustainable base from which KDP can grow earnings in 2024.  Our full year guidance includes the following expectations for below the line items. Interest expense in a $470 million to $475 million range; equity method earnings from Nutrabolt of approximately $40 million to $45 million; an effective tax rate of 22% for the year and approximately $1.4 1 billion diluted, which is average shares outstanding.  We have covered a lot of ground today. So I would just finish by remarking on the projected cadence of earnings for the balance of the year. Given the evolution of pricing, inflation and productivity, along with the timing of planned reinvestments over the back half, we expect only modest EPS growth in quarter three, followed by very strong results in quarter four.  With the good first half in the books and the enhanced visibility to the balance of the year, we are confident in our robust finish to 2023.  With that, I will now turn the call back to Bob for closing comments.  Robert Gamgort  Thanks, Sudhanshu. If you haven't done so already, I encourage all of you to read our 2020 corporate responsibility report, which was published last month. Highlighted within its pages is the significant work KDP is doing to further our sustainability agenda. We're very proud of our progress across multiple focus areas including in renewable energy, water stewardship, and diversity and inclusion.  To close, Q2 was a very good quarter for KDP across multiple dimensions. Performance in U.S. refreshment beverages was once again exceptional and international posted another great quarter.  US coffee is approaching an important inflection with improved visibility to a significant margin recovery, which we expect to lead to strong operating income growth as we close out this transitional year for the segment.  On a consolidated basis our efforts to offset inflation are increasingly evident in gross margin stability, and marketing reinvestment across all segments. And as we discussed today, full year guidance implies double-digit underlying EPS growth with an even stronger top-line outlook. These are all key elements to set us up for ongoing momentum in the back half and ultimately into next year.  I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  Our first question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. You may now go ahead. \nChris Carey: Hi, good morning, everyone. \nRobert Gamgort: Hi, Chris. \nChris Carey : So, clearly, tall results on a total company level, but at the same time so much of the day to be has been around coffee. And I think there's been a bit of a misunderstanding that the underlying assumption of the category has actually been improving through the year. And I think, what I hear today is that that improvement has continued to accelerate through the quarter and into the quarter-to-date.  And so, I just have a couple specific questions around that. So first, you why do you think that underlying improvement has been occurring? And really I'm trying to get to the context of sustainability. It is as simple as the away-from-home channel was recovering in the front half of the year, that's normalized. Now, the at home channel has normalized, as well.  And secondly, it sounds like you expect to remain below consumption in coffee into the second half of the year. Is that a Pod and Brewer comment? And just given the tough comps and you're making some changes to the portfolio, would you expect that dynamic to carry into 2024? Or this predominantly in Q3, is this Q4 and then you've normalized from there?  So, thanks for any perspective on just underlying durability of this improvement. We've seen in the at-home coffee channel and also this dynamic of shifting to consumption and when you think you can start to close that gap over the next two to four quarters? Thanks so much. \nRobert Gamgort : Okay, Chris. Let me start it at a very high level with the total category, because I think that is most important. We've clearly weathered a storm over the past year or so that's impacted our category and our profitability within the negative impacts were on at home coffee.  We saw this category decline in all forms globally. And to answer your question, we have seen that as primarily driven by mobility changes. This is the post-COVID recovery mobility impact. That's largely played out. I think, by the end of the third quarter for sure that will be played out. We also had some issues in terms of supply chain recovery coming out of COVID where it was a service at all cost mindset and we were also not focused on productivity and of course inflation.  And that was combined with the lag in our pricing realization. And that's when you add that all up, that's quite a list of challenges in our coffee business over the past year.  If you look at what the setup is right now, it\u2019s much more constructive. We're seeing a rebound in category and that's largely driven by normalized mobility. To your specific question about away-from-home versus at home, wait from that hasn\u2019t change that much, right.  If you look at office occupancy, it's pretty stable. It's improving very, very gradually. Over time, if that improves, then we'll get the benefit of from that on our way from home coffee business. But that's not something that we're banking on. It's really been an at-home coffee consumption story driven by changes in mobility.  So we're seeing is rebound in category. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we're seeing that pricing that we talked about that was lagged now flowing through the P&L and of course we're seeing a moderation in inflation and the combination of that is very constructive going forward. And one thing I would point out is that single-serve coffee has had and continues to gain share of all forms of coffee over this time period  In terms of our shipments below consumption, the best way to look at us over the long term, I am not going to talk about 2024 specifically, but our shipments share approximate category consumption over time. Our focus is on category growth. We have about an 80% share of all Pods that go through the system. Mix can change over time, but again we're focused on category.  And I think you ought to just think about category rebound as being consistent with how we think about our long-term shift and trends. But in the short term, we're looking at against a period a year ago, we were still rebuilding shipments from supply chain disruptions, so that's part of it. We've also talked about exiting some of the lowest margin private-label contracts and then we\u2019ve taken some additional pricing on our owned and licensed.  We think these are really the right decisions to prioritize margin recovery in a recovering category, and that's what causes a little bit of a separation between consumption and shipments in the short-term. But there's no reason to think that's the case over the long term and really I would point you to category consumption as the long-term indicator. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may now go ahead. \nBryan Spillane : Thank you. Thanks operator. Good morning, everyone one. So, just two quick ones for me. Sudhanshu, just the flip of non-operational gains now not contributing as much, that's obviously good news. Is that a change in just the way you're going to treat them, one, backing them out versus including have things changed. So, some of these financial moves like, sale-leaseback just not as attractive anymore?  And then the second one for you Bob is, just 2 million household penetration or new households - is 2 million new households in coffee brewers still a possibility this year? Or might that be little bit below that just given the current environment? \nSudhanshu Priyadarshi : So, Bob, let me take the first one. So Brian, no, as we have said beginning of the year, KDP is focused on delivering best-in -class CPG activity performance. This also includes our enhancing of composition of our earning profile. Last year we had a lot of non-operating item when we started the year with targeted 50% reduction, but as you can see from our first half performance, our underlying business performance is great. We are also seeing the margin recovery in coffee in second half.  So we have enhanced visibility. So we believe that now we will have a minimal non-operating and we will deliver a better underlying operating performance this year. This will also help us in 2024 because we will not have this roughly 50% of headwind from last year. It was roughly, I think it's more than $150 million, $160 million dollar.  We had a half of that was this year. We don't expect that to do that and that will help us in 2024 and beyond. So there is no change. It's just our strong operating performance that we planned all along. \nRobert Gamgort : Brian, on the two million households yes, still our target for 2023 as we talked about a number of times, brewer sales are really a great predictor of household penetration. So, the two million is still where we're trending. The one thing I would point out is, as you know, we are heavily fourth quarter loaded. Holiday season, gifting we've done well in difficult environments that \u2013 in a difficult economic environments around that gifting because people go for more functional gifts during that time period.  Our innovation pipeline, the promotions, the retailer support that we're getting for the fourth quarter, all was terrific, but got a lot of game left to be played in the fourth quarter. But as we sit here today, we are targeting two million. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning. \nRobert Gamgort : Hey, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So, on the coffee side, you were very clear and comprehensive in your remarks on the second half improvement and what drives the improvement versus the first half. But in theory, it's a pretty big dichotomy. So, I guess it just be helpful to hear how much visibility you think you have at this point in coffee, particularly relative to some of the first half disappointment, maybe rank order some of the factors you mentioned in terms of driving that sequential improvement?  But also just longer-term, broader context for the volatility we're seeing this year and what you think it sort of means for future growth prospects, as we look out longer term? And then be, I'm sure coffee will get a lot of the air time as usual. But we probably be remised if we didn't touch on the US refreshment and international strength in the first half of the year.  How sustainable do you think are the factors there that have driven the strength as you think about go forward trends from here? Thanks. \nRobert Gamgort : Okay. I'll take both of these. I think it's always helpful and I feel like I'd remind everybody that's on many of our calls, but I do think it's helpful step back and look at the coffee category over the longer term that gives you the best context. It is always short term volatility, particularly in the COVID and post-COVID world. But if you go back and it's in our press release if you go back and you take a look at pre-COVID, 2019 to our latest period, the CAGR on Pods is mid-single-digits, CAGR on brewers, about mid-single-digits.  And so there is a lot of bumpiness and it's been tough for all of you to navigate through the pluses and minuses over the past couple years. But that context is always helpful and it always serves us really well to look at the longer term trends, which is this is a growing category driven by zoomers converting from brewing by the Pot to brewing by the cup. We are the drivers of that.  Our partners benefit from that. Our retailers benefit from that, so does Keurig, because we participate in 80% of those transactions. So, that's the most important thing for everyone to always takeaway when you look at any quarterly results on the business.  In terms of the back half of the year and visibility, it\u2019s a really good question. The area that's been most challenging for us over the past couple years is predicting consumer mobility. And it's not a concept we even thought about prior to COVID. So be able to match up consumer mobility against in-home coffee consumption we had to learn a lot there.  And then also being able to predict it is really a difficult thing to do given the economists are having a tough time doing that. But I think that noise is largely behind us, which is the most important takeaway from this conversation and we should see a normalization in category growth, as behavior from consumer perspective also normalizes.  The one area where we have had and still have the most visibility to is our margin. And I know that's been another area where there was pressure on the business that we explained as we look forward and we understand coffee pricing in advance, we understand our pricing. And we also knew that the agreements that we had with our partners and our private-label partners, as well is that we have the ability to recover inflation, but it had a lag effect to it.  And there's only so much that you can talk about before you want to see the proof. And you're seeing the proof of that now flow through and we have great visibility to that in the back half of the year. So, put it on the table, our assumptions for the back half of the years continued slow and gradual recovery of the category in total.  We have and continue to gain share of total at home coffee and single-serve. And then an improving margin and that's driven by pricing flowing through the P&L, moderation, and inflation and our ability to focus on productivity now, that our supply chain is in really good shape across the board. Our customer service on coffee has been fantastic.  So, let me talk a little bit about refreshment beverages and it's a, it is a fantastic story that I'm glad you raised, because we certainly don't take it for granted nor should anyone else. What's been working for us is three factors. We've been gaining share in a growing category and I don't mean to make light of it because it's really each one of these is an important double-click, but it's driven by marketing, innovation, and really importantly outstanding retail execution.  So, gaining share in growing category is always a positive thing. Our pricing and productivity have been catching up to inflation. There was \u2013 we were chasing inflation for a long period of time. We were able to narrow that Gap. And I think importantly, consumer resilience has allowed the category to withstand all the pricing that was required to offset that inflation.  Now, last point is an area that we continue to watch very carefully. And we're seeing a general elasticity hold up nicely. But we're seeing some greater elasticities in some of the segments within LRB that we will watch and adjust to. But, if I were to summarize the cold beverage business, growing margin, and share, and growing category, certainly a formula for success. We plan to continue to do everything I just said, plus add new partnerships as we've done with C4 most recently and then more recently La Colombe. \nOperator: Our next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. You may now go ahead. \nAndrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. I have a couple of questions to the Sudhanshu\u2019s point on site EPS and then a question to Bob on the Pod. First on the EPS growth outlook for Q3, what would be the underlying growth ex non-operational items for the quarter because we understand there were no operational items in Q3 last year?  And the question for Bob on the Pods would be the shipment inflection. Should we expect shipments to converge to consumption in Q4? Or kind of like the embedding what the outlook that you gave for the fourth quarter? Or could you bridge the impact for the private-label exits, which is one of the factors that was a headwind in the quarter and also in the second half?  And sorry for the two-parted question. But on this on - the on the price and improved mix as you exit this, this third-party manufacturing, should we not \u2013 so with the private-label should we expect pricing to lap in Q3? Or use - expect to still have some benefit on pricing for pods into the second half of the year? Thank you. \nSudhanshu Priyadarshi : So, let me take the first one. First, I would urge you to think about back half in total with the cadence between Q3 and Q4 EPS, just the matter of phasing. Our second half growth is expected to be largely Q4 loaded reflecting the expected flow of investment spend and the cadence of pricing and productivity relative to inflation.  In forecasting quarter three EPS, last year, we have no non-operating items in Q3. We had in Q4, which we expect that to be minimal. But the reason we is modestly higher year-over-year. There are three key components. One is U.S. refreshment beverages. We are lapping the year ago pricing and we are forecasting heavier investments.  U.S. coffee positive OI growth as margin begin to inflect in quarter three and then more to come in quarter four. So those are the two main reasons mostly driven by our decision to invest more importantly. But I said, let's look at the second half and you will see that we have a strong EPS growth. \nRobert Gamgort : Yes, let me reiterate what I said before, which is over the long-term consumption to people shipments. There's no reasonably will be different. As is often the case you see some separation between the two on a quarter-to-quarter basis, clearly, there is factor we had supply chain issues in which we were under shipping and we were overshipping to catch up on that.  What's happening right now in the back half of the year is exactly we said is we're seeing our consumption base is, slow and gradual recovery in the in the total at-home coffee category. Single-serve continues to gain share of at-home coffee occasions which is important. And then there's two things that are - couple things I should say that are unique to us as that is causing our shipments to be slightly in high consumption.  One is how we're lapping some of the year ago timing of shipments due to recovery. We talked about all the license pricing and we also talked about some private-label contracts that we exited all in the direction of making sure that we're rebuilding margin. And that'll play out. So, we had talked previously, about for the year coffee being about up 1% in revenue, and 3% or 4% in OI.  And if I look at the way things were playing out and it's hard to forecast it differently, we've got great visibility to margins. So we expect that to strongly inflect in the second half. And that's going to lead to accelerated OI growth. I'll talk about that in a moment. I think the revenue number may come in somewhat below that on a reported basis.  I don't think it's that big of a deal. But the other thing to think about though on the OI growth projection and even if that comes in slightly below that on a reported basis for Sudhanshu\u2019s comments the without any non-operational impacts, the adjusted segment on an underlying basis is even stronger than we talked about before.  So, you add it all up and you say the back half of the year there may be some puts and takes here, but the underlying strength of the business is really, really improving. And anything that's off any of these projections is really driven by some intentional strategies we put in place. And then the last thing I would talk about our coffee margin is, there are four drivers of that margin which is pricing, inflation, and productivity and mix.  And clearly, we're seeing the pricing flow through. You ask about the second half versus first half. We had virtually no pricing coming through from partners and private-label in the first half. That's just starting to flow through in the back half of the year and that will ramp up. And yeah, there's some trade-offs in mix and some of the other parts on here, but we have good visibility to improving margin going forward. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. You may now go ahead. \nLauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping we could maybe take a step back and do something a bit educational on coffee. So, you in the Nielsen data, I know you guys are more into toward IRI, but in the Nielsen data you can see that owned and licensed brands within pods has been losing share and I think that's garnered quite a bit of attention from the investment community.  So, I was hoping you could talk about, I know that you\u2019ve said historically you manage the margin profile of owned and licensed to be comparable to that of partner. But I was curious if you could talk about why we should or shouldn't worry about that from a dollar profit contribution over time and how you manage sort of the - let's call it, the potential conflict of interest with partners versus what's owned in terms. market share and so on and you know, how you manage that relationship?  Also, just Bob, you'd mentioned pricing on owned and licensed and I just wanted to be clear if that was new pricing that's recently gone in the market or if that's still to come? And then finally, I know that inventory destocking for Pods at retail had been a potential watch point that hasn't come up. So I'm assuming it's a non-issue, but I just wanted to check in on that front, as well. Thanks. \nRobert Gamgort : Sure. Yes. Thanks for the opportunity for me to talk about the way - the way the system works. So, again, I go back to the very beginning and say that what we manage as an ecosystem that involves our brands, our partner brands and private-label brands, our retailer brands. And it's really important that retailers are considered to be a partner in this whole ecosystem, as well because, conversion of brewing by the cup are popped by the cup benefits all of the interested stakeholders in this.  Our objective is really focused and hasn\u2019t changed, which is we want to have a growing system. We want to category to continue to expand. We want the dynamics of that category to be constructive for everybody. Part of that is managing our own brands which we manage very separately from our partners. So there is no conflict of ventures.  We manage those as a separate group within our organization that has no visibility into what our partners or private-label are doing and it allows us just to maintain focus on the category. For us, we see the opportunity for more pricing within our brands, within the category. If you take a look at our price gaps versus other forms of coffee, even though there's been pricing in the single-serve segment, the price gaps versus all forms of at-home coffee right now are the narrowest they have ever been.  And in fact, we do believe they are at a point where it's actually not doing anything to drive category growth. Partners and that includes some of our retail partners and their private-label brands. Look, sometimes they have short-term objectives that are more share-driven. So, we see some of that promotional competition and that shift share between one brand to another, but it really does nothing for the category which is our focus.  And so that's why when I take a look at our pricing, it comes back from being more restrained in the promotional environment, which allows us to protect margin. And again, if you go back to the highest level, the rational decision for us to make is to improve our margins in a growing category.  And then, you did point out something about if owned in license brands are losing some share it might have some negative in mix impact. Fair enough that mix is as great as some people think it is as we said before. But I would then also point out that we're looking at pricing inflation and productivity. And the reason that people should believe that we're not concerned about that that difference of share is the visibility that we're giving you two improve in margin going forward.  If it were a heavy negative impact on our business, we wouldn't be able to do that. So we understand all these weavers of pricing inflation part to be mix. And sometimes you have to trade out one for the other. We can do that for the long-term health of the system and the growth of the category, which is what we are focused on.  And then your last point is about destocking of pods. It\u2019s not something that we've seen at retail and nor do we expect to see anything of that nature. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. You may now go ahead. \nSteve Powers: Yes. Hey, good morning. Thank you. \nRobert Gamgort : Hey Steve. \nSteve Powers: I wanted to ask on the free cash flow conversion. Sudhanshu, you talked about the improvements to come which is great. I guess there a way to frame where you think you'll land on convergence for the year? And as we think ahead, is there any reason that a return to 100% free cash flow conversion or thereabouts is too ambitious for \u201824 and beyond?  And I guess, within that, if there's any \u2013 is there any changes that you're thinking about or that you\u2019ve implemented more structurally with regards to supply chain financing that\u2019d be useful to know. Thank you. \nSudhanshu Priyadarshi : So, it's a great question. As you know KDP had been a highly cash-generative since merger and we expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow going forward. In our first half, our cash flow generation was lower primarily due to two factors versus last year. One was the lapping on some discrete items and also our proactive choice to selectively reduce a portion of our supplier financing program in a less attractive rate environment.  The free cash flow conversion will be significantly higher in the second half versus second quarter and also first half, though it\u2019s for the year, it will improve somewhat below 100% for the full year, but as you know, we look beyond 2023, we continue to target industry-leading levels of free cash flow conversion. So there's not too many changes. We are still generating a lot of cash. It\u2019s a second half business. You will see it. But we are making some proactive choices with supply chain financing. That was very attractive in low-rate environment, but now it's not that attractive. \nSteve Powers: And last point, are you through those changes? Or do you anticipate there may be still changes to come given where rates are and where they may go? \nSudhanshu Priyadarshi : No, so, we look at more of a \u2013 as the overall capital allocation policy as we came in, in the summer and we have our growth is. Our goal is to - low leverage, but we generate a lot of cash. So be make those decisions case-by-case. So I wouldn't say that supply chain financing will - the number will become zero, but yes, we're looking at case-by-case it\u2019s a gradual and we are looking at the benefit of - its also has a benefit on operating income.  So it's \u2013 first, in the in the beginning, you feel the most pain is the working capital has a short-term pain, but in the long run, it\u2019s beneficial and we make the right economic decision. So it's case-by-case supply chain financing is proactive choice. We are making the decision based on where we see is better economic benefit.  But it's a gradual and it will not happen everything this year, like we will not reduce everything to this year. It will continue for next couple of years. It will be a gradual reduction. \nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jane Gelfand for closing remarks. \nJane Gelfand: Thanks, Anthony, and thank you, everyone. We appreciate your time and attention on what we know is a busy morning. And the investor relations team is available should you have any follow-up questions Have a great day. \nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. KDP's second quarter once again demonstrated our portfolio's resilience and ability to consistently deliver on our total company commitments. Our solid performance was driven by strength in U.S. refreshment beverages, encouraging developments in U.S. coffee and continued momentum in international.  Consolidated Q2 results were healthy with strong revenue momentum and sequentially accelerating operating income and EPS growth.  Net sales advanced more than 6% supported by net price realization, modest category elasticities and good share performance across much of our portfolio. For the first time since Q3 2021, reported gross margins expanded as an improving balance between pricing, inflation and productivity began to emerge. Gross profit dollar growth funded marketing increases across all segments, and help to offset continued cost pressures in transportation, warehousing, and labor.  As we forecasted, we're in the early stages of a margin recovery that we expect become more visible in the back half.  Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we are raising our 2023 net sales growth outlook to 5% to 6%, while our full year EPS Outlook is optically unchanged, it in fact represents greater than originally anticipated underlying rule with an enhanced composition to our earnings profile. As Sudhanshu will discuss in more detail, we now expect minimal non-operational items in 2023 setting KDP up for strong and sustainable earnings base from which to grow in 2024 and beyond.  U.S. refreshment beverage's performance in Q2 was outstanding double-digit revenue growth and strong operating margin expansion. Similar to last quarter, category growth and our own momentum remained pricing-le. Limited volume elasticities across the portfolio. Though demand is resilient, we are mindful of the various pressures facing our consumers, and are proactively meeting our needs to product, and package innovation along with strong in-market execution.  These elements come together, we see market share gains. Q2 these were most notable across our CSDs sparkling water, coconut water and juice portfolios. Even as price realization begins to moderate in the back half, we remain confident in our ability to drive attractive organic growth by creating value among three key dimensions.  First, by driving growth in core brands through marketing and brand renovation. Second by filling portfolio white spaces via innovation and external partnerships; and third, by enhancing the effectiveness of our omni-channel selling and distribution system. We delivered on each of these dimensions in Q2.  Focusing first on our core brands. For the second consecutive quarter, Dr. Pepper was the largest share gainer in the CSD category, bolstered by the success of Strawberries & Cream, and the continued strong momentum of Dr. Pepper Zero Sugar, which was once again maybe top two food and beverage product in IRI Circana's New Product Pacesetter Innovation Ranking.  Keurig also continue to outperform driven by its multicultural appeal and unsweetened sparkling waters, our partnership with Polar have now boosted the brand to the #2 volume share position nationally. We also brought significant excitement or choose categories were mocked in a wine puncher driving innovation and gaining share.  When it comes to the partnerships our C4 distribution transition is proceeding well. 2023 is a year of transition and investment and though it is still early days in our distribution rollout we are driving gains across multiple metrics and remain confident in the growth potential of C4. KDP distributed geographies, total points of distribution increased nearly 60% versus prior year and waited weeks on display across large format food outlets are up nearly 50% relative to the beginning of 2023.  These gains translated into continued velocity and share momentum for C4, and accelerated the brand's already strong revenue growth even further. Clearly, our partnership approach continues to create win-win outcomes, making this model increasingly attractive to other high potential companies including La Colombe, which I'll speak more about shortly.  The effectiveness of our selling and distribution engine underpins our success across all the examples I cited. One would acknowledge the hard work our teams have done to drive improvement across the system where it shows signs of strain during the pandemic. Customer service levels have now significantly improved relative to where we were during the COVID period, and in some cases exceed pre-pandemic comparisons.  But our work here is never complete. These strides are leading to even tighter in-store and on-shelf execution as our market share momentum demonstrates.  Turning now to US Coffee, we're exiting Q2, we saw several encouraging developments that are expected to benefit segment performance over the coming quarters. On our last earnings call I identified three key tenets underpinning our expectations in this segment.  First, an at-home coffee category momentum would begin to recover in the back half, as mobility comparison ease. Second that we would add approximately two million new households to Keurig's ecosystem in 2023, aided by BrewID & Pod innovation and the addition of new brands.  And third, that segment operating margins would improve meaningfully in the back half supported by a better balance between pricing, inflation and productivity. We had even more visibility to these elements playing out today with Q2 marking an expected trough in both top-line growth and margins.  Let's address each point in turn. First, as anticipated, at home coffee category momentum began to improve toward the end of the second quarter. This continue to do so in July.  Lot of time our consumers are spending at home this year versus last is continuing to normalize. Since we believe time spent at home is the single largest variable driving at home coffee consumption, it follows that volume trends are recovering too. We are observing this across broader at-home coffee within which single-serve continues to gain share.  Category recovery is very clear when looking at publicly syndicated data. In Q1, Keurig compatible Pod volumes good proxy for the total single-serve category declined nearly 4% across measured channels. Q2 these declines moderated to less than 2% with improvement particularly notable towards the end of the quarter.  For the last four weeks, category volumes are flat to up slightly. Notably, category and KDP volume performance has been even stronger in non-track channels such as e-commerce and Unmeasured Club. Category trend is a positive leading indicator for our business and we would expect sequential improvement in net sales growth in the back half.  That said, we are prepared for our volume growth to lag the single-serve category in the shorter term, as we focus on optimizing profitability. Pricing across all sub- segments of our K-Cup K- portfolio Is now more fully flowing through our financials including from our partner breadth consistent with our previous expectation that pricing would catch up to inflation, but a delay We also exited some of our lowest margin private-label contracts.  Both of these elements are now filtering through our results and the syndicated data. Longer-term, our growth in U.S. coffee will remain underpinned by driving incremental household penetration for the Keurig system and increasing revenues from our existing 38 million active households, which brings me to the second tenet of our coffee outlook, driving incremental household penetration.  In Q2, we furthered this growth strategy by elevating our presence in cold coffee, which is an important trend among younger consumers. This spring, we nationally expanded the K-Iced Brewer platform, especially formulated Ice K-Cup pods. Strong marketing and activation activities across all media and digital channels, including a special limited edition Rolling Stone's K-Iced brewer that sold out in less than 24 hours.  These Innovations are off to a very strong start with the K-Iced Brewer family performing extremely well and our ice pods proving highly incremental to our base business. Just last week, we announced a strategic partnership with La Colombe, super premium and award-winning coffee brand with wide appeal and untapped potential.  Partnership which includes an equity investment, a sales and distribution agreement for RTD Coffee and a K-Cup pod licensing agreement is a compelling example of our ability to add value to a single partner across both hot and cold beverages, which KDP is uniquely positioned to deliver. Our collaboration with La Colombe will encompass several exciting strategic avenues.  We will leverage our sales and distribution capabilities to scale La Colombe across major retail classes of trade. Along with the Pete's brand, we're creating a ready to drink coffee platform, which will enable us to better serve the needs of our consumers and retail customers in this important category. We will also work closely with La Colombe to formulate and introduce the brand into the Keurig ecosystem in a K-Cup format.  Here too, we are building a super premium platform as La Colombe joined several recently added brands like Intelligentsia, BLK & Bold, and Philz. Additionally, La Colombe is a vertically integrated model and specialized manufacturing knowledge are other differentiated elements that could enhance our collaboration over time.  In short, this partnership has strong value creation potential that when unlocked will benefit both KDP and LA Colombe to our joint ownership model.  Now moving to the third element, driving our coffee outlook. We continue to expect segment margins for the U.S. coffee segment to meaningfully improve both sequentially and year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. Multiple factors led the segment margin contraction over the last few years and several elements including sequential favorability in pricing, commodity costs and productivity are now starting to come together to facilitate a margin rebuild.  Pricing to offset cumulative inflation across our K-Cup portfolio including for partner and private-label brands will now more fully flow through starting in Q3. Commodity cost pressures including in green coffee and packaging are also projected to ease. Efficiency benefits should ramp up throughout the year as we have redoubled our productivity efforts following a period focus on mitigating supply chain disruptions. We will work to further enhance these elements going forward with the expected back half margin inflection and important marker for future profit growth.  Our International segment continues to perform well, even as it begins to lapse double-digit growth in the year ago period. In Q2, Canadian volume momentum was fueled by non-alcoholic and low alcohol beverages where we have multiple brands like Atypique and Labatt's is gaining share. This is an exciting set of emerging categories where we plan to leverage our learnings across markets.  Execution also remains strong in our Canadian coffee business where KDP manufactured Pod's grew consumption dollars in gained market share during the period.  In Mexico, our DSD network continues to strengthen, which is supporting broad based share momentum across our LRB portfolio and the ongoing rollout of our partnership with Red Bull. Across the portfolio, Pen UCL and its aide extensions into flavored sparkling waters, as well as our CSD brands continue to perform very well.  Wrapping up, our consolidated Q2 results are yet another illustration of our modern beverage company working to deliver strong, consistent and predictable company performance. We continue to develop our business for the long term to investments in innovation, partnerships and capabilities, while demonstrating our ability to work through shorter-term normalization in coffee.  We also continue to deploy our cash to create value for shareholders. It's all this via the equity investment in La Colombe and through the opportunistic repurchase of KDP's shares, which continued through Q2 as our share price remain dislocated. We are raising our 2023 outlook for constant currency net sales growth, do 5% to 6% and reaffirming our guidance for adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7% with an improving composition of our earnings profile.  We now expect only minimal non-operational benefits within the frameworks of this guidance implying double-digit adjusted EPS growth on an underlying basis. I'll now turn it over to Sudhanshu to discuss Q2 results and our balance of year outlook in greater detail. Hi, Chris. Okay, Chris. Let me start it at a very high level with the total category, because I think that is most important. We've clearly weathered a storm over the past year or so that's impacted our category and our profitability within the negative impacts were on at home coffee.  We saw this category decline in all forms globally. And to answer your question, we have seen that as primarily driven by mobility changes. This is the post-COVID recovery mobility impact. That's largely played out. I think, by the end of the third quarter for sure that will be played out. We also had some issues in terms of supply chain recovery coming out of COVID where it was a service at all cost mindset and we were also not focused on productivity and of course inflation.  And that was combined with the lag in our pricing realization. And that's when you add that all up, that's quite a list of challenges in our coffee business over the past year.  If you look at what the setup is right now, it's much more constructive. We're seeing a rebound in category and that's largely driven by normalized mobility. To your specific question about away-from-home versus at home, wait from that hasn't change that much, right.  If you look at office occupancy, it's pretty stable. It's improving very, very gradually. Over time, if that improves, then we'll get the benefit of from that on our way from home coffee business. But that's not something that we're banking on. It's really been an at-home coffee consumption story driven by changes in mobility.  So we're seeing is rebound in category. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we're seeing that pricing that we talked about that was lagged now flowing through the P&L and of course we're seeing a moderation in inflation and the combination of that is very constructive going forward. And one thing I would point out is that single-serve coffee has had and continues to gain share of all forms of coffee over this time period  In terms of our shipments below consumption, the best way to look at us over the long term, I am not going to talk about 2024 specifically, but our shipments share approximate category consumption over time. Our focus is on category growth. We have about an 80% share of all Pods that go through the system. Mix can change over time, but again we're focused on category.  And I think you ought to just think about category rebound as being consistent with how we think about our long-term shift and trends. But in the short term, we're looking at against a period a year ago, we were still rebuilding shipments from supply chain disruptions, so that's part of it. We've also talked about exiting some of the lowest margin private-label contracts and then we've taken some additional pricing on our owned and licensed.  We think these are really the right decisions to prioritize margin recovery in a recovering category, and that's what causes a little bit of a separation between consumption and shipments in the short-term. But there's no reason to think that's the case over the long term and really I would point you to category consumption as the long-term indicator. Brian, on the two million households yes, still our target for 2023 as we talked about a number of times, brewer sales are really a great predictor of household penetration. So, the two million is still where we're trending. The one thing I would point out is, as you know, we are heavily fourth quarter loaded. Holiday season, gifting we've done well in difficult environments that \u2013 in a difficult economic environments around that gifting because people go for more functional gifts during that time period.  Our innovation pipeline, the promotions, the retailer support that we're getting for the fourth quarter, all was terrific, but got a lot of game left to be played in the fourth quarter. But as we sit here today, we are targeting two million. Hey, Dara. Okay. I'll take both of these. I think it's always helpful and I feel like I'd remind everybody that's on many of our calls, but I do think it's helpful step back and look at the coffee category over the longer term that gives you the best context. It is always short term volatility, particularly in the COVID and post-COVID world. But if you go back and it's in our press release if you go back and you take a look at pre-COVID, 2019 to our latest period, the CAGR on Pods is mid-single-digits, CAGR on brewers, about mid-single-digits.  And so there is a lot of bumpiness and it's been tough for all of you to navigate through the pluses and minuses over the past couple years. But that context is always helpful and it always serves us really well to look at the longer term trends, which is this is a growing category driven by zoomers converting from brewing by the Pot to brewing by the cup. We are the drivers of that.  Our partners benefit from that. Our retailers benefit from that, so does Keurig, because we participate in 80% of those transactions. So, that's the most important thing for everyone to always takeaway when you look at any quarterly results on the business.  In terms of the back half of the year and visibility, it's a really good question. The area that's been most challenging for us over the past couple years is predicting consumer mobility. And it's not a concept we even thought about prior to COVID. So be able to match up consumer mobility against in-home coffee consumption we had to learn a lot there.  And then also being able to predict it is really a difficult thing to do given the economists are having a tough time doing that. But I think that noise is largely behind us, which is the most important takeaway from this conversation and we should see a normalization in category growth, as behavior from consumer perspective also normalizes.  The one area where we have had and still have the most visibility to is our margin. And I know that's been another area where there was pressure on the business that we explained as we look forward and we understand coffee pricing in advance, we understand our pricing. And we also knew that the agreements that we had with our partners and our private-label partners, as well is that we have the ability to recover inflation, but it had a lag effect to it.  And there's only so much that you can talk about before you want to see the proof. And you're seeing the proof of that now flow through and we have great visibility to that in the back half of the year. So, put it on the table, our assumptions for the back half of the years continued slow and gradual recovery of the category in total.  We have and continue to gain share of total at home coffee and single-serve. And then an improving margin and that's driven by pricing flowing through the P&L, moderation, and inflation and our ability to focus on productivity now, that our supply chain is in really good shape across the board. Our customer service on coffee has been fantastic.  So, let me talk a little bit about refreshment beverages and it's a, it is a fantastic story that I'm glad you raised, because we certainly don't take it for granted nor should anyone else. What's been working for us is three factors. We've been gaining share in a growing category and I don't mean to make light of it because it's really each one of these is an important double-click, but it's driven by marketing, innovation, and really importantly outstanding retail execution.  So, gaining share in growing category is always a positive thing. Our pricing and productivity have been catching up to inflation. There was \u2013 we were chasing inflation for a long period of time. We were able to narrow that Gap. And I think importantly, consumer resilience has allowed the category to withstand all the pricing that was required to offset that inflation.  Now, last point is an area that we continue to watch very carefully. And we're seeing a general elasticity hold up nicely. But we're seeing some greater elasticities in some of the segments within LRB that we will watch and adjust to. But, if I were to summarize the cold beverage business, growing margin, and share, and growing category, certainly a formula for success. We plan to continue to do everything I just said, plus add new partnerships as we've done with C4 most recently and then more recently La Colombe. Yes, let me reiterate what I said before, which is over the long-term consumption to people shipments. There's no reasonably will be different. As is often the case you see some separation between the two on a quarter-to-quarter basis, clearly, there is factor we had supply chain issues in which we were under shipping and we were overshipping to catch up on that.  What's happening right now in the back half of the year is exactly we said is we're seeing our consumption base is, slow and gradual recovery in the in the total at-home coffee category. Single-serve continues to gain share of at-home coffee occasions which is important. And then there's two things that are - couple things I should say that are unique to us as that is causing our shipments to be slightly in high consumption.  One is how we're lapping some of the year ago timing of shipments due to recovery. We talked about all the license pricing and we also talked about some private-label contracts that we exited all in the direction of making sure that we're rebuilding margin. And that'll play out. So, we had talked previously, about for the year coffee being about up 1% in revenue, and 3% or 4% in OI.  And if I look at the way things were playing out and it's hard to forecast it differently, we've got great visibility to margins. So we expect that to strongly inflect in the second half. And that's going to lead to accelerated OI growth. I'll talk about that in a moment. I think the revenue number may come in somewhat below that on a reported basis.  I don't think it's that big of a deal. But the other thing to think about though on the OI growth projection and even if that comes in slightly below that on a reported basis for Sudhanshu's comments the without any non-operational impacts, the adjusted segment on an underlying basis is even stronger than we talked about before.  So, you add it all up and you say the back half of the year there may be some puts and takes here, but the underlying strength of the business is really, really improving. And anything that's off any of these projections is really driven by some intentional strategies we put in place. And then the last thing I would talk about our coffee margin is, there are four drivers of that margin which is pricing, inflation, and productivity and mix.  And clearly, we're seeing the pricing flow through. You ask about the second half versus first half. We had virtually no pricing coming through from partners and private-label in the first half. That's just starting to flow through in the back half of the year and that will ramp up. And yeah, there's some trade-offs in mix and some of the other parts on here, but we have good visibility to improving margin going forward. Sure. Yes. Thanks for the opportunity for me to talk about the way - the way the system works. So, again, I go back to the very beginning and say that what we manage as an ecosystem that involves our brands, our partner brands and private-label brands, our retailer brands. And it's really important that retailers are considered to be a partner in this whole ecosystem, as well because, conversion of brewing by the cup are popped by the cup benefits all of the interested stakeholders in this.  Our objective is really focused and hasn't changed, which is we want to have a growing system. We want to category to continue to expand. We want the dynamics of that category to be constructive for everybody. Part of that is managing our own brands which we manage very separately from our partners. So there is no conflict of ventures.  We manage those as a separate group within our organization that has no visibility into what our partners or private-label are doing and it allows us just to maintain focus on the category. For us, we see the opportunity for more pricing within our brands, within the category. If you take a look at our price gaps versus other forms of coffee, even though there's been pricing in the single-serve segment, the price gaps versus all forms of at-home coffee right now are the narrowest they have ever been.  And in fact, we do believe they are at a point where it's actually not doing anything to drive category growth. Partners and that includes some of our retail partners and their private-label brands. Look, sometimes they have short-term objectives that are more share-driven. So, we see some of that promotional competition and that shift share between one brand to another, but it really does nothing for the category which is our focus.  And so that's why when I take a look at our pricing, it comes back from being more restrained in the promotional environment, which allows us to protect margin. And again, if you go back to the highest level, the rational decision for us to make is to improve our margins in a growing category.  And then, you did point out something about if owned in license brands are losing some share it might have some negative in mix impact. Fair enough that mix is as great as some people think it is as we said before. But I would then also point out that we're looking at pricing inflation and productivity. And the reason that people should believe that we're not concerned about that that difference of share is the visibility that we're giving you two improve in margin going forward.  If it were a heavy negative impact on our business, we wouldn't be able to do that. So we understand all these weavers of pricing inflation part to be mix. And sometimes you have to trade out one for the other. We can do that for the long-term health of the system and the growth of the category, which is what we are focused on.  And then your last point is about destocking of pods. It's not something that we've seen at retail and nor do we expect to see anything of that nature. Hey Steve."

            "name": "Sudhanshu Priyadarshi",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our concentrated quarter two results which represented another quarter of strong sales growth with reported gross margin expansion both sequentially and year-over-year and significant reinvestment in marketing. Reported sales advanced 6.6%, to $3.8 billion with 6.1% organic growth, reflecting strong pricing and a modest decline in volume mix.  Consolidated top-line momentum, was driven by U.S. refreshment beverages and international segments, partially offset by a trough quarter in U.S. coffee which we anticipated.  Reported gross margin expanded slightly year-over-year to 54.8% as we made progress in offsetting ongoing inflection. This is an important change in trend past in the nearly two years. Even with continued cost pressures across transportation, warehousing and labor, we reinvested significantly in marketing, with increases across each segment.  As a result, total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 40 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating income grew 4.4%, and additional below the line leverage helped drive adjusted EPS of $0.42, 7.7% above prior year.  We continued to deploy our cash in accordance with our evolved capital allocation priorities. Over the past four quarters, we have opportunistically repurchased nearly 22 million KDP shares, including 7 million shares in quarter two in recognition of a significant long-term opportunity in our stock. Combined with our quarterly dividend, we have returned approximately $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders over this timeframe.  In addition, since the merger, we have evolved our ownership structure to that of the modern beverage company we are today, increasing KDP's public float from 13% in 2018 to 73% today. This includes the exit of Mondele\u0304z which earlier this month completed its final sale of the long-term strategic equity stake it took as part of the KGM Tech private in 2016.  During the quarter, we continued to persistently invest in promising partnership and M&A opportunities, namely the $300 million investment we made in La Colombe announced last week. KDP's successful track record in the scaling beverage brands and strengthening our leadership positions across our key categories make us a sought-after partner for high potential companies and brand owners.  We remain discerning and disciplined at all such opportunities seeking out only those that has compelling the strategic merit create win-win outcomes for both parties and provide significant value creation potential.  Turning now to segment performance. U.S. refreshment beverages sales grew an impressive 11.8%, led by 12 percentage points from pricing with virtually no volume mix impact. This resilient volume mix performance continue to reflect the strength of our portfolio, ongoing market share gains, manageable. category elasticities in the face of significant pricing and the contribution from C4 energy.  Segment operating income increased 18.1% and segment margins expanded 150 basis points as pricing and productivity benefits more than offset commodity, manufacturing and labor inflation and an increase in marketing investments.  In US coffee, sales declined by 0.7%, with positive pricing more than offset by anticipated volume expression which I will further explain now.  Focusing first on the consumable parts business, as Bob indicated, we are encouraged by the improving consumption volume trends in the single subcategory exiting the first half. We see this category trend as the leading indicator for the direction of our business.  Further, in quarter two, our reported Pod shipment declines had yet to reflect any improvement due to three primary factors. First, a category volume recovery began later in the period and therefore had a limited impact on quarterly results.  Second , we lapped a period last year when we were replenishing retailer and partner inventories after supplying to disruptions creating a difficult shipment compression; and third, our conjunction and shipment volume were impacted by our decision to exit some low value private-label contracts. We expect some lingering impact to our shipment volume from factors two entry as we move into quarter three. Even so revenue trends are projected to sequentially strengthen driven by positive pricing and moderating volume declines.  On a trailing 12 month basis, brewer shipments declined 11% year-over-year. For perspective, our brewer volume is still 18% higher than the comparable 12-month period ending quarter two 2019, which represents a clean pre-pandemic compression. The point here is that, despite all the volatility of the last several years, the surging demand during the height of COVID and the later stages of normalization we are working through, demand for Keurig ecosystem is greater today than it was four years ago among both consumers and retail partners.  Our Q2 brewer shipment declined 10.9%, a sequential improvement relative to quarter one and were impacted by the same factors we discussed last quarter. With improved softer discretionary demand for smaller appliances, including brewers which saw mid-single-digit consumption declines and additional, albeit moderating pressures from trade inventory rebalancing.  After two quarters of inventory adjustments, we believe these are that largely behind us looking out to the back half. Importantly, Keurig branded brewers gained share of all of coffee makers sold in quarter two, which recently launched KI brewers seen good traction in the market. We will further support these new brewers and highly incremental ice bars in the back half as we continue to expand our cold coffee platform and offerings.  US coffee operating income contracted 14.6% at 30.1% segment margins were similar to quarter one level, but 310 basis points lower year-over-year. Versus the prior year, this performance reflected a continued unfavorable relationship between pricing and inflation, as well a significant investment in higher marketing in part to support our ice innovation launches.  Looking to the back half of the year in U.S. coffee, we forecast a gradual recovery in revenue growth, coupled with significantly improved margins. This combination underpins our outlook or a strong rebound in segment, operating income with positive growth in quarter three to be followed by very attractive gains in quarter four.  Our international segment performance in quarter two remains strong even as we lapped tougher years ago completions. Net sales increased 10.9% on a reported basis with constant currency growth up 7%. Net price realization contributed 6.1% and volume mix was up 0.9% year-over-year. Segment operating income grew 11.5% on a reported basis and 7.7% in constant currency, reflecting the benefit of the growth in net sales and increase productivity, partially offset by inflationary pressures and a significant increase in marketing investment.  Turning briefly to cash flow. Free cash flow totaled almost $300 million in the second quarter. As we enter the seasonally more cash generative back half, we would expect our absolute levels of free cash flow as well as free cash conversion to meaningfully improve from here. This brings me to our consolidated outlook for 2023, which we updated in our press release this morning.  Our outlook for constant currency net sales growth is now higher at 5% to 6% and we continue to expect adjusted EPS to grow 6% to 7%. While our EPS outlook is unchanged on the surface, expected profile of our earnings is now further improved relative to our guidance earlier this year.  Specifically, you'll recall that 2022 benefited from several non-operational items and at the start of this year we expected to reduce the use of these items by approximately 50% in 2023. I am pleased to share that our EPS forecast now includes only minimal such benefits. As a result, on an underlying basis, I our EPS growth is now projected to be in the double-digits versus our prior expectations for a high-single-digit gain.  This very strong underlying performance demonstrates the earnings power inherent in KDP's model. It is also effectively and increase to our 2023 growth outlook and will preclude any further upside to EPS expectations for this year while setting us up for a strong and sustainable base from which KDP can grow earnings in 2024.  Our full year guidance includes the following expectations for below the line items. Interest expense in a $470 million to $475 million range; equity method earnings from Nutrabolt of approximately $40 million to $45 million; an effective tax rate of 22% for the year and approximately $1.4 1 billion diluted, which is average shares outstanding.  We have covered a lot of ground today. So I would just finish by remarking on the projected cadence of earnings for the balance of the year. Given the evolution of pricing, inflation and productivity, along with the timing of planned reinvestments over the back half, we expect only modest EPS growth in quarter three, followed by very strong results in quarter four.  With the good first half in the books and the enhanced visibility to the balance of the year, we are confident in our robust finish to 2023.  With that, I will now turn the call back to Bob for closing comments.  Robert Gamgort  Thanks, Sudhanshu. If you haven't done so already, I encourage all of you to read our 2020 corporate responsibility report, which was published last month. Highlighted within its pages is the significant work KDP is doing to further our sustainability agenda. We're very proud of our progress across multiple focus areas including in renewable energy, water stewardship, and diversity and inclusion.  To close, Q2 was a very good quarter for KDP across multiple dimensions. Performance in U.S. refreshment beverages was once again exceptional and international posted another great quarter.  US coffee is approaching an important inflection with improved visibility to a significant margin recovery, which we expect to lead to strong operating income growth as we close out this transitional year for the segment.  On a consolidated basis our efforts to offset inflation are increasingly evident in gross margin stability, and marketing reinvestment across all segments. And as we discussed today, full year guidance implies double-digit underlying EPS growth with an even stronger top-line outlook. These are all key elements to set us up for ongoing momentum in the back half and ultimately into next year.  I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. So, Bob, let me take the first one. So Brian, no, as we have said beginning of the year, KDP is focused on delivering best-in -class CPG activity performance. This also includes our enhancing of composition of our earning profile. Last year we had a lot of non-operating item when we started the year with targeted 50% reduction, but as you can see from our first half performance, our underlying business performance is great. We are also seeing the margin recovery in coffee in second half.  So we have enhanced visibility. So we believe that now we will have a minimal non-operating and we will deliver a better underlying operating performance this year. This will also help us in 2024 because we will not have this roughly 50% of headwind from last year. It was roughly, I think it's more than $150 million, $160 million dollar.  We had a half of that was this year. We don't expect that to do that and that will help us in 2024 and beyond. So there is no change. It's just our strong operating performance that we planned all along. So, let me take the first one. First, I would urge you to think about back half in total with the cadence between Q3 and Q4 EPS, just the matter of phasing. Our second half growth is expected to be largely Q4 loaded reflecting the expected flow of investment spend and the cadence of pricing and productivity relative to inflation.  In forecasting quarter three EPS, last year, we have no non-operating items in Q3. We had in Q4, which we expect that to be minimal. But the reason we is modestly higher year-over-year. There are three key components. One is U.S. refreshment beverages. We are lapping the year ago pricing and we are forecasting heavier investments.  U.S. coffee positive OI growth as margin begin to inflect in quarter three and then more to come in quarter four. So those are the two main reasons mostly driven by our decision to invest more importantly. But I said, let's look at the second half and you will see that we have a strong EPS growth. So, it's a great question. As you know KDP had been a highly cash-generative since merger and we expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow going forward. In our first half, our cash flow generation was lower primarily due to two factors versus last year. One was the lapping on some discrete items and also our proactive choice to selectively reduce a portion of our supplier financing program in a less attractive rate environment.  The free cash flow conversion will be significantly higher in the second half versus second quarter and also first half, though it's for the year, it will improve somewhat below 100% for the full year, but as you know, we look beyond 2023, we continue to target industry-leading levels of free cash flow conversion. So there's not too many changes. We are still generating a lot of cash. It's a second half business. You will see it. But we are making some proactive choices with supply chain financing. That was very attractive in low-rate environment, but now it's not that attractive. No, so, we look at more of a \u2013 as the overall capital allocation policy as we came in, in the summer and we have our growth is. Our goal is to - low leverage, but we generate a lot of cash. So be make those decisions case-by-case. So I wouldn't say that supply chain financing will - the number will become zero, but yes, we're looking at case-by-case it's a gradual and we are looking at the benefit of - its also has a benefit on operating income.  So it's \u2013 first, in the in the beginning, you feel the most pain is the working capital has a short-term pain, but in the long run, it's beneficial and we make the right economic decision. So it's case-by-case supply chain financing is proactive choice. We are making the decision based on where we see is better economic benefit.  But it's a gradual and it will not happen everything this year, like we will not reduce everything to this year. It will continue for next couple of years. It will be a gradual reduction."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper's Earnings Call for the First Quarter of 2023. This conference call is being recorded, and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce the company's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, please go ahead.\nJane Gelfand: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our first quarter results. Consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our performance on an adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. The company believes that the adjusted basis provides investors with additional insight into our business and operating performance trends.  While the exclusion of items affecting comparability and the use of constant currency growth rates are not in accordance with GAAP, we believe that the adjusted basis provides meaningful comparisons and an appropriate basis for discussion of our performance. Details of the excluded items are provided in the reconciliation table included in our press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of certain impacts outside of the company's control, we do not reconcile our guidance.  Beginning this quarter, we will discuss our performance in accordance with our recently redefined business segments, which were described in the 8-K filed last Thursday, April 20. This new segment structure is more consistent with how we evaluate the business internally and provides more visibility to our segment performance in the U.S., which is our largest market.  We will also speak about the concept of underlying performance, which removes the impact of nonoperational items in the current and prior years. These items include gains on asset sale leaseback transactions, reimbursement of litigation expenses related to the successful resolution of our BODYARMOR lawsuit, a business interruption insurance recovery and a change in accounting policy for stock compensation.  And finally, our discussion this morning may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based upon subsequent events. A detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC.  Here with us today to discuss our results are KDP Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; our Chief Financial Officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi; and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Maria Sceppaguercio. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We started 2023 with good momentum. Our overall Q1 performance came in largely as expected and demonstrated the resilience of the modern beverage company we have built. We continue to manage well against a dynamic macro environment with the diversification benefits of KDP's model evident in our results.  This morning, we reaffirmed our 2023 outlook, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our commitments as a company. For the quarter, consolidated net sales advanced a strong 9% versus the prior year, and adjusted EPS grew 3%. Consumer demand remained healthy driven by successful renovation and innovation, increased investment in marketing and modest elasticities across much of our portfolio.  A narrowing gap between inflation and pricing coupled with increased productivity and favorable mix contributed to good flow-through to gross profit, though we continue to work through significant ongoing inflation in transportation, warehousing and labor costs. We expect the balance between these operating income drivers to turn more favorable in the back half of the year.  In U.S. refreshment beverages, which represents nearly 60% of KDP consolidated revenue, our strong performance in Q1 demonstrated the depth of our capabilities across multiple dimensions including brand renovation, marketing, distribution and in-market execution as well as our partnership philosophy and successful track record.  As discussed previously, we create value in U.S. refreshment beverages in 3 ways: by driving growth in core brands through marketing and brand renovation, by filling portfolio white spaces via innovation and external partnerships and by enhancing the effectiveness of our omnichannel selling and distribution system, including our company-owned direct store delivery system. The multiplier effect of all 3 of these elements working in unison was evident in Q1.  We gained share in categories representing almost 90% of retail sales. With strong momentum in core brands, particularly Dr. Pepper, Crush and Mott's. On the back of the very successful launch of Dr Pepper Strawberries & Cream, brand Dr Pepper recorded the largest market share gain in the CSD category this quarter. In fact, the brand has become the #1 flavored CSD in syndicated data over the past 13 weeks.  For perspective, Strawberries & Cream reached 70% ACV distribution within 5 weeks of launch, quickly gained a full share point in the CSD category and continues to experience strong momentum. Driving the early success of Strawberries & Cream is KDP's direct store delivery engine and robust consumer insights and marketing support.  In Q1, we also began to activate our strategic partnership with Nutrabolt, transitioning C4 energy distribution to our network. Our execution thus far has been smooth and is progressing in line with our plans. As we begin to invest behind the brand, we are securing incremental distribution points and display as well as upgrading placements. Though it is still very early days, our partnership with Nutrabolt is strong and collaborative.  We are excited by its potential and look forward to unlocking more value for both KDP and Nutrabolt in the quarters and years ahead. In-market execution underpins the gains we are making across our U.S. refreshment beverages portfolio. The results speak for themselves, but they are even more notable given we and the industry at large, continue to work through significant inflation.  We have supplemented 2022 carryover pricing with some additional pricing actions to start the year, as we protect our profitability and our ability to reinvest for the long term. The limited elasticities this business has experienced so far are a telling reminder of the resilience of the category in general and the KDP portfolio in particular.  Our brands remain important and affordable components of our consumers' everyday lives. Still, as recessionary risks persist, we continue to closely monitor consumer health and sentiment.  Turning now to U.S. Coffee, which represents roughly 30% of our consolidated revenue. This segment experienced a slower start to the year. The performance in pods.which as you know, is our primary focus and profit driver was as expected, with brewers softer than expected.  Pod segment's performance in the first half of the year will be difficult to analyze for longer-term trends. Let me take a step back and explain what we are seeing in the category and in our own business. Growth rates in the at-home coffee category, including the single-serve segment are being temporarily impacted by changes in mobility relative to the prior year.  In Q1, the category lapped the surge of the Omicron variant and lingering pandemic precautions in the year ago period are expected to continue to affect comparisons through the first half. At the same time, the category is digesting significant cumulative pricing to offset inflation. Importantly, single-serve continues to gain volume share in the at-home coffee category in the U.S. underpinning the strength and resilience of the segment and our long-term growth strategy.  We also see the environment for small appliances being impacted by the combination of lower consumer discretionary spending and a challenged specialty retailer environment. Sudhanshu will cover the detailed quarterly performance drivers, but let me say upfront, we expect the second half to reveal a more normalized picture of the health of the single-serve category and our ongoing momentum.  We are still planning to add approximately 2 million new households to the Keurig ecosystem in 2023, and we also continue to expect the back half to show strong improvement in segment operating margins.  Short-term noise aside, the category -- the coffee category is vast and growing in the U.S. and globally. Moving out the volatility of the pandemic period, we are projecting double-digit volume growth for our at-home pods in the U.S. from 2019 to 2023, which translates to mid-single-digit compound annual growth rate. This is consistent with our previous discussions that eliminating the significant noise over the past 3 years revealed consistent and healthy long-term trends for at-home single-serve coffee.  As the leader in U.S. single serve, our overarching growth strategy is to continue converting consumers from brewing coffee by the pot to brewing it by the pod, which we pursue through 2 primary means. First, by driving household penetration for the Keurig system. U.S. single-serve adoption remains significantly below that in more developed single-serve markets in Western Europe and even Canada. And we expect household growth to continue for many years to come as we target adding approximately 2 million new households annually.  Second, by increasing revenue and profit growth from our existing 38 million U.S. Keurig households. Ongoing brewer innovation to address new and changing consumer needs, and a focus on expanding brand and variety of offerings within the Keurig ecosystem underpin our coffee growth strategy. We have news on both fronts in 2023. When it comes to meeting consumer needs, after an initial successful launch with a single customer last year, in 2023, we are expanding our K-Iced brewer platform as well as dedicated iced pods specifically designed for cold beverages.  Both coffee beverages are growing quickly at coffee shops and over-indexed to younger consumers. Given our ability to deliver a high-quality cold coffee experience at home for a fraction of the price, we see ice coffee as a growth opportunity for the Keurig ecosystem in 2023 and beyond.  We also continue to add new and exciting brands to the Keurig ecosystem. Today, we are pleased to announce that Philz Coffee, a super premium brand based in San Francisco, will be available on K-Cup pods beginning this fall. Through the new partnership with Philz as well as the additions of Intelligentsia and BLK & Bold announced last year, we are building a new super premium segment for K-Cup pods.  Our International segment which represents just above 10% of our consolidated revenue, encompasses both our Canadian coffee and beverages business as well as our LRB businesses in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Our growth strategy for international, leverages enterprise-wide insights and capabilities to grow household penetration in coffee and to drive share gains in LRBs through brand innovation and renovation, white space expansion and strengthening our routes to market. We tailor our approach to local taste and market structures while exporting best practices and ideas across the whole of North America.  In Q1, we were pleased to see broad-based momentum across our brands and categories, including in mineral waters, CSDs and single-serve coffee. Our partnership with Red Bull in Mexico continues to build. And we also remained focused on expanding within the low or no alcohol category, including through our acquisition of Atypique in Canada. Both opportunities leverage our existing portfolio and distribution assets, including our DSD system in Mexico and our alcohol portfolio and expertise in Canada.  Wrapping up, we expect the operating environment to remain fluid, and we see KDP as well positioned to continue to deliver strong consolidated performance in 2023. We are reaffirming our 2023 outlook for constant currency net sales growth of 5% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. On an underlying basis, this implies adjusted EPS growth that is closer to 9% at the top end of our long-term algorithm.  In addition, KDP has a track record of strong free cash flow generation, and we expect to continue to unlock the potential for incremental shareholder returns through strategic capital allocation. We have evolved our capital allocation approach to better fit our development stage as a company and to respond to a higher interest rate environment.  We are prioritizing internal investments, partnerships and M&A, balanced against returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, which we undertook this quarter and last quarter. A recent upgrade by Moody's to a stronger investment-grade credit rating recognizes that the inherent portfolio balance of our modern beverage company, along with our capital allocation philosophy and free cash flow profile, all aspects that Sudhanshu will talk more about next.\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. In kicking off 2023, we made the decision to realign our segment reporting to more closely reflect how we plan, run and evaluate these businesses internally. The new U.S. coffee segment will also enhance comparability relative to how we speak about our long-term goals, including our 2 million annual U.S. household penetration target. There is also the added benefit of giving you a more refined picture of our operations in the United States, which is by far our largest market.  We believe the size, scale and margin profile of each U.S. segment becomes more visible externally, making it easier for you to track and analyze. U.S. refreshment beverages is an $8 billion-plus revenue business with a 28% adjusted operating margin. The U.S. coffee business is $4.3 billion in revenue, also very large with an adjusted operating margin above 32%.  Obviously, both are high-quality CPG businesses with tremendous scale in the U.S. market. At the same time, our fast-growing international segment at approximately $1.7 billion of revenue and a 24% adjusted operating margin is already meaningful and quite profitable.  We are pleased that KDP's portfolio delivered over all Q1 results, which were consistent with our going-in expectations even as performance among the segments was varied. Q1 sales advanced 9% driven by a strong in-market execution, particularly in U.S. refreshment beverages. Gross profit dollars grew at a similar rate, and we increased marketing investments versus prior year. At $0.34, our adjusted diluted EPS grew 3% versus Q1 last year. Without a $0.05 headwind from the significant reduction in nonoperational items year-over-year, underlying EPS growth in the quarter was in the high-teens.  As discussed on our last earnings call, we are committed to a step function decrease in the use of nonoperational items this year. And as this occurs, the earning powers of the business will become even more visible. Our actions also continued to reflect our revised capital allocation priorities.  In Q1, we saw and took advantage of a value opportunity in KDP shares and bought back 6.6 million shares during the quarter. Combined with the share repurchases we undertook in late 2022, we have now returned more than $500 million to shareholders via opportunistic buybacks over the past 2 quarters.  Our high-quality portfolio, consistent results, well-capitalized balance sheet and flexible capital allocation approach are being increasingly recognized. As Bob mentioned, Moody's upgraded our credit rating earlier this month, which is especially notable in a weaker macro environment. We believe our strong balance sheet and North American focus represents a safe haven in the current tumultuous financial market.  Let's now take a closer look at consolidated Q1 results. Consistent with the last couple of quarters, our top line growth was driven by pricing taken to offset inflation and a modest volume/mix decline. Net sales grew 8.9% to $3.4 billion with pricing up approximately 10%.  Gross margins were stable at 52.7% and primarily reflected the combined benefits of pricing, productivity gains and positive mix balanced against considerable input cost inflation. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by about 100 bps versus prior year, reflecting continued elevated transportation, warehousing and labor costs.  Despite these cost headwinds, we increased marketing investment to support our brand momentum. We also lapped an SG&A benefit of $28 million from a stock comp accounting chain in the prior year period. Q1 adjusted operating income was $699 million, about 4.5% below a year ago, but representing almost 9% growth on an underlying basis.  Adjusted net income grew about 1%, aided by flat interest expense, equity method earnings and a lower tax rate versus the prior year. Lower diluted shares outstanding helped drive additional leverage in the EPS growth rate.  Turning now to segment performance. U.S. refreshment beverages sales grew 12.7%, led by 12.5 percentage points from favorable net price realization. The benefit of pricing was sequentially lower relative to Q4 as we begin to anniversary price increases we took in early 2022 and have not yet captured the full benefit of pricing actions announced earlier this year.  Volume mix was slightly positive in the quarter reflecting very limited elasticity impact as well as the contribution from C4 Energy. This volume mix result speaks to resilient consumer demand, modest elasticities in our categories and a successful slate of renovations and innovations.  Segment operating income increased 11.6% as we effectively translated top line momentum to bottom line results despite inflation in packaging, manufacturing and labor costs. Our U.S. coffee segment represents a single-serve ecosystem in which our brewers create a platform for high-quality coffee experiences through our high-margin consumable K-Cup pods. Simply put, we are in the business of selling pods, not brewers.  That said, we recognize that the quarter volatility in brewers can sometimes distort the picture. To help you further contextualize brewer trends, we are introducing 2 additional disclosures, trailing 12 months brewers sold and associated growth rates.  You saw both of these in our press release this morning. Going forward, while we will continue to disclose quarterly brewer sales and shipments in our 10-Q, we will focus our remarks in this forum as well as in the press release on trailing 12 months strength, which we believe to smooth the inherent quarterly volatility of appliances relative to consumables.  Let's now get into the results. In U.S. Coffee, Q1 revenue declined 1.3%, with pricing up 5.3%, but volume mix down 6.6%. The involvement for small appliances was more dynamic than we expected, reflecting the combination of softer discretionary spending and a challenged specialty retailer landscape. These factors primarily impacted brewer shipments, which declined 29% in the quarter. For perspective, Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter of the year, accounting for less than 20% of brewer shipments.  On a trailing 12-month basis, brewer shipments totaled $10.2 million, reflecting a 9.8% decline year-over-year, but a strong growth of 25.6% relative to the pre-pandemic period ending Q1 2019. Our goal of adding an incremental 2 million households in the U.S. in 2023 remains intact.  U.S. pod revenues grew 2.9% and pod volumes declined modestly, down 1.9% in quarter 1. This was influenced by consumer mobility that was meaningfully different versus the same time last year when the Omicron surge led to more time spent at home. There are other factors at play in the category such as some elasticity in response to pricing and mix shifts to a more normalized level of premium versus private label exposure.  However, we continue to believe that mobility is the largest driver of at-home coffee category softness over the past few quarters. It follows that pod trends should improve in H2 as mobility differences relative to last year begin to dissipate.  We continue to expect U.S. coffee volumes in quarter 2 to remain under pressure against the year ago period when we successfully executed our coffee recovery program and rebuilt partner and retail inventories after supply disruptions.  Inflation remains a headwind in U.S. Coffee, where segment operating margin contracted 130 basis points in the quarter and segment operating income declined 5.3%. We expect an improvement in the relationship between inflation, pricing and productivity in the back half which provides good visibility to a strong margin recovery in the segment, leading to a year-over-year improvement in gross margin in 2023.  In particular, we are refocusing on productivity in 2023 after much of 2022 was focused on prioritizing customer service. I want to revert for a minute to Q1 performance as it would have been reported for the former Coffee Systems segment.  Constant currency revenue for Coffee Systems grew 1% in quarter 1 with faster growth in Canada relative to the U.S. Following the segment realignment and reflecting softer-than-expected brewer volume, we now expect U.S. Coffee revenue to grow approximately 1% in 2023 with segment operating income growth of 3% to 4%.  This incorporates plans for ongoing marketing reinvestment and the expected back half margin expansion. Our consolidated outlook for KDP in 2023, which I will address in more detail shortly, remains unchanged.  Our International segment performance in Q1 was strong and well balanced. Net sales increased 16.7% with net price realization contributing 9 points of growth and volume mix up 7.7% year-over-year. Growth was broad-based and led by LRBs and single sub-pods.  The combination of net price realization and productivity gains helped to offset inflationary headwinds and together led to a strong segment operating income growth of 18%.  Turning briefly to cash flow. Free cash flow in Q1 was $16 million. This declined relative to last year, reflecting the lapping of certain discrete benefits in Q1 2022, such as the BODYARMOR litigation settlement gain as well as a use of net working capital this quarter.  For the full year, we expect the rate of free cash flow conversion to approach our long-term target. This brings us to our consolidated outlook. With Q1 results largely as expected, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to increase 5% in 2023 and adjusted EPS to grow 6% to 7%.  We continue to project currency translation to be a 50 basis point headwind to both top and bottom lines. As Bob said, underlying EPS growth is expected to be closer to 9% at the top end of our high single-digit long-term algorithm. This basis removes the noise from year-over-year differences in nonoperational items, which we still expect to roughly half relative to 2022 levels.  Despite the recent news headlines about CPI and PPI easing, we continue to see significant cost inflation. Headwinds across realized raw material costs transportation and labor are sticky and persistent, and we still expect mid-single-digit inflation in 2023. We are highly focused on offsetting these pressures through a combination of pricing, revenue growth management and productivity initiatives, and we expect the gap versus inflation to reverse as the year progresses.  Our full year guidance for below-the-line items remains unchanged. We expect interest expense in a $465 million to $470 million range, which still includes $45 million related to the Nutrabolt investment. Equity method earnings from Nutrabolt of approximately $40 million to $45 million, an effective tax rate of 22% for the year and approximately 1.42 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding.  As it relates to quarter 2, EPS is expected to grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range. We still expect to have a gap between inflation and pricing and productivity in the quarter with a more beneficial relationship expected to materialize in the back half.  Marketing is also expected to increase in quarter 2, reflecting incremental investments across both LRBs and coffee particularly behind the Iced platform in U.S. Coffee that Bob highlighted earlier.  To wrap up, our overall Q1 performance tracked largely in line with our expectations, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate the balance of 2023, which promises to remain dynamic. Our recast segments better eliminate the scale of our businesses with distinct and clearly defined growth pillars in place for each segment.  Our brand portfolio, renovation and innovation activity and in-market execution remains very strong. We are working diligently to offset inflation and to drive margin improvement later in the year while reinvesting in our brands.  And finally, our capital allocation priorities are clear as we look to deploy our strong cash flow against the highest ROI opportunities.  I will now turn the call back to Bob for closing comments.\nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Sudhanshu. Before moving to Q&A, I want to take a moment to thank Maria who is retiring in July after a distinguished 40-plus-year career. She will remain with KDP as an adviser through year-end. I know that most of you hold Maria in the highest regard, just as we do at KDP where she has been a valued member of the executive leadership team for the last 5 years.  Maria and I have worked together for over a decade, spanning 2 companies and countless deals, including an IPO. She has built a very strong corporate affairs team for KDP, and we are pleased that she will stay on as an adviser to support the transition to her successor upon hire.  We will all miss working with Maria, and wish her the very best in this next and well-earned chapter. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: So I wanted to go back. Bob, you spoke about like the brewer shipments. And then I understand the volatility that allowed you to change the reporting ways and merging the 2. I was just wondering, embedded in your commentary as well, you spoke about second quarter still being challenging and all the mobility aspects of the category. So if you can talk about a little bit of what are you seeing as we exit the quarter and as you lap the Omicron or [indiscernible] pandemic benefits for the in-house or at-home consumption?  And then at the same time, I understand you don't disclose what is out-of-home, but there is some out-of-home component of the pod, so how should we be thinking about that as well as pantry destocking or retail destocking?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. Okay, Andrea. Thanks for your questions. It's really 3 components, particularly on brewers now I'll talk about mobility-related pods and then I'll add in the last point about what is the away-from-home business impact on our pods business.  So first of all, in brewers, let me -- I always need to go back and say what we said essentially every quarter is, we don't see brewer sales as a good predictor of household penetration, and our primary focus is driving household penetration.  And just so we're clear, we said that in quarters where brewers were plus 60% or plus 35%, we felt the same way. There is an inherent volatility in selling small appliances that is fundamentally different than selling consumables. And that's why looking at out on a quarter-by-quarter basis makes that metric even less helpful.  And if you look at this quarter in particular, you're seeing a lot of disruption in retail. I'm thinking about one of our original retailers for the Keurig business actually went bankrupt. So there's movement in inventory, there's movement across retail channels on the brewer side, so it's particularly volatile.  Having said that, we don't believe it impacts household penetration. Just for perspective, we sell about 10 million brewers per year, and we add 2 million households. So there's a significant difference there that is representative of upgrades or replacement. And that's the piece that I think people always forget.  The reason that we're talking about brewers on a rolling 12-month basis -- trailing 12-month basis because that at least take some of the noise out of it and gives an accurate picture. But of course, we didn't change the metric. We're just talking about that, and we're still reporting the quarterly metric as well. So we'll give you both.  With regard to mobility, that has been the single biggest driver of at-home coffee consumption. And as we've talked about on the last call and still true today, we're seeing the exact same trend globally. As it stands right now, mobility, the run rate, if you want to think about it that way, on mobility is pretty steady. And what's happening now is we begin to lap year-ago numbers that also are more normal that will happen in the back half of the year.  And we've been saying that for a while. Everything seems to be on track for that. And other people around the globe who are in the coffee business are seeing the same kind of trends and saying the same thing. So I think there's a common view of what's happened with the consumer.  The biggest driver of consumption of coffee at home is time spent at home. It's that simple. And so that's what we're seeing happening right now. And with regard to away from home, when you see the total pod number, as you point out, it's a combination of at-home and away-from-home. And a lot of people do that calculation for attachment rate and they divide the total pod number divided by the number of brewers, that embeds the away-from-home number, which is really nothing to do with an attachment rate.  That at-home business, which was down almost gone in the early days of COVID, has rebounded, but we think it is lower -- it is clearly lower than pre-COVID. And we think that's the way it's going to stay for a while. So I don't think there's good news to come on that away from home. I also don't think there's bad news to come.  I think it's pretty stable right now, but it has been a significant drag on the business over the past couple of years. But it is on a -- if you were to calculate that and its impact on the attachment rate I described, it would give the impression that attachment rate is down just simply because away-from-home in total was smaller than it once was.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Maria, congratulations. It's been a pleasure working with you. You'll definitely be missed.\nMaria Sceppaguercio: That's so nice, Bryan. Look forward to seeing you soon.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. I guess you stayed for more than just a cup of coffee.\nRobert Gamgort: We'll wait for that.\nBryan Spillane: You teed it up. So actually, my question is for Sudhanshu and just around your comments around cash flow. The tables -- working capital was a pretty negative swing in the first quarter. And I think it's -- if you can clarify for this, that this is partly just reducing the size of your factoring program?  So a, if you can confirm that? And then the second is just how you get to approaching, I guess, 100% free cash flow conversion because you're starting from a pretty big hole in the first quarter? So I guess if you can kind of clarify how close you think you get to the long-term target? And again, just kind of how that evolves over the course of the year, given the impact on cash from operations in the first quarter?\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Bryan, it's a great question. So you see Q1 operating cash flow is down versus a year ago, but last year, we had a lot of one-off items. So it's lower, mainly driven by those things, but also there is some timing of supply chain financing, we call it factoring. And this program was great in the beginning when interest rate was low, but we have a lot of options of our cash. You saw our leverage target is 2x to 2.5x. So we make the right optimal financial decision, whether it's interest rate, factoring also takes care of some interest rate is impact our P&L.  So we're making a lot of those decisions. Those are dynamic. But when I sit today, I still expect that we should be pretty close to our long-term target of cash conversion. I don't see an issue here right now, but we will be making these like dynamic trade-off decisions every month, every quarter, and we will update you more if we see something different.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Very much appreciate the conversation I'm trying to effectively almost smooth out the conversation on brewer sales in particular and also on pods across multiple quarters. But I was wondering why the comparison is being made to trailing 12 months ending the March quarter of '19 because that's basically comparing to 2018?.  I wouldn't think that with the pandemic starting as it did that there was any big real acceleration in shipments. There may have been takeaway at retail, but shipments wouldn't have changed very much in those last weeks of March 2020. So why compare it to effectively 2018 rather than to 2019?\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Lauren, this is Sudhanshu. The reason we did it to give you a more clear picture. In Q1 2020, you'll see the China started having locked down and then we saw the late March, there was some retail. So it was more to give you the visibility, but we -- that's the reason we did it. It's more because Q1 2020 had more noise.  So we just wanted to have a pre-COVID number. But we'll continue to give you a trailing 12 months decline. As you can see, this time, we declined 9.8%. So you will always have these metrics, but that's the reason because Q1 2020 had some noise, so we just wanted to be more clean.\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. And just to build on that one, but one of the points is if you take a look at how we're expecting sales for brewers to play out in 2023, it's going to be up nicely versus 2019 or you could pick a date prior to 2019, all of which were years in which we added 2 million or more households.  So one of the points we're trying to make on this is there were a number of upgrades and replacements that were accelerated during the pandemic cycle. You'd people spending more time at home, people were spending money on their home and also there was government subsidies as well.  But if you're -- if in the end, we sell brewers as part of household penetration -- actually, the household penetration is what drives brewer sales primarily. And if you go back and you check '19, '18, '17, the 2023 numbers no matter how you look at it, are going to be up nicely versus that. And we added 2 million households in all of those years. And that's the point we're trying to make.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo.\nChristopher Carey: Can you just comment on the coffee margin in the quarter, just given the volume decline I actually think it came in a little bit better? What are some of the drivers? What are you seeing from commodity inflation? What are you seeing from transportation? What are you seeing from volume deleverage in the quarter?  And then also, what are you seeing from a productivity standpoint? This is a key kind of debate for investors. And again, I just want to understand some of the components that came in, in Q1 and maybe helping build confidence on what you expect for the full year, including the back half recovery?\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: So Chris, there are 3 things that impacted in Q1. One was there's a narrowed gap between pricing and inflation. There was mix between pod and also the brewer sales. If you see brewer declined 29%, so it helps the margin and productivity benefit was there too, but that will ramp up more towards the second half.  So if you look at our U.S. Coffee guidance, we said roughly 1% top line growth and 3% to 4% profit growth. So you're seeing those leverage will come more. It will be more second half but we believe that the margin improvement driven by relationship improving between inflation and pricing, productivity and mix will help us deliver the full year number. So Q1, all those things impacted, but you will see this benefit move in the second half.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Great. So on the resegmentation, I think I definitely appreciate the simplicity of it. And I think over time, it will become shorthand for all of us. And I think the incremental disclosures you spoke to on or have been speaking to on Coffee Systems pods versus brewers will help.  I guess as I'm thinking about it, my question is really on the restructuring of beverages side because the historical -- I mean just the economic differences, both revenue mix implications and margin mix implications of the former beverage concentrates versus packaged beverages business. I think there's a big spread there. So as you're talking about that business going forward, we're thinking about forecasting that business going forward. How should we think about that? What information may be in the Qs and Ks going forward that will help us kind of tease out those potential mix implications? Is really, I'm just trying to think through that.  And also on refreshment beverages because I don't know if you're going to give this or not, but just the neutral contribution to growth in the quarter and expected over the year just so we can frame sort of the underlying versus the all-in revenue growth?\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: So Steve, this is Sudhanshu. The reason we did this resegmentation, we didn't do it since we merged. When we merged, we were running the business the same way. But internally, this is our second chapter of KDP growth and we run the business, U.S. refreshment beverages, U.S. Coffee and International, so that's the region we're required to report results to you the way we run the business.  We also feel that U.S. Coffee will give -- people will get a lot more visibility because we talk about 2 million households, people look at IRI and channel data. So it will help more clarification and people can relate to what internal numbers and external numbers are.  Regarding refreshment beverages, you have the 3-year -- the 3-year margin and sales. So you can see from there that we will continue to disclose the key drivers of that performance. But that's the way we run the business. It's U.S.-focused. We're also taking noise from ForEx, we're taking noise from -- before it was Canada and U.S. combined.  So a lot of those things will help you simplify it, and we will aid you if you have any questions on building your model. Nutrabolt this quarter was minimum is help us. But for the year, as we say, depending on the interest rate we pay, interest cost and also the equity pickup we will take, it's marginal. It will see more improvement or accretion to our EPS in 2024.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.\nBrett Cooper: Congrats to Maria as well. A question for you on distribution system. There's been a lot of change in the marketplace. And I think you're in a unique position given that your nondistributed volume goes through Coke, close to Pepsi route to market. And given that perspective, I was hoping you could offer your thoughts on the potential for distribution relationships and partnerships as a means to enhance scale capabilities and economics and then obviously, ultimately, brand performance in the years to come?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. Brett, just to clarify for everyone, the -- a portion of our Dr Pepper volume goes through Coke and Pepsi as well as our own trucks and then some other brands like Schweppes and Crush.  Outside of those brands, everything goes through our distribution system, and we cover about 75% of the U.S. population. And then the rest of that is covered by a network of independent operators, most of whom we've had long-term relationships with. And so we have always stated that we want to be a catalyst for consolidation on the distribution side of the business.  We think it is what retailers are going to want over time. We believe it's highly cost efficient. We also think from an environmental impact, taking miles off the road is a smart thing to do. Our way of doing that has been to consolidate overlapping territories where our company-owned routes match up against independent operators.  And we've done about 25 transactions over the past couple of years to make that happen. We think that consolidation will continue over time. We think that there is all the macro drivers that we just talked about and we stand ready and are driving our role as a catalyst to continue to make that happen. So, a lot more to come there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. I want to send my congratulations to Maria as well. I want to come back to Nutrabolt, and the C4 brand, Bob, you said it pretty bullish, both near term and long term. A few questions related to that. Just 1 maybe comment on how quickly you think you can ramp that brand from a distribution perspective? Some color on the spring, shelf space resets and where you think that brand is possibly gaining share?  And then Sudhanshu, to follow up on Steve's question, I think there would be some interest in the revenue contribution. I think the guidance for equity earnings is helpful, but the revenue contribution on the distribution agreement that would have gone through the PB segment, is that something you want to provide with respect both to the quarter and to the full year in terms of what's embedded in your outlook?\nRobert Gamgort: Early days on C4. We're in the mode of transitioning from their current distribution system into ours. I can tell you that that's gone very smoothly so far. And if you look at the syndicated data, you can see that the points of distribution are on the rise, which is really what our initial objective is. And it's more than just the quantitative increase in distribution. It's also the qualitative increase in terms of quality of placements, distribution -- I mean, on merchandising and placements.  So all of that is very much going on track. And the good news is you'll be able to track our progress on both the distribution gain and you'll be able to monitor velocities through syndicated data. So you'll be able to track our progress. You want to talk about the growth contribution?\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Yes, Kevin. So the C4 contributed to volume in U.S. refreshment beverages in Q1 and which we expect to continue for the full year. But the similar to other distribution partnership, we are not quantifying the top line contribution. As Bob said, we will call this out as a driver and you can track our performance in the scanner data.  It is a very small -- if you look at our $8 billion U.S. refreshment beverages, it's a very small. But we'll call that as a driver for you. And then once it becomes big enough to really meaningfully impact our revenue and profit, we will start thinking on how do we disclose it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.\nBonnie Herzog: I just had a couple of questions on your U.S. Coffee segment. Bob, I understand your point about brewer volumes versus household penetration. But I guess I'm trying to understand your expectations for brewer volume this year, especially that's a pretty big driver of your top line as well as impacts on margins since they're just slightly profitable.  So how should we think about brewer volumes for the year, especially given how elevated your inventory levels still are? I mean is it fair to assume your volumes will likely now be down more than you originally thought? And then, I guess, if so, is that also a key driver of why you're expecting margin expansion in the second half? Any color there would be appreciated.\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. Sure. On our last call, we set the expectation for 2023 that brewers would be down modestly. When you take a look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, you see those kind of trends that we described here, down 9.8%. This quarter, as we said in the prepared remarks, was softer than expected.  And I don't take a look at any one of these quarters and project it as a long-term trend. And there's a lot of volatility in this quarter compared to a normal quarter, which is -- which has volatility. And part of that, as we talked about is retail disruption with regard to some of the specialty retailers being really challenging and one of them going bankrupt.  Having said that, other retailers will pick up the consumer slack and the consumer demand. And we will certainly be there in all those retailers. We have distribution everywhere. And a lot of this is moving online where we are very, very strong. And so as I said before, just like in quarters, we're plus 60%. We said don't project this quarter out anywhere that's the inherent volatility. I'm saying the same thing about this quarter.  With regard to brewers, I mean inventory, it's not an issue from our standpoint. We managed that very, very well. So it's not a negative. And with regard to second half margins, expected reduction of brewers is not a driver of our margin assumption in the back half of the year, that's not built into any of our assumptions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS.\nPeter Grom: Maria, congrats as well. Maybe just two questions on coffee, maybe 1 just housekeeping. Bob, you mentioned Bed Bath & Beyond, how impactful is that to the business? I'm assuming it's embedded in the outlook, but just wanted to understand if there's something we need to think through as we model the growth from here?  And then I guess I just wanted to follow up on Chris' earlier question around operating margin in coffee, but more from a long-term recovery perspective. I understand you expect improvement in the back half of the year. But how would you frame the long-term opportunity? And maybe more specifically, how quickly can you get back to operating margin in kind of the mid- to high 30% range?\nRobert Gamgort: Yes. I mean the disruption from any particular retailer is not a major factor over the long term. The consumer demand remains. They just shift their demand to other retailers. And I said before, we have great relationships and great availability across the board, including e-commerce. We always try to work with retailers even when they're challenged.  And so in a given quarter, it caused some disruption based on shipments versus a year ago, et cetera. But like I said, it has no impact on household penetration nor does it have any impact on the long-term outlook that we have or even the annual outlook that we have. With regard to margins, Sudhanshu gave you the reasons why margin was on the right trajectory.  If you continue to look forward, I'll give you a couple of factors. One is the narrowing of pricing versus inflation as we talked about on our contracts with our partners. We have long-term contracts. We said a number of times that there is a lag in being able to secure the pricing versus inflation. So as time goes forward, we're able to do that.  And the other part that we talked about is productivity. Productivity, a year ago when we were in a supply chain rebuild mode, was a very, very low focus for us back there's no focus. We were just trying to get supply out there to rebuild inventories. Now that we're way ahead of the game from a manufacturing standpoint, it allows us to focus on productivity.  And then, of course, we talked about big structural productivity projects like Spartanburg, and we said that we view that -- it's been a delay, which has been challenging in the past 12 months and currently. But as you look forward to think of that one as deferred productivity still to come. So again, this is all about the narrowing of our cost structure, which is inflation minus productivity versus pricing and they continue to get more favorable as we move forward.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: First, just a point of clarification, then my real question. The clarification is, I just want to make sure I heard it right, that the pod sales in the second quarter will be affected by Omicron last year? And please remind me on the guidance on that. And then the main question is, wondering if you could give us an update on your digital initiatives and e-commerce?\nRobert Gamgort: Sure. Just to clarify on the pod conversation. The primary driver of pod volume is the mobility. And it's -- as I said before, time spent at home is the biggest driver of coffee consumed that no big surprise there, but it's a very direct relationship there. The run rate that we're seeing on mobility is relatively stable over the past couple of months, and we continue to expect that going forward. It's the lap versus year ago that becomes more neutral/favorable as you get to the second half of the year. And that's why we're saying in the second half of the year for all forms of adult coffee would look better on a volume perspective.  The unique element in your comparison to Q2, in addition to the mobility comparison, is we were rebuilding inventory after the late -- it was Q4, Q1 supply chain issue. And so we outshipped ourselves in the second quarter of last year. And we were really clear when that happened and that was the rebuild of inventory.  So that's why when we talk about Q2 being more challenged on a comparison basis, it's the combination of still the rebound in the mobility versus a year ago with this unique situation in Q2, which is the inventory build.  With regard to digital, we don't have a lot of time to talk about that right now. I mean I think it's a conversation for another day. We have initiatives across the board in terms of the way that we plan and run the business as well as the way that we identify and optimize our consumer marketing.  With regard to direct-to-consumer, we are -- we've talked before that we believe we are one of, if not the leader, in -- certainly in the food and beverage world in terms of direct consumer sales. And the technology that we continue to build on the Keurig side of the business, which is the connected brewers with the ability to understand consumption on a real-time basis, translating that into a smart auto reorder program is very exciting as we continue to move forward and build the number of households that have a smart brewer. So a lot more conversation on that point to come. I can't really do it justice in this period of time, but appreciate the question.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jane Gelfand for any closing remarks.\nJane Gelfand: Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on a busy morning. The IR team is available to answer any questions you may have. So please do reach out. Thank you again.\nOperator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Very much appreciate the conversation I'm trying to effectively almost smooth out the conversation on brewer sales in particular and also on pods across multiple quarters. But I was wondering why the comparison is being made to trailing 12 months ending the March quarter of '19 because that's basically comparing to 2018?.  I wouldn't think that with the pandemic starting as it did that there was any big real acceleration in shipments. There may have been takeaway at retail, but shipments wouldn't have changed very much in those last weeks of March 2020. So why compare it to effectively 2018 rather than to 2019?"
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Gamgort",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We started 2023 with good momentum. Our overall Q1 performance came in largely as expected and demonstrated the resilience of the modern beverage company we have built. We continue to manage well against a dynamic macro environment with the diversification benefits of KDP's model evident in our results.  This morning, we reaffirmed our 2023 outlook, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our commitments as a company. For the quarter, consolidated net sales advanced a strong 9% versus the prior year, and adjusted EPS grew 3%. Consumer demand remained healthy driven by successful renovation and innovation, increased investment in marketing and modest elasticities across much of our portfolio.  A narrowing gap between inflation and pricing coupled with increased productivity and favorable mix contributed to good flow-through to gross profit, though we continue to work through significant ongoing inflation in transportation, warehousing and labor costs. We expect the balance between these operating income drivers to turn more favorable in the back half of the year.  In U.S. refreshment beverages, which represents nearly 60% of KDP consolidated revenue, our strong performance in Q1 demonstrated the depth of our capabilities across multiple dimensions including brand renovation, marketing, distribution and in-market execution as well as our partnership philosophy and successful track record.  As discussed previously, we create value in U.S. refreshment beverages in 3 ways: by driving growth in core brands through marketing and brand renovation, by filling portfolio white spaces via innovation and external partnerships and by enhancing the effectiveness of our omnichannel selling and distribution system, including our company-owned direct store delivery system. The multiplier effect of all 3 of these elements working in unison was evident in Q1.  We gained share in categories representing almost 90% of retail sales. With strong momentum in core brands, particularly Dr. Pepper, Crush and Mott's. On the back of the very successful launch of Dr Pepper Strawberries & Cream, brand Dr Pepper recorded the largest market share gain in the CSD category this quarter. In fact, the brand has become the #1 flavored CSD in syndicated data over the past 13 weeks.  For perspective, Strawberries & Cream reached 70% ACV distribution within 5 weeks of launch, quickly gained a full share point in the CSD category and continues to experience strong momentum. Driving the early success of Strawberries & Cream is KDP's direct store delivery engine and robust consumer insights and marketing support.  In Q1, we also began to activate our strategic partnership with Nutrabolt, transitioning C4 energy distribution to our network. Our execution thus far has been smooth and is progressing in line with our plans. As we begin to invest behind the brand, we are securing incremental distribution points and display as well as upgrading placements. Though it is still very early days, our partnership with Nutrabolt is strong and collaborative.  We are excited by its potential and look forward to unlocking more value for both KDP and Nutrabolt in the quarters and years ahead. In-market execution underpins the gains we are making across our U.S. refreshment beverages portfolio. The results speak for themselves, but they are even more notable given we and the industry at large, continue to work through significant inflation.  We have supplemented 2022 carryover pricing with some additional pricing actions to start the year, as we protect our profitability and our ability to reinvest for the long term. The limited elasticities this business has experienced so far are a telling reminder of the resilience of the category in general and the KDP portfolio in particular.  Our brands remain important and affordable components of our consumers' everyday lives. Still, as recessionary risks persist, we continue to closely monitor consumer health and sentiment.  Turning now to U.S. Coffee, which represents roughly 30% of our consolidated revenue. This segment experienced a slower start to the year. The performance in pods.which as you know, is our primary focus and profit driver was as expected, with brewers softer than expected.  Pod segment's performance in the first half of the year will be difficult to analyze for longer-term trends. Let me take a step back and explain what we are seeing in the category and in our own business. Growth rates in the at-home coffee category, including the single-serve segment are being temporarily impacted by changes in mobility relative to the prior year.  In Q1, the category lapped the surge of the Omicron variant and lingering pandemic precautions in the year ago period are expected to continue to affect comparisons through the first half. At the same time, the category is digesting significant cumulative pricing to offset inflation. Importantly, single-serve continues to gain volume share in the at-home coffee category in the U.S. underpinning the strength and resilience of the segment and our long-term growth strategy.  We also see the environment for small appliances being impacted by the combination of lower consumer discretionary spending and a challenged specialty retailer environment. Sudhanshu will cover the detailed quarterly performance drivers, but let me say upfront, we expect the second half to reveal a more normalized picture of the health of the single-serve category and our ongoing momentum.  We are still planning to add approximately 2 million new households to the Keurig ecosystem in 2023, and we also continue to expect the back half to show strong improvement in segment operating margins.  Short-term noise aside, the category -- the coffee category is vast and growing in the U.S. and globally. Moving out the volatility of the pandemic period, we are projecting double-digit volume growth for our at-home pods in the U.S. from 2019 to 2023, which translates to mid-single-digit compound annual growth rate. This is consistent with our previous discussions that eliminating the significant noise over the past 3 years revealed consistent and healthy long-term trends for at-home single-serve coffee.  As the leader in U.S. single serve, our overarching growth strategy is to continue converting consumers from brewing coffee by the pot to brewing it by the pod, which we pursue through 2 primary means. First, by driving household penetration for the Keurig system. U.S. single-serve adoption remains significantly below that in more developed single-serve markets in Western Europe and even Canada. And we expect household growth to continue for many years to come as we target adding approximately 2 million new households annually.  Second, by increasing revenue and profit growth from our existing 38 million U.S. Keurig households. Ongoing brewer innovation to address new and changing consumer needs, and a focus on expanding brand and variety of offerings within the Keurig ecosystem underpin our coffee growth strategy. We have news on both fronts in 2023. When it comes to meeting consumer needs, after an initial successful launch with a single customer last year, in 2023, we are expanding our K-Iced brewer platform as well as dedicated iced pods specifically designed for cold beverages.  Both coffee beverages are growing quickly at coffee shops and over-indexed to younger consumers. Given our ability to deliver a high-quality cold coffee experience at home for a fraction of the price, we see ice coffee as a growth opportunity for the Keurig ecosystem in 2023 and beyond.  We also continue to add new and exciting brands to the Keurig ecosystem. Today, we are pleased to announce that Philz Coffee, a super premium brand based in San Francisco, will be available on K-Cup pods beginning this fall. Through the new partnership with Philz as well as the additions of Intelligentsia and BLK & Bold announced last year, we are building a new super premium segment for K-Cup pods.  Our International segment which represents just above 10% of our consolidated revenue, encompasses both our Canadian coffee and beverages business as well as our LRB businesses in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Our growth strategy for international, leverages enterprise-wide insights and capabilities to grow household penetration in coffee and to drive share gains in LRBs through brand innovation and renovation, white space expansion and strengthening our routes to market. We tailor our approach to local taste and market structures while exporting best practices and ideas across the whole of North America.  In Q1, we were pleased to see broad-based momentum across our brands and categories, including in mineral waters, CSDs and single-serve coffee. Our partnership with Red Bull in Mexico continues to build. And we also remained focused on expanding within the low or no alcohol category, including through our acquisition of Atypique in Canada. Both opportunities leverage our existing portfolio and distribution assets, including our DSD system in Mexico and our alcohol portfolio and expertise in Canada.  Wrapping up, we expect the operating environment to remain fluid, and we see KDP as well positioned to continue to deliver strong consolidated performance in 2023. We are reaffirming our 2023 outlook for constant currency net sales growth of 5% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%. On an underlying basis, this implies adjusted EPS growth that is closer to 9% at the top end of our long-term algorithm.  In addition, KDP has a track record of strong free cash flow generation, and we expect to continue to unlock the potential for incremental shareholder returns through strategic capital allocation. We have evolved our capital allocation approach to better fit our development stage as a company and to respond to a higher interest rate environment.  We are prioritizing internal investments, partnerships and M&A, balanced against returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, which we undertook this quarter and last quarter. A recent upgrade by Moody's to a stronger investment-grade credit rating recognizes that the inherent portfolio balance of our modern beverage company, along with our capital allocation philosophy and free cash flow profile, all aspects that Sudhanshu will talk more about next. Thanks, Sudhanshu. Before moving to Q&A, I want to take a moment to thank Maria who is retiring in July after a distinguished 40-plus-year career. She will remain with KDP as an adviser through year-end. I know that most of you hold Maria in the highest regard, just as we do at KDP where she has been a valued member of the executive leadership team for the last 5 years.  Maria and I have worked together for over a decade, spanning 2 companies and countless deals, including an IPO. She has built a very strong corporate affairs team for KDP, and we are pleased that she will stay on as an adviser to support the transition to her successor upon hire.  We will all miss working with Maria, and wish her the very best in this next and well-earned chapter. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Yes. Okay, Andrea. Thanks for your questions. It's really 3 components, particularly on brewers now I'll talk about mobility-related pods and then I'll add in the last point about what is the away-from-home business impact on our pods business.  So first of all, in brewers, let me -- I always need to go back and say what we said essentially every quarter is, we don't see brewer sales as a good predictor of household penetration, and our primary focus is driving household penetration.  And just so we're clear, we said that in quarters where brewers were plus 60% or plus 35%, we felt the same way. There is an inherent volatility in selling small appliances that is fundamentally different than selling consumables. And that's why looking at out on a quarter-by-quarter basis makes that metric even less helpful.  And if you look at this quarter in particular, you're seeing a lot of disruption in retail. I'm thinking about one of our original retailers for the Keurig business actually went bankrupt. So there's movement in inventory, there's movement across retail channels on the brewer side, so it's particularly volatile.  Having said that, we don't believe it impacts household penetration. Just for perspective, we sell about 10 million brewers per year, and we add 2 million households. So there's a significant difference there that is representative of upgrades or replacement. And that's the piece that I think people always forget.  The reason that we're talking about brewers on a rolling 12-month basis -- trailing 12-month basis because that at least take some of the noise out of it and gives an accurate picture. But of course, we didn't change the metric. We're just talking about that, and we're still reporting the quarterly metric as well. So we'll give you both.  With regard to mobility, that has been the single biggest driver of at-home coffee consumption. And as we've talked about on the last call and still true today, we're seeing the exact same trend globally. As it stands right now, mobility, the run rate, if you want to think about it that way, on mobility is pretty steady. And what's happening now is we begin to lap year-ago numbers that also are more normal that will happen in the back half of the year.  And we've been saying that for a while. Everything seems to be on track for that. And other people around the globe who are in the coffee business are seeing the same kind of trends and saying the same thing. So I think there's a common view of what's happened with the consumer.  The biggest driver of consumption of coffee at home is time spent at home. It's that simple. And so that's what we're seeing happening right now. And with regard to away from home, when you see the total pod number, as you point out, it's a combination of at-home and away-from-home. And a lot of people do that calculation for attachment rate and they divide the total pod number divided by the number of brewers, that embeds the away-from-home number, which is really nothing to do with an attachment rate.  That at-home business, which was down almost gone in the early days of COVID, has rebounded, but we think it is lower -- it is clearly lower than pre-COVID. And we think that's the way it's going to stay for a while. So I don't think there's good news to come on that away from home. I also don't think there's bad news to come.  I think it's pretty stable right now, but it has been a significant drag on the business over the past couple of years. But it is on a -- if you were to calculate that and its impact on the attachment rate I described, it would give the impression that attachment rate is down just simply because away-from-home in total was smaller than it once was. We'll wait for that. Yes. And just to build on that one, but one of the points is if you take a look at how we're expecting sales for brewers to play out in 2023, it's going to be up nicely versus 2019 or you could pick a date prior to 2019, all of which were years in which we added 2 million or more households.  So one of the points we're trying to make on this is there were a number of upgrades and replacements that were accelerated during the pandemic cycle. You'd people spending more time at home, people were spending money on their home and also there was government subsidies as well.  But if you're -- if in the end, we sell brewers as part of household penetration -- actually, the household penetration is what drives brewer sales primarily. And if you go back and you check '19, '18, '17, the 2023 numbers no matter how you look at it, are going to be up nicely versus that. And we added 2 million households in all of those years. And that's the point we're trying to make. Yes. Brett, just to clarify for everyone, the -- a portion of our Dr Pepper volume goes through Coke and Pepsi as well as our own trucks and then some other brands like Schweppes and Crush.  Outside of those brands, everything goes through our distribution system, and we cover about 75% of the U.S. population. And then the rest of that is covered by a network of independent operators, most of whom we've had long-term relationships with. And so we have always stated that we want to be a catalyst for consolidation on the distribution side of the business.  We think it is what retailers are going to want over time. We believe it's highly cost efficient. We also think from an environmental impact, taking miles off the road is a smart thing to do. Our way of doing that has been to consolidate overlapping territories where our company-owned routes match up against independent operators.  And we've done about 25 transactions over the past couple of years to make that happen. We think that consolidation will continue over time. We think that there is all the macro drivers that we just talked about and we stand ready and are driving our role as a catalyst to continue to make that happen. So, a lot more to come there. Early days on C4. We're in the mode of transitioning from their current distribution system into ours. I can tell you that that's gone very smoothly so far. And if you look at the syndicated data, you can see that the points of distribution are on the rise, which is really what our initial objective is. And it's more than just the quantitative increase in distribution. It's also the qualitative increase in terms of quality of placements, distribution -- I mean, on merchandising and placements.  So all of that is very much going on track. And the good news is you'll be able to track our progress on both the distribution gain and you'll be able to monitor velocities through syndicated data. So you'll be able to track our progress. You want to talk about the growth contribution? Sure. Sure. On our last call, we set the expectation for 2023 that brewers would be down modestly. When you take a look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, you see those kind of trends that we described here, down 9.8%. This quarter, as we said in the prepared remarks, was softer than expected.  And I don't take a look at any one of these quarters and project it as a long-term trend. And there's a lot of volatility in this quarter compared to a normal quarter, which is -- which has volatility.

Having said that, other retailers will pick up the consumer slack and the consumer demand. And we will certainly be there in all those retailers. We have distribution everywhere. And a lot of this is moving online where we are very, very strong. And so as I said before, just like in quarters, we're plus 60%. We said don't project this quarter out anywhere that's the inherent volatility. I'm saying the same thing about this quarter.

One is the narrowing of pricing versus inflation as we talked about on our contracts with our partners. We have long-term contracts. We said a number of times that there is a lag in being able to secure the pricing versus inflation. So as time goes forward, we're able to do that.

            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. In kicking off 2023, we made the decision to realign our segment reporting to more closely reflect how we plan, run and evaluate these businesses internally. The new U.S. coffee segment will also enhance comparability relative to how we speak about our long-term goals, including our 2 million annual U.S. household penetration target. There is also the added benefit of giving you a more refined picture of our operations in the United States, which is by far our largest market.  We believe the size, scale and margin profile of each U.S. segment becomes more visible externally, making it easier for you to track and analyze. U.S. refreshment beverages is an $8 billion-plus revenue business with a 28% adjusted operating margin. The U.S. coffee business is $4.3 billion in revenue, also very large with an adjusted operating margin above 32%.  Obviously, both are high-quality CPG businesses with tremendous scale in the U.S. market. At the same time, our fast-growing international segment at approximately $1.7 billion of revenue and a 24% adjusted operating margin is already meaningful and quite profitable.  We are pleased that KDP's portfolio delivered over all Q1 results, which were consistent with our going-in expectations even as performance among the segments was varied. Q1 sales advanced 9% driven by a strong in-market execution, particularly in U.S. refreshment beverages. Gross profit dollars grew at a similar rate, and we increased marketing investments versus prior year. At $0.34, our adjusted diluted EPS grew 3% versus Q1 last year. Without a $0.05 headwind from the significant reduction in nonoperational items year-over-year, underlying EPS growth in the quarter was in the high-teens.  As discussed on our last earnings call, we are committed to a step function decrease in the use of nonoperational items this year. And as this occurs, the earning powers of the business will become even more visible. Our actions also continued to reflect our revised capital allocation priorities.  In Q1, we saw and took advantage of a value opportunity in KDP shares and bought back 6.6 million shares during the quarter. Combined with the share repurchases we undertook in late 2022, we have now returned more than $500 million to shareholders via opportunistic buybacks over the past 2 quarters.  Our high-quality portfolio, consistent results, well-capitalized balance sheet and flexible capital allocation approach are being increasingly recognized. As Bob mentioned, Moody's upgraded our credit rating earlier this month, which is especially notable in a weaker macro environment. We believe our strong balance sheet and North American focus represents a safe haven in the current tumultuous financial market.  Let's now take a closer look at consolidated Q1 results. Consistent with the last couple of quarters, our top line growth was driven by pricing taken to offset inflation and a modest volume/mix decline. Net sales grew 8.9% to $3.4 billion with pricing up approximately 10%.  Gross margins were stable at 52.7% and primarily reflected the combined benefits of pricing, productivity gains and positive mix balanced against considerable input cost inflation. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by about 100 bps versus prior year, reflecting continued elevated transportation, warehousing and labor costs.  Despite these cost headwinds, we increased marketing investment to support our brand momentum. We also lapped an SG&A benefit of $28 million from a stock comp accounting chain in the prior year period. Q1 adjusted operating income was $699 million, about 4.5% below a year ago, but representing almost 9% growth on an underlying basis.  Adjusted net income grew about 1%, aided by flat interest expense, equity method earnings and a lower tax rate versus the prior year. Lower diluted shares outstanding helped drive additional leverage in the EPS growth rate.  Turning now to segment performance. U.S. refreshment beverages sales grew 12.7%, led by 12.5 percentage points from favorable net price realization. The benefit of pricing was sequentially lower relative to Q4 as we begin to anniversary price increases we took in early 2022 and have not yet captured the full benefit of pricing actions announced earlier this year.  Volume mix was slightly positive in the quarter reflecting very limited elasticity impact as well as the contribution from C4 Energy. This volume mix result speaks to resilient consumer demand, modest elasticities in our categories and a successful slate of renovations and innovations.  Segment operating income increased 11.6% as we effectively translated top line momentum to bottom line results despite inflation in packaging, manufacturing and labor costs. Our U.S. coffee segment represents a single-serve ecosystem in which our brewers create a platform for high-quality coffee experiences through our high-margin consumable K-Cup pods. Simply put, we are in the business of selling pods, not brewers.  That said, we recognize that the quarter volatility in brewers can sometimes distort the picture. To help you further contextualize brewer trends, we are introducing 2 additional disclosures, trailing 12 months brewers sold and associated growth rates.  You saw both of these in our press release this morning. Going forward, while we will continue to disclose quarterly brewer sales and shipments in our 10-Q, we will focus our remarks in this forum as well as in the press release on trailing 12 months strength, which we believe to smooth the inherent quarterly volatility of appliances relative to consumables.  Let's now get into the results. In U.S. Coffee, Q1 revenue declined 1.3%, with pricing up 5.3%, but volume mix down 6.6%. The involvement for small appliances was more dynamic than we expected, reflecting the combination of softer discretionary spending and a challenged specialty retailer landscape. These factors primarily impacted brewer shipments, which declined 29% in the quarter. For perspective, Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter of the year, accounting for less than 20% of brewer shipments.  On a trailing 12-month basis, brewer shipments totaled $10.2 million, reflecting a 9.8% decline year-over-year, but a strong growth of 25.6% relative to the pre-pandemic period ending Q1 2019. Our goal of adding an incremental 2 million households in the U.S. in 2023 remains intact.  U.S. pod revenues grew 2.9% and pod volumes declined modestly, down 1.9% in quarter 1. This was influenced by consumer mobility that was meaningfully different versus the same time last year when the Omicron surge led to more time spent at home. There are other factors at play in the category such as some elasticity in response to pricing and mix shifts to a more normalized level of premium versus private label exposure.  However, we continue to believe that mobility is the largest driver of at-home coffee category softness over the past few quarters. It follows that pod trends should improve in H2 as mobility differences relative to last year begin to dissipate.  We continue to expect U.S. coffee volumes in quarter 2 to remain under pressure against the year ago period when we successfully executed our coffee recovery program and rebuilt partner and retail inventories after supply disruptions.  Inflation remains a headwind in U.S. Coffee, where segment operating margin contracted 130 basis points in the quarter and segment operating income declined 5.3%. We expect an improvement in the relationship between inflation, pricing and productivity in the back half which provides good visibility to a strong margin recovery in the segment, leading to a year-over-year improvement in gross margin in 2023.  In particular, we are refocusing on productivity in 2023 after much of 2022 was focused on prioritizing customer service. I want to revert for a minute to Q1 performance as it would have been reported for the former Coffee Systems segment.  Constant currency revenue for Coffee Systems grew 1% in quarter 1 with faster growth in Canada relative to the U.S. Following the segment realignment and reflecting softer-than-expected brewer volume, we now expect U.S. Coffee revenue to grow approximately 1% in 2023 with segment operating income growth of 3% to 4%.  This incorporates plans for ongoing marketing reinvestment and the expected back half margin expansion. Our consolidated outlook for KDP in 2023, which I will address in more detail shortly, remains unchanged.  Our International segment performance in Q1 was strong and well balanced. Net sales increased 16.7% with net price realization contributing 9 points of growth and volume mix up 7.7% year-over-year. Growth was broad-based and led by LRBs and single sub-pods.  The combination of net price realization and productivity gains helped to offset inflationary headwinds and together led to a strong segment operating income growth of 18%.  Turning briefly to cash flow. Free cash flow in Q1 was $16 million. This declined relative to last year, reflecting the lapping of certain discrete benefits in Q1 2022, such as the BODYARMOR litigation settlement gain as well as a use of net working capital this quarter.  For the full year, we expect the rate of free cash flow conversion to approach our long-term target. This brings us to our consolidated outlook. With Q1 results largely as expected, we continue to expect constant currency net sales to increase 5% in 2023 and adjusted EPS to grow 6% to 7%.  We continue to project currency translation to be a 50 basis point headwind to both top and bottom lines. As Bob said, underlying EPS growth is expected to be closer to 9% at the top end of our high single-digit long-term algorithm. This basis removes the noise from year-over-year differences in nonoperational items, which we still expect to roughly half relative to 2022 levels.  Despite the recent news headlines about CPI and PPI easing, we continue to see significant cost inflation. Headwinds across realized raw material costs transportation and labor are sticky and persistent, and we still expect mid-single-digit inflation in 2023. We are highly focused on offsetting these pressures through a combination of pricing, revenue growth management and productivity initiatives, and we expect the gap versus inflation to reverse as the year progresses.  Our full year guidance for below-the-line items remains unchanged. We expect interest expense in a $465 million to $470 million range, which still includes $45 million related to the Nutrabolt investment. Equity method earnings from Nutrabolt of approximately $40 million to $45 million, an effective tax rate of 22% for the year and approximately 1.42 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding.  As it relates to quarter 2, EPS is expected to grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range. We still expect to have a gap between inflation and pricing and productivity in the quarter with a more beneficial relationship expected to materialize in the back half.  Marketing is also expected to increase in quarter 2, reflecting incremental investments across both LRBs and coffee particularly behind the Iced platform in U.S. Coffee that Bob highlighted earlier.  To wrap up, our overall Q1 performance tracked largely in line with our expectations, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate the balance of 2023, which promises to remain dynamic. Our recast segments better eliminate the scale of our businesses with distinct and clearly defined growth pillars in place for each segment.  Our brand portfolio, renovation and innovation activity and in-market execution remains very strong. We are working diligently to offset inflation and to drive margin improvement later in the year while reinvesting in our brands.  And finally, our capital allocation priorities are clear as we look to deploy our strong cash flow against the highest ROI opportunities.  I will now turn the call back to Bob for closing comments. Bryan, it's a great question. So you see Q1 operating cash flow is down versus a year ago, but last year, we had a lot of one-off items. So it's lower, mainly driven by those things, but also there is some timing of supply chain financing, we call it factoring. And this program was great in the beginning when interest rate was low, but we have a lot of options of our cash. You saw our leverage target is 2x to 2.5x. So we make the right optimal financial decision, whether it's interest rate, factoring also takes care of some interest rate is impact our P&L.  So we're making a lot of those decisions. Those are dynamic. But when I sit today, I still expect that we should be pretty close to our long-term target of cash conversion. I don't see an issue here right now, but we will be making these like dynamic trade-off decisions every month, every quarter, and we will update you more if we see something different. Lauren, this is Sudhanshu. The reason we did it to give you a more clear picture. In Q1 2020, you'll see the China started having locked down and then we saw the late March, there was some retail. So it was more to give you the visibility, but we -- that's the reason we did it. It's more because Q1 2020 had more noise.  So we just wanted to have a pre-COVID number. But we'll continue to give you a trailing 12 months decline. As you can see, this time, we declined 9.8%. So you will always have these metrics, but that's the reason because Q1 2020 had some noise, so we just wanted to be more clean. So Chris, there are 3 things that impacted in Q1. One was there's a narrowed gap between pricing and inflation. There was mix between pod and also the brewer sales. If you see brewer declined 29%, so it helps the margin and productivity benefit was there too, but that will ramp up more towards the second half.  So if you look at our U.S. Coffee guidance, we said roughly 1% top line growth and 3% to 4% profit growth. So you're seeing those leverage will come more. It will be more second half but we believe that the margin improvement driven by relationship improving between inflation and pricing, productivity and mix will help us deliver the full year number. So Q1, all those things impacted, but you will see this benefit move in the second half. So Steve, this is Sudhanshu. The reason we did this resegmentation, we didn't do it since we merged. When we merged, we were running the business the same way. But internally, this is our second chapter of KDP growth and we run the business, U.S. refreshment beverages, U.S. Coffee and International, so that's the region we're required to report results to you the way we run the business.  We also feel that U.S. Coffee will give -- people will get a lot more visibility because we talk about 2 million households, people look at IRI and channel data. So it will help more clarification and people can relate to what internal numbers and external numbers are.  Regarding refreshment beverages, you have the 3-year -- the 3-year margin and sales. So you can see from there that we will continue to disclose the key drivers of that performance. But that's the way we run the business. It's U.S.-focused. We're also taking noise from ForEx, we're taking noise from -- before it was Canada and U.S. combined.  So a lot of those things will help you simplify it, and we will aid you if you have any questions on building your model. Nutrabolt this quarter was minimum is help us. But for the year, as we say, depending on the interest rate we pay, interest cost and also the equity pickup we will take, it's marginal. It will see more improvement or accretion to our EPS in 2024. Yes, Kevin. So the C4 contributed to volume in U.S. refreshment beverages in Q1 and which we expect to continue for the full year. But the similar to other distribution partnership, we are not quantifying the top line contribution. As Bob said, we will call this out as a driver and you can track our performance in the scanner data.  It is a very small -- if you look at our $8 billion U.S. refreshment beverages, it's a very small. But we'll call that as a driver for you. And then once it becomes big enough to really meaningfully impact our revenue and profit, we will start thinking on how do we disclose it."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Earnings Call for the Third Quarter of 2024. This conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Head of Investor Relations, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, you may please begin.\nJane Gelfand: Thank you and hello everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued two separate press releases announcing third quarter results and our pending transaction with GHOST. We will discuss both topics during this conference call and in the accompanying slide presentation, which can be tracked in real time on the live webcast. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements, which reflect KDP\u2019s judgment, assumptions and analysis only as of today. Our actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting KDP\u2019s business. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements discussed today. For more information, please refer to our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our Q3 performance on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. Definitions and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics are included in our earnings materials. Here with us today to discuss our results are Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cofer; and Chief Financial Officer and President, International, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim.\nTim Cofer: Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. Our solid 2024 year-to-date performance demonstrates KDP\u2019s resiliency and flexibility. This morning, we reaffirmed our full year outlook despite an uneven operating environment. And we are targeting a strong finish to the year in Q4. Simultaneously, we are making good progress against our long-term strategy, laying the groundwork for multiyear success. Now, before covering our quarterly results, I want to highlight the just announced GHOST deal as yet another example of how we are enhancing our portfolio while exercising capital discipline. We have reached an agreement to purchase a majority stake in GHOST this year to be followed by the acquisition of the remainder of the business in the first half of \u201828. This transaction strengthens our position in the attractive energy drink category and accelerates our portfolio evolution towards consumer preferred and growth accretive spaces. GHOST is young, versatile and founder-led, with approximately $0.5 billion portfolio anchored by its leading energy drink while also spanning supplements and an emerging presence in other LRB categories. The brand more than quadrupled in size over the last 3 years and remains one of the fastest-growing in the energy category, thanks to its unique brand identity, distinctive flavors and packaging, cross-occasion appeal and strong consumer engagement, including on-premise. GHOST will complement KDP\u2019s existing energy portfolio and substantially enhance our presence in the category. We see significant potential to further scale GHOST in collaboration with its founders, Dan Lorenzo and Ryan Hughes, who will continue to lead the brand as part of KDP\u2019s U.S. refreshment beverages unit. I\u2019ve been very impressed with Dan and Ryan and their tremendous success to-date. More importantly, I share their vision for strong growth in the years to come. Together, we plan to take GHOST to new heights as we build out KDP\u2019s platform-based approach to the energy category. Now at $23 billion in size, energy remains one of the fastest-growing scaled categories in beverages and enjoys multiple structural growth characteristics. These beverages satisfy a near universal consumer need for energy and alertness, which is increasingly relevant in a world with significant demands on our time and attention. They appeal to consumers across all ages and demographics, including over-indexing to GenZennials. There is significant headroom for household penetration to grow versus other leading beverage categories. And the category is still in the development stage of price pack architecture and channel diversity. All of these elements translate to a large total addressable market that we believe the category will grow into and on which KDP is well positioned to capitalize. As energy drink consumption becomes more prevalent, the category is evolving to serve distinct consumer need states and occasions. This landscape lends itself nicely to a portfolio approach, which we have successfully employed in premium water to become the number two share player. We\u2019re now using a similar playbook in energy, having accelerated our push into the category over the last 24 months with C4, GHOST and Black Rifle Energy. In addition to today\u2019s Ghost announcement, we just signed a distribution agreement with Nutrabolt for Bloom ready-to-drink energy. Bloom is a highly promising emerging and distinctive beverage brand with a female-oriented SKU. Together, each of these brands can work in complementary ways to address consumer needs while driving greater scale in the category and across our DSD infrastructure. Beyond its strategic merits, the GHOST transaction is another good example of how we approach efficient capital deployment. Through an elegant deal structure, we are capturing the growth opportunity and paving the way for compelling financial returns while retaining manageable balance sheet leverage and aligning long-term incentives. Our chosen structure retains GHOST leadership team, reinforcing a unique element of KDP\u2019s white space expansion strategy, our founder network. We work to keep visionary entrepreneurs at the helm of the brands they created while adding substantial scale and resources from KDP. In energy drinks, we\u2019ve seen the value of this arrangement firsthand through our close relationship with Nutrabolt\u2019s innovative leader, Doss Cunningham. With alignment and support from energy leaders like Doss, Dan and Ryan of GHOST and others, we are building a formidable energy platform that will drive win-win outcomes for all involved. Let\u2019s now move to our third quarter results. Constant currency net sales grew 3.1%. We made solid progress on volume/mix with 3.5% growth in Q3. As anticipated, U.S. refreshment beverages momentum strengthened considerably U.S. coffee volume mix grew nicely and international trends remained healthy. Total KDP net price was a source of modest pressure in Q3. We expect sequential improvement in Q4 and a further step-up into 2025 as recently announced pricing actions across meaningful parts of our portfolio including CSDs and single-serve coffee take effect early next year. Our focus on productivity and cost discipline continued to ratchet up in Q3. These elements help to support gross and operating margin expansion. As a result, consolidated operating income grew in the high single digits, and EPS grew 6%, consistent with our plan. We are focused on near-term delivery while also truly orienting our business towards the long term. Our strategy provides a roadmap for achieving strong and consistent results over a multiyear time frame, and we aim to incrementally advance our strategic pillars each and every quarter. Let me discuss our latest progress. I\u2019ll start with consumer-obsessed brand building. Our consumer-centric scorecards include awareness, household penetration, loyalty and other classic brand-led metrics. And yet, how we ultimately measure success comes down to market share growth. In Q3, we gained share across each of our major product verticals, liquid refreshment beverages, K-Cup pods and brewers, and in each of our major markets, the United States, Mexico and Canada. We achieved this performance through a combination of exciting innovation and brand activity as well as strong commercial delivery. While our Q3 top line also reflected the impact of the softer consumer environment on certain category growth rates, our market share results are a good indicator that we are effectively stewarding our brands and controlling the controllables. Our second pillar, reshaping our now and next portfolio has been a major 2024 priority, primarily through our new Electrolit and La Colombe partnerships. Both brands continued to transition to our DSD network during the third quarter with a growing financial contribution. We are now able to more directly influence their marketplace performance and accordingly, our trends are accelerating with significant opportunity still ahead. Our just announced transaction with GHOST furthers our commitment to evolving towards high-growth areas. We will continuously shape our portfolio in the future, which will likely entail both brand additions and targeted pruning. Moving now to route to market. During the third quarter, we closed on and integrated our recently acquired assets in Arizona. The transition of coverage to our network went smoothly and was achieved in record time. We have now shifted our focus to ensuring the Arizona operations run as efficiently as possible and leverage the network benefits of being part of KDP. We also continue to opportunistically expand our distribution presence in other regions, including the recent tack-on of incremental territories in Tennessee. Our company-owned DSD network in Mexico is another focus area, given the vital competitive advantage it provides in a market with a sizable traditional trade. During the third quarter, we invested in expanding the systems coverage, selling routes and cooler penetration, all of which contributed to our strong relative trends. Turning now to our productivity and overhead disciplined work to generate fuel for growth. This is a priority in all environments, but it\u2019s particularly critical in the current moment. As such, we delivered strong savings during the third quarter with healthy productivity and the reemergence of SG&A overhead leverage for the first time in many quarters. We are now on track to exceed our cost savings goals for the year while also carrying a healthy pipeline of productivity and efficiency projects forward into 2025. Finally, our cash generation has strengthened, as expected in 2024, and we are dynamically allocating this cash flow to support multiple parallel priorities. Our capital deployment this year has thus far included capital expenditures to support our growth and productivity initiatives, a sizable share buyback near our stock\u2019s 52-week low, a 7% dividend increase announced in Q3, which marked our fourth consecutive annual raise, and now our pending acquisition of a 60% interest in GHOST. In other words, we are staying disciplined, being opportunistic when compelling options become available and managing across our capital allocation objectives, including our commitment to a resilient balance sheet. Let me now share some observations on our third quarter segment performance, starting with U.S. refreshment beverages. We saw a nice sequential acceleration in revenue growth, which increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter. Our volume/mix momentum built as we completed the distribution transition and significantly ramped display activity for Electrolit. We also delivered solid base business trends across our core brands. The consumer environment remains dynamic, which is having varying impacts across our portfolio. For instance, the carbonated soft drinks category is outperforming our expectations. CSDs have accessible price points and are supported by sophisticated revenue growth management capabilities, which make them well positioned to provide options for value-seeking consumers. At the same time, we are also winning in the category with a strong innovation and commercial programming slate that is driving healthy share trends. Our CSD performance was led by brand Dr Pepper, thanks in part to a very successful summertime LTO with creamy coconut as well as the continued build-out of our zero sugar line. We expect the brand\u2019s momentum and share gains to sustain, supported by a recent launch of the seventh season of our incredibly popular Fansville college football marketing campaign. Elsewhere in CSDs, Canada Dry Fruit Splash, the brand\u2019s most significant launch in years remains highly incremental to the franchise and is demonstrating the potential of this great brand. We\u2019re also stepping up support behind our iconic 7UP with a first-in-a-decade brand design refresh that debuted in Q3 and a limited time offering surely temple flavor that is just now rolling out and has been a hit on social media. Meanwhile, some still beverage categories remain under pressure, which we see as a reflection of the current consumer softness. This is particularly true for categories with a greater exposure to convenience stores and with higher average price per ounce products like ready-to-drink teas. In these categories, we must continue engaging consumers with compelling brand activity, while also appropriately emphasizing value at key price points. In other still beverages, we\u2019re seeing stronger trends. One example is our billion-dollar warehouse delivered MOTs brand, which has been an investment priority during 2024. During Q3, our back-to-school campaign, which highlighted fresh, minimally processed apples as a point of differentiation for MOTs, performed well, supporting top line growth and share gains for the brand. In total, we\u2019re pleased with the performance of the U.S. refreshment beverages segment in Q3, with notable progress made in scaling the Electrolit partnership and supporting our core portfolio. In U.S. coffee, we experienced a soft overall quarter. Market share momentum drove solid volume mix, but pricing realization was challenged due to persistent category promotions, which weighed on segment revenue and profitability. We\u2019re not satisfied with this outcome and are actively working to improve these trends even in the context of escalating inflation. At the same time, we\u2019re planning prudently regarding U.S. coffee\u2019s role in our near-term overall enterprise performance. The reality is that at-home coffee category consumption remains muted. However, within that, single-serve is outperforming, and within that, our brands are as well. But because the category\u2019s absolute growth rate is below the long-term trend, we are choosing to be judicious, and we\u2019re focusing on the elements within our control. Let me dive deeper into three such areas that, together, should result in improving revenue trends for the coffee segment over time. First, we have good pod market share momentum. Our three-pronged strategy focused on affordability, premiumization and cold coffee translated into further meaningful owned and licensed share momentum in the quarter. We saw strength across both Green Mountain and the original doughnut shop, including particular traction and incrementality from our new line of refreshers \u2013 which we are building into a distinct single-serve platform. At the same time, we are attracting new brands into the Keurig ecosystem, including the recent addition of Black Rifle K-Cup pods, which began to scale in our network during Q3. Taken together, our favorable owned and licensed market share trends and new partnerships position us for a stronger set of financial outcomes as the category recovers. Second, brewer trends continue to move in the right direction. In Q3, we drove strong double-digit growth in brewer shipments. While quarterly trends are inherently lumpy, the coffee maker category has returned to more stable footing and Keurig and Keurig-compatible brewers are gaining significant share. This speaks to our ongoing appeal among coffee-consuming households and should be supportive of future pod consumption. Looking out to the important holiday season, we\u2019re well positioned with excellent retailer and consumer feedback for Kay Brew and Chill in the early days of our launch and good momentum behind our entry-priced models. Third, while not yet evident in category trends or our results, we are encouraged by recent category pricing in response to escalating inflation. The competitive environment in the third quarter was notably promotional as in the first half, and we do not expect any immediate easing in Q4. However, industry pricing should build over the coming quarters given recently announced competitor price increases as well as our early 2025 single-serve increase. Even with an anticipated elasticity impact and some related volume trade-off, we\u2019d expect this to result in a healthier overall revenue trend. All in, though the path ahead will likely come with some quarter-to-quarter variability, we continue to see traction across our U.S. coffee segment. As long as the at-home coffee category remains soft, we will continue to plan with restraint, all while positioning Keurig and our assortment of brands to win longer-term. In other words, we are playing the long-game by driving high-quality innovation and marketing and attracting new brands into the Keurig ecosystem. Turning now to international. We delivered another quarter of good performance, with constant currency net sales growth nearing the high single digits. We drove gains across multiple regions and categories. In Mexico, market share grew in almost every category in which we operate, reflecting productive brand-building activity and DSD investments bearing fruit. We often talk about the success of our powerhouse, Penafiel brand. Which maintained its trajectory in Q3, but Squirt\u2019s performance was also notable. The brand recently achieved a significant milestone becoming the number two flavored CSD in Mexico, and it is a great example of another iconic KDP brand with local traction and momentum. Our cold beverages performance in Canada was also robust, led by growth in Canada Dry and Dr Pepper as well as continued strength in our low- and no-alcohol portfolio. In international coffee, as in the U.S., our three-pronged strategy helped to drive market share gains across both brewers and pods. Overall, we feel great about our international momentum and with ongoing investment, expect this segment to remain an outsized growth driver for KDP. In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our team\u2019s strong execution in what remains a dynamic operating environment. We are on track and focused on closing out the year strong while pushing ahead on key strategic initiatives and setting the stage for healthy, consistent financial performance beyond 2024. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call to Sudhanshu.\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid quarter with operational discipline driving strong OI growth and accelerating cash generation. We are on track to a strong finish to 2024 while also making important strategic progress like today\u2019s announced transaction with GHOST. The actions we are taking to support base momentum and enhance our portfolio help reinforce visibility to consistent performance in the years ahead. Third quarter net sales grew 3.1% in constant currency. U.S. refresh and beverages top line accelerated, U.S. Coffee posted a soft quarter and international growth remained healthy. I will discuss each segment in more detail shortly. On a consolidated basis, volume/mix was the primary sales driver, a strengthening to a 3.5% gain. We grew share across our portfolio and also benefited from a building contribution from new partnerships. Net price realization declined 0.4%. Pricing was positive across most of the business with pressure confined to U.S. coffee. We expect consolidated pricing to turn positive once again in quarter four. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points versus prior year. This reflected good productivity delivery and a performance incentive from C4, which contributed approximately 50 basis points of expansion. SG&A also leveraged 80 basis points as the lean overhead discipline we are embedding across the organization is beginning to more meaningfully benefit results. This will remain a focus area going forward. All in, operating margins expanded 110 basis points and operating income grew 7.5%. Inclusive of a net headwind below the line, EPS grew a solid 6%, consistent with our plan. Moving to the segments. U.S. refreshment Beverages net sales grew 5.3%, accelerating from a low single-digit rate in quarter two. Volume/mix led the way, up 4%, including a growing contribution from Electrolit as volume fully transition to our DSD network. Our base business trends also strengthened, led by our CSD portfolio. Pricing contributed 1.3% to the top line, reflecting favorable price realization in CSDs and targeted value investments in parts of the still beverages portfolio. We expect segment net sales growth to improve further in quarter four, reflecting a healthy partnership contribution and base business trend. Segment operating income grew 6.8%, with 40 basis points of margin expansion. The improvement was driven by our net sales momentum, productivity and the C4 performance incentive. This was partially offset by cost inflation across key inputs. In U.S. coffee, net revenue and operating income declined 3.6% and 7.2%, respectively. Obviously, we are not pleased with these results, but this performance deserves greater context. Despite a still muted coffee category, we drove improving volume/mix in the third quarter with 2.7% growth. This was comprised of flattish pods and 14% growth in brewer shipments. We enjoyed good market share momentum across both product lines, thanks to strong innovation and retail execution. This market share trend should sustain in quarter four as we continue to benefit from our 3 strategic focus areas of affordability, premiumization and cold coffee. Third quarter pricing was soft, declining 6.3%. We lapped a challenging year ago pricing competition, and like in the first half, continued to respond to industry promotions, which remained at odds with coffee commodity moves. We do not expect the competitive picture to moderate immediately, but our comparisons get easier starting in quarter four. In addition, we just announced a price increase due to take effect early in the next year. As is typical, there will likely be an elasticity impact as industry pricing is implemented. As Tim said, we will manage the business for overall revenue dollars, which we expect to reflect the combination of good market share and more favorable pricing. Shifting to the segment operating income decrease in quarter three. We generated a strong productivity savings, but these were more than offset by the net price decline. Though Q4 operating income is likely to once again be pressured given the return of commodity cost inflation, our team is focused on 2 major levers to improve the trend into next year. Price increases and modulating promotions will be one significant driver, and productivity, network optimization and broader cost controls will be the other important enabler. Our discipline across both is getting stronger, and we are revving our productivity engines, which gives us optimism looking out to 2025. International constant currency net sales grew 6.5% or 0.4% on a reported basis. Top line growth was balanced, with volume/mix increasing 3.1% and net price realization adding another 3.4%. Our growth was strong in absolute terms, and also came against a tough year ago comparison. During quarter three, our local execution was exceptional, driving market share gains in our major categories and markets. International top line growth should accelerate in quarter four as our market share outperformance sustains and comparisons begin to ease. Beyond this year, we have exciting plans to continue to capture the significant long-term growth opportunity we see for this segment. International segment operating income advanced meaningfully in the quarter, growing 16.6% in constant currency. The strong bottom line result was driven by net pricing and productivity. This more than offset continued inflationary pressures and help fund incremental marketing. Moving to the balance sheet, cash flow and capital allocation. In the third quarter, we generated more than $500 million in free cash flow. Consistent with our expectations, free cash flow dollars and conversion are improving. We remain on track for a meaningful step-up in full year cash flow compared to prior year. The accelerating cash flow profile is supporting our ability to advance multiple capital allocation priorities. GHOST will enhance our presence in an attractive white space category. By utilizing a thoughtful restructure, we are setting up to deliver compelling multi-year financial returns. We are doing so while aligning incentives and ensuring our balance sheet remains resilient post the transaction. In quarter three, we also announced a 7% dividend increase, marking KDP\u2019s fourth consecutive year of dividend growth and underscoring our commitment to direct shareholder returns. Turning now to our 2024 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net sales and high single-digit EPS growth. Our full year 2024 outlook also embeds the following below-the-line assumptions: Interest expense in a range of $615 million to $625 million, an effective tax rate in a 22% to 23% range, and approximately $1.37 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. When it comes to quarter four, we are focused on delivering a strong top line result, driven by solid base momentum, including improved net price realization and a continued healthy contribution from recent partnerships. Though revenue growth is expected to accelerate and our productivity bias will remain strong, our margin progress is likely to pause this quarter. This is because inflation is slated to become a bigger factor in quarter four, while the benefits of just announced pricing do not kick in until early 2025. We also expect a modest FX translation headwind to both top and bottom line. In closing, we are pleased with our overall performance in quarter three. In an uneven operating environment, we are focused on executing our plans over the balance of the year, emphasizing Q4 delivery, advancing our strategic pillars and actively planning for another year of consistent performance in 2025. I will now pass on to Tim to wrap with some brief remarks about next year.\nTim Cofer: Thanks, Sudhanshu. Before we move to Q&A, I want to leave you with a few closing thoughts. First and foremost, we are laser-focused on finishing 2024 on a strong note. At the same time, similar to many of you, our internal attention is increasingly shifting to 2025. While it\u2019s premature to provide an exact outlook, I can share a few preliminary thoughts. As we build our 2025 plan, we see considerable opportunity and also some risk. On the one hand, the operating environment remains subdued, with no immediate signs of relief for stretched consumers. Pockets of escalating inflationary pressure are necessitating industry pricing, but because consumer health is varied, the elasticity impact is uncertain. On the other hand, our strategic progress in 2024 will provide long-tailed benefits in 2025. We have strong innovation and commercial plans across our brands, the benefit of continued portfolio evolution and expanded route-to-market capabilities and greater productivity and cost discipline taking hold across the company. We will also have added top line flexibility from GHOST, which will enable us to plan judiciously in the case of coffee, and to push ahead on other portfolio optimization opportunities, all while delivering consistently. Put another way, as we see it today, the various puts and takes into 2025 appear fairly balanced. Together, we expect them to support another year of performance within our long-term algorithm. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the environment and refine our assumptions and will share official 2025 guidance during our next earnings cycle. Thank you for the time, and we\u2019re now happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi guys. Good morning. Congrats. Can we maybe talk more about how the portfolio works together in energy? And maybe specifically C4 and GHOST, but also with Black Rifle and some of the other things that you have been doing, just how is the whole meant to work, or is there any concern of the blurring of lines between some of these categories?\nTim Cofer: Yes. Good morning Kaumil. I could certainly speak to that. As you look at energy, we continue to believe energy is one of the most attractive categories within total LRB, large, consistently fastest growing over the last many years. I think what we are starting to see is as that category matures, it\u2019s evolving to serve distinct consumer need states and occasions, and we believe that, that landscape lends itself well to a portfolio approach. And that\u2019s what we are pursuing with today\u2019s announcement is a collection of brands that work in complementary ways to address different consumer needs and different occasions while obviously generating scale that will benefit our DSD system. So, if you think about it, step back just 2 years ago, KDP basically had very little, if any, presence in the energy category. As a result of today\u2019s announcement, primarily around GHOST, but also around Bloom, we now have a portfolio of four to five material brands in the category that will allow us to establish a multifaceted energy platform. Very quickly on each one to your question, as you look at C4, Doss Cunningham has done a great job of establishing a strong performance-based positioning with products that really provide functional efficacy, targeted largely at gym and fitness occasions and everyday energy. It\u2019s also, from a consumer standpoint tends to be more male and skewing a little bit millennial. Then you get to GHOST. GHOST has a more lifestyle positioning, bold flavor forward products, popular with gamers, social settings and increasingly a business that lends itself to on-prem, on-premise, including occasions like music festivals. Also a slightly more balanced male, female split, a little bit more Gen Z and a real growing authority in zero sugar. In fact, recent data would suggest 6 of the top 30 SKUs in zero sugar are from GHOST. Then you get to Black Rifle, a recently announced partnership with Black Rifle. This brand will serve consumers seeking more mainstream energy products as well as those looking for coffee energy hybrids and obviously, the chance to leverage that strong coffee brand with that target. And then finally, the other news of today Bloom, clearly more female-oriented, early days, but highly promising. And as you heard, we just signed on to distribute that business nationwide after really a very successful launch at Target this summer. So, we feel great about this portfolio approach. It\u2019s a big step forward for KDP. The energy category is more sophisticated, and we think this approach will serve us well in the years to come.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.\nBrett Cooper: Good morning. Another question for you on the GHOST transaction, the brand has been able to get to about a 3% share in the beer distribution network, there is some stuff there. So, can you talk about what KDP brings to the table that can step change that, maybe offering past examples? And then on the other side of that, can you speak to and maybe quantify the scale benefit it brings to your business in the C-store channel, and the impact that can have on the total portfolio over the long-term? Again, any tangible examples would be helpful. Thanks.\nTim Cofer: Yes, absolutely. I think the best example of what KDP can bring to GHOST and why this today\u2019s announcement and acquisition, I think has tremendous logic and benefit is really what we have done in the last couple of years with Doss, Nutrabolt and C4. In less than 2 years, we have effectively doubled the business on C4 together. We have increased market share by more than a point. We have essentially doubled TDPs, total distribution points, in particular, in C-stores and UDS, which as you well know, is critical for energy. With the power of KDP DSD, we have almost tripled display activity, and we have by orders of magnitude, increased cold drink assets. So, I think when you are looking for specifics, there is a number of specifics there. We know energy now well, and I think we have a proven playbook that we have executed with C4 that we believe we can replicate with GHOST. Beyond that, I think there is other elements that we bring to this partnership that can be powerful and a real win-win. Obviously, things like R&D capabilities, innovation capabilities, marketing strength, our commercial teams, our GM skill sets, connections and top to tops, obviously, with our customers in building out the doors, price pack architecture. And then over time, I think a lot of synergies as well from the procurement side, certainly manufacturing long-term, there is quite a few cost synergies that we can think about. So, overall, I feel good about our model, the strong momentum that we have with Dawson C4 and our ability to replicate this once again with GHOST. And I think the last part of your question, no doubt this will help drive the total KDP DSD flywheel. When you look at what we have done here over the last few years, say the last 3 years, we have gone at C-store in particular, from about a 7 share to approaching a 10 share across total LRB. C-store is obviously critical for the Energy segment. And with the addition of GHOST, that will probably add close to 20% additional scale in small format to KDP\u2019s footprint. And obviously, that drives the entire DSD flywheel and economics.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey. Good morning. Tim, you spent a lot of time on your plans in the Coffee segment. And obviously, there is a lot occurring from an industry standpoint here. Just wanted to get your perspective, it does sound like you have taken a step back in terms of what you assume from an industry perspective in coffee. How durable do you think that is as you look out? And then given some of the company initiatives you mentioned that are paying off in terms of your market share picking up, brewers picking up, do you think that you can offset some of those industry headwinds? Are you looking at a pace of organic sales growth that\u2019s similar to long-term trend as you look out over the next year or 2 year s? And how do you think about that? And then second, just on profitability. Once pricing goes into place, do you think you can start to expand year-over-year margins again in the Coffee segment, or with some of the cost pressures and industry top line headwinds, that\u2019s more uncertain? Just how you think about those things going forward would be helpful.\nTim Cofer: Okay. Thanks Dara. Yes, I will start on that, and I will kick it over to Sudhanshu to speak to the last part of your question on margin for next year. Dara, I will start. I said it before, I am going to say it again. We are bullish on coffee\u2019s long-term prospects. I think the structural tailwinds are intact. We are bullish on this category, ubiquitous, right, regular consumption. The most consumed beverage aside from water on the planet, addressing a critical need for energy and alertness. So, we are bullish long-term. No doubt, at-home coffee category performance has been sluggish, and it is taking longer to recover than we have planned and anticipated. Having said that, what we are doing is focusing on what we can control. And I think the encouraging signs are, within at-home coffee, which overall is sluggish, the single-serve category continues to outperform. And within the single-serve category, our brands continue to outperform. So, for us, and you said it in your question, we are planning prudently when it comes to the category recovery. That\u2019s inclusive of Q4 in terms of year to go and our \u2013 affirmation of our guide on the year, so we are planning prudently in Q4. And as we look ahead to \u201825, you heard me give some preliminary commentary on \u201825. We are planning prudently, but we are continuing to execute, I think a strategy that we believe is working and I have talked before, I won\u2019t drain it, affordability, premiumization, cold coffee, those three vectors, we think are working. We have plans against it. We are encouraged by our results. Evidence of that are market share gains you are seeing in both pods and brewers and an improving trend in \u201824 versus \u201823. The new dynamic now is the green coffee increase in cost. And to your question, what that means for us is we intend to manage the business for overall revenue dollars in the near-term, as you would expect, in an inflationary environment. So, as I shared in my prepared remarks, we have announced the pricing that will go into effect in early \u201825. Obviously, there will be an elasticity impact as is usually the case. But this should translate to a healthier top line trend as well as continued good market share as we go into 2025. And then maybe, Sudhanshu, do you want to margin.\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Thanks Tim. Hey Dara. So, as you know, we indicated consistently that our plan for U.S. coffee margin in \u201824 was skewed to a first half that are mainly driven by the timing of green coffee cost impacting our P&L because we had six months to nine months. And as you have seen, this cadence has generally played out consistently with our expectation of our first half margin expanded nicely, and then margins started to come under pressure versus last year in quarter three, which we expect will continue in quarter four. Now if you look at 2025, we expect coffee inflation to continue to ramp. We will look to offset with pricing that is going into market early in the year, as just Tim said. And we will \u2013 also will have heightened focus on productivity and other expense discipline. As it is typical inflationary environment, our plan is to manage for operating profit growth and not the margin percentages. However, as inflation normalizes, we continue to see opportunity to rebuild segment margin on a multiyear basis and our focus on delivering that outcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning. I have one quick follow-up on Dara\u2019s question just around coffee. Do you have any shipment timing impacts from storms in the quarter, cost came in a bit below consumption, and I would just love your thoughts on that. Obviously, less material over the long-term, but perhaps if there is any caveats there, I would be curious. And then really, Tim, you have been going through portfolio. You have some comments on portfolio optimization. Over time, clearly, you have been adding some faster growth assets, but the business has not done a whole lot of pruning. So, how does this all come together as you look out over the next 1 year to 2 years and you think about the type of portfolio that you are really trying to create and some of the avenues that adding some of this volume, scale and energy and Electrolit allow you to do on maybe some of the areas that are not growing quite efficiently or quickly? Thanks.\nTim Cofer: Yes, Chris. Thank you. On the first one, here is what I would say. Look, the hurricanes came right at the end of the quarter, literally in the last few days, and it didn\u2019t help, alright. We saw an impact. We actually had a significant facility as well in \u2013 right in the hurricanes path that got wiped out temporarily. And we are putting it back together. So, it didn\u2019t help. We are not going to give you a number, but that certainly didn\u2019t help our quarter and close in Q3, particularly on the coffee side. To your other question on portfolio optimization, I would say, look, any good company continuously shapes their portfolio, and that means adding good on top end and cleaning house as appropriate. And when you do that well and consistently, you drive a more efficient total network from procurement, raw materials through the manufacturing, supply chain, distribution operations. And I think part of our approach here is really assessing our existing portfolio holistically and now deciding which categories and brands do we really want to emphasize. And within the categories and brands, which SKUs. And when you do that that does open the door to network optimization and really DSD optimization. Now, when you do that, it also can come with a net sales trade-off. But the long-term, and I have seen it many times in my career, is a faster-growing portfolio operating at higher service levels and operating at a more attractive cost structure. If you think about KDP, you know we are still a relatively young company. And if you think about the last 5 years to 6 years, first things first, it was around integrating these two companies, doing a great job on synergy capture, then we hit that whole COVID pandemic. And so we are now at a point, especially when you add a great new brand like GHOST where we can take the opportunity to refocus on portfolio optimization. And so you are going to hear us talk more about it. I referenced it in today\u2019s remarks. And I think it\u2019s particularly true on U.S. refreshment beverage. So, we are actively working. We are scoping and sizing the potential as we speak. We will share more details over time. But no doubt, when you add a high-growth focused asset like GHOST in an attractive category like energy, that \u2013 and I said it in my remarks, that gives us some top line flexibility going into \u201825 to make some tough choices on portfolio optimization that over the long-term, I think will really yield fruit both on the top line growth and on the margin.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: You kind of \u2013 two things, first of all, congratulations on both GHOST and Bloom, they are terrific brands. You kind of win at this a little bit, but obviously, there is a bit of a concern. You can hear from investors and else on the call about whether you are kind of doing too much at the same time and whether the system can handle it all, and not just in terms of energy, but you got Electrolit, there is a lot going on, you talked about pruning things. But maybe if you could talk a little bit about your infrastructure capabilities, what you have in terms of warehouses, logistics, IT systems and the investments that you have done over the last number of years to be able to handle increased complexity. And then just more of an execution issue, any comments on plans to transition from the Anheuser-Busch distribution system to yours for GHOST and kind of roughly how long you expect that to take? Thanks.\nTim Cofer: Thanks Robert. I think a little bit to your preface. We spoke about this a little bit, but let me try to unpack it a little bit more. In short, I think we are well prepared and well positioned to take on the new growth vector with GHOST. I think evidence of that is what you have seen us do the last couple of years. C4, I gave a lot of stats earlier to one of the earlier questions on our success with C4. Electrolit has been a very smooth and successful transition this year. We have an incredible relationship with Electrolit management and the family at Grupo PiSA. I was actually there a few months ago talking about the transition. And I think they and we are very pleased with that handover and that transition. You are seeing the good early results, and you will see more next year. We have had a very successful sell-in into 2025 resets on Electrolit. I think the KDP DSD system is showing its resilience. In fact I met with our DSD leadership team the last couple of days here in Frisco headquarters, and they are feeling very bullish about what we are doing on C4 and Electrolit. And I know their \u2013 I told them for all the right reasons, obviously, didn\u2019t share the news of this morning. Until this morning, I told him to call in and listen and I know they are listening right now. They are really excited about seeing the flywheel of KDP accelerate, particularly in C-stores. So, from an infrastructure standpoint, from an investment standpoint, to your point, in our branches, in our DCs and our warehouses, you have seen that investment take hold. You have seen us also get acquisitive around territories, which is I think another proof point of our confidence in DSD. We will look at what you see in Arizona, I mentioned a new smaller territory in Tennessee we just took, and then there is some broader bigger news that may follow in \u201825 that\u2019s out in the public domain. So, we have got really a strong commercial skill set with our partners. I think that\u2019s why we are a preferred partner in the industry. And we feel good overall about our ability to digest these. At the end of your question, you referenced AVI, yes. And no doubt, AVI is GHOST current distribution partner. Our expectation is we will begin to transition the distribution in mid-2025. This is consistent with the six-month termination notice that\u2019s required. After that, we will resume \u2013 assume responsibility for all the distribution and work within KDP DSD and, in some select cases, partner distributors to ensure that GHOST is available everywhere.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jane Gelfand for any closing remarks.\nJane Gelfand: Thank you, Betsy and thank you everyone for participating. We are going to try to keep you on time given multiple competing earnings. We do appreciate your support and IR will be available all day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you again and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Sudhanshu Priyadarshi",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid quarter with operational discipline driving strong OI growth and accelerating cash generation. We are on track to a strong finish to 2024 while also making important strategic progress like today's announced transaction with GHOST. The actions we are taking to support base momentum and enhance our portfolio help reinforce visibility to consistent performance in the years ahead. Third quarter net sales grew 3.1% in constant currency. U.S. refresh and beverages top line accelerated, U.S. Coffee posted a soft quarter and international growth remained healthy. I will discuss each segment in more detail shortly. On a consolidated basis, volume/mix was the primary sales driver, a strengthening to a 3.5% gain. We grew share across our portfolio and also benefited from a building contribution from new partnerships. Net price realization declined 0.4%. Pricing was positive across most of the business with pressure confined to U.S. coffee. We expect consolidated pricing to turn positive once again in quarter four. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points versus prior year. This reflected good productivity delivery and a performance incentive from C4, which contributed approximately 50 basis points of expansion. SG&A also leveraged 80 basis points as the lean overhead discipline we are embedding across the organization is beginning to more meaningfully benefit results. This will remain a focus area going forward. All in, operating margins expanded 110 basis points and operating income grew 7.5%. Inclusive of a net headwind below the line, EPS grew a solid 6%, consistent with our plan. Moving to the segments. U.S. refreshment Beverages net sales grew 5.3%, accelerating from a low single-digit rate in quarter two. Volume/mix led the way, up 4%, including a growing contribution from Electrolit as volume fully transition to our DSD network. Our base business trends also strengthened, led by our CSD portfolio. Pricing contributed 1.3% to the top line, reflecting favorable price realization in CSDs and targeted value investments in parts of the still beverages portfolio. We expect segment net sales growth to improve further in quarter four, reflecting a healthy partnership contribution and base business trend. Segment operating income grew 6.8%, with 40 basis points of margin expansion. The improvement was driven by our net sales momentum, productivity and the C4 performance incentive. This was partially offset by cost inflation across key inputs. In U.S. coffee, net revenue and operating income declined 3.6% and 7.2%, respectively. Obviously, we are not pleased with these results, but this performance deserves greater context. Despite a still muted coffee category, we drove improving volume/mix in the third quarter with 2.7% growth. This was comprised of flattish pods and 14% growth in brewer shipments. We enjoyed good market share momentum across both product lines, thanks to strong innovation and retail execution. This market share trend should sustain in quarter four as we continue to benefit from our 3 strategic focus areas of affordability, premiumization and cold coffee. Third quarter pricing was soft, declining 6.3%. We lapped a challenging year ago pricing competition, and like in the first half, continued to respond to industry promotions, which remained at odds with coffee commodity moves. We do not expect the competitive picture to moderate immediately, but our comparisons get easier starting in quarter four. In addition, we just announced a price increase due to take effect early in the next year. As is typical, there will likely be an elasticity impact as industry pricing is implemented. As Tim said, we will manage the business for overall revenue dollars, which we expect to reflect the combination of good market share and more favorable pricing. Shifting to the segment operating income decrease in quarter three. We generated a strong productivity savings, but these were more than offset by the net price decline. Though Q4 operating income is likely to once again be pressured given the return of commodity cost inflation, our team is focused on 2 major levers to improve the trend into next year. Price increases and modulating promotions will be one significant driver, and productivity, network optimization and broader cost controls will be the other important enabler. Our discipline across both is getting stronger, and we are revving our productivity engines, which gives us optimism looking out to 2025. International constant currency net sales grew 6.5% or 0.4% on a reported basis. Top line growth was balanced, with volume/mix increasing 3.1% and net price realization adding another 3.4%. Our growth was strong in absolute terms, and also came against a tough year ago comparison. During quarter three, our local execution was exceptional, driving market share gains in our major categories and markets. International top line growth should accelerate in quarter four as our market share outperformance sustains and comparisons begin to ease. Beyond this year, we have exciting plans to continue to capture the significant long-term growth opportunity we see for this segment. International segment operating income advanced meaningfully in the quarter, growing 16.6% in constant currency. The strong bottom line result was driven by net pricing and productivity. This more than offset continued inflationary pressures and help fund incremental marketing. Moving to the balance sheet, cash flow and capital allocation. In the third quarter, we generated more than $500 million in free cash flow. Consistent with our expectations, free cash flow dollars and conversion are improving. We remain on track for a meaningful step-up in full year cash flow compared to prior year. The accelerating cash flow profile is supporting our ability to advance multiple capital allocation priorities. GHOST will enhance our presence in an attractive white space category. By utilizing a thoughtful restructure, we are setting up to deliver compelling multi-year financial returns. We are doing so while aligning incentives and ensuring our balance sheet remains resilient post the transaction. In quarter three, we also announced a 7% dividend increase, marking KDP's fourth consecutive year of dividend growth and underscoring our commitment to direct shareholder returns. Turning now to our 2024 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net sales and high single-digit EPS growth. Our full year 2024 outlook also embeds the following below-the-line assumptions: Interest expense in a range of $615 million to $625 million, an effective tax rate in a 22% to 23% range, and approximately $1.37 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. When it comes to quarter four, we are focused on delivering a strong top line result, driven by solid base momentum, including improved net price realization and a continued healthy contribution from recent partnerships. Though revenue growth is expected to accelerate and our productivity bias will remain strong, our margin progress is likely to pause this quarter. This is because inflation is slated to become a bigger factor in quarter four, while the benefits of just announced pricing do not kick in until early 2025. We also expect a modest FX translation headwind to both top and bottom line. In closing, we are pleased with our overall performance in quarter three. In an uneven operating environment, we are focused on executing our plans over the balance of the year, emphasizing Q4 delivery, advancing our strategic pillars and actively planning for another year of consistent performance in 2025. I will now pass on to Tim to wrap with some brief remarks about next year. Thanks Tim. Hey Dara.

            "name": "Tim Cofer",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. Our solid 2024 year-to-date performance demonstrates KDP's resiliency and flexibility. This morning, we reaffirmed our full year outlook despite an uneven operating environment. And we are targeting a strong finish to the year in Q4. Simultaneously, we are making good progress against our long-term strategy, laying the groundwork for multiyear success. Now, before covering our quarterly results, I want to highlight the just announced GHOST deal as yet another example of how we are enhancing our portfolio while exercising capital discipline. We have reached an agreement to purchase a majority stake in GHOST this year to be followed by the acquisition of the remainder of the business in the first half of \u201828. This transaction strengthens our position in the attractive energy drink category and accelerates our portfolio evolution towards consumer preferred and growth accretive spaces. GHOST is young, versatile and founder-led, with approximately $0.5 billion portfolio anchored by its leading energy drink while also spanning supplements and an emerging presence in other LRB categories. The brand more than quadrupled in size over the last 3 years and remains one of the fastest-growing in the energy category, thanks to its unique brand identity, distinctive flavors and packaging, cross-occasion appeal and strong consumer engagement, including on-premise. GHOST will complement KDP's existing energy portfolio and substantially enhance our presence in the category. We see significant potential to further scale GHOST in collaboration with its founders, Dan Lorenzo and Ryan Hughes, who will continue to lead the brand as part of KDP's U.S. refreshment beverages unit. I've been very impressed with Dan and Ryan and their tremendous success to-date. More importantly, I share their vision for strong growth in the years to come. Together, we plan to take GHOST to new heights as we build out KDP's platform-based approach to the energy category. Now at $23 billion in size, energy remains one of the fastest-growing scaled categories in beverages and enjoys multiple structural growth characteristics. These beverages satisfy a near universal consumer need for energy and alertness, which is increasingly relevant in a world with significant demands on our time and attention. They appeal to consumers across all ages and demographics, including over-indexing to GenZennials. There is significant headroom for household penetration to grow versus other leading beverage categories. And the category is still in the development stage of price pack architecture and channel diversity. All of these elements translate to a large total addressable market that we believe the category will grow into and on which KDP is well positioned to capitalize. As energy drink consumption becomes more prevalent, the category is evolving to serve distinct consumer need states and occasions. This landscape lends itself nicely to a portfolio approach, which we have successfully employed in premium water to become the number two share player. We're now using a similar playbook in energy, having accelerated our push into the category over the last 24 months with C4, GHOST and Black Rifle Energy. In addition to today's Ghost announcement, we just signed a distribution agreement with Nutrabolt for Bloom ready-to-drink energy. Bloom is a highly promising emerging and distinctive beverage brand with a female-oriented SKU. Together, each of these brands can work in complementary ways to address consumer needs while driving greater scale in the category and across our DSD infrastructure. Beyond its strategic merits, the GHOST transaction is another good example of how we approach efficient capital deployment. Through an elegant deal structure, we are capturing the growth opportunity and paving the way for compelling financial returns while retaining manageable balance sheet leverage and aligning long-term incentives. Our chosen structure retains GHOST leadership team, reinforcing a unique element of KDP's white space expansion strategy, our founder network. We work to keep visionary entrepreneurs at the helm of the brands they created while adding substantial scale and resources from KDP. In energy drinks, we've seen the value of this arrangement firsthand through our close relationship with Nutrabolt's innovative leader, Doss Cunningham. With alignment and support from energy leaders like Doss, Dan and Ryan of GHOST and others, we are building a formidable energy platform that will drive win-win outcomes for all involved. Let's now move to our third quarter results. Constant currency net sales grew 3.1%. We made solid progress on volume/mix with 3.5% growth in Q3. As anticipated, U.S. refreshment beverages momentum strengthened considerably U.S. coffee volume mix grew nicely and international trends remained healthy. Total KDP net price was a source of modest pressure in Q3. We expect sequential improvement in Q4 and a further step-up into 2025 as recently announced pricing actions across meaningful parts of our portfolio including CSDs and single-serve coffee take effect early next year. Our focus on productivity and cost discipline continued to ratchet up in Q3. These elements help to support gross and operating margin expansion. As a result, consolidated operating income grew in the high single digits, and EPS grew 6%, consistent with our plan. We are focused on near-term delivery while also truly orienting our business towards the long term. Our strategy provides a roadmap for achieving strong and consistent results over a multiyear time frame, and we aim to incrementally advance our strategic pillars each and every quarter. Let me discuss our latest progress. I'll start with consumer-obsessed brand building. Our consumer-centric scorecards include awareness, household penetration, loyalty and other classic brand-led metrics. And yet, how we ultimately measure success comes down to market share growth. In Q3, we gained share across each of our major product verticals, liquid refreshment beverages, K-Cup pods and brewers, and in each of our major markets, the United States, Mexico and Canada. We achieved this performance through a combination of exciting innovation and brand activity as well as strong commercial delivery. While our Q3 top line also reflected the impact of the softer consumer environment on certain category growth rates, our market share results are a good indicator that we are effectively stewarding our brands and controlling the controllables. Our second pillar, reshaping our now and next portfolio has been a major 2024 priority, primarily through our new Electrolit and La Colombe partnerships. Both brands continued to transition to our DSD network during the third quarter with a growing financial contribution. We are now able to more directly influence their marketplace performance and accordingly, our trends are accelerating with significant opportunity still ahead. Our just announced transaction with GHOST furthers our commitment to evolving towards high-growth areas. We will continuously shape our portfolio in the future, which will likely entail both brand additions and targeted pruning. Moving now to route to market. During the third quarter, we closed on and integrated our recently acquired assets in Arizona. The transition of coverage to our network went smoothly and was achieved in record time. We have now shifted our focus to ensuring the Arizona operations run as efficiently as possible and leverage the network benefits of being part of KDP. We also continue to opportunistically expand our distribution presence in other regions, including the recent tack-on of incremental territories in Tennessee. Our company-owned DSD network in Mexico is another focus area, given the vital competitive advantage it provides in a market with a sizable traditional trade. During the third quarter, we invested in expanding the systems coverage, selling routes and cooler penetration, all of which contributed to our strong relative trends. Turning now to our productivity and overhead disciplined work to generate fuel for growth. This is a priority in all environments, but it's particularly critical in the current moment. As such, we delivered strong savings during the third quarter with healthy productivity and the reemergence of SG&A overhead leverage for the first time in many quarters. We are now on track to exceed our cost savings goals for the year while also carrying a healthy pipeline of productivity and efficiency projects forward into 2025. Finally, our cash generation has strengthened, as expected in 2024, and we are dynamically allocating this cash flow to support multiple parallel priorities. Our capital deployment this year has thus far included capital expenditures to support our growth and productivity initiatives, a sizable share buyback near our stock's 52-week low, a 7% dividend increase announced in Q3, which marked our fourth consecutive annual raise, and now our pending acquisition of a 60% interest in GHOST. In other words, we are staying disciplined, being opportunistic when compelling options become available and managing across our capital allocation objectives, including our commitment to a resilient balance sheet. Let me now share some observations on our third quarter segment performance, starting with U.S. refreshment beverages. We saw a nice sequential acceleration in revenue growth, which increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter. Our volume/mix momentum built as we completed the distribution transition and significantly ramped display activity for Electrolit. We also delivered solid base business trends across our core brands. The consumer environment remains dynamic, which is having varying impacts across our portfolio. For instance, the carbonated soft drinks category is outperforming our expectations. CSDs have accessible price points and are supported by sophisticated revenue growth management capabilities, which make them well positioned to provide options for value-seeking consumers. At the same time, we are also winning in the category with a strong innovation and commercial programming slate that is driving healthy share trends. Our CSD performance was led by brand Dr Pepper, thanks in part to a very successful summertime LTO with creamy coconut as well as the continued build-out of our zero sugar line. We expect the brand's momentum and share gains to sustain, supported by a recent launch of the seventh season of our incredibly popular Fansville college football marketing campaign. Elsewhere in CSDs, Canada Dry Fruit Splash, the brand's most significant launch in years remains highly incremental to the franchise and is demonstrating the potential of this great brand. We're also stepping up support behind our iconic 7UP with a first-in-a-decade brand design refresh that debuted in Q3 and a limited time offering surely temple flavor that is just now rolling out and has been a hit on social media. Meanwhile, some still beverage categories remain under pressure, which we see as a reflection of the current consumer softness. This is particularly true for categories with a greater exposure to convenience stores and with higher average price per ounce products like ready-to-drink teas. In these categories, we must continue engaging consumers with compelling brand activity, while also appropriately emphasizing value at key price points. In other still beverages, we're seeing stronger trends. One example is our billion-dollar warehouse delivered MOTs brand, which has been an investment priority during 2024. During Q3, our back-to-school campaign, which highlighted fresh, minimally processed apples as a point of differentiation for MOTs, performed well, supporting top line growth and share gains for the brand. In total, we're pleased with the performance of the U.S. refreshment beverages segment in Q3, with notable progress made in scaling the Electrolit partnership and supporting our core portfolio. In U.S. coffee, we experienced a soft overall quarter. Market share momentum drove solid volume mix, but pricing realization was challenged due to persistent category promotions, which weighed on segment revenue and profitability. We're not satisfied with this outcome and are actively working to improve these trends even in the context of escalating inflation. At the same time, we're planning prudently regarding U.S. coffee's role in our near-term overall enterprise performance. The reality is that at-home coffee category consumption remains muted. However, within that, single-serve is outperforming, and within that, our brands are as well. But because the category's absolute growth rate is below the long-term trend, we are choosing to be judicious, and we're focusing on the elements within our control. Let me dive deeper into three such areas that, together, should result in improving revenue trends for the coffee segment over time. First, we have good pod market share momentum. Our three-pronged strategy focused on affordability, premiumization and cold coffee translated into further meaningful owned and licensed share momentum in the quarter. We saw strength across both Green Mountain and the original doughnut shop, including particular traction and incrementality from our new line of refreshers \u2013 which we are building into a distinct single-serve platform. At the same time, we are attracting new brands into the Keurig ecosystem, including the recent addition of Black Rifle K-Cup pods, which began to scale in our network during Q3. Taken together, our favorable owned and licensed market share trends and new partnerships position us for a stronger set of financial outcomes as the category recovers. Second, brewer trends continue to move in the right direction. In Q3, we drove strong double-digit growth in brewer shipments. While quarterly trends are inherently lumpy, the coffee maker category has returned to more stable footing and Keurig and Keurig-compatible brewers are gaining significant share. This speaks to our ongoing appeal among coffee-consuming households and should be supportive of future pod consumption. Looking out to the important holiday season, we're well positioned with excellent retailer and consumer feedback for Kay Brew and Chill in the early days of our launch and good momentum behind our entry-priced models. Third, while not yet evident in category trends or our results, we are encouraged by recent category pricing in response to escalating inflation. The competitive environment in the third quarter was notably promotional as in the first half, and we do not expect any immediate easing in Q4. However, industry pricing should build over the coming quarters given recently announced competitor price increases as well as our early 2025 single-serve increase. Even with an anticipated elasticity impact and some related volume trade-off, we'd expect this to result in a healthier overall revenue trend. All in, though the path ahead will likely come with some quarter-to-quarter variability, we continue to see traction across our U.S. coffee segment. As long as the at-home coffee category remains soft, we will continue to plan with restraint, all while positioning Keurig and our assortment of brands to win longer-term. In other words, we are playing the long-game by driving high-quality innovation and marketing and attracting new brands into the Keurig ecosystem. Turning now to international. We delivered another quarter of good performance, with constant currency net sales growth nearing the high single digits. We drove gains across multiple regions and categories. In Mexico, market share grew in almost every category in which we operate, reflecting productive brand-building activity and DSD investments bearing fruit. We often talk about the success of our powerhouse, Penafiel brand. Which maintained its trajectory in Q3, but Squirt's performance was also notable. The brand recently achieved a significant milestone becoming the number two flavored CSD in Mexico, and it is a great example of another iconic KDP brand with local traction and momentum. Our cold beverages performance in Canada was also robust, led by growth in Canada Dry and Dr Pepper as well as continued strength in our low- and no-alcohol portfolio. In international coffee, as in the U.S., our three-pronged strategy helped to drive market share gains across both brewers and pods. Overall, we feel great about our international momentum and with ongoing investment, expect this segment to remain an outsized growth driver for KDP. In closing, we're pleased with our team's strong execution in what remains a dynamic operating environment. We are on track and focused on closing out the year strong while pushing ahead on key strategic initiatives and setting the stage for healthy, consistent financial performance beyond 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call to Sudhanshu. Thanks, Sudhanshu. Before we move to Q&A, I want to leave you with a few closing thoughts. First and foremost, we are laser-focused on finishing 2024 on a strong note. At the same time, similar to many of you, our internal attention is increasingly shifting to 2025. While it's premature to provide an exact outlook, I can share a few preliminary thoughts. As we build our 2025 plan, we see considerable opportunity and also some risk. On the one hand, the operating environment remains subdued, with no immediate signs of relief for stretched consumers. Pockets of escalating inflationary pressure are necessitating industry pricing, but because consumer health is varied, the elasticity impact is uncertain. On the other hand, our strategic progress in 2024 will provide long-tailed benefits in 2025. We have strong innovation and commercial plans across our brands, the benefit of continued portfolio evolution and expanded route-to-market capabilities and greater productivity and cost discipline taking hold across the company. We will also have added top line flexibility from GHOST, which will enable us to plan judiciously in the case of coffee, and to push ahead on other portfolio optimization opportunities, all while delivering consistently. Put another way, as we see it today, the various puts and takes into 2025 appear fairly balanced. Together, we expect them to support another year of performance within our long-term algorithm. We'll continue to monitor the environment and refine our assumptions and will share official 2025 guidance during our next earnings cycle. Thank you for the time, and we're now happy to take your questions. Yes. Good morning Kaumil. I could certainly speak to that. As you look at energy, we continue to believe energy is one of the most attractive categories within total LRB, large, consistently fastest growing over the last many years. I think what we are starting to see is as that category matures, it's evolving to serve distinct consumer need states and occasions, and we believe that, that landscape lends itself well to a portfolio approach. And that's what we are pursuing with today's announcement is a collection of brands that work in complementary ways to address different consumer needs and different occasions while obviously generating scale that will benefit our DSD system. So, if you think about it, step back just 2 years ago, KDP basically had very little, if any, presence in the energy category. As a result of today's announcement, primarily around GHOST, but also around Bloom, we now have a portfolio of four to five material brands in the category that will allow us to establish a multifaceted energy platform. Very quickly on each one to your question, as you look at C4, Doss Cunningham has done a great job of establishing a strong performance-based positioning with products that really provide functional efficacy, targeted largely at gym and fitness occasions and everyday energy. It's also, from a consumer standpoint tends to be more male and skewing a little bit millennial. Then you get to GHOST. GHOST has a more lifestyle positioning, bold flavor forward products, popular with gamers, social settings and increasingly a business that lends itself to on-prem, on-premise, including occasions like music festivals. Also a slightly more balanced male, female split, a little bit more Gen Z and a real growing authority in zero sugar. In fact, recent data would suggest 6 of the top 30 SKUs in zero sugar are from GHOST. Then you get to Black Rifle, a recently announced partnership with Black Rifle. This brand will serve consumers seeking more mainstream energy products as well as those looking for coffee energy hybrids and obviously, the chance to leverage that strong coffee brand with that target. And then finally, the other news of today Bloom, clearly more female-oriented, early days, but highly promising. And as you heard, we just signed on to distribute that business nationwide after really a very successful launch at Target this summer. So, we feel great about this portfolio approach. It's a big step forward for KDP. The energy category is more sophisticated, and we think this approach will serve us well in the years to come. Yes, absolutely. I think the best example of what KDP can bring to GHOST and why this today's announcement and acquisition, I think has tremendous logic and benefit is really what we have done in the last couple of years with Doss, Nutrabolt and C4. In less than 2 years, we have effectively doubled the business on C4 together. We have increased market share by more than a point. We have essentially doubled TDPs, total distribution points, in particular, in C-stores and UDS, which as you well know, is critical for energy. With the power of KDP DSD, we have almost tripled display activity, and we have by orders of magnitude, increased cold drink assets. So, I think when you are looking for specifics, there is a number of specifics there. We know energy now well, and I think we have a proven playbook that we have executed with C4 that we believe we can replicate with GHOST. Beyond that, I think there is other elements that we bring to this partnership that can be powerful and a real win-win. Obviously, things like R&D capabilities, innovation capabilities, marketing strength, our commercial teams, our GM skill sets, connections and top to tops, obviously, with our customers in building out the doors, price pack architecture. And then over time, I think a lot of synergies as well from the procurement side, certainly manufacturing long-term, there is quite a few cost synergies that we can think about. So, overall, I feel good about our model, the strong momentum that we have with Dawson C4 and our ability to replicate this once again with GHOST. And I think the last part of your question, no doubt this will help drive the total KDP DSD flywheel. When you look at what we have done here over the last few years, say the last 3 years, we have gone at C-store in particular, from about a 7 share to approaching a 10 share across total LRB. C-store is obviously critical for the Energy segment. And with the addition of GHOST, that will probably add close to 20% additional scale in small format to KDP's footprint. And obviously, that drives the entire DSD flywheel and economics. Okay. Thanks Dara. Yes, I will start on that, and I will kick it over to Sudhanshu to speak to the last part of your question on margin for next year. Dara, I will start. I said it before, I am going to say it again. We are bullish on coffee's long-term prospects. I think the structural tailwinds are intact. We are bullish on this category, ubiquitous, right, regular consumption. The most consumed beverage aside from water on the planet, addressing a critical need for energy and alertness. So, we are bullish long-term. No doubt, at-home coffee category performance has been sluggish, and it is taking longer to recover than we have planned and anticipated. Having said that, what we are doing is focusing on what we can control. And I think the encouraging signs are, within at-home coffee, which overall is sluggish, the single-serve category continues to outperform. And within the single-serve category, our brands continue to outperform. So, for us, and you said it in your question, we are planning prudently when it comes to the category recovery. That's inclusive of Q4 in terms of year to go and our \u2013 affirmation of our guide on the year, so we are planning prudently in Q4. And as we look ahead to \u201825, you heard me give some preliminary commentary on \u201825. We are planning prudently, but we are continuing to execute, I think a strategy that we believe is working and I have talked before, I won't drain it, affordability, premiumization, cold coffee, those three vectors, we think are working. We have plans against it. We are encouraged by our results. Evidence of that are market share gains you are seeing in both pods and brewers and an improving trend in \u201824 versus \u201823. The new dynamic now is the green coffee increase in cost. And to your question, what that means for us is we intend to manage the business for overall revenue dollars in the near-term, as you would expect, in an inflationary environment. So, as I shared in my prepared remarks, we have announced the pricing that will go into effect in early \u201825. Obviously, there will be an elasticity impact as is usually the case. But this should translate to a healthier top line trend as well as continued good market share as we go into 2025. And then maybe, Sudhanshu, do you want to margin. Yes, Chris. Thank you. On the first one, here is what I would say. Look, the hurricanes came right at the end of the quarter, literally in the last few days, and it didn't help, alright. We saw an impact. We actually had a significant facility as well in \u2013 right in the hurricanes path that got wiped out temporarily. And we are putting it back together. So, it didn't help. We are not going to give you a number, but that certainly didn't help our quarter and close in Q3, particularly on the coffee side. To your other question on portfolio optimization, I would say, look, any good company continuously shapes their portfolio, and that means adding good on top end and cleaning house as appropriate. And when you do that well and consistently, you drive a more efficient total network from procurement, raw materials through the manufacturing, supply chain, distribution operations. And I think part of our approach here is really assessing our existing portfolio holistically and now deciding which categories and brands do we really want to emphasize. And within the categories and brands, which SKUs. And when you do that that does open the door to network optimization and really DSD optimization. Now, when you do that, it also can come with a net sales trade-off. But the long-term, and I have seen it many times in my career, is a faster-growing portfolio operating at higher service levels and operating at a more attractive cost structure. If you think about KDP, you know we are still a relatively young company. And if you think about the last 5 years to 6 years, first things first, it was around integrating these two companies, doing a great job on synergy capture, then we hit that whole COVID pandemic. And so we are now at a point, especially when you add a great new brand like GHOST where we can take the opportunity to refocus on portfolio optimization. And so you are going to hear us talk more about it. I referenced it in today's remarks. And I think it's particularly true on U.S. refreshment beverage. So, we are actively working. We are scoping and sizing the potential as we speak. We will share more details over time. But no doubt, when you add a high-growth focused asset like GHOST in an attractive category like energy, that \u2013 and I said it in my remarks, that gives us some top line flexibility going into \u201825 to make some tough choices on portfolio optimization that over the long-term, I think will really yield fruit both on the top line growth and on the margin. Thanks Robert. I think a little bit to your preface. We spoke about this a little bit, but let me try to unpack it a little bit more. In short, I think we are well prepared and well positioned to take on the new growth vector with GHOST. I think evidence of that is what you have seen us do the last couple of years. C4, I gave a lot of stats earlier to one of the earlier questions on our success with C4. Electrolit has been a very smooth and successful transition this year. We have an incredible relationship with Electrolit management and the family at Grupo PiSA. I was actually there a few months ago talking about the transition. And I think they and we are very pleased with that handover and that transition. You are seeing the good early results, and you will see more next year. We have had a very successful sell-in into 2025 resets on Electrolit. I think the KDP DSD system is showing its resilience. In fact I met with our DSD leadership team the last couple of days here in Frisco headquarters, and they are feeling very bullish about what we are doing on C4 and Electrolit. And I know their \u2013 I told them for all the right reasons, obviously, didn't share the news of this morning. Until this morning, I told him to call in and listen and I know they are listening right now. They are really excited about seeing the flywheel of KDP accelerate, particularly in C-stores. So, from an infrastructure standpoint, from an investment standpoint, to your point, in our branches, in our DCs and our warehouses, you have seen that investment take hold. You have seen us also get acquisitive around territories, which is I think another proof point of our confidence in DSD. We will look at what you see in Arizona, I mentioned a new smaller territory in Tennessee we just took, and then there is some broader bigger news that may follow in \u201825 that's out in the public domain. So, we have got really a strong commercial skill set with our partners. I think that's why we are a preferred partner in the industry. And we feel good overall about our ability to digest these. At the end of your question, you referenced AVI, yes. And no doubt, AVI is GHOST current distribution partner. Our expectation is we will begin to transition the distribution in mid-2025. This is consistent with the six-month termination notice that's required. After that, we will resume \u2013 assume responsibility for all the distribution and work within KDP DSD and, in some select cases, partner distributors to ensure that GHOST is available everywhere."

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded and there will be a question and answer session at the end of the call. I would now like to introduce the Keurig Dr Pepper's Vice President of Investor Relations, Jane Gelfand. Ms. Gelfand, please go ahead.\nJane Gelfand: Thank you and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our second quarter results, which we will discuss during this conference call. A slide presentation will accompany our remarks and can be viewed in real time on the live webcast. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements, which reflect KDP's judgment, assumptions and analysis only as of today. Our actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting KDP's business. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements discussed today. For more information, please refer to our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our Q2 performance on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. Definitions and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics are included in our earnings materials. Here with us today to discuss our results are Keurig Dr. Peppers Chief Executive Officer Tim Cofer; and Chief Financial Officer and President, International, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi. I'll now turn it over to Tim.\nTim Cofer: Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. It's been eight months since I joined this great, young and dynamic company. I continue to be impressed with the caliber of the organization, the quality of our execution and the challenger mindset our people embody each and every day. Together, we delivered healthy second quarter performance while making important progress to advance our strategic agenda. With our first half now in the books, we're on track to deliver full year results consistent with our on algorithm outlook. The operating environment remains uneven with resilient demand from higher income consumers and value seeking behavior among low and middle income consumers. We are highly attuned to these dynamics and despite them, we still expect a top-line acceleration over the balance of the year. Thanks to several elements largely within our control including new partnership growth and traction from innovation. At the same time, our first half weighted EPS delivery outs taped the way for on planned performance as we also seed our multi-year growth agenda. In Q2, constant currency net sales growth sequentially improved to 3.4% and reflected a re-weighting of our top-line drivers with pricing moderating and volume mix accelerating to positive territory. We entered 2024 anticipating net price realization for KDP and the industry would normalize from the unusually high levels over the past few years and it has. It's encouraging to now see a more balanced top-line growth profile begin to emerge. At the same time, we remain focused on generating leverage throughout our P&L to fund reinvestments and drive earnings growth. In Q2, continuous productivity savings and cost discipline drove strong operating margin expansion helping to translate our top-line momentum to a solid bottom-line results with 7% EPS growth versus prior year. As we execute against evolved strategic framework, we registered a number of wins in Q2. Let me highlight a few that will continue to payoff throughout the year along with focus areas for the long-term. As you know, one of our key strategies is consumer obsessed brand building. Our innovation ramped significantly in the second quarter and as expected these new products are seeing good marketplace Traction. In U.S refreshment beverages, Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut is now our most successful limited time offering. Canada Dry Fruit Splash is also proving highly incremental to the brand. Together, these innovations are driving improved share trends across the CSD portfolio. Outside of CSDs, we're pleased with the initial response to our WonderWater restage, which is re-engaging consumers in its early days. In US Coffee, our new refreshers from The Original Donut Shop are on track to be the largest Keurig platform launch of the last several years. These coffee shop inspired cold beverages are bringing new occasions and younger consumers into the single-serve K-Cup category and are supporting market share gains for our owned and licensed portfolio. Outside the US, our Pe\u00f1afiel Aced and Twist products are extending the powerful Pe\u00f1afiel brand into new white space segments and contributing to market share gains for our Mexico portfolio. In total, these Innovations will continue to develop over the coming months with additional news and activation upcoming across the portfolio including in Powerhouse brands like Motts and Green Mountain. We also made progress with new partnerships as we focus on shaping our now and next beverage portfolio. With Electrolit and La Colombe now part of that portfolio, our excitement about each brand's future and the win-win collaboration models behind them continues to build. As anticipated, revenue contributions from these brands increased during the second quarter and should further scale over the balance of the year. The transition of Electrolit volume to our DSD network is ongoing with the handover expected to be complete in the back half. As we take on this distribution, we're beginning to unlock the brand\u2019s untapped potential with outsized market share gains in KDP served regions and channels. This performance underscores our go to market capabilities and spotlights the growth opportunity for Electrolit within the Sports Hydration category. Similarly, we continue to cultivate our La Colombe partnership across both K-Cup pods and shelf-stable Ready-To-Drink coffee. Focusing on the latter, the La Colombe\u2019s reformulated Draft Lattes are truly differentiated in this category and showed strong promise. As we speak, our DSD organization is focused on expanding this unique product\u2019s availability and display to drive initial consumer trials contributing to strengthening marketplace trends. In May, we also announced a planned transaction with Kalil Bottling Company, another concrete step to amplify a route-to-market advantage, which is a key component of our strategic agenda. With one of only three nationwide direct store delivery systems for LRBs, we understand innately the competitive advantage of controlling last mile distribution in our industry. This particular transaction will grant us full control of our brands\u2019 distribution in Arizona, a strategic and fast-growing state and with it the ability to optimize and extract even more leverage from our local DSD assets. We are moving quickly towards completing the acquisition of Kalil\u2019s production, sales and distribution operations in Q3 and we are honored that the Kalil family has entrusted us to carry on the legacy of their multi-generational business. Perhaps less externally visible in any single quarter is the significant work we're doing to dial-up our productivity and fuel for growth engine. With consumer health mixed, pockets of inflation returning like in the case of green coffee and currency volatility increasing, we are reinforcing our attention on driving productivity, network optimization and structural cost discipline. These focus areas are essential to securing additional near-term flexibility and room for reinvestment and they are enablers of consistent delivery over the long term. We had an active agenda to support each element in 2024 and are laying the groundwork for meaningful further actions that will benefit us well beyond this year. Also woven throughout our strategic agenda is a commitment to corporate responsibility and being a force for positive change. I am proud of how our people corporate this focus into every day activities and decision-making, while also pursuing a set of ambitious multi-year targets. We highlighted this important work once again in our 2023 corporate responsibility report published just last month. I encourage you to give it a read to track our progress and to witness how we live up to our Drink Well, Do Good progress. Now, let's turn to our Q2 segment top-line performance. Sudhanshu will then discuss segment performance in more detail including the strong margin expansion we delivered across the board. Starting with US Refreshment Beverages, revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate in the quarter. Our performance was led by CSDs which remain an outperformer in the liquid refreshment beverage space by offering compelling everyday value and variety. Within the CSD category ,and as expected, our relative market share trend improved as Q2 progressed and as our 2024 innovations slate and brand activations layered into the market resonating with consumers. Brand Dr Pepper maintained its long-term track record of market share growth. On the back of this year's dirty soda inspired Creamy Coconut LTO and the marketing excellence behind our new \u201cit's a Pepper thing\u201d campaign. Our ability to steadily grow Dr Pepper by staying on top of trends and continually tapping into the cultural zeitgeist is a defining characteristic of the brand. It\u2019s on track for its eighth consecutive year of market share outperformance and yet there is still substantial untapped opportunity to further expand its preferred status. Beyond CSDs, we also delivered another strong quarter of growth for C4 Energy. Despite the energy category\u2019s recent moderation, it remains a highly attractive space with consistently faster volume growth in all major beverage categories including on a year-to-date basis. With C4, we also have a uniquely positioned brand that is gaining share with meaningful growth runway still available for us to realize. In some parts of these still beverages portfolio, we continue to see a more pronounced macro impact leading to softer category growth rates. As a result we're taking steps to ensure our brand\u2019s value propositions are clearly resonating. This includes targeted channel-specific promotions, price pack work like smaller bottles and multi packs and a focus on value-oriented channels like Club and Dollar. Simultaneously, we are investing to drive demand through innovation and brand activations such as this year's rollout of reformulated Bai WonderWater and the Summer Olympics Gymnastics tie-in for core hydration Moving to US Coffee, we made further progress against key priorities during the quarter. While overall at-home coffee category trends remained subdued our relative performance is strengthening with pod shipments improving to flat year-over-year in Q2. This outcome reflected market share gains across our owned and licensed brands including initial traction across our three focus areas, affordability, premiumization, and cold coffee. Together, these initiatives reflects a barbell strategy intended to highlight value for those consumers who are feeling stretched and provide premium options for those with more spending power. When it comes to affordability, during Q2, we began rolling out smaller pack sizes intended to optimize the cost per package of K-Cup pods. Because of its multi-serve nature, coffee is one of the highest dollar ringed food and beverage categories and these price pack adjustments enable us to hit more attractive every day and promoted price points across grocery and club channels. At the same time, we launched digital campaign that emphasized the affordability of consuming coffee at home instead of at coffee shops which we see as particularly resonant messaging in the current environment. Our Q2 affordability strategy also extended to brewers where we drove sizable Keurig share gains led by entry price machines and supported by some targeted value investments. Shifting to premiumization, the combination of brewer innovation in an increasingly well-developed set of super premium pods is strengthening Keurig\u2019s system credibility with coffee connoisseurs and tapping into more affluent consumers. This includes our work with Lavazza, now a licensed brand within our portfolio as of Q2. With greater commercial influence, we have already secured expanded distribution for the brand and are just getting started on the activation agenda. Moving to cold coffee, we are actively pursuing the significant number of ice occasions currently occurring away from home. Cold Coffee represents less than 20% of at-home occasions, while at certain coffee shops, cold beverages account for upwards of 70%. One way we are pursuing this white space is through K-Cup innovation with significant activity during Q2, including refreshers cold brewed pods. These items performed well in the quarter with wider distribution and support slated for the back half. We're excited to further address the cold opportunity through brewers including the upcoming launch of our new K- Brew + Chill brewer in Q3, as well as through the continued expansion of La Colombe Ready-To-Drink coffee. All in, we're encouraged by the progress we are seeing from our multiple coffee initiatives which is visible in improving market share for both K-Cup pods and brewers. Even so, and as with many food and beverage categories today, demand trends across the larger at-home coffee category are soft. In single-serve, a promotional environment that is at odds with significant green coffee inflation also persists. This softer demand backdrop supports why we constructed our 2024 outlook assuming a muted revenue growth contribution from U.S Coffee, which remains an appropriate planning stance. Turning now to International, impressive segment performance continued in the second quarter with double-digit constant currency growth on the top and bottom-lines and broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In cold beverages, strong in-market execution in both Mexico and Canada powered our results. Compelling Pe\u00f1afiel the outline extensions momentum behind Clamato and Canada Dry and ITP share gains in the low and no alcohol category led the growth. Our Canadian Coffee results were also robust in the quarter driven by our owned and licensed brands and supported by nuanced portfolio management. With exceptional strength in the International business in Q2, we also seized the opportunity to reinvest in our brands and capabilities to see the future growth adding to our confidence in sustained segment momentum. In closing, we are pleased with our overall second quarter performance and remain on track to our full year outlook. At the same time, we are activating our strategic agenda. Our consumer-centric approach to brand building is resonating in markets. Successful portfolio expansion into higher growth categories like energy, sports hydration and ready-to-drink coffee continues. And multiple initiatives to strengthen and already potent route to market are underway including our pending transaction with Kalil Bottling. We also remain highly focused on furthering our enterprise-wide efficiency and cost agenda which will underpin our visibility for the balance of the year and our ability to invest in the future. And throughout our capital discipline is unwavering and with a strong balance sheet and improving free cash flow, our ability to strategically deploy our cash is robust. With that I\u2019ll turn the call to Sudhanshu.\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Our solid Q2 financial performance speaks to KDP\u2019s strength of execution. Net sales growth sequentially accelerated with margin expansion powering double-digit operating income growth and high-single-digit EPS growth. Free cash flow conversion also strengthened. We are pleased with our progress year-to-date and have visibility to our full year outlook. Our constant currency net revenue grew 3.4% in the quarter. Performance was led by strong double-digit growth in our International segment and healthy trends in US refreshment beverages balanced against continued muted performance in US Coffee. Consolidated volume mix grew 1.8% year-over-year inflecting back to growth as new partnerships failed and our innovations gained traction in the marketplace. We saw broad based volume mix progress across the business with positive growth in each segment. 1.6 points of pricing also added to consolidated net sales growth. This reflected a more normalized level of net price realization in US refreshment beverages relative to recent quarters and ongoing gains in International. This was partially reduced by the impact of previously discussed price gap adjustments in US Coffee. Gross margin expanded strongly, up 130 basis points versus prior year driven by the favorable net impact of productivity pricing and inflation. [Indiscernible] grew at a slower rate than net sales, resulting in approximately 30 basis points of leverage in the quarter. All in, total company operating income grew strongly up 11% versus prior year. Even with some offsets from below the line items, EPS growth was a healthy 7% in Q2. Moving to the segments. US refreshment beverages net sales grew 3.3% in the quarter led by 2.9 percentage points from net price realization. The pricing contributions reflected increases in CSDs taken in early 2024 slightly offset by targeted value investments across other parts of the portfolio. As expected, segment volume mix returned to growth in Q2 increasing 0.4%. This performance reflected a ramping benefit from the successful transition of Electrolit volume to our DSD network, as well as our Q2 weighted innovation calendar. Our new products are resonating in the marketplace as evidenced by improving share trends for brands like Dr Pepper and Canada Dry. We expect the building benefits from partnerships and innovation over the balance of the year to yield accelerated volume `mix growth in the back half. Segment operating income grew 11.9% in the quarter and margins expanded 230 basis points primarily reflecting tailwinds from net pricing and productivity. We continue to expect healthy operating income growth in US refreshment beverages for the full year to notch at the same magnitude as we saw during the first half. In US Coffee, net sales declined 2.1% with volume mix growth of 0.8% offset by the 2.9% net pricing declines. We have made sequential progress in driving improved take up trends over the past few quarters and we were pleased to pod shipments stabilize in Q2 with 0.2% growth. As Tim described, owned and licensed share gains were a major driver with tractions across our strategic initiatives. Our market share momentum should sustain into the back half. At the same time, we\u2019ve built our full year balance assuming only muted at-home coffee category trends which is what we have experienced year-to-date. We are expecting similar category dynamics for the balance of the year. Brewer shipments increased 2.1% in Q2, with the rolling 12 months trend improving to 1.4% growth. Our innovation in commercial strategies are driving meaningful share gains particularly for our value brewers we expect this share momentum to persist in second half. Segment net pricing decreased 2.9%. Similar to last quarter, this reflected investments to appropriately managed price gaps in a competitive single-serve environment. US Coffee operating income grew modestly versus prior year and margins expanded 70 basis points with productivity savings and cost discipline effectively neutralizing the profit impacts of price investments. As expected, our year-over-year margin trend is moderating as we calibrate our growth drivers to achieve greater balance between our top and bottom-line delivery. This will likely pay out to an even greater degree in the back half as we lapse more difficult competitions and combat inflation, though we still expect segment margin expansion on a full year basis. International net sales grew 15.5% on a reported basis points and 14.7% in constant currency. Segment growth was comprised of very strong 10.4% volume mix growth and up 4.3% increase in price. Our performance reflected growth across markets and categories, including Canada Coffee and Latin American LRBs driven by excellent execution. Segment operating income advanced significantly increasing 30.2% in constant currency terms. Growth was driven by net sales gain and net productivity, which more than offset a significant increase in marketing. We will continue to make high quality investments as we execute our strategy to capture the outsized growth opportunity in our International business. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows. In Q2, we generated $543 million in free cash flow reflecting a combination of difficult seasonality, capital discipline and a more modest impact from our supplier financing program reductions. For the first half in total, free cash flow grew roughly 50% versus prior year and conversion improved. We expect back half free cash flow conversion to improve further relative to the first half. The accelerate in free cash flow profile supports an unchanged capital allocation agenda. Our priorities remains organic and inorganic investments to further our growth, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through a steadily growing dividend and via opportunistic share buybacks. We dynamically manage these options in the short-term with a balanced approach over the long term. For example, following our significant share repurchase activity in Q1 we had more modest free cash outlays in the second quarter resulting in a slight reduction in management leverage during the period. We remain committed to our long-term leverage target of 2 to 2.5 times though by comfortable following a non-linear path. Moving now to our 2024 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net sales and high-single-digit EPS growth in 2024, both consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. Our plans to invest, and net sales acceleration over the back half of the year which is based largely on factors within our control like partnerships and innovation. Even so, we are cognizant of mixed consumer involvements and are focused on strong execution to secure full year delivery. Even as revenue growth accelerates, we do expect back half EPS growth to moderate sequentially. That is, the strong first half EPS profile provides us with sufficient flexibility to manage through accelerating inflation, product headwinds, and ongoing investments in the back half of the year while delivering on full year expectations. From a phasing perspective, we expect roughly similar rates of EPS growth in quarter three and quarter four. Our full year 2024 outlook embeds the following unchanged below the line assumptions. Interest expense in a $625 million and $645 million range and effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% and approximately $1.37 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding In closing, we are quite pleased with our second quarter results and feel good about our ability to deliver the year, while also advancing clear strategic initiatives with multi-year payback windows. With that, I will now turn the call back to Tim to close.\nTim Cofer: Thanks, Sudhanshu. Now halfway through the year, 2024 is progressing well and according to plan. We knew that our top-line momentum would build quarter-over-quarter and it has improving market share trends and strengths of execution should support further net revenue acceleration in the back half. We also knew that margin and EPS gains would be tilted towards the first half and we delivered. With 9% EPS growth in the first six months of the year, we have good visibility to delivering on algorithm performance in 2024 while solidifying our focus on the strategic initiatives that will fuel consistent growth over multiple years. Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our greatest source of competitive advantage, our talented people. I am thankful to our 28,000 colleagues for the hard work and dedication reflected in our Q2 results and in the strategic agenda we are simultaneously activating that will benefit us in the future. Thank you for your time and we're now happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Hi, thanks operator. Good morning, everyone. Tim, I wanted to just pick up on maybe some of the comments you made about and some of the things that have changed like inflation the dollar strengthening a bit. Just can you give us a perspective on what the operating conditions or what the segment or category dynamics are today versus maybe where they were at the start of the year when you set your plan? The guidance isn't changing, but I guess it feels like the categories have a little bit and I know one major theme that we've seen across earnings season is just demand in the US across a lot of categories not as strong as expected and we've got some companies rolling back on price. So just want to kind of want to get your perspective of is it accurate that maybe the categories maybe not as strong as you all thought at the start? What have that patience you've made and maybe if I can slip into that in CSDs US in particular, if needed the - that the consumers\u2019 ability to maybe absorb or take on more and more price increases. I know there's a lot there, but thanks.\nTim Cofer : Yeah. Thanks, Brian. I'd say - I'd start by saying we are pleased with our execution and our results in Q2 despite an uneven I think was a word I used earlier uneven or mixed consumer environment. And I think when you ask about how the categories are evolving, obviously, it starts with the consumer. And we continue to see, I mentioned this in our last quarterly call, we continue to see a bifurcation across income levels. So we're seeing the high income consumer continuing to be resilient in their purchases and their demand and we're seeing a low and middle income consumer that's under pressure and seeking value. And that manifests in many ways as it relates to the beverage industry. Consumers are being more selective around when they're buying, where they're buying, we are seeing a little bit more of the purchase in key categories around holiday periods, waiting to stock up for that Memorial Day or July 4th period for example. We're also seeing the shifting in spending to more value-oriented channels like club like a dollar and value. And I would say over the course of Q2, these dynamics became a bit more pronounced. But the way we look at it given our broad portfolio across liquids refreshment beverage is this drop creates both opportunities and challenges. And I think on opportunities I now connect it to the end of your question, I\u2019d start with CSDs. CSDs right now are highly resilient and it's clear that CSDs continue to offer value to consumers. This category is outperforming even our expectations that when we created the plan for the year. We're seeing the robust category both on value and dollars and on volume and within that of course we're seeing a strong performance from KDP brands led by brand Dr Pepper which grew share again in Q2. I also think on the coffee side, while we are seeing a more muted total coffee contribution, it's a great opportunity to bolster at-home coffee consumption through value-oriented tactics. I talk about affordability as one of our three key tactics. Thanks to opening price point brewers, value messaging versus coffee shops which we put out there in Q2 and so on. There are challenges as well in certain parts of our portfolio and the one that I speak to is still beverages. I think still beverages and some of the other categories perhaps even energy that skew themselves towards C-Store, towards single bottle or can purchase, those were seeing a little bit more pressure. So that's how we're seeing it. The great news is when you look at the entire basket of our portfolio, I would say it is on plan and that's why that gives us the confidence that and the strength of our ramp in the back half around partners give us the confidence to continue to confirm MSD on the top-line.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, Tim. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thanks operator and good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. So, I was hoping to get some color on the organic sales guidance for the back half of the year which implies a pretty decent acceleration. You both touch on this acceleration being driven by areas where you have controls of partnered brands and innovation. So maybe can you just speak to how we should anticipate this contribution building and then just on the underlying business obviously a lot of moving pieces. Can you just touched on a lot of those as to Bryan's question, but you do you need any improvement in core trends and orders to hit this target or can this current environment hold and you would still see this acceleration?\nTim Cofer : Yeah, thanks, Peter. Yeah, I tell you we have good line of sight to sequentially stronger top-line growth in the back half in Q3 and Q4. And the good news for us is it reflects factors largely within our control. I would say it is not predicated on a need for a significant change in terms of consumer health or macro. The single greatest driver of that top-line acceleration does lie with these partnerships that are continuing to scale. Lead among them is Electrolit. Electrolit will continue to ramp in Q3 and Q4. We\u2019re very pleased with the distribution hand over that we've had so far and that is continuing to ramp on a geographic and an account level and will be a meaningful incremental contributor in Q3 and Q4. Shifting to the coffee side of the house, I\u2019d point out Black Rifle. Black Rifle is a new brand that we signed on I think I mentioned it at the tail end of last call and that will continue to ramp into Q3 and Q4. La Colombe is another that will contribute more to the top -line in the back half. So, partnerships is a big part of it. On the base business side, I mentioned some of our innovation, we're really pleased with what we seen on for example Creamy Coconut, Canada dry Fruit Splash, the Bai WonderWater restage and then we have more to come that actually will begin to hit in Q3, think core hydration Olympics sponsorship with US Gymnastics. We've got a big program for Mott\u2019s at back-to-school, I'd say one of our biggest in years and I stand to hesitate to tell you about another season of Fansville. I\u2019ve seen that the team\u2019s work on Dr Pepper Fansville and I am telling you if you're a College Football and Dr Pepper fan, you're going to be excited about what. And I remind you we've got an extended season of College Football this year. So, we feel good about it. The last one I talk about is International. International right now strong double-digit growth in Q2 and we expect international to continue to be a meaningful contributor. So, it is not an easy operating environment. It is mixed and uneven. But we're confident about our plans and really focused on strong execution to deliver on our outlook.\nPeter Grom: Thanks and maybe just one quick follow-up. You mentioned green coffee prices starting to move higher. How should we think about this dynamic impacting your pricing strategy in coffee? And maybe what you'd expect from the category more broadly as we move forward here?\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi : Well, Peter, this is Sudhanshu. Good morning. You are right, the green coffee green coffee price is higher and we've talked about before that it will factor in our guidance. We hedge for six to nine months. So we are factoring as part of the guidance. So our top-line and bottom-line guidance includes that. Your question about pricing as a category, there is two words, we always focus on high quality activity to drive category growth. Tim mentioned in the call. Right now we are seeing the promotional dynamics that play in the category which is as odds with where the green coffee prices are. But we have continued to accept to appropriately position ourselves versus the competition. But as I said before, we are monitoring the situation. It's part of our guidance we have factored in. But yeah, it does create a headwind in H2. But our intent is to continue to responsibly manage our price gaps. But we must protect our ability to fund high quality investment on behalf of these categories and our brands.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just coming back to coffee again, I mean, it seems like great timing that you had a a plan already in place and underway to address affordability is what given what we're seeing call it accelerate in the consumer environment. But I was curious, I guess, given the mentions on the promotional environment, and Investments already made to-date, where do you stand on price gaps? So are you feeling good about where you are? Is there incremental investment needed in price gaps to narrow them or in promotions specifically? And then, on the more structural sort of invest - strategic elements here where you can - how fully rolled out on those smaller packages more affordable price points or is that something that also keeps building as we move through Q3?\nTim Cofer: Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. As mentioned, when we think about driving our coffee business, we're really focused in three areas, affordability, premiumization, and cold coffee. And I think those first two do reflect this barbell strategy as we've called it and the bifurcation we're seeing in across the consumer landscape. Your question primarily was in that affordability area and indeed pricing and absolute price and price gap is one element of that. I would say specifically to your question and how we're feeling on price gaps, we feel good. We feel good. The move that was made late last year did put us more at historic price gap levels. I do think as Sudhanshu said and as we said in the prepared remarks, with green coffee going up right now, it is a little bit at odds with the current promotional dynamic that's going on. We're going to closely monitor that and obviously take a measured and nuanced approach. But our affordability strategy is much more than that. And one of them is the down counts so that was part of your question as well specifically on two of our key sizes 12 count at Food channel, we downsized to 10 counts. That is done in terms of from a production standpoint. So you'll continue to see a little bit of that 12 count still out in the marketplace. But it's rolling through as we speak, some retail some channels are already fully in 10 others are still working through 12. We've seen a good response from that Lauren, in terms of volume response as we would expect and obviously that allows us to hit an everyday price point and a promoted price point that is more in line with what consumers are looking for especially at that low and mid income level. I\u2019ll remind you that as you look at total food and beverage, 40 is actually a top five dollar per unit outlay because of its multi-serve nature. And these down counts 12 to 10 and then I\u2019ll reference the other big one in the club channel it was a 100 count and that's down to an 80 count and that also allows us to hit key price points. So you've got the pack down counts. You\u2019ve got the value messaging, I think In the last quarter Lauren, I remember you asked me a question on that and indeed we went live with that feeling good about that. I think that is very resonant and compelling messaging positioning our coffee single-serve at-home, the quality, the variety in a broader frame of coffee shop and away from home. And the last thing I\u2019d point to on affordability is entry price brewers. We're seeing that we're growing the Keurig system within the total coffee maker category and part of that is entry price brewers. So that's the affordability. I will stop there, but I remind you and others that there's also a great premium strategy as well, as well as a big push into cold coffee.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian : Good morning. So, I just want to get a bit more granular on the take-home coffee category. Obviously, there\u2019s been a slow down in the last year and a half, which seems to be improving. But more recently now we've seen a pronounced slowdown at the same time in their strength. So the broader energy, let's say caffeine complex seems to be a bit under pressure. So, A. would just love your perspective on that what's driving that? Is it more short-term macros? Is it the lot of middle-end consumer pressure you mentioned or other longer-term factors? And just B, is there opportunity in coffee to source greater share from energy here as you think about share of stomach. And then also maybe you can just touch on any shifts you're seeing in away-from-home coffee to at-home coffee and in brewing versus ground coffee and at-home just as you move through Q2 and here so far in Q3? Thanks.\nTim Cofer : Thanks, Dara. No doubt, at-home coffee volumes remain muted in Q2 and I'd say at a similar level to what we saw in Q1. I would also say it's not all that different from many food and beverage categories today. Importantly, within at-home coffee, the single-serve category outperformed as it has the last many years and did as well. We're feeling good about the progress we've made across a number of initiatives, the ones I mentioned to Lauren, affordability, premiumization, and cold coffee. But I think we have a - an appropriate outlook for the balance of the year in terms of expectations and our guidance contemplates that muted revenue contribution from coffee. In tougher macroeconomic times, we have seen shifts in consumption from away-from-home channels, to at-home channels. And that does tend to benefit our business on the coffee side, as well as on the liquid refreshment beverages side. Obviously, more of our business is in at-home business than away-from-home. So I think in general, if as we see that trend and certainly based on some of the actions we're taking around price promotion, around down counts, around value marketing in the broader frame, I think that conserve as well. You also referenced energy and let me give you a few comments on that. Energy in my view is a highly attractive space. It is over time, over these last many years consistently faster volume growth than really any other major beverage category. That is also the case on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis from volume standpoint, energy remains the fastest growing as it did in \u201823 and in \u201922. Now within that, we have seen a slowdown of late and the volumes have moderated. I do think that is related to the broader macro and some of the pressure we're seeing of consumers, particularly in low and mid income energy obviously skews to C-Store. It skews to single bottle purchase and that\u2019s where you're seeing a little bit more pressure in certain channels like gas and convenience. But for me, that doesn't change what I characterize as a constructive view on the energy category. Energy. addresses a clear set of needs for consumers. It occupies clear demand spaces. I think there's a lot of interesting nuances and opportunities within energy to build out sub-segments and you're seeing that today in terms of challenger brands that are coming in relative to the big large historic incumbents. And I look, tell you Dara that you that there's significant helpful penetration gains still for the energy category as it relates other beverage categories, think CSDs. Last thing I\u2019ll tell you on energy is, we continue to be excited about our position with C4. C4 has strong momentum. I think in the quarter, our C4 business on a retail sales basis grew about 30% and at only 3% market share we believe we have meaningful runway for growth.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hey, good morning, everyone. So, I wanted to just follow up on some of the back half commentary, which has been well covered. But in the U.S. Coffee business we\u2019ve seen this stabilization. There is a sequential improvement and a pause specifically, I know you're talking about muted performance for the full year. But is there any reason to believe that going to the back half of the year this stabilization to your mind would not sustain and maybe even continue to improve as you fold in partners? And similarly, is there any reason to your mind that the pricing that we've seen which did down a little bit should be materially improve into the back half? So it\u2019s a bit of opposite questions between the two and if I could sneak this as given we are at the end of the call, but the half in US refreshment improvement, is there a way that you'd frame the contribution from the distribution partnership ramp relative to innovation, is it mostly distribution and innovation is the kicker? So you know thanks for those two on coffee and US refreshment in the back half.\nTim Cofer : Yes. Hi, Chris. So, let's start coffee back half and then we'll go to ref bev. As you said we're encouraged by the slow and steady progress we're seeing. in K-Cup volume trends and I will point out that we've now had four consecutive quarters of sequential improvement in K-Cup volume. And we were pleased to see our K-Cup shipments stabilized in the second quarter flat - I think up 20, 20 basis points. So this slow and steady improvement trend is clearly there. There's always going to be potential for quarter-to-quarter lumpiness, but I would expect that the H2 second half pod shipment trend will improve versus H1 in particularly in Q4. And indeed, that improvement has been underpinned by the progress we're making in our owned and licensed business, the market share progress we are seeing I referenced some successful innovation, the work we're doing again in the three areas around affordability, premiumization, cold coffee. And a big push into cold coffee the back half. That\u2019s pods, that\u2019s refreshers, that\u2019s also our new Brew + Chill brewer and that'll be the first brewer that actually brews out a cold cup of coffee. So feeling good about the progress in coffee in the back half. As it relates to refreshment beverages, I'm pleased with both the base business and the new partners. And they will both play a meaningful role in the back half. The ramp, as I said earlier will be more around what we see from partner contribution, Electrolit, La Colombe, C4, et cetera. And I think we\u2019ve said earlier then on a full year basis we expect those new partnerships to add about 200 basis points to total company net sales and I would tell you we continue to feel good about that number.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBonnie Herzog : Alright. Thank you. Good morning everyone. I am I have a question on your International business. It's clear you've been making a significant push. So curious to hear what you believe, are the key drivers that are going to allow you to continue to win internationally? And second, how will you evaluate whether it's best to enter new markets or organically or possibly through acquisitions? And then finally what percentage of your sales, do you think your International business could ultimately represent? Thank you.\nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Bonnie, good morning. So, you're right, we have - International is doing well. We said that this will be a growth driver for our business for overall KDP and we are very pleased with the momentum in our International segment. This performance basically reflects combination of growing categories as per their share gains. So it\u2019s geographic and category-wise expansion and we are seeing low and no alcohol in Canada and Mexico. And we are also seeing line extensions in Mexico. We are investing in route to market and in cooler in Mexico and we are seeing the execution there. And also the local team they understand the market consumer. You are seeing the on and licensed pod momentum in Canada and we continue to have confidence that this growth actually give contribution from International will continue. Regarding your question on the future markets, plus we have a lot of work to do in our bases in basically in Mexico and Canada. And we have significant opportunity to drive outsized growth, but we do look at both inorganic and organic strategy to unlock this potential. We have the similar model in those markets what we have in US, buy, build and partner model. And we will look at into some international markets to see whether we can make some inorganic entry, but mainly focused right now is driving what we are driving in Mexico and Canada. And while I don't have a number to give that what will be the mix of it, but the math you could see last five years, International has grown close to double-digit CAGR and we expect similar type of growth coming to the business.\nOperator: Our last question today will come [Indiscernible] with Citi. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning, everyone. So, Tim I wanted to go back to US Coffee and the second half outlook. Obviously, good to see the volume improvement in pods and the total segment but obviously pricing came in more sequentially. So should we expect this level of promotional activity to remain consistent in the second half? Would you think about maybe reducing a bit the promotional intensity? And do you need that level of promotional activity to get further volume improvement in the second half? Just to get some context that will be will be helpful. Thank you.\nTim Cofer : Thanks [Indiscernible] As the pioneer here in the single-serve and the category\u2019s steward, we're most focused on high quality activity should drive sustainable single-serve category growth. And that\u2019s of course for us, but for all our participants and all of our partners in the Keurig ecosystem. And that includes our work on innovation, in consumer marketing, value messaging, both on brewers and on pods. That said, right now there are some promotional dynamics at play in the category and in response to that, at the end of the year and early this year we did take some steps to appropriately position ourselves versus competition. I think inherent in your question is this tensions leave all that. The building backdrop around green coffee prices is a bit at odds with some of the promotional activity and I would say over long term it does not appear to be sustainable. So from our standpoint, of course we're doing the right thing around striking that balance around protecting our positions and making sure that we also have the margin structure we need to continue to drive the entire ecosystem. Obviously, part of that is the way that we manage commodities and our hedging position which I think we\u2019ve shared in the past, that\u2019s usually six to nine months out. And so that means the higher green coffee could begin to impact our P&L progressively over the course of H2, second half. So, we're going to continue to closely monitor that situation. Our intent here is to responsibly manage our price gaps while also protecting our ability to fund high quality reinvestment to drive the single-serve category.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jane Gelfand for any closing remarks.\nJane Gelfand : Thank you, Drew and thank you, everyone for participating this morning. We appreciate your support. Investor Relations is available all day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Appreciate it and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Sudhanshu Priyadarshi",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Our solid Q2 financial performance speaks to KDP's strength of execution. Net sales growth sequentially accelerated with margin expansion powering double-digit operating income growth and high-single-digit EPS growth. Free cash flow conversion also strengthened. We are pleased with our progress year-to-date and have visibility to our full year outlook. Our constant currency net revenue grew 3.4% in the quarter. Performance was led by strong double-digit growth in our International segment and healthy trends in US refreshment beverages balanced against continued muted performance in US Coffee. Consolidated volume mix grew 1.8% year-over-year inflecting back to growth as new partnerships failed and our innovations gained traction in the marketplace. We saw broad based volume mix progress across the business with positive growth in each segment. 1.6 points of pricing also added to consolidated net sales growth. This reflected a more normalized level of net price realization in US refreshment beverages relative to recent quarters and ongoing gains in International. This was partially reduced by the impact of previously discussed price gap adjustments in US Coffee. Gross margin expanded strongly, up 130 basis points versus prior year driven by the favorable net impact of productivity pricing and inflation. [Indiscernible] grew at a slower rate than net sales, resulting in approximately 30 basis points of leverage in the quarter. All in, total company operating income grew strongly up 11% versus prior year. Even with some offsets from below the line items, EPS growth was a healthy 7% in Q2. Moving to the segments. US refreshment beverages net sales grew 3.3% in the quarter led by 2.9 percentage points from net price realization. The pricing contributions reflected increases in CSDs taken in early 2024 slightly offset by targeted value investments across other parts of the portfolio. As expected, segment volume mix returned to growth in Q2 increasing 0.4%. This performance reflected a ramping benefit from the successful transition of Electrolit volume to our DSD network, as well as our Q2 weighted innovation calendar. Our new products are resonating in the marketplace as evidenced by improving share trends for brands like Dr Pepper and Canada Dry. We expect the building benefits from partnerships and innovation over the balance of the year to yield accelerated volume `mix growth in the back half. Segment operating income grew 11.9% in the quarter and margins expanded 230 basis points primarily reflecting tailwinds from net pricing and productivity. We continue to expect healthy operating income growth in US refreshment beverages for the full year to notch at the same magnitude as we saw during the first half. In US Coffee, net sales declined 2.1% with volume mix growth of 0.8% offset by the 2.9% net pricing declines. We have made sequential progress in driving improved take up trends over the past few quarters and we were pleased to pod shipments stabilize in Q2 with 0.2% growth. As Tim described, owned and licensed share gains were a major driver with tractions across our strategic initiatives. Our market share momentum should sustain into the back half. At the same time, we've built our full year balance assuming only muted at-home coffee category trends which is what we have experienced year-to-date. We are expecting similar category dynamics for the balance of the year. Brewer shipments increased 2.1% in Q2, with the rolling 12 months trend improving to 1.4% growth. Our innovation in commercial strategies are driving meaningful share gains particularly for our value brewers we expect this share momentum to persist in second half. Segment net pricing decreased 2.9%. Similar to last quarter, this reflected investments to appropriately managed price gaps in a competitive single-serve environment. US Coffee operating income grew modestly versus prior year and margins expanded 70 basis points with productivity savings and cost discipline effectively neutralizing the profit impacts of price investments. As expected, our year-over-year margin trend is moderating as we calibrate our growth drivers to achieve greater balance between our top and bottom-line delivery. This will likely pay out to an even greater degree in the back half as we lapse more difficult competitions and combat inflation, though we still expect segment margin expansion on a full year basis. International net sales grew 15.5% on a reported basis points and 14.7% in constant currency. Segment growth was comprised of very strong 10.4% volume mix growth and up 4.3% increase in price. Our performance reflected growth across markets and categories, including Canada Coffee and Latin American LRBs driven by excellent execution. Segment operating income advanced significantly increasing 30.2% in constant currency terms. Growth was driven by net sales gain and net productivity, which more than offset a significant increase in marketing. We will continue to make high quality investments as we execute our strategy to capture the outsized growth opportunity in our International business. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows. In Q2, we generated $543 million in free cash flow reflecting a combination of difficult seasonality, capital discipline and a more modest impact from our supplier financing program reductions. For the first half in total, free cash flow grew roughly 50% versus prior year and conversion improved. We expect back half free cash flow conversion to improve further relative to the first half. The accelerate in free cash flow profile supports an unchanged capital allocation agenda. Our priorities remains organic and inorganic investments to further our growth, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through a steadily growing dividend and via opportunistic share buybacks. We dynamically manage these options in the short-term with a balanced approach over the long term. For example, following our significant share repurchase activity in Q1 we had more modest free cash outlays in the second quarter resulting in a slight reduction in management leverage during the period. We remain committed to our long-term leverage target of 2 to 2.5 times though by comfortable following a non-linear path. Moving now to our 2024 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net sales and high-single-digit EPS growth in 2024, both consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. Our plans to invest, and net sales acceleration over the back half of the year which is based largely on factors within our control like partnerships and innovation. Even so, we are cognizant of mixed consumer involvements and are focused on strong execution to secure full year delivery. Even as revenue growth accelerates, we do expect back half EPS growth to moderate sequentially. That is, the strong first half EPS profile provides us with sufficient flexibility to manage through accelerating inflation, product headwinds, and ongoing investments in the back half of the year while delivering on full year expectations. From a phasing perspective, we expect roughly similar rates of EPS growth in quarter three and quarter four. Our full year 2024 outlook embeds the following unchanged below the line assumptions. Interest expense in a $625 million and $645 million range and effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% and approximately $1.37 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding In closing, we are quite pleased with our second quarter results and feel good about our ability to deliver the year, while also advancing clear strategic initiatives with multi-year payback windows. With that, I will now turn the call back to Tim to close. Well, Peter, this is Sudhanshu. Good morning. You are right, the green coffee green coffee price is higher and we've talked about before that it will factor in our guidance. We hedge for six to nine months. So we are factoring as part of the guidance. So our top-line and bottom-line guidance includes that. Your question about pricing as a category, there is two words, we always focus on high quality activity to drive category growth. Tim mentioned in the call. Right now we are seeing the promotional dynamics that play in the category which is as odds with where the green coffee prices are. But we have continued to accept to appropriately position ourselves versus the competition. But as I said before, we are monitoring the situation. It's part of our guidance we have factored in. But yeah, it does create a headwind in H2. But our intent is to continue to responsibly manage our price gaps. But we must protect our ability to fund high quality investment on behalf of these categories and our brands. Bonnie, good morning. So, you're right, we have - International is doing well. We said that this will be a growth driver for our business for overall KDP and we are very pleased with the momentum in our International segment. This performance basically reflects combination of growing categories as per their share gains. So it's geographic and category-wise expansion and we are seeing low and no alcohol in Canada and Mexico. And we are also seeing line extensions in Mexico. We are investing in route to market and in cooler in Mexico and we are seeing the execution there. And also the local team they understand the market consumer. You are seeing the on and licensed pod momentum in Canada and we continue to have confidence that this growth actually give contribution from International will continue. Regarding your question on the future markets, plus we have a lot of work to do in our bases in basically in Mexico and Canada. And we have significant opportunity to drive outsized growth, but we do look at both inorganic and organic strategy to unlock this potential. We have the similar model in those markets what we have in US, buy, build and partner model. And we will look at into some international markets to see whether we can make some inorganic entry, but mainly focused right now is driving what we are driving in Mexico and Canada. And while I don't have a number to give that what will be the mix of it, but the math you could see last five years, International has grown close to double-digit CAGR and we expect similar type of growth coming to the business."

            "name": "Tim Cofer",
            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. It's been eight months since I joined this great, young and dynamic company. I continue to be impressed with the caliber of the organization, the quality of our execution and the challenger mindset our people embody each and every day. Together, we delivered healthy second quarter performance while making important progress to advance our strategic agenda. With our first half now in the books, we're on track to deliver full year results consistent with our on algorithm outlook. The operating environment remains uneven with resilient demand from higher income consumers and value seeking behavior among low and middle income consumers. We are highly attuned to these dynamics and despite them, we still expect a top-line acceleration over the balance of the year. Thanks to several elements largely within our control including new partnership growth and traction from innovation. At the same time, our first half weighted EPS delivery outs taped the way for on planned performance as we also seed our multi-year growth agenda. In Q2, constant currency net sales growth sequentially improved to 3.4% and reflected a re-weighting of our top-line drivers with pricing moderating and volume mix accelerating to positive territory. We entered 2024 anticipating net price realization for KDP and the industry would normalize from the unusually high levels over the past few years and it has. It's encouraging to now see a more balanced top-line growth profile begin to emerge. At the same time, we remain focused on generating leverage throughout our P&L to fund reinvestments and drive earnings growth. In Q2, continuous productivity savings and cost discipline drove strong operating margin expansion helping to translate our top-line momentum to a solid bottom-line results with 7% EPS growth versus prior year. As we execute against evolved strategic framework, we registered a number of wins in Q2. Let me highlight a few that will continue to payoff throughout the year along with focus areas for the long-term. As you know, one of our key strategies is consumer obsessed brand building. Our innovation ramped significantly in the second quarter and as expected these new products are seeing good marketplace Traction. In U.S refreshment beverages, Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut is now our most successful limited time offering. Canada Dry Fruit Splash is also proving highly incremental to the brand. Together, these innovations are driving improved share trends across the CSD portfolio. Outside of CSDs, we're pleased with the initial response to our WonderWater restage, which is re-engaging consumers in its early days. In US Coffee, our new refreshers from The Original Donut Shop are on track to be the largest Keurig platform launch of the last several years. These coffee shop inspired cold beverages are bringing new occasions and younger consumers into the single-serve K-Cup category and are supporting market share gains for our owned and licensed portfolio. Outside the US, our Pen\u0303afiel Aced and Twist products are extending the powerful Pen\u0303afiel brand into new white space segments and contributing to market share gains for our Mexico portfolio. In total, these Innovations will continue to develop over the coming months with additional news and activation upcoming across the portfolio including in Powerhouse brands like Motts and Green Mountain. We also made progress with new partnerships as we focus on shaping our now and next beverage portfolio. With Electrolit and La Colombe now part of that portfolio, our excitement about each brand's future and the win-win collaboration models behind them continues to build. As anticipated, revenue contributions from these brands increased during the second quarter and should further scale over the balance of the year. The transition of Electrolit volume to our DSD network is ongoing with the handover expected to be complete in the back half. As we take on this distribution, we're beginning to unlock the brand's untapped potential with outsized market share gains in KDP served regions and channels. This performance underscores our go to market capabilities and spotlights the growth opportunity for Electrolit within the Sports Hydration category. Similarly, we continue to cultivate our La Colombe partnership across both K-Cup pods and shelf-stable Ready-To-Drink coffee. Focusing on the latter, the La Colombe's reformulated Draft Lattes are truly differentiated in this category and showed strong promise. As we speak, our DSD organization is focused on expanding this unique product's availability and display to drive initial consumer trials contributing to strengthening marketplace trends. In May, we also announced a planned transaction with Kalil Bottling Company, another concrete step to amplify a route-to-market advantage, which is a key component of our strategic agenda. With one of only three nationwide direct store delivery systems for LRBs, we understand innately the competitive advantage of controlling last mile distribution in our industry. This particular transaction will grant us full control of our brands' distribution in Arizona, a strategic and fast-growing state and with it the ability to optimize and extract even more leverage from our local DSD assets. We are moving quickly towards completing the acquisition of Kalil's production, sales and distribution operations in Q3 and we are honored that the Kalil family has entrusted us to carry on the legacy of their multi-generational business. Perhaps less externally visible in any single quarter is the significant work we're doing to dial-up our productivity and fuel for growth engine. With consumer health mixed, pockets of inflation returning like in the case of green coffee and currency volatility increasing, we are reinforcing our attention on driving productivity, network optimization and structural cost discipline. These focus areas are essential to securing additional near-term flexibility and room for reinvestment and they are enablers of consistent delivery over the long term. We had an active agenda to support each element in 2024 and are laying the groundwork for meaningful further actions that will benefit us well beyond this year. Also woven throughout our strategic agenda is a commitment to corporate responsibility and being a force for positive change. I am proud of how our people corporate this focus into every day activities and decision-making, while also pursuing a set of ambitious multi-year targets. We highlighted this important work once again in our 2023 corporate responsibility report published just last month. I encourage you to give it a read to track our progress and to witness how we live up to our Drink Well, Do Good progress. Now, let's turn to our Q2 segment top-line performance. Sudhanshu will then discuss segment performance in more detail including the strong margin expansion we delivered across the board. Starting with US Refreshment Beverages, revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate in the quarter. Our performance was led by CSDs which remain an outperformer in the liquid refreshment beverage space by offering compelling everyday value and variety. Within the CSD category ,and as expected, our relative market share trend improved as Q2 progressed and as our 2024 innovations slate and brand activations layered into the market resonating with consumers. Brand Dr Pepper maintained its long-term track record of market share growth. On the back of this year's dirty soda inspired Creamy Coconut LTO and the marketing excellence behind our new \u201cit's a Pepper thing\u201d campaign. Our ability to steadily grow Dr Pepper by staying on top of trends and continually tapping into the cultural zeitgeist is a defining characteristic of the brand. It's on track for its eighth consecutive year of market share outperformance and yet there is still substantial untapped opportunity to further expand its preferred status. Beyond CSDs, we also delivered another strong quarter of growth for C4 Energy. Despite the energy category's recent moderation, it remains a highly attractive space with consistently faster volume growth in all major beverage categories including on a year-to-date basis. With C4, we also have a uniquely positioned brand that is gaining share with meaningful growth runway still available for us to realize. In some parts of these still beverages portfolio, we continue to see a more pronounced macro impact leading to softer category growth rates. As a result we're taking steps to ensure our brand's value propositions are clearly resonating. This includes targeted channel-specific promotions, price pack work like smaller bottles and multi packs and a focus on value-oriented channels like Club and Dollar. Simultaneously, we are investing to drive demand through innovation and brand activations such as this year's rollout of reformulated Bai WonderWater and the Summer Olympics Gymnastics tie-in for core hydration Moving to US Coffee, we made further progress against key priorities during the quarter. While overall at-home coffee category trends remained subdued our relative performance is strengthening with pod shipments improving to flat year-over-year in Q2. This outcome reflected market share gains across our owned and licensed brands including initial traction across our three focus areas, affordability, premiumization, and cold coffee. Together, these initiatives reflects a barbell strategy intended to highlight value for those consumers who are feeling stretched and provide premium options for those with more spending power. When it comes to affordability, during Q2, we began rolling out smaller pack sizes intended to optimize the cost per package of K-Cup pods. Because of its multi-serve nature, coffee is one of the highest dollar ringed food and beverage categories and these price pack adjustments enable us to hit more attractive every day and promoted price points across grocery and club channels. At the same time, we launched digital campaign that emphasized the affordability of consuming coffee at home instead of at coffee shops which we see as particularly resonant messaging in the current environment. Our Q2 affordability strategy also extended to brewers where we drove sizable Keurig share gains led by entry price machines and supported by some targeted value investments. Shifting to premiumization, the combination of brewer innovation in an increasingly well-developed set of super premium pods is strengthening Keurig's system credibility with coffee connoisseurs and tapping into more affluent consumers. This includes our work with Lavazza, now a licensed brand within our portfolio as of Q2. With greater commercial influence, we have already secured expanded distribution for the brand and are just getting started on the activation agenda. Moving to cold coffee, we are actively pursuing the significant number of ice occasions currently occurring away from home. Cold Coffee represents less than 20% of at-home occasions, while at certain coffee shops, cold beverages account for upwards of 70%. One way we are pursuing this white space is through K-Cup innovation with significant activity during Q2, including refreshers cold brewed pods. These items performed well in the quarter with wider distribution and support slated for the back half. We're excited to further address the cold opportunity through brewers including the upcoming launch of our new K- Brew + Chill brewer in Q3, as well as through the continued expansion of La Colombe Ready-To-Drink coffee. All in, we're encouraged by the progress we are seeing from our multiple coffee initiatives which is visible in improving market share for both K-Cup pods and brewers. Even so, and as with many food and beverage categories today, demand trends across the larger at-home coffee category are soft. In single-serve, a promotional environment that is at odds with significant green coffee inflation also persists. This softer demand backdrop supports why we constructed our 2024 outlook assuming a muted revenue growth contribution from U.S Coffee, which remains an appropriate planning stance. Turning now to International, impressive segment performance continued in the second quarter with double-digit constant currency growth on the top and bottom-lines and broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In cold beverages, strong in-market execution in both Mexico and Canada powered our results. Compelling Pen\u0303afiel the outline extensions momentum behind Clamato and Canada Dry and ITP share gains in the low and no alcohol category led the growth. Our Canadian Coffee results were also robust in the quarter driven by our owned and licensed brands and supported by nuanced portfolio management. With exceptional strength in the International business in Q2, we also seized the opportunity to reinvest in our brands and capabilities to see the future growth adding to our confidence in sustained segment momentum. In closing, we are pleased with our overall second quarter performance and remain on track to our full year outlook. At the same time, we are activating our strategic agenda. Our consumer-centric approach to brand building is resonating in markets. Successful portfolio expansion into higher growth categories like energy, sports hydration and ready-to-drink coffee continues. And multiple initiatives to strengthen and already potent route to market are underway including our pending transaction with Kalil Bottling. We also remain highly focused on furthering our enterprise-wide efficiency and cost agenda which will underpin our visibility for the balance of the year and our ability to invest in the future. And throughout our capital discipline is unwavering and with a strong balance sheet and improving free cash flow, our ability to strategically deploy our cash is robust. With that I'll turn the call to Sudhanshu. Thanks, Sudhanshu. Now halfway through the year, 2024 is progressing well and according to plan. We knew that our top-line momentum would build quarter-over-quarter and it has improving market share trends and strengths of execution should support further net revenue acceleration in the back half. We also knew that margin and EPS gains would be tilted towards the first half and we delivered. With 9% EPS growth in the first six months of the year, we have good visibility to delivering on algorithm performance in 2024 while solidifying our focus on the strategic initiatives that will fuel consistent growth over multiple years. Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our greatest source of competitive advantage, our talented people. I am thankful to our 28,000 colleagues for the hard work and dedication reflected in our Q2 results and in the strategic agenda we are simultaneously activating that will benefit us in the future. Thank you for your time and we're now happy to take your questions. Yeah. Thanks, Brian. I'd say - I'd start by saying we are pleased with our execution and our results in Q2 despite an uneven I think was a word I used earlier uneven or mixed consumer environment. And I think when you ask about how the categories are evolving, obviously, it starts with the consumer. And we continue to see, I mentioned this in our last quarterly call, we continue to see a bifurcation across income levels. So we're seeing the high income consumer continuing to be resilient in their purchases and their demand and we're seeing a low and middle income consumer that's under pressure and seeking value. And that manifests in many ways as it relates to the beverage industry. Consumers are being more selective around when they're buying, where they're buying, we are seeing a little bit more of the purchase in key categories around holiday periods, waiting to stock up for that Memorial Day or July 4th period for example. We're also seeing the shifting in spending to more value-oriented channels like club like a dollar and value. And I would say over the course of Q2, these dynamics became a bit more pronounced. But the way we look at it given our broad portfolio across liquids refreshment beverage is this drop creates both opportunities and challenges. And I think on opportunities I now connect it to the end of your question, I'd start with CSDs. CSDs right now are highly resilient and it's clear that CSDs continue to offer value to consumers. This category is outperforming even our expectations that when we created the plan for the year. We're seeing the robust category both on value and dollars and on volume and within that of course we're seeing a strong performance from KDP brands led by brand Dr Pepper which grew share again in Q2. I also think on the coffee side, while we are seeing a more muted total coffee contribution, it's a great opportunity to bolster at-home coffee consumption through value-oriented tactics. I talk about affordability as one of our three key tactics. Thanks to opening price point brewers, value messaging versus coffee shops which we put out there in Q2 and so on. There are challenges as well in certain parts of our portfolio and the one that I speak to is still beverages. I think still beverages and some of the other categories perhaps even energy that skew themselves towards C-Store, towards single bottle or can purchase, those were seeing a little bit more pressure. So that's how we're seeing it. The great news is when you look at the entire basket of our portfolio, I would say it is on plan and that's why that gives us the confidence that and the strength of our ramp in the back half around partners give us the confidence to continue to confirm MSD on the top-line. Yeah, thanks, Peter. Yeah, I tell you we have good line of sight to sequentially stronger top-line growth in the back half in Q3 and Q4. And the good news for us is it reflects factors largely within our control. I would say it is not predicated on a need for a significant change in terms of consumer health or macro. The single greatest driver of that top-line acceleration does lie with these partnerships that are continuing to scale. Lead among them is Electrolit. Electrolit will continue to ramp in Q3 and Q4. We're very pleased with the distribution hand over that we've had so far and that is continuing to ramp on a geographic and an account level and will be a meaningful incremental contributor in Q3 and Q4. Shifting to the coffee side of the house, I'd point out Black Rifle. Black Rifle is a new brand that we signed on I think I mentioned it at the tail end of last call and that will continue to ramp into Q3 and Q4. La Colombe is another that will contribute more to the top -line in the back half. So, partnerships is a big part of it. On the base business side, I mentioned some of our innovation, we're really pleased with what we seen on for example Creamy Coconut, Canada dry Fruit Splash, the Bai WonderWater restage and then we have more to come that actually will begin to hit in Q3, think core hydration Olympics sponsorship with US Gymnastics. We've got a big program for Mott's at back-to-school, I'd say one of our biggest in years and I stand to hesitate to tell you about another season of Fansville. I've seen that the team's work on Dr Pepper Fansville and I am telling you if you're a College Football and Dr Pepper fan, you're going to be excited about what. And I remind you we've got an extended season of College Football this year. So, we feel good about it. The last one I talk about is International. International right now strong double-digit growth in Q2 and we expect international to continue to be a meaningful contributor. So, it is not an easy operating environment. It is mixed and uneven. But we're confident about our plans and really focused on strong execution to deliver on our outlook. Yeah. Thanks, Lauren. As mentioned, when we think about driving our coffee business, we're really focused in three areas, affordability, premiumization, and cold coffee. And I think those first two do reflect this barbell strategy as we've called it and the bifurcation we're seeing in across the consumer landscape. Your question primarily was in that affordability area and indeed pricing and absolute price and price gap is one element of that. I would say specifically to your question and how we're feeling on price gaps, we feel good. We feel good. The move that was made late last year did put us more at historic price gap levels. I do think as Sudhanshu said and as we said in the prepared remarks, with green coffee going up right now, it is a little bit at odds with the current promotional dynamic that's going on. We're going to closely monitor that and obviously take a measured and nuanced approach. But our affordability strategy is much more than that. And one of them is the down counts so that was part of your question as well specifically on two of our key sizes 12 count at Food channel, we downsized to 10 counts. That is done in terms of from a production standpoint. So you'll continue to see a little bit of that 12 count still out in the marketplace. But it's rolling through as we speak, some retail some channels are already fully in 10 others are still working through 12. We've seen a good response from that Lauren, in terms of volume response as we would expect and obviously that allows us to hit an everyday price point and a promoted price point that is more in line with what consumers are looking for especially at that low and mid income level. I'll remind you that as you look at total food and beverage, 40 is actually a top five dollar per unit outlay because of its multi-serve nature. And these down counts 12 to 10 and then I'll reference the other big one in the club channel it was a 100 count and that's down to an 80 count and that also allows us to hit key price points. So you've got the pack down counts. You've got the value messaging, I think In the last quarter Lauren, I remember you asked me a question on that and indeed we went live with that feeling good about that. I think that is very resonant and compelling messaging positioning our coffee single-serve at-home, the quality, the variety in a broader frame of coffee shop and away from home. And the last thing I'd point to on affordability is entry price brewers. We're seeing that we're growing the Keurig system within the total coffee maker category and part of that is entry price brewers. So that's the affordability. I will stop there, but I remind you and others that there's also a great premium strategy as well, as well as a big push into cold coffee. Thanks, Dara. No doubt, at-home coffee volumes remain muted in Q2 and I'd say at a similar level to what we saw in Q1. I would also say it's not all that different from many food and beverage categories today. Importantly, within at-home coffee, the single-serve category outperformed as it has the last many years and did as well. We're feeling good about the progress we've made across a number of initiatives, the ones I mentioned to Lauren, affordability, premiumization, and cold coffee. But I think we have a - an appropriate outlook for the balance of the year in terms of expectations and our guidance contemplates that muted revenue contribution from coffee. In tougher macroeconomic times, we have seen shifts in consumption from away-from-home channels, to at-home channels. And that does tend to benefit our business on the coffee side, as well as on the liquid refreshment beverages side. Obviously, more of our business is in at-home business than away-from-home. So I think in general, if as we see that trend and certainly based on some of the actions we're taking around price promotion, around down counts, around value marketing in the broader frame, I think that conserve as well. You also referenced energy and let me give you a few comments on that. Energy in my view is a highly attractive space. It is over time, over these last many years consistently faster volume growth than really any other major beverage category. That is also the case on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis from volume standpoint, energy remains the fastest growing as it did in \u201823 and in '22. Now within that, we have seen a slowdown of late and the volumes have moderated. I do think that is related to the broader macro and some of the pressure we're seeing of consumers, particularly in low and mid income energy obviously skews to C-Store. It skews to single bottle purchase and that's where you're seeing a little bit more pressure in certain channels like gas and convenience. But for me, that doesn't change what I characterize as a constructive view on the energy category. Energy. addresses a clear set of needs for consumers. It occupies clear demand spaces. I think there's a lot of interesting nuances and opportunities within energy to build out sub-segments and you're seeing that today in terms of challenger brands that are coming in relative to the big large historic incumbents. And I look, tell you Dara that you that there's significant helpful penetration gains still for the energy category as it relates other beverage categories, think CSDs. Last thing I'll tell you on energy is, we continue to be excited about our position with C4. C4 has strong momentum. I think in the quarter, our C4 business on a retail sales basis grew about 30% and at only 3% market share we believe we have meaningful runway for growth. Yes. Hi, Chris. So, let's start coffee back half and then we'll go to ref bev. As you said we're encouraged by the slow and steady progress we're seeing. in K-Cup volume trends and I will point out that we've now had four consecutive quarters of sequential improvement in K-Cup volume. And we were pleased to see our K-Cup shipments stabilized in the second quarter flat - I think up 20, 20 basis points. So this slow and steady improvement trend is clearly there. There's always going to be potential for quarter-to-quarter lumpiness, but I would expect that the H2 second half pod shipment trend will improve versus H1 in particularly in Q4. And indeed, that improvement has been underpinned by the progress we're making in our owned and licensed business, the market share progress we are seeing I referenced some successful innovation, the work we're doing again in the three areas around affordability, premiumization, cold coffee. And a big push into cold coffee the back half. That's pods, that's refreshers, that's also our new Brew + Chill brewer and that'll be the first brewer that actually brews out a cold cup of coffee. So feeling good about the progress in coffee in the back half. As it relates to refreshment beverages, I'm pleased with both the base business and the new partners. And they will both play a meaningful role in the back half. The ramp, as I said earlier will be more around what we see from partner contribution, Electrolit, La Colombe, C4, et cetera. And I think we've said earlier then on a full year basis we expect those new partnerships to add about 200 basis points to total company net sales and I would tell you we continue to feel good about that number. Thanks [Indiscernible] As the pioneer here in the single-serve and the category's steward, we're most focused on high quality activity should drive sustainable single-serve category growth. And that's of course for us, but for all our participants and all of our partners in the Keurig ecosystem. And that includes our work on innovation, in consumer marketing, value messaging, both on brewers and on pods. That said, right now there are some promotional dynamics at play in the category and in response to that, at the end of the year and early this year we did take some steps to appropriately position ourselves versus competition. I think inherent in your question is this tensions leave all that. The building backdrop around green coffee prices is a bit at odds with some of the promotional activity and I would say over long term it does not appear to be sustainable. So from our standpoint, of course we're doing the right thing around striking that balance around protecting our positions and making sure that we also have the margin structure we need to continue to drive the entire ecosystem. Obviously, part of that is the way that we manage commodities and our hedging position which I think we've shared in the past, that's usually six to nine months out. And so that means the higher green coffee could begin to impact our P&L progressively over the course of H2, second half. So, we're going to continue to closely monitor that situation. Our intent here is to responsibly manage our price gaps while also protecting our ability to fund high quality reinvestment to drive the single-serve category."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Keurig Dr Pepper First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to introduce the company's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Initiatives, Jane Gelfand. Please go ahead. \nJane Gelfand: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release detailing our first quarter results, which we will discuss during this conference call. We have also added a slide presentation to our earnings material. The slides accompany our prepared remarks and can be tracked in real time on the live webcast. They will be archived on our IR website afterwards. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements, which reflect KDP's judgment, assumptions and analysis only as of today. Our actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting KDP's business. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements discussed today. \n For more information, please refer to our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Consistent with previous quarters, we will be discussing our Q1 performance on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, which reflects constant currency growth rates and excludes items affecting comparability. Definitions and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics are included in our earnings materials. \n Here with us today to discuss our results are Keurig Dr Pepper's Chairman and CEO, Bob Gamgort; Incoming CEO and Chief Operating Officer; Tim Cofer; and Chief Financial Officer and President, International, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi. I'll now turn it over to Bob. \nRobert Gamgort: Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. It has been a busy and exciting start to the year at KDP. First quarter performance was strong, with solid consolidated sales growth and double-digit EPS growth. Momentum in our U.S. refreshment beverages and international segments remained healthy, and U.S. Coffee results showed meaningful sequential recovery. We invested in marketing and capabilities across the business while also delivering attractive broad -- the strong start to the year enhances our visibility to an unchanged on algorithm 2024 growth outlook. \n In Q1, we also advanced several strategic initiatives that position the company for multiyear success and demonstrate our confidence in the value creation opportunity ahead. First, we unveiled a revolutionary future vision for the Keurig brewing system that has been years in the making. When launched, our new proprietary K-Rounds plastic and aluminum-free pods and Keurig Alta brewers will enable consumers to brew a wide variety of hot and cold Barista-style beverages from a single machine using a pod that can be easily and sustainably disposed. This system has the potential to redefine how consumers brew coffee for decades to come, and we're excited to begin beta testing later this year. At the same time, we are committed to growing our preeminent existing K-Cup system, including through a strong slate of innovation in 2024.  \n Second, in Q1, we also took advantage of a highly-compelling and dislocated stock valuation by executing a $1.1 billion buyback of 38 million KDP shares. This was our largest quarterly share purchase -- repurchase in our history, and we have progressively increased our buyback activity over the past several years. And with another $1.8 billion remaining on our authorization, we intend to stay opportunistic, when we see attractive value in our shares. \n Third, we introduced our Evolved enterprise strategy, which we unveiled at an Investor Day hosted last month. This strategic framework combines many of the philosophies and practices that KDP has developed for the last 5 years with new elements intended to drive strong and self-reinforcing growth in our next chapter as a public company. Many elements of this strategy were already evident in our first quarter results.  \n Finally, this morning, we announced that Tim has been appointed KDP's CEO and will join our Board effective tomorrow, marking the culmination of a robust transition process that began when he joined us in November. I have worked closely with Tim over the past several months and have seen firsthand how our company is benefiting from his deep and diversified CPG experience, strategic vision and personification of our challenger culture. I look forward to continuing to partner with Tim and the broader leadership team in my ongoing capacity as KDP's Executive Chairman and could not be more confident in their stewardship of the company's next chapter.  \n With that, I will turn the call over to Tim. \nTimothy Cofer: Thanks, Bob. And good morning, everyone. Let me start by once again expressing my appreciation to Bob and our Board of Directors for the honor and privilege of leading this dynamic company into the future. I'm energized to partner with our 28,000 colleagues across the globe to build on KDP's strong track record and to guide our next chapter of growth and value creation. I see a tremendous amount of upside ahead. At our recent Investor Day, I shared the many elements behind my conviction and discussed how we intend to unlock this future opportunity. If you've not yet had the chance, I would encourage you to watch the replay of that event.  \n Now as Bob mentioned, we recently introduced an Evolved strategy, which is anchored by 5 strategic pillars. These are effectively a road map to guide each of our employees' actions every day, and it includes directives to champion consumer-obsessed brand building, shape our now and next beverage portfolio, amplify our route-to-market advantage, generate fuel for growth and dynamically allocate capital. This strategic framework will guide our company over the next few years and is designed to deliver a sustainable cycle of growth. Each element of this strategy featured in the first quarter, which represented a strong start to the year.  \n Net sales growth accelerated sequentially with continued momentum in U.S. refreshment beverages and international and meaningful progress in U.S. Coffee. Gross margin expanded significantly, driven primarily by robust net productivity, which funded reinvestment to support our future growth and drove strong earnings growth in the quarter. And we flexed our capital allocation priorities toward direct shareholder returns, taking advantage of a unique opportunity to efficiently repurchase a large number of shares at an attractive valuation. Overall, our first quarter performance demonstrates the health of our business and provides enhanced visibility to our unchanged full year outlook for mid-single-digit net sales and high single-digit EPS growth.  \n Taking a closer look at the intersection of strategy and Q1 results, we were encouraged by the quarter-over-quarter acceleration in net sales growth to nearly 3%. Though top line momentum remained pricing-led, volume mix improved to nearly flat, following declines during 2023. Consumer-led innovation leveraging our comprehensive demand space framework was an important contributor to this improvement. \n Here are 2 quick examples. In U.S. refreshment beverages, we launched Canada Dry Fruit Splash, a flavor extension of our second largest CSD brand. The innovation is performing well during the early launch phase, proving incremental to the Canada Drive franchise and driving market share gains. In international, we introduced Schweppes mocktails as the first can mocktail product in Mexico, securing distribution with several large customers and generating very strong initial consumer acceptance. The launch is already exceeding our plan, and we have yet to turn on the advertising. Innovation activity ramps across our portfolio in Q2, and we're excited to build on our initial momentum as we move through 2024. \n Our top line growth during the first quarter also reflected the continued successful execution of our partner strategy. Electrolit sales and distribution commenced in the quarter, and La Colombe ready-to-drink beverages are now ramping through the system with smooth distributor handovers and early traction. C4 Energy also continues to grow strongly, and we achieved further key performance milestones in Q1. DSD execution is a key enabler to this success and we continue to invest to drive greater efficiency throughout the system. \n Improving first quarter trends in U.S. Coffee owned and licensed brands illustrate our commercial and route-to-market effectiveness. Our owned and licensed market share began a recovery, which steadily strengthened throughout the quarter. Distribution growth, increased display activity, price gap management and increased marketing, all contributed and this better trajectory has sustained quarter-to-date with more high-quality activation to come later this year. \n Total KDP gross margin expanded 350 basis points in the first quarter, and gross profit dollars grew approximately 10%. This strong performance reflected an enterprise-wide focus on productivity, which yielded meaningful benefits during the quarter and more than offset persistent inflation as well as the benefit from an additional C4 performance incentive. Our gross profit progress provided important fuel for growth funding reinvestment, including a double-digit increase in marketing also contributed to the very strong bottom line results in Q1. Specifically, operating income grew an impressive 17.5% year-over-year and earnings per share advanced 12% ahead of our ingoing expectations. \n With top line momentum expected to build from here, I'll now spend a few minutes discussing each of our segment's Q1 net sales performance and why we have confidence in the balance of the year. \n Let's start with U.S. refreshment beverages. Revenue momentum remained healthy with mid-single-digit net sales growth in the quarter. Our performance was led by solid growth in CSDs and our expansion in energy and sports hydration, partially offset by softer trends in certain still beverage categories. As anticipated, segment growth moderated from Q4 as we lapped year-ago pricing measures and due to innovation timing, which phases later in '24 when compared to 2023. In Q1, we anniversaried the launch of Dr Pepper Strawberries and Cream, which was a standout success and went on to become the #1 CSD category innovation of 2023. Looking ahead, we expect an exciting 2024 innovation and brand activation slate to drive a larger sales contribution in future periods. \n Our Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut limited time offering is launching as we speak, just in time for the summer season, and it capitalizes on the popular dirty soda social media trend. The complete restage of by Bai WonderWater is just beginning to roll out, and our core hydration partnership with U.S. Gymnastics will be activated during the summer Olympics. We expect these collective activities will have a larger impact in the back half. In addition, our partnership with C4 should continue to enjoy good momentum, and our sales and distribution of Electrolit will build over the course of the year. While the magnitude of overall U.S. refreshment beverage pricing should moderate going forward as we increasingly anniversary year ago activity, some modest incremental pricing across CSDs was announced earlier this year and will contribute to growth. We also continue to optimize price pack architecture to fit consumer needs across the portfolio and various channels. \n Moving now to U.S. Coffee. As expected, net sales strengthened considerably relative to the fourth quarter and decreased at a more modest low single-digit rate in Q1. Notably, volume mix was basically flat, improving from a high single-digit decline last year. There were a number of green shoots in the quarter for U.S. Coffee. Let me outline 5 key elements that bolster our confidence in continued top line recovery in this segment. First, our pod shipment trends improved sequentially. Though at-home coffee category consumption growth remains muted, the trend modestly recovered relative to Q4. More importantly, Keurig's own volume momentum accelerated throughout the quarter. \n Second, our owned and licensed brand market share momentum is building, which is a mix accretive trend. In Q1, we grew owned and licensed total distribution points at a double-digit rate. We increased display activity and supported our brands with higher marketing. In addition, we made tactical adjustments to appropriately align our promotion strategy. This is already having an impact and will allow greater innovation, marketing and activation to shine through in the balance of the year. Owned and licensed share momentum progressively strengthened throughout the quarter, and we expect the trend to continue supported in part by upcoming price pack architecture changes to strengthen the value proposition. \n Third, within the coffee maker category, Keurig and Keurig compatible brewers also continued to gain share in Q1, extending a multiyear track record of outperformance. An exciting innovation like K-Brew + Chill, which has not yet launched and will hit retailer shelves later this year should further support our performance. \n Fourth, as our volume in U.S. Coffee improves, so does our ability to manufacture at a more attractive cost profile. We generated strong productivity during the first quarter, which drove healthy segment margin expansion and funded reinvestment. We're also beginning to optimize our manufacturing footprint to favor high-efficiency locations like Spartanburg, where capacity is ramping and unlocking further network optionality, which should also generate fuel for growth. \n And finally, fifth, the Keurig partnership proposition remains very strong as evidenced by multiple recent brand additions to our ecosystem. Lavazza will transition from a partner to a licensed brand during the second quarter. Also in Q1, we reached agreements to welcome Brooklyn Roasting Company; Shark Tank favorite, Kahawa 1893 Coffee; and Canadian super premium brand, Kicking Horse to our roster. And just this morning, we are announcing the addition of Black Rifle Coffee as a new partner. Black Rifle Coffee's success in the coffee industry is already well established, and their decision to evolve to a Keurig system partner speaks to the full value proposition of our stewardship of the single-serve category. Our La Colombe ready-to-drink coffee partnership is yet another proof point and is just now beginning to scale. In total, these exciting partnerships will begin to contribute to U.S. coffee segment volume growth later in 2024. \n Moving on to international, which is becoming an increasingly significant part of our business and is a core part of our strategic agenda. The segment's strong sales performance continued into the first quarter with high single-digit growth on a constant currency basis and broad-based strength across categories and markets. Our cold beverages portfolio performed particularly well in Latin America, reflecting continued strong DSD execution. Performance was led by our powerhouse Pe\u00f1afiel brand, which continues to enjoy strong base momentum even as we extend the brand into new adjacencies. For instance, we recently launched Pe\u00f1afiel soft seltzers, which offers sparkling mineral water with a refreshing touch of flavor, no calories, no sugar and with 100% natural flavors. \n We also further grew our segment presence in the low and no alcohol alternatives category, with continued share gains for Atypique in Canada and strong retail and consumer reception for our launch of Schweppes mocktails in Mexico. In our Canadian coffee business, market share grew for Keurig brewers and for our owned and licensed pod portfolio led by the Van Houtte brand. As in the U.S., we continue to strengthen our international route to market. And earlier this month, we announced a multiyear partnership with the Toronto Blue Jays for pour rights at their ballpark. We're excited to expand Canada Dry, Dr Pepper, Clamato, Crush and Atypique within the on-premise channel and will continue to seek out opportunities to thoughtfully build the distribution of our brands outside the U.S. \n In short, we're pleased with the promising start to the year. We demonstrated sequential top line progress in the quarter and delivered broad-based growth in adjusted operating income and margins across our segments. We did this while simultaneously funding high quality reinvestment in our brands and capabilities. Sudhanshu will speak more about our margin progress and our intention to continue balancing growth and reinvestment in the coming quarters. We're confident this approach will reinforce our 2024 outlook for on algorithm, top and bottom line growth, which remains unchanged while also powering a virtuous cycle growth over a multiyear time frame. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sudhanshu. \nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Thanks, Tim. And good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results were strong, demonstrating sequentially improving net sales growth, continued meaningful gross margin expansion and incremental investments in marketing and capabilities. With EPS ahead of our plan, we intend to use Q1 upside as additional pool for reinvestment to support revenue growth over the balance of year and as buffer against pockets of reemerging commodity inflation. \n First quarter net revenue grew 2.8% in constant currency. Healthy momentum continued in our U.S. refreshment beverages, and International segments and we are encouraged by the sequential top line recovery in U.S. Coffee. On a consolidated basis, we realized positive net pricing, up 3.1% year-over-year. This was driven by favorable pricing in our U.S. refreshment beverages and international portfolios, balanced against previously flagged targeted price investments in U.S. Coffee. Importantly, consolidated volume mix improved to nearly flat year-over-year, showing a modest 0.3% decline in the quarter. Gross margin expanded significantly up 350 basis points, driven by the favorable combined impact of productivity, pricing and normalizing inflation. \n Gross margins also reflected a performance incentive related to strong commercial execution of our C4 partnership. This benefit contributed slightly over 100 basis points to the gross margin in the quarter and now offers us extra flexibility to drive future reinvestment. SG&A deleveraged 50 basis points in Q1 due in part to a double-digit increase in marketing. All in, total company operating income grew very strongly up 17.5% year-over-year with EPS increasing 12%.\n Moving to the segments. U.S. Refreshment Beverages net sales grew 4.3%, led by 5.6 percentage points of pricing.  Elasticities remain manageable across most categories and volume mix declined 1.3%, including an initial contribution from our electrolyte partnership. As expected, our relative market share and net sales performance reflected a later innovation cadence relative to 2023, particularly in CSDs. These calendar differences will normalize as new products get introduced and our innovation gains traction. In other words, segment net sales drivers should rebalance further towards volume mix as market share performance improves and as the magnitude of pricing contribution moderates considerably from here. Segment operating income grew an impressive 22.4% in the quarter and margins expanded 440 basis points. \n Tailwinds included pricing, strong productivity, and the C4 performance incentive, I mentioned earlier. This combination of factors helps fund higher marketing in the quarter. All in, we have good line of sight to continued operating income gains in U.S. Refreshment Beverages over the balance of the year though not at the same magnitude as we experienced over the last couple of quarters. U.S. Coffee top line trends significantly recovered relative to Q4 as expected, while net sales declined 2.1% volume mix was close to flat down a modest 0.3% year-over-year. Pod shipments continued their multi-quarter improvement trajectory and decreased 1.1%. This progress was driven by a steady recovery in volume and market share momentum across our owned and licensed portfolio during the quarter. \n With multiple elements underpinning this trend, including greater distribution and display and a more appropriately aligned promotional strategy, we expect innovation and activation to begin having an even greater impact in the balance of the year. Brewer shipments increased 26% in Q1 due to a combination of improving trends in the coffee maker category, continued Keurig market share gains and timing benefits. On a rolling 12-month basis, which smooths out some of the inherent quarterly brewer volatility, shipments are still down just under 2%, representing an improving trend versus the double-digit decline we experienced in 2023. Segment net pricing decreased 1.8%, primarily due to previously discussed promotional adjustments across our owned and licensed portfolio. This is in response to competitive activity that began in Q3 last year and continues today. \n These recalibrations more than offset the continued benefit of pricing we are realizing through partner contracts while improving segment mix. U.S. Coffee operating income advanced 1.4% and margins expanded 110 basis points versus the prior year driven by productivity savings and easing cost pressures, partially offset by higher marketing spend. As expected, the rate of segment margin expansion moderated versus the back half of 2023 as we are managing towards a more balanced top and bottom line outcome in this segment in 2024. We are pleased with the progress we made during quarter 1.\n International segment net sales grew 11.8%. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 7% with very solid volume mix growth of 4.8% and pricing up 2.2% year-over-year. Our performance included growth across market and categories with particular strength in Latin American LRBs. Segment operating income advanced very strongly, up 25% in constant currency terms. Volume mix growth, pricing and productivity netted favorably against inflation and higher marketing. We also continued to invest in route-to-market capabilities including the on-premise expansion in Canada that Tim mentioned and by strengthening our DSD network in Mexico. Given its outside growth potential, investing in our international business is a significant priority and should support an increased top and bottom line contribution from the segment in 2024 and over time. \n Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our Q1 free cash flow represented a use of $73 million. Cash generation is seasonally lower during the first quarter, and the year-over-year difference in free cash flow versus Q1 2023 was largely a function of a front-loaded cadence to our CapEx investment this year. In absolute terms, free cash flow also remained weighed down by roughly $400 million of reductions in supplier financing arrangements. We expect the impact of the carryover effects of these changes to moderate over the coming quarters and for free cash flow to accelerate with full year conversion projected considerably ahead of 2023 levels. \n This will support our capital allocation agenda. Our priorities include making organic and inorganic investments to further our growth, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through a steadily growing dividend, and via opportunistic share buybacks. We will remain dynamic in managing across these priorities at any point in time with a balanced approach over the long term. For example, in Q1, we repurchased 38 million shares for a total of $1.1 billion, taking advantage of an attractive valuation and the liquidity event presented by JAB secondary offering. Though our management leverage ratio increased modestly as a result, we remain committed to our long-term target of 2 to 2.5x. \n Moving now to our 2024 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net sales and high single-digit EPS growth in 2024, both consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. Our plans continue to embed strong top line momentum in our U.S. Refreshment Beverages and International segments with a relatively muted growth contribution from U.S. Coffee. We expect productivity savings to help offset a more normal level of inflation. There are, however, pockets of reemerging commodity inflation, for instance, in the green coffee price. We will need to monitor and manage these, particularly in the back half. \n Throughout the balance of the year, we also plan to continue to deploy investment dollars behind brands and capabilities to support our top line growth. The incremental flexibility afforded to us by our Q1 outperformance should enable us to balance these concentrations. As a result, we continue to anticipate healthy operating profit growth and full year operating margin expansion on a consolidated basis. Consistent with our original guide, we expect some of this operating momentum to be offset by a net headwind from below-the-line items, constraining operating profit flow-through to EPS. Our '24 outlook embeds the following below-the-line assumptions, which now reflect share repurchase and financing activity from Q1. Interest expense in a $625 million to $645 million range for the full year and effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% and approximately 1.37 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. \n In closing, we are pleased with the stronger-than-anticipated start to the year, which bolsters our confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance while fueling a virtuous cycle for the long term. \n With that, I will now turn the call back to Tim to close. \nTimothy Cofer: Thanks, Sudhanshu. Before we move to Q&A, I want to thank our KDP colleagues for embodying our company's challenger mindset every day. In Q1, we collectively put the business on an accelerating path in a dynamic macro environment. Strong execution was visible across our results and in every country end market in which we compete. We intend to keep building momentum as the year progresses. Bob, Sudhanshu, the broader executive team, and I, feel the team's energy and enthusiasm for KDP's Evolved strategy, which was particularly evident at this month's annual summit of the company's top leaders. Together, we're excited to activate this strategy to unlock considerable future value for our shareholders. \n Thanks for the time, and we're now happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane: Tim, congratulations on the new role. And Bob, hopefully, it sticks this time, right? I don't want you to come back. \nRobert Gamgort: I'm confident it will, Bryan. \nBryan Spillane: So Sudhanshu, I just wanted to pick up on the comment you made about inflation and understand green coffee cost. If you could also give us a perspective on aluminum, just there's given the headlines about the sanctions and just the potential increases in aluminum cost, how we should be thinking about that? And Tim, maybe just on the coffee point, if we're going to see green coffee inflation, but we've also been discounting to get price points in line with where consumers see value, how do we just think about managing margins in coffee if we do see a sustained increase in green coffee costs? \nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Let me take the first inflation question, and then Tim will take over -- take the next question. So our inflation, we continue to expect some inflation in 2024 overall, but at a more moderate level than in recent year. We talked about green coffee. We're also seeing inflation in aluminum, but as you know, we manage it within our guidance, within our range of outcomes, and we have factored all of these inflation and commodity. We also had some stuff for 6 to 9 months in our guidance. So our overall guidance for the year, which is mid-single-digit top line and high single-digit EPS factors in all of these scenarios. \nTimothy Cofer: Yes, Brian, I'll take the second part of your question. I mean stepping back on coffee, obviously, as the pioneers of single-serve, coffee here in the U.S. and the steward of the category with almost 80% share of manufactured pods, our primary focus is on growing the entire ecosystem. And that's quite honestly more important than maximizing market share of any given brand. We aren't particularly interested in competing on price. But at the same time and to your point, we did make some decisions of late to protect, particularly our owned and licensed brand portfolio when we felt that our competitive positioning was impacted based on some competitive movement that we saw in the back half of last year. So we did make the decision to adjust the pricing really a couple of points around price gaps. \n Having said that, Brian, I would say when you look at our first quarter results, yes, there were some tactical promotional adjustments. But we also grew our owned and licensed distribution points actually at a double-digit rate. We increased display activity. We also brand support, brought some innovation. And I think all of these factors contributed to important strengthening of our business on owned and licensed. And I expect going forward, other activity around the innovation agenda, you've heard us talk about, both on pods and brewers, accelerated marketing and activation will help us drive continued strength in or, I would say, improving sequential strength in coffee for the balance of the year. \nOperator: The next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman: I wanted to talk a little bit about marketing in coffee because one of the things that I've been thinking about recently is that the messaging that you've shared with The Street, the messaging on affordability, some of the advertising you've shared, all feels very spot on. And yet, perhaps over the last 12 months, you haven't had the reach to consumers or the impact to consumers that you might have hoped on some -- communication of some of messages. And so as we're thinking about affordability still being very much a concern and I would think a selling point of single-serve Keurig Coffee and also the launch of iced -- sorry, the chill machine. \n I want to hear a little bit more about maybe how you're targeting or approaching marketing differently, key channels to reach the consumer and what you might be doing to kind of turn up the volume or do things a bit differently than you did in 2023 to get better reach with those messages. \nTimothy Cofer: Absolutely. So we are seeing and we saw it this quarter an increase in our total marketing investment on coffee. And I think as we've realigned back to the question that Brian asked making sure that from a price point standpoint, we feel good about our owned and licensed brand. It's an opportunity now for our marketing and innovation to work even harder. I think there's -- we're employing what we characterize as a bit of a barbell strategy, reflecting both the opportunity to reinforce value on our pod business as well as drive on the premium side. \n When you look at the consumer broadly, you do see at the higher income levels a really robust participation in the Keurig ecosystem and actually growing sales. Where we see a little bit more pressure, of late, is on the lower and mid income. And to that end, you will see new marketing coming starting in the second quarter. That is more sharply focused on a value message, particularly against a broader frame of away-from-home coffee. While at-home coffee represents 3/4 of the volume, away-from-home coffee is the larger dollar ring. And we think in today's economic environment and given the quality and variety that we're providing, a sharper value-based message will be one that's well received and you will see that activated as of Q2 this year. So that's yet to come. \n Another one is around our iced and cold platform and indeed launching the refreshers that we've done, which is obviously a big part of away-from-home coffee shop experience as well as new iced pods and the new Brew + Chill brewer that will be launching in the fall, that will also be incremental and new marketing against that platform, which I think is a big source of growth opportunity for us. And then, finally, on the premium and super premium, we've really rounded out our roster. I made reference to a number of new partners into the Keurig ecosystem at the premium and super premium level, you will see marketing against that. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention as well from a total coffee consumption standpoint, the big opportunity around ready-to-drink and single serve with our La Colombe partnership, and you'll see marketing against that. So I think we've got a stacked series of new news, both in terms of innovation and marketing messaging. Most of that is yet to come as we go through the year. \nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. \nChristopher Carey: So 2 quick questions. First on the coffee business. So adding Black Rifle, very interesting development. Can you just talk about how that partnership came to be and whether this makes you more confident on your ability to continue to see sequential improvement in your coffee volumes into the back half of the year and perhaps into 2025, just given the momentum around that business? And then if I could, just on the cold side, Sudhanshu mentioned some of the innovation timing dynamics of the underlying cold business. Would you expect those to start looking better as innovation comes to market? And can you just remind us on timing of the innovation suite specifically with Creamy Coconut. \nTimothy Cofer: Sure. So first on Black Rifle, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are excited to welcome Black Rifle into the Keurig ecosystem. I think Black Rifle's coffee success, I'm sure you know what, Chris, is already well established in the coffee industry. And I think their decision to evolve to a Keurig system partner really reinforces our full value proposition and our stewardship as the single-serve category leader. So pleased with that development. \n Bigger picture, and I referenced it in the prepared remarks, we partner with a broad range of coffee brands nationwide and we're about offering consumers choice and variety and a great high-quality cup of coffee and really providing consumers the diversity of their preferences and Black Rifle coffee is the newest addition, but it's one of many and one that we feel good joining our system. As it relates to cold and refreshment beverage, indeed, we have a slightly different phasing of the major innovation on our refreshment beverage this year versus last year. We mentioned this in our February call. But when you look at our relative market share here in Q1, we're under a little bit of pressure right now. We expected that. \n It reflects that later innovation cadence. And the one I draw your attention to was really a blockbuster for us last year, and that was Dr Pepper Strawberries and Cream. It launched early in the first quarter of last year. It enjoyed a very strong start. And in fact, it became the #1 CSD category innovation in the industry in 2023. This year, we're seeing a slightly later phasing of that. \n So as we speak, we're launching Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut. You can find it in your local store. It's a great product. We're also rolling out a complete restage of our Bai still portfolio under the banner of Bai WonderWater in partnership with Sydney Sweeney. We're launching, I would say, reinvigorating our core water business hydration business with U.S. gymnastics partnership. So we've got a lot of activity that really is starting now in Q2 and will ramp into the back half of the year. On top of that, I would mention what you know as well, which is continued strong C4 contribution and a continuing distribution ramp of our Electrolit partnership. Therefore, you see more of the firepower hitting in the back half of '24 versus '23. \nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. \nPeter Grom: So maybe building on the partner brands, I was hoping to get some color on C4. Maybe first, I would just love to get your perspective on kind of what you're seeing from the category more broadly. Trends have moderated quite a bit across the board. So just any thoughts on what you think could be driving that. And then just on C4 specifically, continued strong growth, some share gains here. You have visibility on where you're sourcing these share gains from? Do you think it's coming from kind of the legacy brands like a Monster or Redbull? Or do you really think it's coming at the expense of maybe some of the other performance energy drink brands? \nTimothy Cofer: Yes. Yes, absolutely. Well, we continue to be really pleased with our partnership with C4. I think I shared at Investor Day as of that moment with since KDP took the distribution partnership with C4, and we made that minority investment stake. TDPs are up close to 60%. Sales are up 65%, and we continue to see growth potential for C4. C4 has got some exciting innovation this year around flavor extensions and around sizing and packaging configurations as well. Indeed, the Energy segment broadly, as you have mentioned, Peter, has seen some softening versus what was a multiyear run. \n I think Energy remains very much a resilient category and one that particularly among Gen-Xennials will continue to play a huge role in daily beverage choice. As it relates to sourcing, we see sourcing broadly. I'm not going to get into specifics around any given competitors, but I think it's both sourcing from other large players in energy as well as broader liquid refreshment beverage, particularly among youth as they make various choices on their caffeine carrier. \nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. \nStephen Robert Powers: Congrats, Tim and Bob as well, from me. Tim, I wanted to play back what you said just a couple of minutes ago on the cadence of sequential improvement in underlying refreshment beverage performance. It sounds like with the innovation you're launching now in CSDs and then the Bai relaunch, et cetera, it sounds like we should see sequential improvement in market share this quarter as we're looking at consumption data, but the full financial impact is going to be more skewed to the second half. I just want to make sure I got that right. \nTimothy Cofer: That's correct. \nStephen Robert Powers: Okay. Great. And then if I could take a longer-term perspective with respect to the Alta brewer system. As you pursue that, I was just curious as to the engagement you expect from some of your partners. And as you beta test and scale, do you expect to do that with a relatively full brand assortment? Or is that more of a longer-term endeavor? \nRoger Johnson: Yes, Steve, it's Bob. On the Alta system, obviously, we're excited about its potential to continue to drive growth in the total single-serve category. And as Tim, I think, nicely said earlier, that is our top priority. We previewed the system with all of our partners, and they've been involved every step in the way. \n And our decision on how we roll out the system, which brands are in initially and how we continue to execute that over time, we're still very much in the early stages of that, but it's an active conversation with the partners. \nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. \nRobert Ottenstein: Two kind of follow-ups. First, on the pod business, could you remind us or maybe update us just in terms of what the business mix looks like between owned, licensed partner, private label, so we just kind of level set where we are on that. And related to that is there any change in strategy in terms of how you're looking at those categories and your emphasis? Or is it just pretty much as it has been? \n And then second question, great to see all the share buybacks. Does the commitment to the share buybacks, is it purely opportunistic? Or does it, in any way, reflect even a slight philosophical change from where you were 3 or 4 years ago, let's say in terms of use of excess cash flow, maybe a slight pivot towards share buybacks versus inorganic growth. \nTimothy Cofer: Yes. I'll take that first question on pods, and then I'll defer it to Sudhanshu on the second part of your question. I mean broadly, and you see this in the syndicated data when you look at the full estate around pods, you're looking at roughly I'll do round numbers here, Rob. 50% is our partners, 25% owned and licensed, 25% -- well, 20% private label. So that's the broad makeup of the mix. And our strategy hasn't changed. As I said at the beginning, we are stewards of the entire category. Our responsibility is to grow the category and grow the entire ecosystem. \n Obviously, owned and licensed brand give us an additional mix benefit and one that we keep an eye on and want to be sure that they continue to stay robust. I made some comments both in the prepared remarks and in earlier Q&A on what we've done to not only protect that franchise, but also to grow it. And I think we've got a great innovation slate and a series of marketing initiatives here to go to keep our owned and licensed business robust, but very much view ourselves as stewards of the entire category. And then I'll pass to Sudhanshu. \nSudhanshu Priyadarshi: Yes. So regarding the share buyback, as you know, we had $4 billion worth of authorization, and it is opportunistic for us. Our #1 priority in capital allocation and investment in our own business, organic and inorganic growth. Number two is maintaining the strong balance sheet, our long-term leverage target of 2x to 2.5x. But we keep it very dynamic in terms of how we manage quarter after quarter, year after year. So you saw us, we saw opportunistic pricing with JAB secondary sales, and we purchased 38 million shares in 2024. 2023, we purchased close to 22 million shares. And 2022, we purchased 11 million shares. We still have $1.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase, but we will continue to be opportunistic when we see value in our stock price, we will go and buyback shares. \nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. \nAndrea Teixeira: So my question is on consumption. First on coffee, can you comment on the exit rate of pod consumption? And how should we think about the cadence of innovation, you had a lot of, in this call, in terms of that cadence in particular. And also Alta, I understand this is beta testing, but when we should expect that to conclude and to start commercializing. And for cold refreshments on the Creamy Coconut Dr Pepper, how can we pretty much eclipse with the Strawberry Cream lap and how we should be thinking about that? And if I can squeeze the marketing commentary that you had about the A&P investments, how we should be thinking in the cadence of the quarters. \nTimothy Cofer: Andrea, thanks. Let me make sure I can get through all these. I think first on pod shipments and consumption, as referenced, we saw sequential improvement in our pod shipment trend during Q1, and that was underpinned by better trends at POS. So we've seen both a modest improvement in the at-home coffee category broadly. And then as mentioned, a real acceleration in KDP specific volume driven by the recovering share trends, particularly on owned and licensed. So feel good overall that minus 1%, near flat pod shipment performance in Q1 is obviously significantly above what we saw in Q4 and the back half of last year. \n In terms of consumption versus shipments, we're comfortable overall with the pod inventory levels and didn't see any unusual changes. So it's really consumption-driven and continuing. While not perfectly linear, I would say, we expect a gradual recovery in pod volumes and consumptions through the balance of the year underpinned by the initiatives that we've talked about already on this call. You then asked about Alta. We're doing a beta test in the fall with limited consumer really to get the learning around what's working, how we can optimize, et cetera. At this point, there isn't already a predetermined path. Obviously, we have various scenarios and plans. But we're going to take the time to learn from that and then scale it up afterwards based on those learnings. So more specificity to come following the beta test that starts this fall. \n Then as it relates to CSD innovation, indeed, as I said earlier, we're lapping in Q1 just a blockbuster #1 innovation in the entire CSD category last year. So that's what you're seeing in some of the share pressure. Year to go, I think we've got a stacked innovation plan, including with the Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut and many of the others. Canada Dried Fruit Splash is already doing well. And we're only at, I would say, less than half ACV. So that's yet to ramp fully, including in some of the biggest markets. So you will see that phase more to the back half. And then what was it? Was that it? Good. Thank you, Andrea. And obviously, happy to follow up with you further, the IR team, or me on more questions. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jane Gelfand for any closing remarks. \nJane Gelfand: Thank you, Betsy. And thank you, everyone, for participating this morning. As Tim said, we are available all day to answer any follow-up questions and look forward to continued engagement. Thank you. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Timothy Cofer",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. And good morning, everyone. Let me start by once again expressing my appreciation to Bob and our Board of Directors for the honor and privilege of leading this dynamic company into the future. I'm energized to partner with our 28,000 colleagues across the globe to build on KDP's strong track record and to guide our next chapter of growth and value creation. I see a tremendous amount of upside ahead. At our recent Investor Day, I shared the many elements behind my conviction and discussed how we intend to unlock this future opportunity. If you've not yet had the chance, I would encourage you to watch the replay of that event.  \n Now as Bob mentioned, we recently introduced an Evolved strategy, which is anchored by 5 strategic pillars. These are effectively a road map to guide each of our employees' actions every day, and it includes directives to champion consumer-obsessed brand building, shape our now and next beverage portfolio, amplify our route-to-market advantage, generate fuel for growth and dynamically allocate capital. This strategic framework will guide our company over the next few years and is designed to deliver a sustainable cycle of growth. Each element of this strategy featured in the first quarter, which represented a strong start to the year.  \n Net sales growth accelerated sequentially with continued momentum in U.S. refreshment beverages and international and meaningful progress in U.S. Coffee. Gross margin expanded significantly, driven primarily by robust net productivity, which funded reinvestment to support our future growth and drove strong earnings growth in the quarter. And we flexed our capital allocation priorities toward direct shareholder returns, taking advantage of a unique opportunity to efficiently repurchase a large number of shares at an attractive valuation. Overall, our first quarter performance demonstrates the health of our business and provides enhanced visibility to our unchanged full year outlook for mid-single-digit net sales and high single-digit EPS growth.  \n Taking a closer look at the intersection of strategy and Q1 results, we were encouraged by the quarter-over-quarter acceleration in net sales growth to nearly 3%. Though top line momentum remained pricing-led, volume mix improved to nearly flat, following declines during 2023. Consumer-led innovation leveraging our comprehensive demand space framework was an important contributor to this improvement. \n Here are 2 quick examples. In U.S. refreshment beverages, we launched Canada Dry Fruit Splash, a flavor extension of our second largest CSD brand. The innovation is performing well during the early launch phase, proving incremental to the Canada Drive franchise and driving market share gains. In international, we introduced Schweppes mocktails as the first can mocktail product in Mexico, securing distribution with several large customers and generating very strong initial consumer acceptance. The launch is already exceeding our plan, and we have yet to turn on the advertising. Innovation activity ramps across our portfolio in Q2, and we're excited to build on our initial momentum as we move through 2024. \n Our top line growth during the first quarter also reflected the continued successful execution of our partner strategy. Electrolit sales and distribution commenced in the quarter, and La Colombe ready-to-drink beverages are now ramping through the system with smooth distributor handovers and early traction. C4 Energy also continues to grow strongly, and we achieved further key performance milestones in Q1. DSD execution is a key enabler to this success and we continue to invest to drive greater efficiency throughout the system. \n Improving first quarter trends in U.S. Coffee owned and licensed brands illustrate our commercial and route-to-market effectiveness. Our owned and licensed market share began a recovery, which steadily strengthened throughout the quarter. Distribution growth, increased display activity, price gap management and increased marketing, all contributed and this better trajectory has sustained quarter-to-date with more high-quality activation to come later this year. \n Total KDP gross margin expanded 350 basis points in the first quarter, and gross profit dollars grew approximately 10%. This strong performance reflected an enterprise-wide focus on productivity, which yielded meaningful benefits during the quarter and more than offset persistent inflation as well as the benefit from an additional C4 performance incentive. Our gross profit progress provided important fuel for growth funding reinvestment, including a double-digit increase in marketing also contributed to the very strong bottom line results in Q1. Specifically, operating income grew an impressive 17.5% year-over-year and earnings per share advanced 12% ahead of our ingoing expectations. \n With top line momentum expected to build from here, I'll now spend a few minutes discussing each of our segment's Q1 net sales performance and why we have confidence in the balance of the year. \n Let's start with U.S. refreshment beverages. Revenue momentum remained healthy with mid-single-digit net sales growth in the quarter. Our performance was led by solid growth in CSDs and our expansion in energy and sports hydration, partially offset by softer trends in certain still beverage categories. As anticipated, segment growth moderated from Q4 as we lapped year-ago pricing measures and due to innovation timing, which phases later in '24 when compared to 2023. In Q1, we anniversaried the launch of Dr Pepper Strawberries and Cream, which was a standout success and went on to become the #1 CSD category innovation of 2023. Looking ahead, we expect an exciting 2024 innovation and brand activation slate to drive a larger sales contribution in future periods. \n Our Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut limited time offering is launching as we speak, just in time for the summer season, and it capitalizes on the popular dirty soda social media trend. The complete restage of by Bai WonderWater is just beginning to roll out, and our core hydration partnership with U.S. Gymnastics will be activated during the summer Olympics. We expect these collective activities will have a larger impact in the back half. In addition, our partnership with C4 should continue to enjoy good momentum, and our sales and distribution of Electrolit will build over the course of the year. While the magnitude of overall U.S. refreshment beverage pricing should moderate going forward as we increasingly anniversary year ago activity, some modest incremental pricing across CSDs was announced earlier this year and will contribute to growth. We also continue to optimize price pack architecture to fit consumer needs across the portfolio and various channels. \n Moving now to U.S. Coffee. As expected, net sales strengthened considerably relative to the fourth quarter and decreased at a more modest low single-digit rate in Q1. Notably, volume mix was basically flat, improving from a high single-digit decline last year. There were a number of green shoots in the quarter for U.S. Coffee. Let me outline 5 key elements that bolster our confidence in continued top line recovery in this segment. First, our pod shipment trends improved sequentially. Though at-home coffee category consumption growth remains muted, the trend modestly recovered relative to Q4. More importantly, Keurig's own volume momentum accelerated throughout the quarter. \n Second, our owned and licensed brand market share momentum is building, which is a mix accretive trend. In Q1, we grew owned and licensed total distribution points at a double-digit rate. We increased display activity and supported our brands with higher marketing. In addition, we made tactical adjustments to appropriately align our promotion strategy. This is already having an impact and will allow greater innovation, marketing and activation to shine through in the balance of the year. Owned and licensed share momentum progressively strengthened throughout the quarter, and we expect the trend to continue supported in part by upcoming price pack architecture changes to strengthen the value proposition. \n Third, within the coffee maker category, Keurig and Keurig compatible brewers also continued to gain share in Q1, extending a multiyear track record of outperformance. An exciting innovation like K-Brew + Chill, which has not yet launched and will hit retailer shelves later this year should further support our performance. \n Fourth, as our volume in U.S. Coffee improves, so does our ability to manufacture at a more attractive cost profile. We generated strong productivity during the first quarter, which drove healthy segment margin expansion and funded reinvestment. We're also beginning to optimize our manufacturing footprint to favor high-efficiency locations like Spartanburg, where capacity is ramping and unlocking further network optionality, which should also generate fuel for growth. \n And finally, fifth, the Keurig partnership proposition remains very strong as evidenced by multiple recent brand additions to our ecosystem. Lavazza will transition from a partner to a licensed brand during the second quarter. Also in Q1, we reached agreements to welcome Brooklyn Roasting Company; Shark Tank favorite, Kahawa 1893 Coffee; and Canadian super premium brand, Kicking Horse to our roster. And just this morning, we are announcing the addition of Black Rifle Coffee as a new partner. Black Rifle Coffee's success in the coffee industry is already well established, and their decision to evolve to a Keurig system partner speaks to the full value proposition of our stewardship of the single-serve category. Our La Colombe ready-to-drink coffee partnership is yet another proof point and is just now beginning to scale. In total, these exciting partnerships will begin to contribute to U.S. coffee segment volume growth later in 2024. \n Moving on to international, which is becoming an increasingly significant part of our business and is a core part of our strategic agenda. The segment's strong sales performance continued into the first quarter with high single-digit growth on a constant currency basis and broad-based strength across categories and markets. Our cold beverages portfolio performed particularly well in Latin America, reflecting continued strong DSD execution. Performance was led by our powerhouse Pen\u0303afiel brand, which continues to enjoy strong base momentum even as we extend the brand into new adjacencies. For instance, we recently launched Pen\u0303afiel soft seltzers, which offers sparkling mineral water with a refreshing touch of flavor, no calories, no sugar and with 100% natural flavors. \n We also further grew our segment presence in the low and no alcohol alternatives category, with continued share gains for Atypique in Canada and strong retail and consumer reception for our launch of Schweppes mocktails in Mexico. In our Canadian coffee business, market share grew for Keurig brewers and for our owned and licensed pod portfolio led by the Van Houtte brand. As in the U.S., we continue to strengthen our international route to market. And earlier this month, we announced a multiyear partnership with the Toronto Blue Jays for pour rights at their ballpark. We're excited to expand Canada Dry, Dr Pepper, Clamato, Crush and Atypique within the on-premise channel and will continue to seek out opportunities to thoughtfully build the distribution of our brands outside the U.S. \n In short, we're pleased with the promising start to the year. We demonstrated sequential top line progress in the quarter and delivered broad-based growth in adjusted operating income and margins across our segments. We did this while simultaneously funding high quality reinvestment in our brands and capabilities. Sudhanshu will speak more about our margin progress and our intention to continue balancing growth and reinvestment in the coming quarters. We're confident this approach will reinforce our 2024 outlook for on algorithm, top and bottom line growth, which remains unchanged while also powering a virtuous cycle growth over a multiyear time frame. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sudhanshu. Thanks, Sudhanshu. Before we move to Q&A, I want to thank our KDP colleagues for embodying our company's challenger mindset every day. In Q1, we collectively put the business on an accelerating path in a dynamic macro environment. Strong execution was visible across our results and in every country end market in which we compete. We intend to keep building momentum as the year progresses. Bob, Sudhanshu, the broader executive team, and I, feel the team's energy and enthusiasm for KDP's Evolved strategy, which was particularly evident at this month's annual summit of the company's top leaders. Together, we're excited to activate this strategy to unlock considerable future value for our shareholders. \n Thanks for the time, and we're now happy to take your questions. Yes, Brian, I'll take the second part of your question. I mean stepping back on coffee, obviously, as the pioneers of single-serve, coffee here in the U.S. and the steward of the category with almost 80% share of manufactured pods, our primary focus is on growing the entire ecosystem. And that's quite honestly more important than maximizing market share of any given brand. We aren't particularly interested in competing on price. But at the same time and to your point, we did make some decisions of late to protect, particularly our owned and licensed brand portfolio when we felt that our competitive positioning was impacted based on some competitive movement that we saw in the back half of last year. So we did make the decision to adjust the pricing really a couple of points around price gaps. \n Having said that, Brian, I would say when you look at our first quarter results, yes, there were some tactical promotional adjustments. But we also grew our owned and licensed distribution points actually at a double-digit rate. We increased display activity. We also brand support, brought some innovation. And I think all of these factors contributed to important strengthening of our business on owned and licensed. And I expect going forward, other activity around the innovation agenda, you've heard us talk about, both on pods and brewers, accelerated marketing and activation will help us drive continued strength in or, I would say, improving sequential strength in coffee for the balance of the year. Absolutely. So we are seeing and we saw it this quarter an increase in our total marketing investment on coffee. And I think as we've realigned back to the question that Brian asked making sure that from a price point standpoint, we feel good about our owned and licensed brand. It's an opportunity now for our marketing and innovation to work even harder. I think there's -- we're employing what we characterize as a bit of a barbell strategy, reflecting both the opportunity to reinforce value on our pod business as well as drive on the premium side. \n When you look at the consumer broadly, you do see at the higher income levels a really robust participation in the Keurig ecosystem and actually growing sales. Where we see a little bit more pressure, of late, is on the lower and mid income. And to that end, you will see new marketing coming starting in the second quarter. That is more sharply focused on a value message, particularly against a broader frame of away-from-home coffee. While at-home coffee represents 3/4 of the volume, away-from-home coffee is the larger dollar ring. And we think in today's economic environment and given the quality and variety that we're providing, a sharper value-based message will be one that's well received and you will see that activated as of Q2 this year. So that's yet to come. \n Another one is around our iced and cold platform and indeed launching the refreshers that we've done, which is obviously a big part of away-from-home coffee shop experience as well as new iced pods and the new Brew + Chill brewer that will be launching in the fall, that will also be incremental and new marketing against that platform, which I think is a big source of growth opportunity for us. And then, finally, on the premium and super premium, we've really rounded out our roster. I made reference to a number of new partners into the Keurig ecosystem at the premium and super premium level, you will see marketing against that. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention as well from a total coffee consumption standpoint, the big opportunity around ready-to-drink and single serve with our La Colombe partnership, and you'll see marketing against that. So I think we've got a stacked series of new news, both in terms of innovation and marketing messaging. Most of that is yet to come as we go through the year. Sure. So first on Black Rifle, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are excited to welcome Black Rifle into the Keurig ecosystem. I think Black Rifle's coffee success, I'm sure you know what, Chris, is already well established in the coffee industry. And I think their decision to evolve to a Keurig system partner really reinforces our full value proposition and our stewardship as the single-serve category leader. So pleased with that development. \n Bigger picture, and I referenced it in the prepared remarks, we partner with a broad range of coffee brands nationwide and we're about offering consumers choice and variety and a great high-quality cup of coffee and really providing consumers the diversity of their preferences and Black Rifle coffee is the newest addition, but it's one of many and one that we feel good joining our system. As it relates to cold and refreshment beverage, indeed, we have a slightly different phasing of the major innovation on our refreshment beverage this year versus last year. We mentioned this in our February call. But when you look at our relative market share here in Q1, we're under a little bit of pressure right now.

It launched early in the first quarter of last year. It enjoyed a very strong start. And in fact, it became the #1 CSD category innovation in the industry in 2023. This year, we're seeing a slightly later phasing of that. \n So as we speak, we're launching Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut. You can find it in your local store. It's a great product. We're also rolling out a complete restage of our Bai still portfolio under the banner of Bai WonderWater in partnership with Sydney Sweeney. We're launching, I would say, reinvigorating our core water business hydration business with U.S. gymnastics partnership. So we've got a lot of activity that really is starting now in Q2 and will ramp into the back half of the year. On top of that, I would mention what you know as well, which is continued strong C4 contribution and a continuing distribution ramp of our Electrolit partnership. Therefore, you see more of the firepower hitting in the back half of '24 versus '23. Yes. Yes, absolutely. Well, we continue to be really pleased with our partnership with C4. I think I shared at Investor Day as of that moment with since KDP took the distribution partnership with C4, and we made that minority investment stake. TDPs are up close to 60%. Sales are up 65%, and we continue to see growth potential for C4. C4 has got some exciting innovation this year around flavor extensions and around sizing and packaging configurations as well. Indeed, the Energy segment broadly, as you have mentioned, Peter, has seen some softening versus what was a multiyear run. \n I think Energy remains very much a resilient category and one that particularly among Gen-Xennials will continue to play a huge role in daily beverage choice. As it relates to sourcing, we see sourcing broadly. I'm not going to get into specifics around any given competitors, but I think it's both sourcing from other large players in energy as well as broader liquid refreshment beverage, particularly among youth as they make various choices on their caffeine carrier. That's correct. Yes. I'll take that first question on pods, and then I'll defer it to Sudhanshu on the second part of your question. I mean broadly, and you see this in the syndicated data when you look at the full estate around pods, you're looking at roughly I'll do round numbers here, Rob. 50% is our partners, 25% owned and licensed, 25% -- well, 20% private label.

You then asked about Alta. We're doing a beta test in the fall with limited consumer really to get the learning around what's working, how we can optimize, et cetera. At this point, there isn't already a predetermined path. Obviously, we have various scenarios and plans. But we're going to take the time to learn from that and then scale it up afterwards based on those learnings. So more specificity to come following the beta test that starts this fall. \n Then as it relates to CSD innovation, indeed, as I said earlier, we're lapping in Q1 just a blockbuster #1 innovation in the entire CSD category last year. So that's what you're seeing in some of the share pressure. Year to go, I think we've got a stacked innovation plan, including with the Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut and many of the others. Canada Dried Fruit Splash is already doing well. And we're only at, I would say, less than half ACV. So that's yet to ramp fully, including in some of the biggest markets. So you will see that phase more to the back half. And then what was it? Was that it? Good. Thank you, Andrea. And obviously, happy to follow up with you further, the IR team, or me on more questions."

            "content": "Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. It has been a busy and exciting start to the year at KDP. First quarter performance was strong, with solid consolidated sales growth and double-digit EPS growth. Momentum in our U.S. refreshment beverages and international segments remained healthy, and U.S. Coffee results showed meaningful sequential recovery. We invested in marketing and capabilities across the business while also delivering attractive broad -- the strong start to the year enhances our visibility to an unchanged on algorithm 2024 growth outlook. \n In Q1, we also advanced several strategic initiatives that position the company for multiyear success and demonstrate our confidence in the value creation opportunity ahead. First, we unveiled a revolutionary future vision for the Keurig brewing system that has been years in the making. When launched, our new proprietary K-Rounds plastic and aluminum-free pods and Keurig Alta brewers will enable consumers to brew a wide variety of hot and cold Barista-style beverages from a single machine using a pod that can be easily and sustainably disposed. This system has the potential to redefine how consumers brew coffee for decades to come, and we're excited to begin beta testing later this year. At the same time, we are committed to growing our preeminent existing K-Cup system, including through a strong slate of innovation in 2024.  \n Second, in Q1, we also took advantage of a highly-compelling and dislocated stock valuation by executing a $1.1 billion buyback of 38 million KDP shares. This was our largest quarterly share purchase -- repurchase in our history, and we have progressively increased our buyback activity over the past several years. And with another $1.8 billion remaining on our authorization, we intend to stay opportunistic, when we see attractive value in our shares. \n Third, we introduced our Evolved enterprise strategy, which we unveiled at an Investor Day hosted last month. This strategic framework combines many of the philosophies and practices that KDP has developed for the last 5 years with new elements intended to drive strong and self-reinforcing growth in our next chapter as a public company. Many elements of this strategy were already evident in our first quarter results.  \n Finally, this morning, we announced that Tim has been appointed KDP's CEO and will join our Board effective tomorrow, marking the culmination of a robust transition process that began when he joined us in November. I have worked closely with Tim over the past several months and have seen firsthand how our company is benefiting from his deep and diversified CPG experience, strategic vision and personification of our challenger culture. I look forward to continuing to partner with Tim and the broader leadership team in my ongoing capacity as KDP's Executive Chairman and could not be more confident in their stewardship of the company's next chapter.  \n With that, I will turn the call over to Tim. I'm confident it will, Bryan."

            "content": "Thanks, Tim. And good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results were strong, demonstrating sequentially improving net sales growth, continued meaningful gross margin expansion and incremental investments in marketing and capabilities. With EPS ahead of our plan, we intend to use Q1 upside as additional pool for reinvestment to support revenue growth over the balance of year and as buffer against pockets of reemerging commodity inflation. \n First quarter net revenue grew 2.8% in constant currency. Healthy momentum continued in our U.S. refreshment beverages, and International segments and we are encouraged by the sequential top line recovery in U.S. Coffee. On a consolidated basis, we realized positive net pricing, up 3.1% year-over-year. This was driven by favorable pricing in our U.S. refreshment beverages and international portfolios, balanced against previously flagged targeted price investments in U.S. Coffee. Importantly, consolidated volume mix improved to nearly flat year-over-year, showing a modest 0.3% decline in the quarter. Gross margin expanded significantly up 350 basis points, driven by the favorable combined impact of productivity, pricing and normalizing inflation. \n Gross margins also reflected a performance incentive related to strong commercial execution of our C4 partnership. This benefit contributed slightly over 100 basis points to the gross margin in the quarter and now offers us extra flexibility to drive future reinvestment. SG&A deleveraged 50 basis points in Q1 due in part to a double-digit increase in marketing. All in, total company operating income grew very strongly up 17.5% year-over-year with EPS increasing 12%.\n Moving to the segments. U.S. Refreshment Beverages net sales grew 4.3%, led by 5.6 percentage points of pricing.  Elasticities remain manageable across most categories and volume mix declined 1.3%, including an initial contribution from our electrolyte partnership. As expected, our relative market share and net sales performance reflected a later innovation cadence relative to 2023, particularly in CSDs. These calendar differences will normalize as new products get introduced and our innovation gains traction. In other words, segment net sales drivers should rebalance further towards volume mix as market share performance improves and as the magnitude of pricing contribution moderates considerably from here. Segment operating income grew an impressive 22.4% in the quarter and margins expanded 440 basis points. \n Tailwinds included pricing, strong productivity, and the C4 performance incentive, I mentioned earlier. This combination of factors helps fund higher marketing in the quarter. All in, we have good line of sight to continued operating income gains in U.S. Refreshment Beverages over the balance of the year though not at the same magnitude as we experienced over the last couple of quarters. U.S. Coffee top line trends significantly recovered relative to Q4 as expected, while net sales declined 2.1% volume mix was close to flat down a modest 0.3% year-over-year. Pod shipments continued their multi-quarter improvement trajectory and decreased 1.1%. This progress was driven by a steady recovery in volume and market share momentum across our owned and licensed portfolio during the quarter. \n With multiple elements underpinning this trend, including greater distribution and display and a more appropriately aligned promotional strategy, we expect innovation and activation to begin having an even greater impact in the balance of the year. Brewer shipments increased 26% in Q1 due to a combination of improving trends in the coffee maker category, continued Keurig market share gains and timing benefits. On a rolling 12-month basis, which smooths out some of the inherent quarterly brewer volatility, shipments are still down just under 2%, representing an improving trend versus the double-digit decline we experienced in 2023. Segment net pricing decreased 1.8%, primarily due to previously discussed promotional adjustments across our owned and licensed portfolio. This is in response to competitive activity that began in Q3 last year and continues today. \n These recalibrations more than offset the continued benefit of pricing we are realizing through partner contracts while improving segment mix. U.S. Coffee operating income advanced 1.4% and margins expanded 110 basis points versus the prior year driven by productivity savings and easing cost pressures, partially offset by higher marketing spend. As expected, the rate of segment margin expansion moderated versus the back half of 2023 as we are managing towards a more balanced top and bottom line outcome in this segment in 2024. We are pleased with the progress we made during quarter 1.\n International segment net sales grew 11.8%. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 7% with very solid volume mix growth of 4.8% and pricing up 2.2% year-over-year. Our performance included growth across market and categories with particular strength in Latin American LRBs. Segment operating income advanced very strongly, up 25% in constant currency terms. Volume mix growth, pricing and productivity netted favorably against inflation and higher marketing. We also continued to invest in route-to-market capabilities including the on-premise expansion in Canada that Tim mentioned and by strengthening our DSD network in Mexico. Given its outside growth potential, investing in our international business is a significant priority and should support an increased top and bottom line contribution from the segment in 2024 and over time. \n Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our Q1 free cash flow represented a use of $73 million. Cash generation is seasonally lower during the first quarter, and the year-over-year difference in free cash flow versus Q1 2023 was largely a function of a front-loaded cadence to our CapEx investment this year. In absolute terms, free cash flow also remained weighed down by roughly $400 million of reductions in supplier financing arrangements. We expect the impact of the carryover effects of these changes to moderate over the coming quarters and for free cash flow to accelerate with full year conversion projected considerably ahead of 2023 levels. \n This will support our capital allocation agenda. Our priorities include making organic and inorganic investments to further our growth, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through a steadily growing dividend, and via opportunistic share buybacks. We will remain dynamic in managing across these priorities at any point in time with a balanced approach over the long term. For example, in Q1, we repurchased 38 million shares for a total of $1.1 billion, taking advantage of an attractive valuation and the liquidity event presented by JAB secondary offering. Though our management leverage ratio increased modestly as a result, we remain committed to our long-term target of 2 to 2.5x. \n Moving now to our 2024 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net sales and high single-digit EPS growth in 2024, both consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. Our plans continue to embed strong top line momentum in our U.S. Refreshment Beverages and International segments with a relatively muted growth contribution from U.S. Coffee. We expect productivity savings to help offset a more normal level of inflation. There are, however, pockets of reemerging commodity inflation, for instance, in the green coffee price. We will need to monitor and manage these, particularly in the back half. \n Throughout the balance of the year, we also plan to continue to deploy investment dollars behind brands and capabilities to support our top line growth. The incremental flexibility afforded to us by our Q1 outperformance should enable us to balance these concentrations. As a result, we continue to anticipate healthy operating profit growth and full year operating margin expansion on a consolidated basis. Consistent with our original guide, we expect some of this operating momentum to be offset by a net headwind from below-the-line items, constraining operating profit flow-through to EPS. Our '24 outlook embeds the following below-the-line assumptions, which now reflect share repurchase and financing activity from Q1. Interest expense in a $625 million to $645 million range for the full year and effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% and approximately 1.37 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding. \n In closing, we are pleased with the stronger-than-anticipated start to the year, which bolsters our confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance while fueling a virtuous cycle for the long term. \n With that, I will now turn the call back to Tim to close. Let me take the first inflation question, and then Tim will take over -- take the next question. So our inflation, we continue to expect some inflation in 2024 overall, but at a more moderate level than in recent year. We talked about green coffee. We're also seeing inflation in aluminum, but as you know, we manage it within our guidance, within our range of outcomes, and we have factored all of these inflation and commodity. We also had some stuff for 6 to 9 months in our guidance. So our overall guidance for the year, which is mid-single-digit top line and high single-digit EPS factors in all of these scenarios. Yes. So regarding the share buyback, as you know, we had $4 billion worth of authorization, and it is opportunistic for us. Our #1 priority in capital allocation and investment in our own business, organic and inorganic growth. Number two is maintaining the strong balance sheet, our long-term leverage target of 2x to 2.5x. But we keep it very dynamic in terms of how we manage quarter after quarter, year after year. So you saw us, we saw opportunistic pricing with JAB secondary sales, and we purchased 38 million shares in 2024. 2023, we purchased close to 22 million shares. And 2022, we purchased 11 million shares. We still have $1.8 billion remaining on our share repurchase, but we will continue to be opportunistic when we see value in our stock price, we will go and buyback shares."
