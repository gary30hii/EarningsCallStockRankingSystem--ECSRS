If either file is missing, the script skips that folder.\n",

If the processing is successful, the script prints a message indicating that the data has been saved; otherwise, it notifies the user if any required files are missing.\n"

    "### Statistical Evaluation of Tone-CAR Relationship (Method 1 - Lexicon-Based)\n",
    "\n",
    "This script aggregates `CAR_after_earnings.csv` files from all stock folders, merges them into a single dataset, and analyzes how well **Method 1 sentiment scores** (Lexicon-based using Loughran-McDonald) align with **Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR)** over 3, 10, and 30 days after earnings calls. It calculates percentile thresholds for sentiment scores and runs **independent T-tests** and **ANOVA** between top and bottom sentiment groups (e.g., top 10% vs. bottom 10%). The results help determine if tone captured by Method 1 meaningfully explains variations in CAR, thus validating its potential for capturing PEAD.\n"
