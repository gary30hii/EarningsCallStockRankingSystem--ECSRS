    "\n",
    "This script iterates through all stock folders in the current directory and processes their data. For each folder, it first checks for the existence of two essential JSON files: `daily_chart_2019_2024.json`, which contains historical stock price data, and `earnings_transcripts_2020_2024.json`, which holds earnings call information. If either file is missing, the script skips that folder.\n",

    "\n",
    "The stock data is then sorted by date, and the script calculates the daily stock return as the percentage change in the adjusted closing price from one day to the next. \n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, the processed data, including the date, adjusted closing price, daily stock return, and earnings call indicator, is saved as a CSV file named `daily_return.csv` within the respective stock folder. If the processing is successful, the script prints a message indicating that the data has been saved; otherwise, it notifies the user if any required files are missing.\n"

It calculates percentile thresholds for sentiment scores and runs **independent T-tests** and **ANOVA** between top and bottom sentiment groups (e.g., top 10% vs. bottom 10%). The results help determine if tone captured by Method 1 meaningfully explains variations in CAR, thus validating its potential for capturing PEAD.\n"
