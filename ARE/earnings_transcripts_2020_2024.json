I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead.\nPaula Schwartz: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains Forward-Looking Statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paul, and welcome, everybody, today. With me, as usual, Jenna Foger, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. Want to welcome everybody and extend our thoughts and prayers to each one of you to continue to be well safe and state COVID free. Just over one year ago, January 21, 2020, the United States had its first reported case of COVID-19 in Seattle. And just today, a little more than a year later, we have lost more than 443,000 Americans, a number that is actually quite astounding to imagine. And that does not even count the number of - the millions, probably tens of millions of Americans who have suffered really irreparable personal, mental and financial arm due to the worldwide pandemic. President Roosevelt on Pearl Harbor Day referred to that day as a day that would live in infamy. And I think we will all feel that 2020 is a year that will live in infamy in all of our memories. Talking about the pandemic, there is much work to do to control the virus\u2019 spread. We need to enhance manufacturing supply chains as well as a big effort on distribution, administration of the vaccines as well as continued testing. And we, as a country, I think, for decades, have been ill prepared and behind the curve to respond to a true worldwide and kind of a 100-year pandemic, I think our readiness just has not been there, unfortunately. Much work to do to rebuild businesses and lives so devastatingly impacted. And I would say it is going to take a good part of this decade to do that for many people who\u2019ve been really so devastated. We still have not discovered the root cause of the virus, natural or human made or brought those responsible to an accounting. We at Alexandria at the Vanguard, the heart of the life science industry, are honored, proud and yet humbled to serve this mission-critical industry, which has been on the forefront, 24/7, really as the savior of human kind in this pandemic. It really doesn\u2019t get more important or impactful than that truly. There are two primary causes behind the COVID vaccines rescue of humanity from this pandemic, I firmly believe. The first one is our free market system here in the United States, the economic system that facilitated the innovation, competition and cooperation between our biotech and pharma industries and government, that literally doesn\u2019t happen in other countries around the world. There would likely be no multiple COVID vaccines today that they are not being venture capitalist prepared to invest before product or profit was really visible and no corporate leadership would be willing to double down other than those in our country with the company\u2019s own money in the spring of 2020 to fund a crash effort to produce a safe and affected vaccine by year-end, really truly unheard of.\nJenna Foger: Thank you so much, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. So really echoing Joel here. As the entire world looks to the power of science, the life science industry and specifically to our tenants to lead us out of this devastating COVID pandemic. 2020 has underscored why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and purpose helped drive this mission-critical industry forward. Without a doubt biopharma, essential R&D engine has persisted with amazing productivity and resilience throughout the past year, which has further magnified our tenant\u2019s role as the key solution to overcoming today\u2019s greatest health challenges, bringing unprecedented positive sentiment to the sector, as Joel mentioned. The achievements in COVID vaccine development from our tenants, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax and AstraZeneca many others in the fourth quarter, specifically of 2020 and into the beginning of 2021, have marked the culmination of a full year\u2019s worth of tireless, truly collaborative efforts across the industry with significant aid of federal funding.\nStephen Richardson: Thank you, Jenna. A tremendous deep dive. Good afternoon, everyone. A clear insured vision fused with undaunted determination during 2020 from the Alexandria team has enabled the company to thrive during this unprecedented and challenging time. At a high level, consider the truly exceptional growth during the past 12 months. The operating platform has grown from 26.9 million square feet to 31.8 million square feet, an increase of 18%. The redevelopment pipeline has grown from 12.1 million square feet to 17.8 million square feet, an increase of 47%. And it is important to note that this development pipeline has been smartly derisked with 45% of this value in significantly pre-leased projects well underway, 40% in covered land plays and just 15% of this value in land. The total Alexandria Real Estate platform then have grown during 2020 from 39 million square feet to 49.7 million square feet, an increase of 27%, a truly remarkable achievement. The Company\u2019s leadership and central role in the nation\u2019s life science ecosystem is clearly evident in only increasing in each of our core clusters. The year 2020 demanded the very best from our teams, from operational excellence to the vision and execution of critical strategic growth initiatives. Alexandria is pleased to prevent its outperformance highlights for Q4 and 2020. Operational excellence. The company collected 99.8% of its accounts receivable during COVID from April 1 through December 31, 2020, and we are at 99.6% for the month of January. Alexandria\u2019s labs were deemed essential infrastructure and have been operational from day 1 in the pandemic. Leasing outperformance. During Q4, we leased approximately 1.4 million square feet and a total of 4.35 million square feet during 2020, which is meaningfully above our 10-year average of 4 million square feet and consistent with our 5-year average of 4.4 million square feet. The current and near-term development pipeline is 78% leaser negotiating, a significant metric when 1 considers the active pipeline is now at 4.8 million square feet, up from 4.1 million square feet just three months ago at the end of Q3. An exceptionally strong core. I want to pause for a moment and underscore that during the challenging time, we achieved the highest annual rental rate increases during the past 10-years with cash increases of 18.3% and GAAP increases of 37.6%. The fourth quarter was also strong with cash increases of 10.7% and GAAP increases of 29.8%. We are honored to work with the most innovative life science companies in the world and believe these metrics further validate the value we are providing to the life science ecosystem. Solid occupancy. We are at 94.6% across 31.8 million square feet in the operating portfolio. And again, context is important here as we have increased the operating portfolio from 26.9 million square feet, as mentioned before, providing strategic embedded growth opportunities through lease-up of available suites in the coming quarters. I just want to emphasize this last point, as the recent acquisitions provide very near-term increases in cash flows and strategic expansion of our tenant base. Market health. Demand continues to be broad-based across our innovation clusters as each of the markets have made meaningful contributions to the company\u2019s overall growth during 2020 and Alexandria continues to capture a dominant market share in each of these clusters. We have discussed potential supply in our core clusters the past several quarters. And as we highlighted during our Investor Day, the conversion of generic office product into mission-critical Class A laboratory facilities is brought with significant fault insufficient clear heights and live loads, compromise hazardous material storage areas, dysfunctional shipping and receiving areas, impaired HVAC capabilities and performance, amongst others. We continue to monitor all potential supply closely, but do not see significant high-quality Class A products being delivered during the near-term in our markets. Also a note on the San Francisco Bay Area as this has been a focus in the press. As we have stated, the life science market continues to be very healthy with low single-digit vacancy of 3.4% and demand of 2.6 million square feet, enabling Alexandria to successfully lease-up our Haskins and 825, 835 project at increasing rental rates, all while the city of San Francisco\u2019s tech office sector is struggling with direct vacancy now at 12.4%, above the 15-year average of 8% and sublease space pushing the availability rate to 20.2%. In conclusion, year 2020 accelerated Alexandria\u2019s leadership role in the life science ecosystem. Our team is energized and enthusiastic to continue our partnership with world-class enterprises and the fight against COVID-19 and in the broader mission of building the future of life-changing innovation. With that, I will hand it off to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thanks, Steve. I\u2019m going to follow-up on some remarks we made about our valuation on Investor Day. And then I\u2019m going to update you all on our development pipeline and briefly comment on a new acquisition. As the inventor and pioneer of the essential life science real estate asset class, we have created our campuses and clusters in the best locations with the market\u2019s best assets. By combining our irreplaceable locations and our world-class campuses and ecosystems with meticulously designed, highly functional buildings and a world-class tenant base, Alexandria has aggregated the best life science real estate base in the world and it isn\u2019t close. During Investor Day, we highlighted our views that the private market has been sending strong signals that there should be significant upside in our stock price. This included a comparison of Ventas\u2019 acquisition of the Genesis property in South San Francisco for $1,260 per square foot, which has since been updated to $1,301 per square foot. And Blackstone\u2019s recap of BMR at a value of $1,100 per square foot against a very simple back of the napkin, $767 per square foot implied value of our operating portfolio, which was based upon the difference between the closing price of our common stock on September 30, 2020, and the book value of other significant assets such as construction in progress, venture investments and cash divided by our total operating square feet. We acknowledge that the implied value of our operating portfolio can vary up or down depending upon the valuation of our other assets and liabilities as well as adjustments for joint ventures, but we believe the underlying thesis remains true, which is that Alexandria is significantly undervalued. The Genesis property is vastly inferior to our South San Francisco asset base. It is located on the opposite side of the 101 Freeway, making it part of the cluster by address only. The original South Tower is an office building conversion, which sat vacant for years and required some jerry rigging to make it work and will require more work to complete the conversion of the top floors. And the North Tower has relatively small floor place, which causes it to have a load factor that exceeds what is typically acceptable in the market. Both buildings have relatively low floor-to-floor heights that will dictate a lower finished ceiling than the market prefers. And as a result, the two buildings did not attract a high-quality tenant base. Blackstone has done well reforming and adding to BMRs original somewhat older and tired asset base. But given Alexandria superior locations, assets and tenants, our asset base should command a premium valuation on the real estate alone. Taking all this into account, our assets should be valued significantly higher than what is implied by today\u2019s stock price. Since Investor Day, more evidence from the private markets has come to light such as the sale of the 2.3 million square foot former Forest City lab portfolio from Brookfield to Blackstone BMR for $3.45 billion, which implied an approximately $1,500 per square foot total valuation according to Green Street. Approximately 90% of the portfolio is concentrated in University Park, which was the original Cambridge development area before the emergence of Kendall Square. And according to CoStar, the allocation to those assets yielded a value of $1,800 per square foot and an implied cap rate of 4.2%. This value, and therefore, the overall value of the transaction would have likely been materially higher if not for the fact that those assets are in relatively short to medium-term ground leases. When comparing this portfolio to Alexandria\u2019s primary Cambridge asset base located in the preferred Kendall square location. It should be apparent that the location of our assets are superior as we are aggregated at the front door of MIT, proximate to the Kendall square tea stop in the center of gravity of the East Cambridge ecosystem versus being on the western edge of MIT, far from the heart of the campus in the less desirable area of Cambridge port. Some sell-side analysts seem to agree with this premise. The five that have NAVs above our current stock price ranging from $175.54 to $184 per share, value our operating portfolio within a range of $824 per square foot to $1,062 per square foot. These same analysts have price targets ranging from $185 per square foot to $206. So they seem to be factoring in the private market activity we are seeing. If you are still not convinced and want to look at it from a different angle, I would encourage you to compare Alexandria\u2019s multiple to the sector FFO multiples published in cities weekly REIT and lodging strategy published on January 15. Even with all of the momentum in life science real estate, the single-family home sector\u2019s FFO multiple is 1.1 higher than ours. The industrial mixed ratio is 3.9 higher and the manufactured homes and data center FFO multiple ratios are 3.8 and 5.6 higher than Alexandria\u2019s, respectively. We are in the early days of the biology revolution with 10,000 known diseases and less than 10% of those are addressable treatments. COVID-19 has brought unprecedented positive sentiment to the sector as the world recognizes the life science industry\u2019s contributions to solving today\u2019s greatest health challenges. The five fundamentals that signals strong demand, government funding, medical research philanthropy, FDA regulatory environment, venture capital and public market investor sentiment and commercial R&D funding continue to have tailwinds and there is no reason to suspect that, that will change anytime soon. The life science industry is one of the few bright spots in the world today, and Alexandria is well positioned to enable and participate in its outside growth. We invite you to reassess your valuation and future prospects in light of the private market data presented and the significant prospects for growth in our underlying industry. On to development. We are pleased to report that we continue to make great progress with our development pipeline. We delivered 177,953 square feet and three projects in the fourth quarter including 100% of the 9877 Waples Street project in the Seromas submarket of San Diego, which was featured at Investor Day because it illustrated the power of our brand. When an existing tenant needed to expand, and we did not have space for them, they found a building and effectuated the sale to us by telling the owner it would only lease it from us because the facility was mission-critical to them, and they would not entrust its development and operation with anyone else. Leasing activity has been robust since the third quarter with over 913,000 square feet of leasing completed and approximately 50,000 square feet of space put under LOI in the development redevelopment pipeline, led by significant leasing at 201 Haskins in South San Francisco. The Alexandria center for Life Science San Carlos, 3115 Merryfield in San Diego, and the newly acquired Alexandria Center for Life Science, Durham, which significantly increased their pre-leasing percentages in the range of 27% to 58%. Overall, with the addition of 6 new projects, we now have approximately 3.3 million square feet under construction, that is 74% pre-leased, an increase of over 1.3 million square feet from last quarter\u2019s project aggregation, which was only 63% pre-leased. And as Joel mentioned, I would like to conclude by expressing our great pride and enthusiasm with the acquisition just recently closed 401 Park Drive, 201 Brookline and a continuous development site that will provide Alexandria operating income and an ability to realize upside by marking rents to market, converting certain office and retail space to lab, completing the lease-up of 201 Brookline and developing the future 400,000 square foot development opportunity into a world-class laboratory office building in the Fenway. We are also pleased to be developing this campus in a collaborative venture with esteemed local developer Samuelson associates, who has been the visionary for the Fenway for more than 20 years. With that, I\u2019m going to pass it over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team is super passionate about our strategic initiatives to drive unique, disruptive and highly impactful solutions to tackle society\u2019s most complex and pressing challenges. Now they are also very pleased with continued recognition as a leader in ESG. From our 115 projects focused on solving the opioid epidemic, combating the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRESB sector leadership and leadership in health, wellness and safety. Our team\u2019s passion goes well beyond operational excellence and strong financial and operating results from our real estate business. Our fourth quarter and year-end 2020 financial and operating results were outstanding. For 2020, we reported strong growth in total revenues of 23.1%, NOI growth of 24.8%, and adjusted EBITDA growth of 17.4%, EPS and FFO as adjusted of $6.01 and $7.70 per share diluted, respectively. Now our high-quality properties in tenant roster, combined with our outstanding execution by our best-in-class team, continue to generate strong performance, including many results representing some of the top in the REIT industry. Investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies generate 55% of our annual rental revenue, consistently high and timely payment of rent and well into the 99% range each month. Strong 5.1% cash same-property NOI growth. Strong leasing velocity with record rental rate growth of 37.6% and 18.3% on a cash basis, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%, highlighting operational excellence, occupancy of 94.6% or 97.7% adjusted for vacancy at recently acquired properties. And please see Page 25 of our supplemental package for details on vacancy at these recently acquired properties. Now I should briefly mention that our quarterly rental rate growth related to lease renewals and releasing of space does vary occasionally, since it is only 1/4 of our annual leasing volume. For example, in the third quarter of 2020, we reported 30.9% cash rental rate growth. And then in the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported 10.7% cash rental rate growth. I think the key takeaway is that rental rate growth for 2020 was very strong at 37.6% and 18.3% on a cash basis. And importantly, our outlook for 2021 reflects continued strength in the financial and operating performance, including rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing of space at 30.5% and 17.5% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. Now our team is executing extremely well. We are projecting strong growth in net operating income and cash flows. We anticipate significant growth in occupancy in 2021 and 2022, as our team executes on lease-up of recently acquired properties with vacancy. Additionally, as Peter highlighted, we have a very highly leased pipeline of projects undergoing construction and a very large volume of deliveries in 2021. Now it is important to highlight that our Board has been very consistent with our common stock dividend policy, given the high amount of operating cash flows after dividends that we generate each year. Now in 2020, the growth in our annual common stock dividend was 6%, and cash flows from operating activities after dividends is projected in 2021 to be approximately $230 million at the midpoint of our guidance. Now on Friday, we completed the purchase of what has been rebranded as the Alexandria Center for Life Science, Fenway. It is a campus of 1.8 million square feet upon full build-out. Now as a result, we expect to settle the $1.1 billion in forward equity sale agreements in March, and that was related to our January common stock offering. So huge kudos to our entire team for outstanding execution on this transaction and upon full build-out, this will represent another awesome collaborative campus in our asset base. It is super important to have one of the best teams in the country, since real estate transactions move quickly from selection by the seller to closing. And in this case, the seller selected Alexandria as the best party for this transaction on December 9. On the real estate disposition front, we provided our initial range of guidance for 2021 at a midpoint of $1.375 billion, and we will provide more information on dispositions quarter-to-quarter. Our team has really positioned us very well with our pipeline of redevelopment and development of Class A properties. The key highlights include execution over one million rentable square feet of leasing in 2020 related to our development and redevelopment pipeline. Projects undergoing construction aggregate 3.2 million rentable square feet or 74% leased, about 2.5 million or plus square feet of this is projected for delivery in 2021, making 2021 the largest year of deliveries for Alexandria. And this to generate annual net operating income of about $135 million, which on average, commences in the third quarter of 2021. Now we have a number of well-located near-term projects, aggregating 4.9 million rentable square feet including approximately 348,000 rentable square feet that is 79% leased with vertical construction commencing in the second quarter. And in January, we added two key projects under construction, aggregating 640,000 rentable square feet with pre-leasing in the 20% to 25% range. Now our venture portfolio continues to perform extremely well. Realized gains on our venture investments included in FFO per share were $21.6 million and $71.6 million for the fourth quarter and 2020, respectively. Now as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA, our venture investment gains were approximately 5.5% for 2020, up slightly from approximately the mid-4% range for 2019. And as we look forward into 2021, we expect venture investment gains to increase slightly as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA as we look to capture a portion of the unrealized gains in the portfolio. Unrealized gains on venture investments as of December 31 were $776 million on our adjusted cost basis of $835 million. Now thank you to our team for hitting our key balance sheet goals, and we are well positioning our balance sheet to support our strategic business initiatives. We are very pleased to have corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of companies within the REIT industry. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 5.3 times for fourth quarter annualized with slight improvement to 5.2 times by the end of 2021. Now our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.6 times for the fourth quarter annualized and is also expected to improve by the fourth quarter 2021. Liquidity was very solid at $4.1 billion, and we continue to view long-term capital to fund growth in our business and are very fortunate to have access to efficient cost of capital. Now to put this into perspective, pricing for 10 and 30-year bonds today for Alexandria is extremely attractive at approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Our prior shelf registration expired in December 2020, three years after we filed it. An odd aspect of the ATM program is that each program is associated with a specific shelf registration versus the program that can be used as long as you have an effective shelf registration in place. Now in our case, our ATM program expired in connection with the shelf registration statement that expired in December. And as a result, we expect to file a new ATM program over the next 4 weeks. Moving on to guidance. Please refer to our detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2021 guidance, beginning on Page 12 of our supplemental package. Changes were limited to a breakout of our range of real estate dispositions from the overall equity type capital guidance. The midpoint of our guidance for dispositions, as I mentioned earlier, is at $1.375 billion. And we also provided an update on acquisitions completed in January 2021, most of which was previously disclosed. Now there were no changes in our 2021 guidance for EPS diluted of a range from $2.14 to $2.34 and FFO per share diluted of a range from $7.60 to $7.80. Now embedded in our overall guidance is continued strong growth in cash flows as we execute on the lease-up and occupancy growth in 2021 and 2022 and continued execution on an important year of record deliveries in 2021 of our highly leased redevelopment and development projects. With that, let me turn it back to Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Operator, if we could go to questions, please.\nOperator:  And the first question will come from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJames Feldman: I guess I want to start off with the Fenway acquisition. I\u2019m hoping you can talk a little bit more about what do you like about that submarket? What do you like about those - the 3 buildings or properties for the future? And then how should we be thinking about just your Boston strategy going forward, given - it just seems - now that you have moved to the mega cluster model, it just seems like there is a lot more submarkets to choose from. Where does Fenway fit into kind of the larger Alexandria footprint we might see?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So thanks, Jamie. This is Joel. I will ask Peter to comment in a minute. We don\u2019t want to say too much about Fenway at this point. Peter has given a little bit of detail. He can talk a little more about it. I think it is pretty clear that the location of Fenway which has good proximity to the other submarkets, obviously, to Boston itself and Downtown and Cambridge, but it is also pretty proximate to the collection of important Harvard hospitals, et cetera. And it has been a submarket that has been, I think, quite vital for several decades, and we just think that time is right for the kind of change to a more life science orientation there. And so that is one of the motivations that certainly attracted us. It is pretty clear that the greater Boston region still is the number one region or I should say the number 1 cluster market in the world and still the major destination for so many companies because there is such a rich amount of science, talent capital and the location is certainly one that is excellent. So Peter, just general comments?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. Thanks, Jamie. Look, the 401 Park asset is a really nice office R&D building. It has some dry lab in it. It has a great tenant roster. It is got great duration and leases. And there is going to be opportunities for us to convert some of that to lab over time. The development of 201 Brookline is doing really well ever since we\u2019re awarded the transaction. There is been great activity. We will be reporting on that in future quarters. There is some opportunities at the 401 Park building as well to mark some rents to market. So overall, just typical Alexandria value creation play here with combination of using our brand to increase rents to bring new product to market, and ultimately, another building to create a nice urban campus.\nJames Feldman: And then $1.5 billion, obviously, a very large transaction. Is this something we should expect to see from Alexandria going forward as just\u2026?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, I don\u2019t think you - people ask about that all the time about when we acquire something or become involved in a transaction. We never know what is - and I\u2019m sure Blackstone has the same feeling. You never know until a - like the University Park assets came forward when or if that will ever happen. So I don\u2019t think you can make any general assumptions about things like that. I think they\u2019re very opportunistic, and they\u2019re very dependent upon the time play space. So I wouldn\u2019t take anything, read anything into it or out of it. All - every one of these is just quite unique on their own.\nJames Feldman: Okay. And then my last question is, if you look at your TIs in the quarter, definitely above-average for the year. Is there anything to read into about concessions?\nJoel Marcus: Steve and Dean, you guys maybe want to?\nStephen Richardson: Hi, Jamie, it is Steve. Yes, that was really driven. We had two opportunities in core markets with two very exciting tenants to refresh buildings that were 15 to 20 years old. So we go - we went ahead and did that. The incremental yield was exceptionally strong, well into the double-digits. So when we see opportunities like that, we are going to move. So if you excluded those, I think we were in much more of a normal range. But it was opportunistic to go ahead and refresh buildings, secure great tenants. And have exceptionally strong yields as well on the incremental capital.\nJames Feldman: Okay. And those are life science projects or office?\nStephen Richardson: Yes.\nJoel Marcus: Well, yes, they...\nOperator: And the next question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI.\nSheila McGrath: I guess, Joel, I was wondering your thoughts on the new administration, if you believe there will be more or less favorable to biotech research and investment and also bringing manufacturing of pharma back to the U.S. just your big picture thoughts there?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So we don\u2019t fully know what the health side of the administration is going to look like. We have some indication. But I would say it is too early to tell. I think, though, that when it comes to the enormous substrate, which exists in the NIH and in much of the funding that goes on at really the basic research level. That has remained, I think, very favorably bipartisan for decades now. And I don\u2019t think there will be any change in the increase-- the rate of increase with respect to that. I think the biggest worry would be a knee-jerk reaction by some to raise corporate taxes to try to somewhat either address deficits or just because it seems fair. But the challenge with that and policymakers and lawmakers should really know better and understand that plants can revert back to Ireland or more favorable tax havens and cash can go overseas if the incentives aren\u2019t made to do those things in America. So I hope that people take a long-term view of that. But at the moment, I think, by and large, it looks, I would say, favorable but still too early to tell.\nSheila McGrath: Okay. And one other question. The investment portfolio had very strong gains in fourth quarter. Just - I know Dean touched on it a little bit, but I\u2019m just wondering, given where biotech indices are, if your thoughts on taking some more meaningful profits from that, those investments to invest in the pipeline - development pipeline?\nJoel Marcus: Well, we do, and we have done that from time to time. So the answer is, I\u2019m sure we will review that almost real-time and certainly consider that for sure.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.\nEmmanuel Korchman: Joel, just wanted to sort of circle back on the early remarks you made on the call about scale, and especially the scale you have in your cluster markets. Can you just elaborate on sort of the direct advantages of having the market trend and the scale versus an environment where the tenants are growing quickly? And at the same time, there is new supply being created. So are those kind of going to match up naturally where tenants are just going to slot into space that is available, maybe rather than working through a relationship they have had with you to build space years from now?\nJoel Marcus: You have revealed the office playbook because when you have a generic commodity product, that is true. But I think as Peter indicated or Steve, when you have a mission-critical project, much like the Waples in Sorrento Mesa with Cue Health, you don\u2019t just turn it over to the cheapest guy on the Street or the one who maybe has something available. It is much more careful than that. Office space, that is true. But when you have critical R&D and critical next-gen manufacturing, that just doesn\u2019t happen that way.\nOperator: Next question is from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRichard Anderson: So was looking back in time a little bit about your Moderna exposure, went from about 382,000 square feet in the first quarter to 615,000 square feet in the fourth quarter. I guess, my broader question is, is - can we consider COVID a new line of business? Perhaps, as Jenna mentioned, more leaning towards the therapy side once we kind of get beyond this year and now? Or is what I see, not something I should be reading through to in a broader sense?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think maybe two things, Rich. One is, I think, COVID and pandemic virus, we have been through a number of mini ones over the years. But certainly, this is one of the biggest ones we have ever seen in our lifetime, different than HIV aids, which we did turn into a chronic condition. So I think and Jenna said, it will be with us for a long, long time, and there will be continual efforts not only on the vaccine side and the booster side, the testing side, this testing is going to be critical going forward, and then obviously, on the therapy side because if you can take a quick - if you can have access to therapy that is maybe not infusible, but 1 that is a pill like, just as you get a sour throat, you get a fever, that would be a whole lot better than trying to - or being very sick and looking for an infusion site. So there is a lot to do there. And I do think COVID will be a continuous business and these companies will be very busy. But I think one of the things about Moderna, in particular, we have bought into the mRNA revolution back almost a decade ago when Moderna was founded. And I think today, if you just separate out the COVID-19 stuff, Moderna represents really one of the most impressive and important platforms for many different - to address many different illnesses. Imagine if the body could replicate erythropoietin, so you didn\u2019t need to have constant external injections, et cetera, where the body itself could address different - or insulin where you could do it by regulation in a sense. So the opportunity is pretty big, and that is what we have looked at when we look at companies like Moderna, and there are obviously many more that have enormously big technology platforms. It is not simply a one product company.\nRichard Anderson: And then just 1 question on Fenway Park. Although not specifically, since I know you want to kind of keep it a little tight to the vest for the time being. But if memory serves the Longwood Medical Area perhaps did not pan out as well, if I - and correct me if I\u2019m wrong on that. But it is a further afield from Cambridge. If I\u2019m right on my recollection of Longwood - and I\u2019m not making enough judgment about you, I think your peers were invested there. What makes you think Fenway pretty close to Longwood would sort of work out this, using\u2026?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, your recollection is correct. We dipped our toe into the Longwood Medical Area, and it turns out, it is a pretty institutional area and one that is not a really vibrant one at night. But I think what\u2019s happened in Fenway, and certainly, our partner has been at the forefront of that is it is - they have really created a 24/7 live, work, play environment. Certainly, the park itself has been a major part of that. So I think it is a totally different submarket and a totally different feeling. So I think we have no qualms at all about the future there.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: And I think, Joel, you kind of touched on this a little bit earlier, but can you provide some color on the supply outlook for the space? And I know a few years ago, there were some concerns in South San Francisco, but those seem to have abated. Are there specific markets that ARE is tracking that we should kind of look out for?\nJoel Marcus: So I think Steve touched on that, Steve, do you want to maybe get the question?\nStephen Richardson: Yes. Hi, Michael, it is Steve. No, you are right. We were monitoring South San Francisco closely with combination of Kilroy, PEAK and Blackstone at the time. And those projects have all been substantially leased. And look, we track literally building by building, parcel by parcel in each of our markets very closely, and we just don\u2019t see a lot of new Class A high-quality product being delivered. There has been a lot in the press about conversions. And I think at Investor Day, we kind of went through that chapter inverse, and I highlighted it in the comments today, so we stay very vigilant in our analysis of that. But at the current time, we just don\u2019t see significant supply disruptions happening in the market.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Great. And then, I guess, can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the Mercer Mega Block deal. What\u2019s the time line on that potential acquisition and/or, I guess, the development you do acquire, what\u2019s holding it up? And what should we be expecting there?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think we don\u2019t know precisely, but I think sometime over the next 6 months, part of it is diligence and part of it, as you know, the city has gone through quite a shock over the last probably since, what, late May. Triggered by the death of George Floyd and has had its share of tumult. And obviously, the city - both the Mayor and the counsel have been fighting. Obviously, there was a defund police effort going on there. So I think part of the effort is, hopefully, for the city, I think there is a Mayor election coming up, I think, maybe later this year to get back into a more normal environment. We hope that is true. And this, certainly, I think you will see activity on this over the next six months. But I think Seattle, certainly, South Lake Union remains a very safe and really good area. Seattle\u2019s got a strong, obviously, on the technology side anchored by the likes of Amazon and Microsoft across the water and the big Facebook and Google and the big things are up there other than Netflix different way. So I think that is been all positive. The life science industry, as you know, Peter, I think, talked about our pricing on the partial interest sale we made in a couple of assets. Seattle has attracted a lot of institutional money and the life science industry certainly is growing well, anchored by the Fred Hutch and the University of Washington. So it is a pretty positive outlook there.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tom Catherwood with BTIG.\nThomas Catherwood: So Steve and Dean, you both kind of alluded to this topic, but I wanted to dive into it a little more. We know that the same-store NOI growth guidance on a GAAP basis is 2% for the year. But you have done nearly $6.3 billion of acquisitions over the last 25 months. And I assume most of those, if not all of them, are not in the same-store pool. So how should we think about NOI growth in 2021 from the lease-up and mark-to-market on these non-same-store assets?\nDean Shigenaga: Well, as Tom, it is Dean here, just to clarify. As I mentioned in our commentary, and you have our guidance for 2021, which our guidance for occupancy covers the entire asset base in the operating portfolio, and you have got something in the range of, I think, 170 basis point growth in occupancy, and then that continues into 2022 as well. We\u2019re actually likely to pick up something approaching 300 basis points over the two calendar years. So you are going to see occupancy growth from the acquisitions be a key driver and it is not - we find the asset that fit our business profile nicely. And occasionally they come with some vacancy that we need to manage. But fortunately, we feel comfortable about making good progress on that in 2021. So that is going to be a key driver, and you will see that continue to benefit into 2022 as well. So that is important to note. It is just not a one year trend. I think 2022 will benefit probably as well in the same-property pool because some of those properties will start to drop into the same-property pool over time.\nThomas Catherwood: Got it. That is really helpful, Dean. And then kind of along the same lines, looking at newly acquired assets and all and development assets as well. So a number of development projects shift between your intermediate classification and your near-term classification. But one that had kind of a real marked jump was the Arsenal on the Charles, where 200,000 square feet of future redevelopment moved from the future bucket to near-term, it is kind of a 2-phase jump, and you also picked up an extra 81,000 square feet of potential redevelopment. Can you speak a little bit to the demand that you are seeing in Watertown and how that is driving this acceleration of your redevelopment plans?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So I don\u2019t want to get into too much there at the moment because nothing has been formally announced. But one thing that has been announced that you have seen in a lot of the papers is the next-gen innovation technologies and manufacturing consortium with ourselves, Fujifilm, MIT, Harvard have selected that site as the home of this enterprise. And then there are a host of other, I would say, advanced technology companies, life science companies and other things that have sought that location as being, I think, very proximate to Cambridge and transportation being easier to deal with than some of the other submarkets that are, I think, harder to get in and out. Alewife is a good example. We stayed out of Alewife because we believe that transportation in and transportation out have been super problematic. And so that is been one of the challenges that when we have looked at acquisitions in that submarket, they have kind of confounded us to figure out how we can solve the transportation problem, but Watertown is, I think, in much better shape. So I would say stay tuned.\nOperator: Next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Mizuho.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Most of my questions have been answered, but quick one. One of your largest tenants, not top 10, but just outside top 10, bluebird bio is doing some type of spin-off of one of its units. Just kind of curious...\nJoel Marcus: I\u2019m sorry, what?\nOmotayo Okusanya: One of your tenants, bluebird bio?\nJoel Marcus: Yes?\nOmotayo Okusanya: They\u2019re doing a spin-off of one of their business units. Just curious if that has any implications for their current lease with you guys?\nJoel Marcus: I\u2019m sorry. So the question is what?\nOmotayo Okusanya: They are spinning off one of their business units. Does that have any implications for the current lease they have with you?\nJoel Marcus: Well, we don\u2019t know the answer to that. They may sublease, and they may not. Jenna, do you want to maybe just comment on the nature of that change?\nJenna Foger: Sure, for sure. So bluebird bio, basically announced. They haven\u2019t disclosed the details other than that they\u2019re basically dividing the company between severe genetic diseases and oncology company. And so we usually have exposure to them in Greater Boston, specifically in Cambridge and then in Seattle. And so basically, they\u2019re - everything that they\u2019re retaining in place is what they have kind of with us, both in terms of their H2 in Cambridge and then manufacturing in Seattle, so we\u2019re really not concerned about that at all.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And it would be easy to backfill space if we had it in those locations, I can tell you.\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJames Feldman: Just quickly, I wanted to go back to Dean\u2019s comment on - you said that investment gains as a percentage of EBITDA you expect to be higher this year than last year. Can you maybe quantify that? How big of a portion of EBITDA do you think it can be?\nDean Shigenaga: It is just - Jamie, it is Dean here. It is slight. I think what my comments were - in 2019 was probably in the 4.5% range, 2020 was probably about 5.5% of EBITDA and just a slight growth anticipated as we look out to 2021 on top of that. So it is still staying pretty small as a percentage of overall EBITDA.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: No closing remarks other than to wish everybody be safe, be healthy and COVID-free, and we look forward to talking to you on the first quarter call. Thank you again, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephen Richardson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenna. A tremendous deep dive. Good afternoon, everyone. A clear insured vision fused with undaunted determination during 2020 from the Alexandria team has enabled the company to thrive during this unprecedented and challenging time. At a high level, consider the truly exceptional growth during the past 12 months. The operating platform has grown from 26.9 million square feet to 31.8 million square feet, an increase of 18%. The redevelopment pipeline has grown from 12.1 million square feet to 17.8 million square feet, an increase of 47%. And it is important to note that this development pipeline has been smartly derisked with 45% of this value in significantly pre-leased projects well underway, 40% in covered land plays and just 15% of this value in land. The total Alexandria Real Estate platform then have grown during 2020 from 39 million square feet to 49.7 million square feet, an increase of 27%, a truly remarkable achievement. The Company\u2019s leadership and central role in the nation\u2019s life science ecosystem is clearly evident in only increasing in each of our core clusters. The year 2020 demanded the very best from our teams, from operational excellence to the vision and execution of critical strategic growth initiatives. Alexandria is pleased to prevent its outperformance highlights for Q4 and 2020. Operational excellence. The company collected 99.8% of its accounts receivable during COVID from April 1 through December 31, 2020, and we are at 99.6% for the month of January. Alexandria\u2019s labs were deemed essential infrastructure and have been operational from day 1 in the pandemic. Leasing outperformance. During Q4, we leased approximately 1.4 million square feet and a total of 4.35 million square feet during 2020, which is meaningfully above our 10-year average of 4 million square feet and consistent with our 5-year average of 4.4 million square feet. The current and near-term development pipeline is 78% leaser negotiating, a significant metric when 1 considers the active pipeline is now at 4.8 million square feet, up from 4.1 million square feet just three months ago at the end of Q3. An exceptionally strong core. I want to pause for a moment and underscore that during the challenging time, we achieved the highest annual rental rate increases during the past 10-years with cash increases of 18.3% and GAAP increases of 37.6%. The fourth quarter was also strong with cash increases of 10.7% and GAAP increases of 29.8%. We are honored to work with the most innovative life science companies in the world and believe these metrics further validate the value we are providing to the life science ecosystem. Solid occupancy. We are at 94.6% across 31.8 million square feet in the operating portfolio. And again, context is important here as we have increased the operating portfolio from 26.9 million square feet, as mentioned before, providing strategic embedded growth opportunities through lease-up of available suites in the coming quarters. I just want to emphasize this last point, as the recent acquisitions provide very near-term increases in cash flows and strategic expansion of our tenant base. Market health. Demand continues to be broad-based across our innovation clusters as each of the markets have made meaningful contributions to the company\u2019s overall growth during 2020 and Alexandria continues to capture a dominant market share in each of these clusters. We have discussed potential supply in our core clusters the past several quarters. And as we highlighted during our Investor Day, the conversion of generic office product into mission-critical Class A laboratory facilities is brought with significant fault insufficient clear heights and live loads, compromise hazardous material storage areas, dysfunctional shipping and receiving areas, impaired HVAC capabilities and performance, amongst others. We continue to monitor all potential supply closely, but do not see significant high-quality Class A products being delivered during the near-term in our markets. Also a note on the San Francisco Bay Area as this has been a focus in the press. As we have stated, the life science market continues to be very healthy with low single-digit vacancy of 3.4% and demand of 2.6 million square feet, enabling Alexandria to successfully lease-up our Haskins and 825, 835 project at increasing rental rates, all while the city of San Francisco\u2019s tech office sector is struggling with direct vacancy now at 12.4%, above the 15-year average of 8% and sublease space pushing the availability rate to 20.2%. In conclusion, year 2020 accelerated Alexandria\u2019s leadership role in the life science ecosystem. Our team is energized and enthusiastic to continue our partnership with world-class enterprises and the fight against COVID-19 and in the broader mission of building the future of life-changing innovation. With that, I will hand it off to Peter. Hi, Jamie, it is Steve. Yes, that was really driven. We had two opportunities in core markets with two very exciting tenants to refresh buildings that were 15 to 20 years old. So we go - we went ahead and did that. The incremental yield was exceptionally strong, well into the double-digits. So when we see opportunities like that, we are going to move. So if you excluded those, I think we were in much more of a normal range. But it was opportunistic to go ahead and refresh buildings, secure great tenants. And have exceptionally strong yields as well on the incremental capital. Yes. Yes. Hi, Michael, it is Steve. No, you are right. We were monitoring South San Francisco closely with combination of Kilroy, PEAK and Blackstone at the time. And those projects have all been substantially leased. And look, we track literally building by building, parcel by parcel in each of our markets very closely, and we just don\u2019t see a lot of new Class A high-quality product being delivered. There has been a lot in the press about conversions. And I think at Investor Day, we kind of went through that chapter inverse, and I highlighted it in the comments today, so we stay very vigilant in our analysis of that. But at the current time, we just don\u2019t see significant supply disruptions happening in the market."

            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul, and welcome, everybody, today. With me, as usual, Jenna Foger, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. Want to welcome everybody and extend our thoughts and prayers to each one of you to continue to be well safe and state COVID free. Just over one year ago, January 21, 2020, the United States had its first reported case of COVID-19 in Seattle. And just today, a little more than a year later, we have lost more than 443,000 Americans, a number that is actually quite astounding to imagine. And that does not even count the number of - the millions, probably tens of millions of Americans who have suffered really irreparable personal, mental and financial arm due to the worldwide pandemic. President Roosevelt on Pearl Harbor Day referred to that day as a day that would live in infamy. And I think we will all feel that 2020 is a year that will live in infamy in all of our memories. Talking about the pandemic, there is much work to do to control the virus\u2019 spread. We need to enhance manufacturing supply chains as well as a big effort on distribution, administration of the vaccines as well as continued testing. And we, as a country, I think, for decades, have been ill prepared and behind the curve to respond to a true worldwide and kind of a 100-year pandemic, I think our readiness just has not been there, unfortunately. Much work to do to rebuild businesses and lives so devastatingly impacted. And I would say it is going to take a good part of this decade to do that for many people who\u2019ve been really so devastated. We still have not discovered the root cause of the virus, natural or human made or brought those responsible to an accounting. We at Alexandria at the Vanguard, the heart of the life science industry, are honored, proud and yet humbled to serve this mission-critical industry, which has been on the forefront, 24/7, really as the savior of human kind in this pandemic. It really doesn\u2019t get more important or impactful than that truly. There are two primary causes behind the COVID vaccines rescue of humanity from this pandemic, I firmly believe. The first one is our free market system here in the United States, the economic system that facilitated the innovation, competition and cooperation between our biotech and pharma industries and government, that literally doesn\u2019t happen in other countries around the world. There would likely be no multiple COVID vaccines today that they are not being venture capitalist prepared to invest before product or profit was really visible and no corporate leadership would be willing to double down other than those in our country with the company\u2019s own money in the spring of 2020 to fund a crash effort to produce a safe and affected vaccine by year-end, really truly unheard of. Operator, if we could go to questions, please. Yes. So thanks, Jamie. This is Joel. I will ask Peter to comment in a minute. We don\u2019t want to say too much about Fenway at this point. Peter has given a little bit of detail. He can talk a little more about it. I think it is pretty clear that the location of Fenway which has good proximity to the other submarkets, obviously, to Boston itself and Downtown and Cambridge, but it is also pretty proximate to the collection of important Harvard hospitals, et cetera. And it has been a submarket that has been, I think, quite vital for several decades, and we just think that time is right for the kind of change to a more life science orientation there. And so that is one of the motivations that certainly attracted us. It is pretty clear that the greater Boston region still is the number one region or I should say the number 1 cluster market in the world and still the major destination for so many companies because there is such a rich amount of science, talent capital and the location is certainly one that is excellent. So Peter, just general comments? Yes, I don\u2019t think you - people ask about that all the time about when we acquire something or become involved in a transaction. We never know what is - and I\u2019m sure Blackstone has the same feeling. You never know until a - like the University Park assets came forward when or if that will ever happen. So I don\u2019t think you can make any general assumptions about things like that. I think they\u2019re very opportunistic, and they\u2019re very dependent upon the time play space. So I wouldn\u2019t take anything, read anything into it or out of it. All - every one of these is just quite unique on their own. Steve and Dean, you guys maybe want to? Well, yes, they... Yes. So we don\u2019t fully know what the health side of the administration is going to look like. We have some indication. But I would say it is too early to tell. I think, though, that when it comes to the enormous substrate, which exists in the NIH and in much of the funding that goes on at really the basic research level. That has remained, I think, very favorably bipartisan for decades now. And I don\u2019t think there will be any change in the increase-- the rate of increase with respect to that. I think the biggest worry would be a knee-jerk reaction by some to raise corporate taxes to try to somewhat either address deficits or just because it seems fair. But the challenge with that and policymakers and lawmakers should really know better and understand that plants can revert back to Ireland or more favorable tax havens and cash can go overseas if the incentives aren\u2019t made to do those things in America. So I hope that people take a long-term view of that. But at the moment, I think, by and large, it looks, I would say, favorable but still too early to tell. Well, we do, and we have done that from time to time. So the answer is, I\u2019m sure we will review that almost real-time and certainly consider that for sure. You have revealed the office playbook because when you have a generic commodity product, that is true. But I think as Peter indicated or Steve, when you have a mission-critical project, much like the Waples in Sorrento Mesa with Cue Health, you don\u2019t just turn it over to the cheapest guy on the Street or the one who maybe has something available. It is much more careful than that. Office space, that is true. But when you have critical R&D and critical next-gen manufacturing, that just doesn\u2019t happen that way. Well, I think maybe two things, Rich. One is, I think, COVID and pandemic virus, we have been through a number of mini ones over the years. But certainly, this is one of the biggest ones we have ever seen in our lifetime, different than HIV aids, which we did turn into a chronic condition. So I think and Jenna said, it will be with us for a long, long time, and there will be continual efforts not only on the vaccine side and the booster side, the testing side, this testing is going to be critical going forward, and then obviously, on the therapy side because if you can take a quick - if you can have access to therapy that is maybe not infusible, but 1 that is a pill like, just as you get a sour throat, you get a fever, that would be a whole lot better than trying to - or being very sick and looking for an infusion site.

So I would say stay tuned. I\u2019m sorry, what? Yes? I\u2019m sorry. So the question is what? Well, we don\u2019t know the answer to that. They may sublease, and they may not. Jenna, do you want to maybe just comment on the nature of that change? Yes. And it would be easy to backfill space if we had it in those locations, I can tell you. No closing remarks other than to wish everybody be safe, be healthy and COVID-free, and we look forward to talking to you on the first quarter call. Thank you again, everybody."

            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. I\u2019m going to follow-up on some remarks we made about our valuation on Investor Day. And then I\u2019m going to update you all on our development pipeline and briefly comment on a new acquisition. As the inventor and pioneer of the essential life science real estate asset class, we have created our campuses and clusters in the best locations with the market\u2019s best assets. By combining our irreplaceable locations and our world-class campuses and ecosystems with meticulously designed, highly functional buildings and a world-class tenant base, Alexandria has aggregated the best life science real estate base in the world and it isn\u2019t close. During Investor Day, we highlighted our views that the private market has been sending strong signals that there should be significant upside in our stock price. This included a comparison of Ventas\u2019 acquisition of the Genesis property in South San Francisco for $1,260 per square foot, which has since been updated to $1,301 per square foot. And Blackstone\u2019s recap of BMR at a value of $1,100 per square foot against a very simple back of the napkin, $767 per square foot implied value of our operating portfolio, which was based upon the difference between the closing price of our common stock on September 30, 2020, and the book value of other significant assets such as construction in progress, venture investments and cash divided by our total operating square feet. We acknowledge that the implied value of our operating portfolio can vary up or down depending upon the valuation of our other assets and liabilities as well as adjustments for joint ventures, but we believe the underlying thesis remains true, which is that Alexandria is significantly undervalued. The Genesis property is vastly inferior to our South San Francisco asset base. It is located on the opposite side of the 101 Freeway, making it part of the cluster by address only. The original South Tower is an office building conversion, which sat vacant for years and required some jerry rigging to make it work and will require more work to complete the conversion of the top floors. And the North Tower has relatively small floor place, which causes it to have a load factor that exceeds what is typically acceptable in the market. Both buildings have relatively low floor-to-floor heights that will dictate a lower finished ceiling than the market prefers. And as a result, the two buildings did not attract a high-quality tenant base. Blackstone has done well reforming and adding to BMRs original somewhat older and tired asset base. But given Alexandria superior locations, assets and tenants, our asset base should command a premium valuation on the real estate alone. Taking all this into account, our assets should be valued significantly higher than what is implied by today\u2019s stock price. Since Investor Day, more evidence from the private markets has come to light such as the sale of the 2.3 million square foot former Forest City lab portfolio from Brookfield to Blackstone BMR for $3.45 billion, which implied an approximately $1,500 per square foot total valuation according to Green Street. Approximately 90% of the portfolio is concentrated in University Park, which was the original Cambridge development area before the emergence of Kendall Square. And according to CoStar, the allocation to those assets yielded a value of $1,800 per square foot and an implied cap rate of 4.2%. This value, and therefore, the overall value of the transaction would have likely been materially higher if not for the fact that those assets are in relatively short to medium-term ground leases. When comparing this portfolio to Alexandria\u2019s primary Cambridge asset base located in the preferred Kendall square location. It should be apparent that the location of our assets are superior as we are aggregated at the front door of MIT, proximate to the Kendall square tea stop in the center of gravity of the East Cambridge ecosystem versus being on the western edge of MIT, far from the heart of the campus in the less desirable area of Cambridge port. Some sell-side analysts seem to agree with this premise. The five that have NAVs above our current stock price ranging from $175.54 to $184 per share, value our operating portfolio within a range of $824 per square foot to $1,062 per square foot. These same analysts have price targets ranging from $185 per square foot to $206. So they seem to be factoring in the private market activity we are seeing. If you are still not convinced and want to look at it from a different angle, I would encourage you to compare Alexandria\u2019s multiple to the sector FFO multiples published in cities weekly REIT and lodging strategy published on January 15. Even with all of the momentum in life science real estate, the single-family home sector\u2019s FFO multiple is 1.1 higher than ours. The industrial mixed ratio is 3.9 higher and the manufactured homes and data center FFO multiple ratios are 3.8 and 5.6 higher than Alexandria\u2019s, respectively. We are in the early days of the biology revolution with 10,000 known diseases and less than 10% of those are addressable treatments. COVID-19 has brought unprecedented positive sentiment to the sector as the world recognizes the life science industry\u2019s contributions to solving today\u2019s greatest health challenges. The five fundamentals that signals strong demand, government funding, medical research philanthropy, FDA regulatory environment, venture capital and public market investor sentiment and commercial R&D funding continue to have tailwinds and there is no reason to suspect that, that will change anytime soon. The life science industry is one of the few bright spots in the world today, and Alexandria is well positioned to enable and participate in its outside growth. We invite you to reassess your valuation and future prospects in light of the private market data presented and the significant prospects for growth in our underlying industry. On to development. We are pleased to report that we continue to make great progress with our development pipeline. We delivered 177,953 square feet and three projects in the fourth quarter including 100% of the 9877 Waples Street project in the Seromas submarket of San Diego, which was featured at Investor Day because it illustrated the power of our brand. When an existing tenant needed to expand, and we did not have space for them, they found a building and effectuated the sale to us by telling the owner it would only lease it from us because the facility was mission-critical to them, and they would not entrust its development and operation with anyone else. Leasing activity has been robust since the third quarter with over 913,000 square feet of leasing completed and approximately 50,000 square feet of space put under LOI in the development redevelopment pipeline, led by significant leasing at 201 Haskins in South San Francisco. The Alexandria center for Life Science San Carlos, 3115 Merryfield in San Diego, and the newly acquired Alexandria Center for Life Science, Durham, which significantly increased their pre-leasing percentages in the range of 27% to 58%. Overall, with the addition of 6 new projects, we now have approximately 3.3 million square feet under construction, that is 74% pre-leased, an increase of over 1.3 million square feet from last quarter\u2019s project aggregation, which was only 63% pre-leased. And as Joel mentioned, I would like to conclude by expressing our great pride and enthusiasm with the acquisition just recently closed 401 Park Drive, 201 Brookline and a continuous development site that will provide Alexandria operating income and an ability to realize upside by marking rents to market, converting certain office and retail space to lab, completing the lease-up of 201 Brookline and developing the future 400,000 square foot development opportunity into a world-class laboratory office building in the Fenway. We are also pleased to be developing this campus in a collaborative venture with esteemed local developer Samuelson associates, who has been the visionary for the Fenway for more than 20 years. With that, I\u2019m going to pass it over to Dean. Yes. Thanks, Jamie. Look, the 401 Park asset is a really nice office R&D building. It has some dry lab in it. It has a great tenant roster. It is got great duration and leases. And there is going to be opportunities for us to convert some of that to lab over time. The development of 201 Brookline is doing really well ever since we\u2019re awarded the transaction. There is been great activity. We will be reporting on that in future quarters. There is some opportunities at the 401 Park building as well to mark some rents to market. So overall, just typical Alexandria value creation play here with combination of using our brand to increase rents to bring new product to market, and ultimately, another building to create a nice urban campus."

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team is super passionate about our strategic initiatives to drive unique, disruptive and highly impactful solutions to tackle society\u2019s most complex and pressing challenges. Now they are also very pleased with continued recognition as a leader in ESG. From our 115 projects focused on solving the opioid epidemic, combating the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRESB sector leadership and leadership in health, wellness and safety. Our team\u2019s passion goes well beyond operational excellence and strong financial and operating results from our real estate business. Our fourth quarter and year-end 2020 financial and operating results were outstanding. For 2020, we reported strong growth in total revenues of 23.1%, NOI growth of 24.8%, and adjusted EBITDA growth of 17.4%, EPS and FFO as adjusted of $6.01 and $7.70 per share diluted, respectively. Now our high-quality properties in tenant roster, combined with our outstanding execution by our best-in-class team, continue to generate strong performance, including many results representing some of the top in the REIT industry. Investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies generate 55% of our annual rental revenue, consistently high and timely payment of rent and well into the 99% range each month. Strong 5.1% cash same-property NOI growth. Strong leasing velocity with record rental rate growth of 37.6% and 18.3% on a cash basis, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%, highlighting operational excellence, occupancy of 94.6% or 97.7% adjusted for vacancy at recently acquired properties. And please see Page 25 of our supplemental package for details on vacancy at these recently acquired properties. Now I should briefly mention that our quarterly rental rate growth related to lease renewals and releasing of space does vary occasionally, since it is only 1/4 of our annual leasing volume. For example, in the third quarter of 2020, we reported 30.9% cash rental rate growth. And then in the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported 10.7% cash rental rate growth. I think the key takeaway is that rental rate growth for 2020 was very strong at 37.6% and 18.3% on a cash basis. And importantly, our outlook for 2021 reflects continued strength in the financial and operating performance, including rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing of space at 30.5% and 17.5% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. Now our team is executing extremely well. We are projecting strong growth in net operating income and cash flows. We anticipate significant growth in occupancy in 2021 and 2022, as our team executes on lease-up of recently acquired properties with vacancy. Additionally, as Peter highlighted, we have a very highly leased pipeline of projects undergoing construction and a very large volume of deliveries in 2021. Now it is important to highlight that our Board has been very consistent with our common stock dividend policy, given the high amount of operating cash flows after dividends that we generate each year. Now in 2020, the growth in our annual common stock dividend was 6%, and cash flows from operating activities after dividends is projected in 2021 to be approximately $230 million at the midpoint of our guidance. Now on Friday, we completed the purchase of what has been rebranded as the Alexandria Center for Life Science, Fenway. It is a campus of 1.8 million square feet upon full build-out. Now as a result, we expect to settle the $1.1 billion in forward equity sale agreements in March, and that was related to our January common stock offering. So huge kudos to our entire team for outstanding execution on this transaction and upon full build-out, this will represent another awesome collaborative campus in our asset base. It is super important to have one of the best teams in the country, since real estate transactions move quickly from selection by the seller to closing. And in this case, the seller selected Alexandria as the best party for this transaction on December 9. On the real estate disposition front, we provided our initial range of guidance for 2021 at a midpoint of $1.375 billion, and we will provide more information on dispositions quarter-to-quarter. Our team has really positioned us very well with our pipeline of redevelopment and development of Class A properties. The key highlights include execution over one million rentable square feet of leasing in 2020 related to our development and redevelopment pipeline. Projects undergoing construction aggregate 3.2 million rentable square feet or 74% leased, about 2.5 million or plus square feet of this is projected for delivery in 2021, making 2021 the largest year of deliveries for Alexandria. And this to generate annual net operating income of about $135 million, which on average, commences in the third quarter of 2021. Now we have a number of well-located near-term projects, aggregating 4.9 million rentable square feet including approximately 348,000 rentable square feet that is 79% leased with vertical construction commencing in the second quarter. And in January, we added two key projects under construction, aggregating 640,000 rentable square feet with pre-leasing in the 20% to 25% range. Now our venture portfolio continues to perform extremely well. Realized gains on our venture investments included in FFO per share were $21.6 million and $71.6 million for the fourth quarter and 2020, respectively. Now as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA, our venture investment gains were approximately 5.5% for 2020, up slightly from approximately the mid-4% range for 2019. And as we look forward into 2021, we expect venture investment gains to increase slightly as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA as we look to capture a portion of the unrealized gains in the portfolio. Unrealized gains on venture investments as of December 31 were $776 million on our adjusted cost basis of $835 million. Now thank you to our team for hitting our key balance sheet goals, and we are well positioning our balance sheet to support our strategic business initiatives. We are very pleased to have corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of companies within the REIT industry. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 5.3 times for fourth quarter annualized with slight improvement to 5.2 times by the end of 2021. Now our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.6 times for the fourth quarter annualized and is also expected to improve by the fourth quarter 2021. Liquidity was very solid at $4.1 billion, and we continue to view long-term capital to fund growth in our business and are very fortunate to have access to efficient cost of capital. Now to put this into perspective, pricing for 10 and 30-year bonds today for Alexandria is extremely attractive at approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. Our prior shelf registration expired in December 2020, three years after we filed it. An odd aspect of the ATM program is that each program is associated with a specific shelf registration versus the program that can be used as long as you have an effective shelf registration in place. Now in our case, our ATM program expired in connection with the shelf registration statement that expired in December. And as a result, we expect to file a new ATM program over the next 4 weeks. Moving on to guidance. Please refer to our detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2021 guidance, beginning on Page 12 of our supplemental package. Changes were limited to a breakout of our range of real estate dispositions from the overall equity type capital guidance. The midpoint of our guidance for dispositions, as I mentioned earlier, is at $1.375 billion. And we also provided an update on acquisitions completed in January 2021, most of which was previously disclosed. Now there were no changes in our 2021 guidance for EPS diluted of a range from $2.14 to $2.34 and FFO per share diluted of a range from $7.60 to $7.80. Now embedded in our overall guidance is continued strong growth in cash flows as we execute on the lease-up and occupancy growth in 2021 and 2022 and continued execution on an important year of record deliveries in 2021 of our highly leased redevelopment and development projects. With that, let me turn it back to Joel. Well, as Tom, it is Dean here, just to clarify. As I mentioned in our commentary, and you have our guidance for 2021, which our guidance for occupancy covers the entire asset base in the operating portfolio, and you have got something in the range of, I think, 170 basis point growth in occupancy, and then that continues into 2022 as well. We\u2019re actually likely to pick up something approaching 300 basis points over the two calendar years. So you are going to see occupancy growth from the acquisitions be a key driver and it is not - we find the asset that fit our business profile nicely. And occasionally they come with some vacancy that we need to manage. But fortunately, we feel comfortable about making good progress on that in 2021. So that is going to be a key driver, and you will see that continue to benefit into 2022 as well. So that is important to note. It is just not a one year trend. I think 2022 will benefit probably as well in the same-property pool because some of those properties will start to drop into the same-property pool over time. It is just - Jamie, it is Dean here. It is slight. I think what my comments were - in 2019 was probably in the 4.5% range, 2020 was probably about 5.5% of EBITDA and just a slight growth anticipated as we look out to 2021 on top of that. So it is still staying pretty small as a percentage of overall EBITDA."

            "content": "Thank you so much, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. So really echoing Joel here. As the entire world looks to the power of science, the life science industry and specifically to our tenants to lead us out of this devastating COVID pandemic. 2020 has underscored why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and purpose helped drive this mission-critical industry forward. Without a doubt biopharma, essential R&D engine has persisted with amazing productivity and resilience throughout the past year, which has further magnified our tenant\u2019s role as the key solution to overcoming today\u2019s greatest health challenges, bringing unprecedented positive sentiment to the sector, as Joel mentioned. The achievements in COVID vaccine development from our tenants, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax and AstraZeneca many others in the fourth quarter, specifically of 2020 and into the beginning of 2021, have marked the culmination of a full year\u2019s worth of tireless, truly collaborative efforts across the industry with significant aid of federal funding. Sure, for sure. So bluebird bio, basically announced. They haven\u2019t disclosed the details other than that they\u2019re basically dividing the company between severe genetic diseases and oncology company. And so we usually have exposure to them in Greater Boston, specifically in Cambridge and then in Seattle. And so basically, they\u2019re - everything that they\u2019re retaining in place is what they have kind of with us, both in terms of their H2 in Cambridge and then manufacturing in Seattle, so we\u2019re really not concerned about that at all."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the Alexandria Real Estate Equities Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nPaula Schwartz: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. \nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to Alexandria's third quarter call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Jenna Foger. I'd like to welcome everybody and -- from the Alexandria team and family wishing -- hoping you're all well, safe and COVID-free. \n As all of us know, 2020 has been an astounding year of the never-imagined confluence of a international pandemic from Wuhan, China; a deep shutdown recession; civil strife; coupled with a heated and complex election upcoming here next week. 2020 started off very sadly with the untimely death of Kobe Bryant, not only a great athlete but a special human being. And I want to make just a brief quote from one of his great things. He often said that, \"Great things come from hard work and perseverance.\" And those of you who knew or watched or admired Kobe, always, he was the last guy to finish up and the first guy to start, and was one of the hardest working people anyone could ever imagine. \n And that really exemplifies our team, and want to thank our team from the bottom of our -- my heart and our team's heart, for doing such a great job. Alexandria has really uniquely achieved 3 outputs that are very rare in corporate America today that define a truly great company: continuing superior results, continuing distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And again, we want to thank our entire team for a stellar third quarter as we are all building the future of life-changing innovation, literally during COVID-19. One could never imagine that. \n So a couple of different comments. I wanted to comment on the recent Blackstone transaction where Blackstone announced the recapitalization of its life science real estate business. And it only serves, I think, to reconfirm once again the great vote of confidence in the life science real estate niche we pioneered in 1994. \n The transaction implies an approximate $1,070 price per square foot for that 13 million square foot portfolio. And I think compared to where Alexandria trades more or less today at about $950 a square foot, I think that's, I think, very good benchmark for us. Blackstone timed its, I think, 2015 purchase really quite ideally as the biotech industry was emerging from about a 5- or 6-year bear market in the 2013 and 2014 time frame. And at that time, when they acquired the assets, they were, by and large -- most of the buildings were older than Alexandria's, and they were not in as strong locations as we were. They've clearly enhanced that portfolio since, and kudos to them for doing that. \n I want to take a particular mention on third quarter activity on our Research Triangle acquisition, which is really a particular note. A large acquisition, about $590 million purchase price, about $265 a square foot, 2.2 million square feet over about 300 acres, 20 buildings with very high credit tenant but also significant value add. This acquisition substantially increased our footprint in Research Triangle, and particularly was motivated by our need to accommodate numerous inbound substantial tenant requirements, both who needed existing solutions and build-to-suit capabilities. We now have 3 mega campuses in the Triangle, this newly branded campus, the Alexandria Center for Life Science \u2013 Durham; the Alexandria Center for AgTech; and the Alexandria Center for Advanced Technologies. \n We see continuing strong demand for life science base across our markets, but particularly pointed are the many requirements from our own tenant base within. Also, it's important to remember, 2 key truths have really been revealed by COVID-19. One is the resilience of -- and the need for domestic medical supply chains to be here based in the United States, crucial for national security and for medical supply. And I think it only reinforces that complex medicines are really the future of health care. And I guess the famous COVID-19 antibody cocktails would be a good example of that. \n I wanted to mention a little bit about Operation Warp Speed. This was initiated by the Trump administration and supported by more than $10 billion in funding through the CARES Act. Operation Warp Speed led by really a legendary, probably one of the most skilled vaccine developers in the entire world, Moncef Slaoui, aims to deliver 300 million doses of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine in first quarter as part of a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Really all in tandem, very different than the government has ever operated before and really a great credit to public-private partnerships. \n The Warp Speed partnership is between selected biopharma companies and key federal science agencies, including BARDA, CDC, DoD, FDA, HHS and the NIH. As of October 21, the initiative announced funding decisions totaling over $13 billion for 10 companies -- more than 10 companies to support vaccine therapy and manufacturing efforts. These included virtually all of which, maybe except one, our tenants of Alexandria, Moderna, GSK, Sanofi, Pfizer, Novavax, AstraZeneca, J&J, Merck, Regeneron, Emergent Bio and Fujifilm. So quite a humongous feat, I think, given the onset of this pandemic in a pretty odd fashion. I think to this date, there is certainly speculation that this was not a natural occurring virus, but one that was man-made in a lab in Wuhan. \n A couple of comments about the life science industry. And again, a real shout-out to the great private-public partnerships that have been formed in so many different fashions. The life science fundamentals throughout 2020 have remained fundamentally strong, especially given the critical nature of the fight against COVID-19. This has helped lead to substantial progress and acceleration including late-stage vaccine trials and therapeutics, along with improved and expanded testing. The life science industry has not slowed down its pace. It's important to remember of investment in innovation well beyond COVID-19. \n The industry's commitment and investment in innovation, along with the FDA's ability to continue to operate at a high level despite the pandemic, has led to 40 new drug approvals as of the end of September, which puts us on a pace to meet or exceed the 51 average of the past couple of years. I was on a call last week with Commissioner Hahn. And it's a great credit to he and the entire professional workforce at the FDA for their really 24/7 effort in this time. \n Life science venture funding has continued to flow at a strong pace in the third quarter, setting new quarterly records at almost $12 billion, with more than $30 billion raised through the first 3 quarters, really surpassing all previous annual totals. It's important to remember that most of the -- this investment, 80% comes from Alexandria's core markets. And especially greater Boston, San Francisco, which capture about 60%. \n Capital flows to early-stage companies and the public markets continue at a fast pace. There have been 47 pharma and biotech IPOs in the first 3 quarters of this year, raising almost $9 billion larger than any previous year. And the companies have been able to access capital markets at historic levels approximating almost $35 billion in follow-on offerings, surpassing the previous high of about $29 billion in 2015. So all in all, it's been a pretty strong tailwind for the industry and what we're doing. \n So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jenna Foger, our Senior VP of our Science and Tech team, and she's going to talk about the latest developments in the vaccine therapeutic area. So Jenna, please? \nJenna Foger: Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. \n So as this unprecedented pandemic races on, giving rise to a new record high resurgence in COVID cases across the country and forging an indelible mark on the global economy, society and, of course, the future of public health, the imminent need for safe and effective treatments of vaccines to combat this coronavirus is paramount. And those skepticism and impatience have set in as each and every one of us navigates this uncomfortably discomforting human experience of waiting, never before has the work of our tenants in the life science industry have been more important. \n In the mission-critical and absolutely essential efforts of our nearly 100 tenants with meaningful COVID programs represent the beacon of hope for an end to this COVID-19 pandemic. In aggregate, our tenants in the life science industry also represents the solution for the longer-term impact to human health, which COVID has urged us all to rethink an increased focus on prevention, overdue innovation and infectious disease and other neglected therapeutic areas, and new paradigms for R&D collaboration, next-generation manufacturing, supply chain efficiency and improved distribution and access to new medicines. \n Clearly, a safe and effective vaccine should help bring about the effective end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is absolutely a requisite to meaningfully reopen society and restore the global economy. As such, researchers around the world are working with unprecedented speed and collaboration on at least 135 distinct coronavirus vaccine programs, of which nearly 50 vaccine candidates are already in human trials. As Joel mentioned, a cornerstone of the U.S. government's effort to expedite the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines is, of course, the Operation Warp Speed initiative with the vast majority of its grant recipients being to Alexandria tenants. \n So among these efforts, I want to call your attention to 4 of the most advanced vaccine programs from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Novavax, each a top tenant for Alexandria in their respective regions, and each applying a slightly different underlying technology and approach to vaccine development. Each one of these companies has reported clinical data that suggest initial safety and efficacy, and each are currently conducting major Phase III studies with tens of thousands of subjects around the world. Key data readouts from each of these companies are expected in the fourth quarter of this year spanning between now probably November and December. Together, these 4 companies alone are building capacity to provide over 6 billion doses next year. \n So what do we make of all of this? And it's the constant flow of headlines. It is highly likely that at least one, and likely more than one of these initial Phase III trials will report interim efficacy results in November and December of this year. If they do, the FDA could grant emergency use authorization by year-end or very early into 2021, which would enable the highest risk populations like health care workers and others to begin to receive the vaccine over the coming months. \n The FDA has set the minimum standard efficacy threshold for all COVID vaccines at 50%, meaning that a vaccine will have to protect at least 50% of those receiving it to receive emergency use authorization. And based on some of the data that's come out to date and the time that it's taken for companies like Pfizer or Moderna and others to report their data, health care analysts have begun to predict efficacy more likely in the range of at least 70%, but all obviously remains to be seen. \n As more data becomes available and the vaccines begin to be distributed, if safety and efficacy persists, these companies and others could receive FDA approval in the first half of 2021 with widespread distribution of safe and effective vaccines to the public sometime in the next year. Given the addressable population, pretty much the entire world, this will not be a winner-take-all opportunity and no one company alone will supply the global demand in the near term. Over time, the most effective vaccines will likely have more upside. \n Of course, many questions remain, and we'll continue to learn more in the coming months as more data rolls out. Just as it remains unclear how long natural immunity lasts after a person becomes infected with COVID-19, similarly, the durability of a COVID-19 vaccine is still a wide open question. Will COVID be a pandemic like SARS or MERS that will subside over time? Or will it be more endemic or flu-like, creating a longer-term market opportunity for the current treatments and development? \n In addition to safety and efficacy questions, challenges related to capacity, access, distribution, logistics and early adoption are all being navigated in real time. Meaningful strides are being taken by our tenants in the life science industry to preempt as many of these complexities as possible. \n And of course, in the meantime, new antibody therapies by companies such as tenants Vir in collaboration with GSK, Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca could serve as a bridge to a vaccine, taken prophylactically and/or to help reduce the severity of COVID-19, especially if taken early in the course of disease, as we see now with the Eli Lilly's antibody. Key data readouts will be forthcoming over the next few months while Eli Lilly's single-agent antibody and Regeneron's antibody cocktail have filed for emergency use authorization and await approval. \n Other notable advances in the treatment of COVID-19 included the FDA's first COVID-specific approval of tenant Gilead's antiviral drug Veklury or remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization. The FDA has also granted emergency use authorization for the use of convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with severe disease. And the NIH has also included within its guidance the use of dexamethasone or steroids in hospitalized COVID patients requiring supplemental oxygen.\n These notable and expedient efforts across our tenant base and the life science industry are in large part to the fact that as the coronavirus made itself known to the world almost a year ago now, these companies were already well equipped with the R&D infrastructure, technology platforms, resources and talent in place such that they were able to mobilize quickly and meaningfully to combat this global health crisis. It is our honor to continue to serve at the vanguard of this essential life science industry and to support the heroic work of our tenants and campus communities, focused on bringing an end to this pandemic, addressing the 10,000-plus diseases already known to us today and innovating the future of drug discovery to solve tomorrow's risks to human health. \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Thank you. \nStephen A. Richardson: Thank you, Jenna. Good afternoon, everyone. \n The very strong results we've achieved during the third quarter are a testament to both the clear vision the company has had since its inception more than 25 years ago, and a highly creative and entrepreneurial team that has skillfully adapted to this tumultuous time. Alexandria's mega campuses are now not only essential and mission-critical, but they are also especially desirable in capturing a significant majority of the life science growth in the marketplace. \n The Alexandria brand is highly valued across the entire life cycle -- life science ecosystem for its well-earned trusted relationships, impeccable integrity and unparalleled expertise and experience. These timeless elements are the foundation for a tenant's decisions to continue to seek out a collaborative and mutually beneficial multidimensional platform for their growth with Alexandria. As the challenges only increased for navigating success in the quest to eradicate disease and improve nutrition globally, particularly with a once-in-a-century pandemic upon us, Alexandria stands out and is recognized as an innovative, insightful and unique partner as the following results clearly demonstrate.\n In the realm of operational excellence, the company has collected 99.7% of its accounts receivable during the third quarter and 99.7% during October. The 24/7 nature of these labs and the fundamental value they provide for our tenants is clearly evident with these operational statistics.\n On the leasing front, we have continued outperformance. During the third quarter, we outperformed the second quarter leasing activity with a total of 1.2 million square feet leased, which brings us to nearly 3 million square feet leased year-to-date during 2020, which is pretty impressive considering our 10-year leasing average is 3.9 million square feet. Alexandria's team is fully engaged, and our tenant base is thriving and continuing to grow.\n To underscore the leasing outperformance, this quarterly run rate during the time of COVID is approximately equal to or better than the leasing run rate during the first quarter, the second quarter and the third quarter of 2019. And of particular note is the 80% leased or negotiation status of the development pipeline for the same set of projects detailed in our Q2 supplemental, so very solid progress with our on-balance sheet growth engine, and Peter will provide further details during his remarks.\n Our core continues to be strong with rental rate increases of 30.9% cash and 39.9% GAAP for renewals and re-leases. And early renewals for the third quarter are above our historic levels and reached 86%, so the sense of urgency remains strong for our tenant base. Our mark-to-market is at 16.4% cash, a 90 bps increase from the second quarter and 17.1% GAAP, up 120 bps over the second quarter.\n Occupancy continues to be solid at 94.9% across 31.2 million square feet in the operating portfolio. And after taking into account the recently acquired lease-up opportunities, we would otherwise be at 97.7% occupancy, up 60 bps from the second quarter.\n Market health continues to be strong with robust lab demand of 3.2 million square feet in the Bay Area of San Francisco, 2.5 million square feet in the greater Boston region and 2.1 million square feet in San Diego. But importantly, there's a market acceleration to high-quality, COVID-safe campuses and evidenced, again, by our ability to capture a dominant market share of promising and strong credit life science companies.\n So in conclusion, Alexandria's pioneering efforts have placed the company at the actual and virtual intersection of science and global health. The team is entrepreneurial, creative and fully prepared to meet and decisively capitalize on this opportunity to partner with our tenants for the benefit of health across the globe.\n With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. \nPeter M. Moglia: Thanks, Steve. \n I'm going to briefly update you all on our development pipeline, the impact of Prop 15 on Alexandria and touch on a recent third-party asset sale in one of our submarkets. So as with developments, overall, the leasing activity was very robust. We had over 300,000 square feet of leases completed and approximately 490,000 square feet of space put under LOI in the development, redevelopment pipeline during the quarter. And that was led by a significant demand at our 2 Bay Area projects, 201 Haskins and the Alexandria District project in San Carlos.\n There have been a few adjustments to the development, redevelopment pipeline from last quarter. 975 (sic) [ 945 ] Market Street in SoMa was sold for $198 million as noted in our dispositions disclosure. Accepting the unsolicited offer really made a lot of sense to us as an opportunity to really recycle that capital into our already robust pipeline. 704 Quince Orchard Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland and 9880 Campus Point Drive in San Diego were successfully completed during the quarter and put into operation.\n So as those assets were removed from the pipeline, 2 new assets have been added including the Parmer campus in Research Triangle that Joel referenced. That was acquired in the third quarter and has been rebranded as Alexandria Center for Life Science \u2013 Durham, approximately 650,000 square feet of the 2.2 million square foot campus is slated for redevelopment into research and development lab space for manufacturing space, and it has already been 50% pre-leased. The second asset, Alexandria Center for Advanced Technologies is also in the Triangle, and features research and manufacturing space in 2 buildings that are a combined 40% pre-leased.\n We have also disclosed 3 new pre-leased projects in our San Diego region: 3115 Merryfield Row, also referred to as Spectrum 3, is 146,456 square foot ground-up development. That will be the fourth and final phase of our Spectrum 3 -- for our Spectrum campus in Torrey Pines. The project has considerable interest. 80% of the building is already under letter of intent.\n At Alexandria Point, we have pre-leased 100% of a new ground-up -- once ground-up 171,102 square foot development on that mega campus to a credit tenant. And at the San Diego Tech by Alexandria project, we've kicked off our first ground-up development with a 59% pre-leasing of 176,428 square foot building to an exciting genetic sequencing company, a technology that's really a major strength of the San Diego region.\n On to Prop 15, we're sure everybody is aware of the details of California's Proposition 15 ballot measure that would overhaul the state's property tax limitation of 2% increases per year and replace it with market value assessments every 3 years for commercial properties that have values in excess of $3 million. If Proposition 15 is passed, the property taxes for some of our properties in California could substantially increase. \n Our current assessment is that we're in pretty good position to absorb the impact of this proposition should it pass as our California asset base is relatively young, with approximately 60% of our California properties purchased or developed, redeveloped over the past 10 years, and our triple-net leases allow us to pass-through, among other costs, substantially all real estate and rent-related taxes to our tenants in the form of additional rent tenant recoveries. Consequently, as a result of having triple-net leases and a relatively new asset base, we do not expect potential increases of property taxes resulting from tax reassessments to significantly impact our operating results, and they will have almost no impact on NOI.\n Moving to the asset sale I mentioned. So over the past 2 quarters, we've discussed strong interest in lab office assets from a diverse set of investors mentioning Healthpeak's purchase of The Post and Waltham at a 5.1% cap rate and a healthy price per square foot of $751 a foot for a suburban asset. Their purchase of 35 Cambridge Park Drive for almost $1,500 a square foot in a 4.8% cap rate. And Beacon's purchase, I think, referenced last quarter of 27 Drydock, subject to a very onerous ground lease in the Seaport area of Boston at a 4.8% cap rate and a $916 per square foot value. It is still a good time to be in the market with assets in life science markets.\n During the third quarter, Ventas purchased the Genesis Towers and 4000 Shoreline in South San Francisco for $1.02 billion or $1,301 per square foot and a 4.75% cap rate. We were somewhat surprised by that valuation as the Towers sit oddly and alone on the west side of the 101 Freeway and the south tower's an actual converted office building, which as we've been talking about at a number of recent meetings, can cause less than ideal conditions for tenants. For instance, the low clear height of the base building design led to lower finished -- a lower-finished ceiling than what you would normally find in a Class A lab building. And since the building had an office tenant in the top floors during its conversion, much of the ducting resides on the exterior of the building, making for less than ideal aesthetics and the freight elevator does not reach the building's other floors. All of these things really put the project at a competitive disadvantage to others in the rental market.\n Look, despite the exuberance of our product type, we are going to continue to maintain our highly disciplined approach to underwriting. And know that our deep knowledge, expertise and experience will continue to provide us with great opportunities to grow our asset base at reasonable valuations. \n And with that, I will pass it over to Dean. \nDean Shigenaga: Okay. Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. \n Our essential real estate portfolio continues to provide highly innovative entities with mission-critical research facilities really focused on acceleration of innovation to advance human health. We're very proud to be the key partner to leading entities across pharma, biotech and AgTech, and have a highly experienced team delivering operational excellence quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. \n Our high-quality Class A properties and future development sites, combined with our stellar tenant roster, continues to generate high-quality and growing cash flows. Our growth in cash flows from operating activities continue to allow us to increase our common stock dividend, most recently, $1.06 per common share or $4.12 per share on an annual basis, and that was up 6% over the previous 12 months. We are on track to retain over $200 million in cash flows from operating activities after dividends in 2020 for reinvestment into our highly leased development pipeline.\n Our third quarter results were very solid, and 2020 is wrapping up as a strong year for our essential real estate business. Total revenues for the third quarter were up almost 17% over the third quarter of '19 and excluding the termination payment from Pinterest, really highlighting continued, solid execution on both internal and external growth.\n Adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 67% for the third quarter and remains one of the top stats within the REIT industry. The slight temporary decline in the third quarter was due to 2 items, about 1/3 of which was related to temporary vacancy for a space that will be delivered for occupancy in the fourth quarter and about 2/3 of that decline related to seasonal increases in utilities. Now the increase in utility expenses are recoverable from our tenants and did not impact net operating income. Importantly, our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve to 68% in the fourth quarter.\n Rent collections have been very strong, as Steve highlighted, at 99.7% for both 3Q and for October, and in line with our expectations for our mission-critical essential real estate. Now occupancy has been solid this year, 97.7% before the impact of vacancy from recently acquired priorities. And please refer to Page 24 of our supplemental package for a detailed list of vacancy that was acquired recently.\n Now the key takeaway is that recently acquired properties vacancy will provide growth in cash flows as our team executes on these lease-up opportunities. Now our operating results continue to benefit from contractual annual rent escalations averaging approximately 3% from one of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry. As highlighted on our second quarter earnings call, tenants took occupancy in the third quarter, closing out temporary vacancy as of June 30 and contractual rents commenced in 3Q pushing through third quarter same-property results in line for our expectations for 2020.\n Now same-property NOI growth was 2.9% and 4.9% on a cash basis for the third quarter. We reported continued and very strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-lease in the space at almost 40% and almost 31% on a cash basis for the third quarter.\n And quick comment on leasing activity for the quarter and for the 9 months. Two leases did impact the amount of TIs and leasing commitments related to lease renewals and re-lease in the space. One lease executed in the quarter related to re-tenanting of an older building that was occupied by a single tenant for 15 to 20 years, and the infrastructure was not really our traditional generic lab improvements. Also, consistent with our assumptions related to a recent acquisition, we successfully re-leased a portion of the property, along with the TI allowance to bring the space up to ARE standard really for high-quality facilities. \n Now these 2 leases are unusual, and did impact our quarterly average for TIs and leasing commissions. Excluding these 2 leases, our average TIs and LCs for the 3 months and 9 months ended September 30, would have been in line with historical amounts at approximately $17 and $20 per square foot, respectively.\n Now during the quarter, our General Counsel resigned for family reasons. And she really was one of our top leaders in the company. She built a really great team and had an amazing 2-decade career at Alexandria. We truly wish her well. In connection with her departure, we recognized a $4.5 million compensation expense in the third quarter.\n Now turning briefly to venture investments. Over the past year or so, we have been taking advantage of the strength of the portfolio and overall capital markets. Our net cash flows from -- have been about neutral for the first 3 quarters of 2020, highlighting that we have been strategically monetizing certain holdings. Unrealized gains have grown significantly to $542 million as of September 30. And realized gains have averaged about $16.1 million per quarter over the last 4 quarters and was $17.4 million for the third quarter.\n Now our team has been working diligently on our active and near-term development and redevelopment projects. Peter touched on a lot of the details, but key highlights included 4.1 million square feet of active and near-term projects that are highly leased or negotiating at 74% that will generate significant cash flows. This consisted of great progress on the active pipeline that we presented last quarter, which is now 80% leased or negotiating. We added over 900,000 square feet to our active pipeline in the quarter, which is now -- those projects are 54% leased and negotiating. And we also have an additional 500,000 square feet of near-term projects, which are 80% leased or negotiating with vertical construction starts ranging from the fourth quarter to the second quarter of '21. So a huge thanks to our entire team for their outstanding execution on our development and redevelopment pipeline.\n Moving to our balance sheet. I just want to say thank you to our relationship lenders and our team for completing an amendment to our unsecured senior line of credit, providing aggregate commitments of $3 billion, up $800 million and extending the maturity date by 2 years to early 2026. We completed a record low, 12-year bond deal at 1.875% in August of 2020. The all-in rate for 10-year bonds today for Alexandria remains very attractive at approximately 2%.\n Now we remain committed to our strong and improving credit profile and are on track to hit our year-end goal for net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.3x. And we're very proud to highlight one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry, ranking in the top 10 among all publicly traded REITs. We have liquidity of about $3.9 billion reflecting the increase in commitments from our October 2020 amendment to our line of credit. And our weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt was very solid at 10.6 years with very minimal debt maturities until 2024.\n We updated our 2020 guidance and narrowed the range for EPS diluted from $3 to $3.11 (sic) [ $3.09 to $3.11 ], and FFO per share diluted as adjusted from $7.29 to $7.31. Now our targeted dispositions for the remainder of 2020 include 2 key transactions, both of which are moving along very well, with one expected to close real soon. Both of the deals are in process and subject to confidentiality agreements, and therefore, we are unable to comment on either transaction until after closing.\n Now as usual, please refer to detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2020 guidance, beginning on Page 10 of our supplemental package. Additionally, consistent with prior years, we plan to provide our detailed guidance assumptions for 2021 later on -- at our Annual Investor Day on December 1, and therefore, we are unable to comment on 2021 until then.\n Let me turn it back over to Joel. \nJoel Marcus: Thank you. \n We'll go to question and answer. Operator, please? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. \nAnthony Paolone: Okay. I think, Peter, you had mentioned some of the challenges with some of the conversions to lab. But with a lot of the capital circling some conversions, new submarkets and new markets, can you just comment whether you think there's enough demand to go around for everybody? \nJoel Marcus: Well, yes, let me jump in before Peter comments, Tony. I think you have to look at where these are happening and where the demand wants to be, and those don't always match up. I mean -- I think if you look at Cambridge, the ability to add supply there is pretty, pretty tough. And the demand is strong. Same thing, I think, in different parts of San Francisco. So I think you have to isolate where these either are or might be converted. And you heard a little bit about the downside of conversions, they oftentimes don't work out all that well and where the demand is coming from and where they want to go. \n But Peter, you can comment. \nPeter M. Moglia: Yes. I mean I -- just yesterday, an article came out in the Bisnow website of San Francisco, titled, \"Too Low, Too Fragile, Too Short-Term: Life Sciences Conversions Are Popular But Hard To Pull Off\" by -- author's name was Dean Boerner. And I think it's just -- it's a pretty summary-level article. But like we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters, office buildings just don't have the infrastructure needed for a laboratory that will be efficient and flexible at the end of the day. So convert one, you can, but the tenants are going to have to make sacrifices in order to occupy that space. And they could be very material as far as like how many chemicals they can store, where they can put equipment. It's very inefficient compared to Alexandria's portfolio which was purpose-built for labs.\n So we feel like any requirement in any of our submarkets that comes around, we're going to be the first choice. We're going to have a building that's flexible, that works and has a staff that knows how to run it. I mean that's the other thing. There's more than just bricks-and-mortar here. There's operational expertise and that can get very technical. And these are mission-critical facilities. Can't -- our companies can't really afford to go into a building when somebody doesn't know what they're doing because time is money, and especially in the life science industry. \nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then my second question, Joel, I think it was either last quarter, maybe the quarter before, you had made some comments about the election, and it sounded like a blue wave would be bad. Can you give some updated thoughts on if we get a so-called blue wave, what the near-term impact might be on the business? \nJoel Marcus: Well, I think, first of all, the ideal is always, in government, that there's a balanced government and balanced between the parties. I think it's hard to speculate on a blue wave and what it means because the democratic party is really a pretty highly, I would say -- a party that encompasses a pretty broad spectrum of thoughts from socialized medicine to free market with some guidance. So it's hard to know what that really means.\n I think there are 2 areas that so-called Biden-aligned groups said early on, if there were things they could do pretty quickly, what would they do. One might be to try to get Medicare to negotiate for those drugs administered by doctors. That's one that they might likely try to go after pretty quickly. And then another one is if they could show that intellectual property was created outside of the company, maybe a more revenue-sharing basis with, say, federal lab or a university or whatever. So those are 2 ones that I've heard that they might go to. But I think it's hard to predict and hard to speculate and -- anyway. So that's kind of my knee-jerk reaction at this point. \nAnthony Paolone: Do you think in that scenario, there's any pause in leasing as tenants try to just figure out what the environment might hold? \nJoel Marcus: No. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nJames Feldman: I guess just sticking with the supply topic, are there any markets where you are kind of second guessing or thinking twice about new starts given how much capital is flowing into them? \nJoel Marcus: Well, I think -- and maybe I'll have Steve comment. But I think one that we've certainly flagged over the past couple of years, which certainly has turned out to be way better than we thought, we tend to be pretty conservative in our thinking with South San Francisco when Kilroy announced the Oyster Point and a number of other groups have built their -- I think Healthpeak has done a good job of building and so has Blackstone. And it looked like there might be a tip, more -- the potential for more oversupply than demand, but it's turned out that the demand has been healthy, and the supply issue has been pretty in check. So we've been pretty careful there over the past couple of years, but we certainly have a very strong position. And I think as either Peter or Steve mentioned, we're making great progress on our 201 Haskins project. \n But Steve, you could comment. \nStephen A. Richardson: Yes. I would add, Jamie, that our South San Francisco portfolio for the lab product is essentially 100% leased. At Haskins now, we're at 88% leased and negotiating so very well positioned there. The entirety of the Phase 1 of Kilroy's project is 100% leased. Blackstone is substantially leased. Peak is substantially leased. So we did monitor it, as Joe mentioned a couple of years ago, but there has been very robust demand. You have a combination of big pharma coming into South San Francisco that's anchored it with probably 4 or 5 global pharma companies coming in that were not there before. You have the second cohort of companies that have matured to commercialization. So we continue to see that very healthy and do monitor supply certainly very closely, but not overly worried as we might have been a couple of years ago. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. Steve, maybe mention Stripe moving there to the Kilroy project because that's kind of an interesting trend that we haven't really seen before. A little bit like Mission Bay was in the early days when it was life science and suddenly, tech came in, in a big way. \nStephen A. Richardson: Right. Yes, I think that was really a unique situation as the market was extremely tight. When they were making that decision, they were looking for opportunities to have additional buildings for expansion, so they did make the move to South San Francisco. You had a particular tax regime in San Francisco. That might have been troublesome as well. So that -- we'll see if that's a harbinger for future tech locations, which will only increase demand in South San Francisco. But it is -- it was an important and kind of unique situation. \nJames Feldman: Okay. And are there any other markets you're thinking about as -- even monitoring as high risk for supply? \nJoel Marcus: Well, I think you always think about Research Triangle because there is a lot of land in and around the Triangle. But that's the reason we've gone to a mega campus strategy because people don't want to just be in isolated locations. And many tenants, including one we're under LOI with right now in a pretty big expansion, we're looking for existing solutions. So I think that's one. We're always -- we always have historically been watching, but we're pretty comfortable given our recent dollar commitment there. \nOperator: Next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. \nEmmanuel Korchman: Thanks for the comments earlier on the amount of capital looking at the space. Just in that light, you guys have also increased the number of acquisitions you're doing, and there's a couple of big deals out there. I know you don't really talk about future deals. But how interested would you be in big deals, especially in a market like Cambridge? \nJoel Marcus: Yes. So let me maybe react to that. First of all, it's always hard at the beginning of any year to know, especially this year of 2020. I mean, my gosh, in March and April, we had cut and we're planning to cut further CapEx because no one knew if this was going to be a repeat of '08, '09 in a sense. But by May, it was pretty clear that, that wasn't the case. It was a different kind of market shock.\n So nobody knows at the beginning of any year or during the year, what assets might come to market for what reasons. So I think it's always hard to speculate on acquisitions. And we're always looking for ones that have an ability to satisfy internal tenant demand that we have. Now we have hundreds and hundreds of tenants that we know where -- what they want to do going forward. So that gives us a huge competitive advantage. And I think trying to match that up with solutions that either exist or we can create.\n I think when it comes to big portfolios, I mentioned Blackstone before. I think their recapitalization and move from one fund to another. And I guess if there was an offer out there. We know that the base portfolio well back in 2015, I described it, there would be -- we didn't have interest then and we wouldn't have interest now. It doesn't do anything for us particularly. And adding a gigantic scale doesn't really make sense. But I think they've done a great job of calling that portfolio and then really adding quality buildings, which weren't there so much many years ago.\n And I think on the other big portfolio in Cambridge, we don't have any comment on that. But I would say that's kind of an A-minus, B-plus location. We have 3 mega campuses in the heart of Kendall Square, which are AAA locations. So I think that gives you some insight on how we think about that. \nEmmanuel Korchman: Great. And Joel, maybe you'll take this one as well. How are you guys thinking about maybe the amount of manufacturing space that's in your portfolio now? And how much that might ramp over time. One of the pictures you highlighted in the supplemental this time around was a manufacturing facility, which I don't think you've done in the past. Just kind of curious how much of your space might not be labs or office but more manufacturing. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. Well, we have done manufacturing before. We don't do remote manufacturing, if somebody wants to build a plant in Puerto Rico or Iowa or Kansas or West Virginia or some place. We don't go to locations where we think that there is no long-term inherent value in the real estate. It's just an investment. It's amortized over the term of the lease. And then when it's gone, you've kind of written down your asset. So that's never of interest.\n But I think given today, remember what I said in my comments, there are really 2 fundamental things going -- things that have been evidenced by COVID-19. One is -- and whether it's the Trump administration or Biden's push, he's kind of parroted what Trump has said. Whether he can do it or not, don't know. Or whether he'll have the chance or not, don't know. But it's pretty critical that we do repatriate as much research development in manufacturing in the medical -- in the critical medical arena and health care arena back to the U.S. for obvious reasons. And where those become either adjacencies or in close proximity to headquarters and core R&D, then we clearly have interest. If they're in really random remote locations, there would be no interest.\n And you have to also remember there is a new generation of companies today, particularly in cell and gene therapy. And those manufacturing capabilities, whether they be at the clinical level or at full-scale commercial level are, to a large extent, worth more than the company's research. And so those become mission-critical. You can think of any number -- I mean Bluebird is a good example, any number of companies that have highly specialized manufacturing for these complex medicines of the future. So we think it becomes an integral part of [ R&D, C and now M ]. And I think it's a huge opportunity. I think it's a huge opportunity for everybody in the United States because I hope it comes true.\n I think the one negative thing that sits on the horizon is if Biden happened to win, and he happened to be able to increase corporate taxes, he's going to do the very thing that we've sought not to do, which is force companies overseas, move companies' cash overseas. Why would you want to operate in a high-cost U.S. environment where you could operate overseas at a reduced price? And so that would undermine the purpose of bringing back manufacturing. So we hope that doesn't happen. \nMichael Bilerman: Joel, it's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. I just had one other one for you. As you talk about overseas and you talk about the highly competitive nature for buildings here in the U.S., either acquisitions, development deals, conversion plays, have you changed your thinking at all about putting incremental dollars outside of the U.S. at all? And I recognize you've had fits and starts on global. And the message pre-COVID was focus on the core markets here in the U.S. I'm just wondering if the returns have been driven down to such low levels here and there's so much competition, whether that you have an advantage of going global given your operational and investment expertise. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. So that's a really good question. And you know a little bit of the history of back in the '05, '06, '07 era, pre-crash, we entered both China and India. After getting into India, it became pretty clear, the Indian Supreme Court invalidated the Glivec patent. It was pretty clear that novel research wasn't going to India. And it's a tough place to operate from a Foreign Practices Act. So we terminated -- we sold our operation there.\n China, we have -- we only did 2 projects. We sold one. We have one remaining. The problem in China is -- and we refused to tie up with the local partner, even though that was kind of recommended. But what happens is the government builds crappy buildings around your nice building. It'd be putting like something like a mini storage unit next to a first-class lab and then telling the Chinese to go in there and operate a lab, which they do at free rent because the government told them to do it. And so that's a hard business model to follow.\n But I think November 3 or thereafter, we'll be revealing of the answer to that question. I don't think I could answer it at the moment. But if it turned out there was a blue wave, and it turned out that they dramatically increased corporate taxes, then I think the answer is you'd have to look at the possibility of thinking overseas because the government would have just done the exact opposite of what makes compelling sense to keep companies in this country at competitive tax rates and keep their critical operations here. So I think November 3 or thereafter, we'll be revealing of that question. \nMichael Bilerman: Yes. I was thinking more so Europe, U.K., Canada rather than going back to China or India, but we can certainly have the discussion at Investor Day. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. And if we go into New Zealand, I'm sure I'll be down there to help start that office. \nOperator: The next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. \nSheila McGrath: On the acquisition in RTP, that was a market you previously had a smaller presence in. I was wondering if you could talk about the market dynamics there that may have changed you to be more bullish, details on demand drivers and any insights on the embedded growth opportunity at that asset. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. So what -- we've been in the Triangle since 1998. We were early in there. And we've always been attracted because in the early days, North Carolina was very aggressive in providing incentives to companies wanting to move down there for -- in the biotech space, in particular. And we really like that market anchored by Duke, UNC and NC State. Duke and UNC in the health care arena, and NC State more in the ag arena. And I think we saw that the market, though, had pretty slow growth and, in fact, lost rental rate increase momentum for quite a long time during the -- from like '08 through, say, 2016 or something. So almost a decade, it really struggled. \n And when the urban cores were kind of being the most popular, people didn't want to go down to kind of sleepy Research Triangle and hang out in a wooded beautiful area by a lake. That has a little bit reversed its course, as you could imagine, given what's going on in New York and some of these other cities that have seen a lot of both rise in crime and obviously, the impact of COVID and homelessness and things like that.\n So we have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have a large number or certainly an important number, large square footage, of existing tenants who've expressed interest in creating either expansion or new space down in Research Triangle, and so that really motivated us in a substantial way. Also, our market share there now has moved to about 40%, which gives us the scale of 3 mega campuses where we have a lot of existing solutions and a lot of to-be-built solutions. So that's kind of where we wanted to get to. \nSheila McGrath: Okay. Great. And then could you give us your updated thoughts on the downtown San Francisco market, the plans for 88 Bluxome and insights on Stripe subleasing its space? \nJoel Marcus: Yes. Steve? \nStephen A. Richardson: Yes. Sheila, it's Steve here. Yes, Stripe's plans for subleasing, I think, were always the case with the relocation of South San Francisco. They haven't done anything official yet. I think they're just putting some feelers out. So that's very much a TBD. \n And then with 88 Bluxome, we have important preconstruction activities that we'll be undertaking in the next several quarters here. When you look at that building, it is a lab-ready shell. So as Peter was highlighting that contrast between office product and lab product, we'll have the floor to floor, the live load, the capability, shipping and receiving. So when you start looking at a mid-rise facility, a lot of outdoor space, the capability to go lab, we think it's going to be an extremely desirable product. So we'll see this time next year where we're at. \nOperator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC Nikko. \nRichard Anderson: Peter, you referred to Prop 15 and the triple-net nature of your leases pass-through tenant recovery increases and all that sort of stuff. But someone's going to be left holding the bag if this thing passes, and I'm wondering how you guys might feel about the vulnerability of California. In general, it's kind of a complicated state to begin with. If you think that Prop 15 passing ultimately does kind of slow down rent growth or create some sort of motivation for companies to exit at an increasing pace someplace else. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. So let me make a comment before I ask Peter to answer that question, Rich. I think everybody is looking carefully at California. Healthpeak just announced the relocation of their headquarters, I guess, from Long Beach area or wherever it is to, I think, Denver, if I'm not -- my memory serves me. \n The founding shareholder of our company, who put in the principal amount of money when we started Jacobs Engineering, left Pasadena for Plano, Texas, a couple of years ago. Obviously, tax motivated. So there is a historic number of companies and people looking at California today and wondering, is this the state going to save itself? And are the cities going to save themselves? Obviously, homelessness has been a big problem in a number of cities. Obviously, you've got fires. You've got earthquakes. You've got the natural disasters, different than other parts of the country, but everybody has got something. But more important is really governance, sensible governance. \n We're working pretty intensively. In fact, we had a long call internally yesterday on trying to assist the city of San Francisco on homeless solutions, thinking about could we bring the OneFifteen, Dayton solution for opioid addiction to homelessness in San Francisco as a model to try to help solve that problem. The numbers show something like over 70% or 80% of homeless people generally have some kind of addiction or mental health issue. So just putting them somewhere doesn't work, you've really got to bring intensive services there. So I think all companies are really looking at California in fairly realistic and important ways. \n But with that kind of long-winded intro, Peter, fire away. \nPeter M. Moglia: Yes, sure. Rich, I mean, it's obviously a great question. Look, would it be much better if this doesn't pass? It would be because it would just maybe give people confidence that California isn't necessarily going to continue to search for revenue sources from business. That said, as I mentioned, we pass through the cost. And you inferred, well, eventually, your occupancy cost is going to go up. It will. But our analysis is that it would be in the low or low single digits overall for a company.\n And I would take you back to a lot of questions we get about just when rents are rising in a market very quickly, people are always like, well, at what point is it going to just get so expensive, people will go elsewhere? And the answer is, well, it really won't because these companies need to be anchored where they are because they're typically located where they are because of institutions that they collaborate with.\n So the increase in operating expenses is not something anyone wants to see. Is it going to cause them to move? We would think probably not. And then the overwhelming amount of annual revenue that comes through Alexandria is from very large pharma and biotech, where the OpEx, that rent and operating expenses in the context of their overall cost structure is like 1% to 3%. So it's not going to move that needle. It's going to be an annoyance. But again, wanting to be near the institutions, which is why work in these markets, is going to really win the location selection at the end of the day and an annoyance about property tax increase will ultimately be absorbed. \nRichard Anderson: Okay. In the interest of time, I just have a real quick yes or no one. On the Pinterest building, will that now be redesigned for lab use? Or how will that be modified since you haven't gone vertical yet? \nStephen A. Richardson: Rich, it's Steve. Again, from the very outset, we designed that as a lab-ready shell. So we do not need to make any modifications. And we have the ability to both accommodate lab and technology users. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. \nMichael Carroll: Yes. Just to touch on the Research Triangle acquisition again. And I think you -- Joel, you mentioned a little bit this earlier in the call. But with the Durham site, how different is that from the AgTech site and the Advanced Technology campus? I mean I know the AgTech buildings have a different build-out. But are each individual campus that you have down in North Carolina better suited for different tenants? Or could they -- could each -- could they take all types of tenants at either of these campuses? \nJoel Marcus: Well, the AgTech campus will -- and they're all in pretty close proximity. The AgTech campus is really dedicated to AgTech. And the Advanced Technology campus will be primarily life science, and it also sits next to a building we have that is chock full of small growing tenants. So there's a natural growth trajectory there. And then the Durham campus, we just bought in are in the process of doing quite a bit of retrofitting and redeveloping, will be primarily life science as well. \nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then the demand that you've seen in the Research Triangle market, I mean, is it from the life science demand or the AgTech demand? And I know you have a lot of space under construction right now, but is that enough demand supports another ground-up development? Or you just want to complete what you guys have going on today? \nJoel Marcus: Well, it's primarily life science, although there is AgTech activity. It's not quite as broad or as deep, obviously, because the industry is just a very different structured industry. But we do have 2 developments on our Advanced Technology campus going up, and we've got pretty robust demand from existing tenants there. And one build-to-suit that we're doing.\n And then on the Durham campus, we're accommodating a number of existing tenants or relationships that have expressed they want immediate existing solutions, which we really didn't have, and that was a big motivator for us. So we hope to do both, and we think there is good pent-up demand. Hopefully, the tax -- if there are tax changes, they won't screw it all up. Because, obviously, some companies who might expand here in the U.S.A. today, maybe next year if things go in a different fashion, they might go overseas, and we would be sad to see that happen. \nOperator: The next question comes from Dave Rodgers of Baird. \nDave Rodgers: Yes. Maybe first question for Peter and Steve, just with regard to San Francisco. You talked specifically about 88. But maybe go back to your comments, Peter, on 975 (sic) [ 945 ] Market. Just with respect to -- you said it made a lot of sense for a lot of reasons to sell that. But there's a pretty quick turnaround for you. And obviously, price maybe wasn't the motivation. So if you could talk about why exit that and then why that doesn't have an implication on how you think about Bluxome, that would be helpful. \nPeter M. Moglia: Steve, do you want to take that? \nStephen A. Richardson: Sure. Dave, it's Steve. Yes, when we looked at that asset, to receive an unsolicited offer and then also to look at its location along Market Street, was somewhat of a one-off kind of at the edge of the cluster at best of SoMa, it really did make sense to go ahead and exit. And I just think the scale and the size of 88 Bluxome is much, much different and qualitatively in a different position. You're really at the edge of Mission Bay there. So I do think we have the opportunity at scale to help life science or technology. Whereas the Market Street location was just a -- ultimately, a smaller project there. We weren't really going to build a cluster adjacent to that. And again, as Peter said, receiving an unsolicited offer and recycling that capital with these other opportunities just made great sense. \nPeter M. Moglia: And I would just add -- I was just going to add that 88 Bluxome is a much closer extension of Mission Bay than Market Street. So it makes a lot more sense to be our next development to build on that cluster than Market Street would. \nDave Rodgers: And is that -- I mean, the sale is just indicative in -- of your mind of maybe -- I don't want to say shrinking San Francisco market, but obviously, the lab market is going to be one component of it. But office maybe in a deterioration mode here. Is that indicative of that thinking? And is that how we should think about it? \nStephen A. Richardson: I think you just have to look at that in isolation, Dave, and the circumstances that led us to make that decision. \nDave Rodgers: Okay. And then maybe, Dean, just on the ARE ventures investments that you guys have, $1.3 billion, including the unrealized gains. Do you just anticipate continuing to want to sell more of that? I mean do you want to manage that to a certain size of the portfolio and with the gains embedded in there? Do you want to try to get that portfolio size down in any particular way? I guess maybe not necessarily guidance on quarter-by-quarter or 2021, but how you want to kind of manage the gains in there to realize those as quickly as you can. \nDean Shigenaga: Dave, Dean here. I'd say that the overall strategy for the venture portfolio has been to carefully manage that aspect of our business. If you look back over several years now, I think the aggregate dollars invested from a cost perspective has actually declined as a percentage of total assets or assets have grown on the real estate side over time. And like I shared in my commentary, we've -- from a cash flow perspective, the venture portfolio has been about neutral this year. So still always careful about selective new investment opportunities.\n But given what Joel had mentioned, if you look back over -- since 2013, there's been a real acceleration of innovation. So we're seeing a lot of exciting opportunities, but still being very selective, Dave.\n I think we've commented that the size of the venture portfolio will always moderate in size somewhere in that 3% to 5% from a cost basis perspective, and it's closer to 3.5% today, down from where it was a couple of years ago. \nOperator: Next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. \nWilliam Catherwood: Just a quick clarification on the RTP acquisition. I believe that the Parmer park also had a few office assets in it that didn't look like they were part of your acquisition of the 16 buildings. Is that correct? \nJoel Marcus: Peter, you want to talk to that? \nPeter M. Moglia: Yes. No. There are -- I think it's -- I don't have the exact number, but there are a few assets that are currently used as office and leased as office that we consider as future upside. There's either 1- or 2-story buildings that could be converted to labs. So there are -- all of the assets that were on the campus were sold to us, and we own all of them. \nWilliam Catherwood: Got it. Got it. Got it. Okay. \n The -- then switching over to Cambridge, Joel, you had mentioned how hard of this to bring supply on in that market. And this quarter, you moved 325 Binney from the intermediate development bucket into near term, and you were able to add another 48,000 square feet of density. How soon do you think you can get to that site and begin that project if you have a tenant? And are there differences between the types of tenants or tenant requirements that are looking at your Cambridge site versus 15 Necco in the Seaport or 57 Coolidge in Watertown? \nJoel Marcus: Yes. So maybe I'll give an intro to that and maybe let Peter talk about it. But we had substantially upzoned, I think, about 2x from what was the as-of-right square footage. I think the square footage we've got is north of 400,000. We just got design approval just the other night. So we're moving full steam ahead. \n We have a handful of existing tenants who are looking for expansion space. So we're -- likely, this building will be a little bit like what we did in Seattle at 188 or 1818 -- Eastlake, 188 Blaine -- I forgot the exact address there, where we created almost 200,000 square foot building, multitenant life science building and accommodated most of our -- many of our existing tenants who needed more space. I think that's what's going to happen to 325 Binney.\n I think companies that are in Cambridge would prefer to be in Cambridge. The Seaport, I think, offers some nice opportunities, but I think Cambridge would be first choice. \n But Peter, you could comment. \nPeter M. Moglia: Yes, absolutely. I mean Cambridge is still the place everybody wants to be. The opportunities there are very limited. We fortunately have one. But we've been very proactive to figure out where people could go that need to be in close proximity. \n Watertown was one of our strategies. It's working out very well. The demand there has been even stronger than we would have imagined. And it makes a lot of sense that the Seaport would also be as attractive, in a way, maybe a bit more to those that are more Cambridge-centric because it is linked by the Red Line, you can get from South Station to Kendall Square in about 12 to 15 minutes. And obviously, the amenities and the Fort Point Channel area mimic what you can find in Cambridge as well. So we think it's a good, natural extension for those that may not have the ability to be in Cambridge but needed to be close by. \nOperator: Next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Mizuho. \nOmotayo Okusanya: I just wanted to go back to the Durham acquisition. And I'm trying to understand a little bit better the tenant base in that building. You made some illusions of the proximity to Duke and UNC is the major reason for holding the asset. And I'm just curious, is this kind of more kind of traditional life sciences? Or does it have an aspect of kind of the university-based, R&D-based life sciences that you often hear Ventas and Brandywine talk about in Philadelphia? And if it is, I'm just kind of curious why you're not going to find that type of life sciences attractive or not. \nJoel Marcus: Okay. I'm not sure I could hear you when you described about Philadelphia. Could you repeat that? \nOmotayo Okusanya: Sure. I think -- again, Ventas and Brandywine, I mean, often talk about Philadelphia as university-based life sciences. And again, I think with some other comments around Durham about being close Duke and UNC, I'm just kind of curious, do you also consider this university-based life sciences? And if it is... \nJoel Marcus: No. No. Yes. I don't -- yes, we don't think like that. This is not -- yes, that's just a different, I don't know, way of thinking. This is a -- this is originally the Glaxo campus that was bought and redeveloped. I think the timing and the job that was done by the seller was really good. We came in, there are a strong number of existing credit tenants, among which is Duke. Duke has an important lab presence there that's attractive to us, but that wasn't the major reason for it. The major reason was it had good, existing solutions and a number of future solutions that would accommodate existing tenants' expansion and growth of ours that we had. And it gave us a 3 campus -- 3 mega campus opportunity down in the Triangle.\n This is in the park. The park is not adjacent to Duke. It's not adjacent to UNC. It's some miles away or NC State. So I wouldn't compare it at all to -- it's nothing like Philadelphia. Just totally different ballgame. \nPeter M. Moglia: Yes. And Joel, it's Peter. I can add -- I mean there's a total of 6 tenants there, 5 of the 6 are credit tenants. The sixth one's actually probably also a credit tenant now. And only Duke is university related. So I'll echo what Joel said, this is nothing like a university play that Ventas would have done. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. And the challenge, if you do universities, is if you're entirely dependent on the university, and universities can be up and down and so forth, and you have no commercial tenant base, you're really at the mercy of the university, which we've never wanted to be. That's why we've never really gone after that business model. \nOmotayo Okusanya: Previous comment, if not international, would you actually consider any new markets within the U.S.? \nJoel Marcus: Yes. We said we might. I think our hands are full in our existing markets because they're so vibrant and keeping us busy. We have a big budget this year to fulfill. And so at the moment, we're not focused on -- or ready to announce any expansion markets because we're pretty occupied in where we are. But who knows what the future may have given -- post-election, what may happen there. \nOperator: And the last question today will come from Daniel Ismail of Green Street. \nDaniel Ismail: Great. Just a few quick ones for me. Another good quarter of cash re-leasing spreads. So I'm curious on a portfolio-wide basis, where in-place rents sit relative to markets. \nJoel Marcus: So Dean, maybe a comment? \nDean Shigenaga: Yes. So I just want to be sure it was off mute. The overall portfolio, I think, over the last number of quarters have been in the upper teens on average, both GAAP and cash. So I think the continued overall constraints and supply and good fundamentals in our core markets, I think, has held up good upside on the overall portfolio. \nDaniel Ismail: Okay. And you -- I appreciate the clarity on the concessions and leasing costs. But can you frame how net effective rents have grown, say, year-over-year across your portfolio? Are we talking 5% up? 10% up? \nDean Shigenaga: It turns out, I don't have that specific analysis for this quarter. But if I think back to the last several quarters, net effective rents have trended nicely. I think the only change in -- that I can see that might make that picture a little bit harder to see as we go forward is you've got to -- through the acquisitions, we've got a broader mix of assets in the portfolio, including this Research Triangle project as well as The Arsenal on the Charles as a couple of examples. But net effective rent generally has been trending very well for the last number of years as well as the last several quarters. I can't tell you specifically for this quarter right now, though. \nDaniel Ismail: Okay. And just last one for me. The H-1B visa program and potential changes have been more highlighted towards the potential impact to the tech industry. But can you comment on the potential impact it might have to life science industry in terms of employment and hiring? \nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think -- I'm not an expert in that. But I think it's pretty clear that there are quite a number of scientists from other countries who have unique skill bases that are here under that visa category or designation, and it would be positive to keep that going, for sure. I know there is some sensitivity on -- and there have been a bunch written about people coming over from China working in universities with professors. And maybe there being some national security issue there that I know the government has looked pretty carefully at. But set that aside, I think it's been a very positive -- a positive program and certainly very helpful to the life science industry. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. \nJoel Marcus: Okay. Thank you very much. Sorry for a long call during this third quarter of COVID. Look forward to talking to you on fourth quarter and year-end. Thank you. And everybody, please stay safe. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to Alexandria's third quarter call. With me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Jenna Foger. I'd like to welcome everybody and -- from the Alexandria team and family wishing -- hoping you're all well, safe and COVID-free. \n As all of us know, 2020 has been an astounding year of the never-imagined confluence of a international pandemic from Wuhan, China; a deep shutdown recession; civil strife; coupled with a heated and complex election upcoming here next week. 2020 started off very sadly with the untimely death of Kobe Bryant, not only a great athlete but a special human being. And I want to make just a brief quote from one of his great things. He often said that, \"Great things come from hard work and perseverance.\" And those of you who knew or watched or admired Kobe, always, he was the last guy to finish up and the first guy to start, and was one of the hardest working people anyone could ever imagine. \n And that really exemplifies our team, and want to thank our team from the bottom of our -- my heart and our team's heart, for doing such a great job. Alexandria has really uniquely achieved 3 outputs that are very rare in corporate America today that define a truly great company: continuing superior results, continuing distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And again, we want to thank our entire team for a stellar third quarter as we are all building the future of life-changing innovation, literally during COVID-19. One could never imagine that. \n So a couple of different comments. I wanted to comment on the recent Blackstone transaction where Blackstone announced the recapitalization of its life science real estate business. And it only serves, I think, to reconfirm once again the great vote of confidence in the life science real estate niche we pioneered in 1994. \n The transaction implies an approximate $1,070 price per square foot for that 13 million square foot portfolio. And I think compared to where Alexandria trades more or less today at about $950 a square foot, I think that's, I think, very good benchmark for us. Blackstone timed its, I think, 2015 purchase really quite ideally as the biotech industry was emerging from about a 5- or 6-year bear market in the 2013 and 2014 time frame. And at that time, when they acquired the assets, they were, by and large -- most of the buildings were older than Alexandria's, and they were not in as strong locations as we were. They've clearly enhanced that portfolio since, and kudos to them for doing that. \n I want to take a particular mention on third quarter activity on our Research Triangle acquisition, which is really a particular note. A large acquisition, about $590 million purchase price, about $265 a square foot, 2.2 million square feet over about 300 acres, 20 buildings with very high credit tenant but also significant value add. This acquisition substantially increased our footprint in Research Triangle, and particularly was motivated by our need to accommodate numerous inbound substantial tenant requirements, both who needed existing solutions and build-to-suit capabilities. We now have 3 mega campuses in the Triangle, this newly branded campus, the Alexandria Center for Life Science \u2013 Durham; the Alexandria Center for AgTech; and the Alexandria Center for Advanced Technologies. \n We see continuing strong demand for life science base across our markets, but particularly pointed are the many requirements from our own tenant base within. Also, it's important to remember, 2 key truths have really been revealed by COVID-19. One is the resilience of -- and the need for domestic medical supply chains to be here based in the United States, crucial for national security and for medical supply. And I think it only reinforces that complex medicines are really the future of health care. And I guess the famous COVID-19 antibody cocktails would be a good example of that. \n I wanted to mention a little bit about Operation Warp Speed. This was initiated by the Trump administration and supported by more than $10 billion in funding through the CARES Act. Operation Warp Speed led by really a legendary, probably one of the most skilled vaccine developers in the entire world, Moncef Slaoui, aims to deliver 300 million doses of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine in first quarter as part of a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Really all in tandem, very different than the government has ever operated before and really a great credit to public-private partnerships. \n The Warp Speed partnership is between selected biopharma companies and key federal science agencies, including BARDA, CDC, DoD, FDA, HHS and the NIH. As of October 21, the initiative announced funding decisions totaling over $13 billion for 10 companies -- more than 10 companies to support vaccine therapy and manufacturing efforts. These included virtually all of which, maybe except one, our tenants of Alexandria, Moderna, GSK, Sanofi, Pfizer, Novavax, AstraZeneca, J&J, Merck, Regeneron, Emergent Bio and Fujifilm. So quite a humongous feat, I think, given the onset of this pandemic in a pretty odd fashion. I think to this date, there is certainly speculation that this was not a natural occurring virus, but one that was man-made in a lab in Wuhan. \n A couple of comments about the life science industry. And again, a real shout-out to the great private-public partnerships that have been formed in so many different fashions. The life science fundamentals throughout 2020 have remained fundamentally strong, especially given the critical nature of the fight against COVID-19. This has helped lead to substantial progress and acceleration including late-stage vaccine trials and therapeutics, along with improved and expanded testing. The life science industry has not slowed down its pace. It's important to remember of investment in innovation well beyond COVID-19. \n The industry's commitment and investment in innovation, along with the FDA's ability to continue to operate at a high level despite the pandemic, has led to 40 new drug approvals as of the end of September, which puts us on a pace to meet or exceed the 51 average of the past couple of years. I was on a call last week with Commissioner Hahn. And it's a great credit to he and the entire professional workforce at the FDA for their really 24/7 effort in this time. \n Life science venture funding has continued to flow at a strong pace in the third quarter, setting new quarterly records at almost $12 billion, with more than $30 billion raised through the first 3 quarters, really surpassing all previous annual totals. It's important to remember that most of the -- this investment, 80% comes from Alexandria's core markets. And especially greater Boston, San Francisco, which capture about 60%. \n Capital flows to early-stage companies and the public markets continue at a fast pace. There have been 47 pharma and biotech IPOs in the first 3 quarters of this year, raising almost $9 billion larger than any previous year. And the companies have been able to access capital markets at historic levels approximating almost $35 billion in follow-on offerings, surpassing the previous high of about $29 billion in 2015. So all in all, it's been a pretty strong tailwind for the industry and what we're doing. \n So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jenna Foger, our Senior VP of our Science and Tech team, and she's going to talk about the latest developments in the vaccine therapeutic area. So Jenna, please? Thank you. \n We'll go to question and answer. Operator, please? Well, yes, let me jump in before Peter comments, Tony. I think you have to look at where these are happening and where the demand wants to be, and those don't always match up. I mean -- I think if you look at Cambridge, the ability to add supply there is pretty, pretty tough. And the demand is strong. Same thing, I think, in different parts of San Francisco. So I think you have to isolate where these either are or might be converted. And you heard a little bit about the downside of conversions, they oftentimes don't work out all that well and where the demand is coming from and where they want to go. \n But Peter, you can comment. Well, I think, first of all, the ideal is always, in government, that there's a balanced government and balanced between the parties. I think it's hard to speculate on a blue wave and what it means because the democratic party is really a pretty highly, I would say -- a party that encompasses a pretty broad spectrum of thoughts from socialized medicine to free market with some guidance. So it's hard to know what that really means.\n I think there are 2 areas that so-called Biden-aligned groups said early on, if there were things they could do pretty quickly, what would they do. One might be to try to get Medicare to negotiate for those drugs administered by doctors. That's one that they might likely try to go after pretty quickly. And then another one is if they could show that intellectual property was created outside of the company, maybe a more revenue-sharing basis with, say, federal lab or a university or whatever. So those are 2 ones that I've heard that they might go to. But I think it's hard to predict and hard to speculate and -- anyway. So that's kind of my knee-jerk reaction at this point. No. Well, I think -- and maybe I'll have Steve comment. But I think one that we've certainly flagged over the past couple of years, which certainly has turned out to be way better than we thought, we tend to be pretty conservative in our thinking with South San Francisco when Kilroy announced the Oyster Point and a number of other groups have built their -- I think Healthpeak has done a good job of building and so has Blackstone. And it looked like there might be a tip, more -- the potential for more oversupply than demand, but it's turned out that the demand has been healthy, and the supply issue has been pretty in check. So we've been pretty careful there over the past couple of years, but we certainly have a very strong position. And I think as either Peter or Steve mentioned, we're making great progress on our 201 Haskins project. \n But Steve, you could comment. Yes. Steve, maybe mention Stripe moving there to the Kilroy project because that's kind of an interesting trend that we haven't really seen before. A little bit like Mission Bay was in the early days when it was life science and suddenly, tech came in, in a big way. Well, I think you always think about Research Triangle because there is a lot of land in and around the Triangle. But that's the reason we've gone to a mega campus strategy because people don't want to just be in isolated locations. And many tenants, including one we're under LOI with right now in a pretty big expansion, we're looking for existing solutions. So I think that's one. We're always -- we always have historically been watching, but we're pretty comfortable given our recent dollar commitment there. Yes. So let me maybe react to that. First of all, it's always hard at the beginning of any year to know, especially this year of 2020. I mean, my gosh, in March and April, we had cut and we're planning to cut further CapEx because no one knew if this was going to be a repeat of '08, '09 in a sense. But by May, it was pretty clear that, that wasn't the case. It was a different kind of market shock.\n So nobody knows at the beginning of any year or during the year, what assets might come to market for what reasons. So I think it's always hard to speculate on acquisitions. And we're always looking for ones that have an ability to satisfy internal tenant demand that we have. Now we have hundreds and hundreds of tenants that we know where -- what they want to do going forward. So that gives us a huge competitive advantage. And I think trying to match that up with solutions that either exist or we can create.\n I think when it comes to big portfolios, I mentioned Blackstone before. I think their recapitalization and move from one fund to another. And I guess if there was an offer out there. We know that the base portfolio well back in 2015, I described it, there would be -- we didn't have interest then and we wouldn't have interest now. It doesn't do anything for us particularly. And adding a gigantic scale doesn't really make sense. But I think they've done a great job of calling that portfolio and then really adding quality buildings, which weren't there so much many years ago.\n And I think on the other big portfolio in Cambridge, we don't have any comment on that. But I would say that's kind of an A-minus, B-plus location. We have 3 mega campuses in the heart of Kendall Square, which are AAA locations. So I think that gives you some insight on how we think about that. Yes. Well, we have done manufacturing before. We don't do remote manufacturing, if somebody wants to build a plant in Puerto Rico or Iowa or Kansas or West Virginia or some place. We don't go to locations where we think that there is no long-term inherent value in the real estate. It's just an investment. It's amortized over the term of the lease. And then when it's gone, you've kind of written down your asset. So that's never of interest.\n But I think given today, remember what I said in my comments, there are really 2 fundamental things going -- things that have been evidenced by COVID-19. One is -- and whether it's the Trump administration or Biden's push, he's kind of parroted what Trump has said. Whether he can do it or not, don't know. Or whether he'll have the chance or not, don't know. But it's pretty critical that we do repatriate as much research development in manufacturing in the medical -- in the critical medical arena and health care arena back to the U.S. for obvious reasons. And where those become either adjacencies or in close proximity to headquarters and core R&D, then we clearly have interest. If they're in really random remote locations, there would be no interest.\n And you have to also remember there is a new generation of companies today, particularly in cell and gene therapy. And those manufacturing capabilities, whether they be at the clinical level or at full-scale commercial level are, to a large extent, worth more than the company's research. And so those become mission-critical. You can think of any number -- I mean Bluebird is a good example, any number of companies that have highly specialized manufacturing for these complex medicines of the future. So we think it becomes an integral part of [ R&D, C and now M ]. And I think it's a huge opportunity. I think it's a huge opportunity for everybody in the United States because I hope it comes true.\n I think the one negative thing that sits on the horizon is if Biden happened to win, and he happened to be able to increase corporate taxes, he's going to do the very thing that we've sought not to do, which is force companies overseas, move companies' cash overseas. Why would you want to operate in a high-cost U.S. environment where you could operate overseas at a reduced price? And so that would undermine the purpose of bringing back manufacturing. So we hope that doesn't happen. Yes. So that's a really good question. And you know a little bit of the history of back in the '05, '06, '07 era, pre-crash, we entered both China and India. After getting into India, it became pretty clear, the Indian Supreme Court invalidated the Glivec patent. It was pretty clear that novel research wasn't going to India. And it's a tough place to operate from a Foreign Practices Act. So we terminated -- we sold our operation there.\n China, we have -- we only did 2 projects. We sold one. We have one remaining. The problem in China is -- and we refused to tie up with the local partner, even though that was kind of recommended. But what happens is the government builds crappy buildings around your nice building. It'd be putting like something like a mini storage unit next to a first-class lab and then telling the Chinese to go in there and operate a lab, which they do at free rent because the government told them to do it. And so that's a hard business model to follow.\n But I think November 3 or thereafter, we'll be revealing of the answer to that question. I don't think I could answer it at the moment. But if it turned out there was a blue wave, and it turned out that they dramatically increased corporate taxes, then I think the answer is you'd have to look at the possibility of thinking overseas because the government would have just done the exact opposite of what makes compelling sense to keep companies in this country at competitive tax rates and keep their critical operations here. So I think November 3 or thereafter, we'll be revealing of that question. Yes. And if we go into New Zealand, I'm sure I'll be down there to help start that office. Yes. So what -- we've been in the Triangle since 1998. We were early in there. And we've always been attracted because in the early days, North Carolina was very aggressive in providing incentives to companies wanting to move down there for -- in the biotech space, in particular. And we really like that market anchored by Duke, UNC and NC State. Duke and UNC in the health care arena, and NC State more in the ag arena. And I think we saw that the market, though, had pretty slow growth and, in fact, lost rental rate increase momentum for quite a long time during the -- from like '08 through, say, 2016 or something. So almost a decade, it really struggled. \n And when the urban cores were kind of being the most popular, people didn't want to go down to kind of sleepy Research Triangle and hang out in a wooded beautiful area by a lake. That has a little bit reversed its course, as you could imagine, given what's going on in New York and some of these other cities that have seen a lot of both rise in crime and obviously, the impact of COVID and homelessness and things like that.\n So we have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have a large number or certainly an important number, large square footage, of existing tenants who've expressed interest in creating either expansion or new space down in Research Triangle, and so that really motivated us in a substantial way. Also, our market share there now has moved to about 40%, which gives us the scale of 3 mega campuses where we have a lot of existing solutions and a lot of to-be-built solutions. So that's kind of where we wanted to get to. Yes. Steve? Yes. So let me make a comment before I ask Peter to answer that question, Rich. I think everybody is looking carefully at California. Healthpeak just announced the relocation of their headquarters, I guess, from Long Beach area or wherever it is to, I think, Denver, if I'm not -- my memory serves me. \n The founding shareholder of our company, who put in the principal amount of money when we started Jacobs Engineering, left Pasadena for Plano, Texas, a couple of years ago. Obviously, tax motivated. So there is a historic number of companies and people looking at California today and wondering, is this the state going to save itself? And are the cities going to save themselves? Obviously, homelessness has been a big problem in a number of cities. Obviously, you've got fires. You've got earthquakes. You've got the natural disasters, different than other parts of the country, but everybody has got something. But more important is really governance, sensible governance. \n We're working pretty intensively. In fact, we had a long call internally yesterday on trying to assist the city of San Francisco on homeless solutions, thinking about could we bring the OneFifteen, Dayton solution for opioid addiction to homelessness in San Francisco as a model to try to help solve that problem. The numbers show something like over 70% or 80% of homeless people generally have some kind of addiction or mental health issue. So just putting them somewhere doesn't work, you've really got to bring intensive services there. So I think all companies are really looking at California in fairly realistic and important ways. \n But with that kind of long-winded intro, Peter, fire away. Well, the AgTech campus will -- and they're all in pretty close proximity. The AgTech campus is really dedicated to AgTech. And the Advanced Technology campus will be primarily life science, and it also sits next to a building we have that is chock full of small growing tenants. So there's a natural growth trajectory there. And then the Durham campus, we just bought in are in the process of doing quite a bit of retrofitting and redeveloping, will be primarily life science as well. Well, it's primarily life science, although there is AgTech activity. It's not quite as broad or as deep, obviously, because the industry is just a very different structured industry. But we do have 2 developments on our Advanced Technology campus going up, and we've got pretty robust demand from existing tenants there. And one build-to-suit that we're doing.\n And then on the Durham campus, we're accommodating a number of existing tenants or relationships that have expressed they want immediate existing solutions, which we really didn't have, and that was a big motivator for us. So we hope to do both, and we think there is good pent-up demand. Hopefully, the tax -- if there are tax changes, they won't screw it all up. Because, obviously, some companies who might expand here in the U.S.A. today, maybe next year if things go in a different fashion, they might go overseas, and we would be sad to see that happen. Peter, you want to talk to that? Yes. So maybe I'll give an intro to that and maybe let Peter talk about it. But we had substantially upzoned, I think, about 2x from what was the as-of-right square footage. I think the square footage we've got is north of 400,000. We just got design approval just the other night. So we're moving full steam ahead. \n We have a handful of existing tenants who are looking for expansion space. So we're -- likely, this building will be a little bit like what we did in Seattle at 188 or 1818 -- Eastlake, 188 Blaine -- I forgot the exact address there, where we created almost 200,000 square foot building, multitenant life science building and accommodated most of our -- many of our existing tenants who needed more space. I think that's what's going to happen to 325 Binney.\n I think companies that are in Cambridge would prefer to be in Cambridge. The Seaport, I think, offers some nice opportunities, but I think Cambridge would be first choice. \n But Peter, you could comment. Okay. I'm not sure I could hear you when you described about Philadelphia. Could you repeat that? No. No. Yes. I don't -- yes, we don't think like that. This is not -- yes, that's just a different, I don't know, way of thinking. This is a -- this is originally the Glaxo campus that was bought and redeveloped. I think the timing and the job that was done by the seller was really good. We came in, there are a strong number of existing credit tenants, among which is Duke. Duke has an important lab presence there that's attractive to us, but that wasn't the major reason for it. The major reason was it had good, existing solutions and a number of future solutions that would accommodate existing tenants' expansion and growth of ours that we had. And it gave us a 3 campus -- 3 mega campus opportunity down in the Triangle.\n This is in the park. The park is not adjacent to Duke. It's not adjacent to UNC. It's some miles away or NC State. So I wouldn't compare it at all to -- it's nothing like Philadelphia. Just totally different ballgame. Yes. And the challenge, if you do universities, is if you're entirely dependent on the university, and universities can be up and down and so forth, and you have no commercial tenant base, you're really at the mercy of the university, which we've never wanted to be. That's why we've never really gone after that business model. Yes. We said we might. I think our hands are full in our existing markets because they're so vibrant and keeping us busy. We have a big budget this year to fulfill. And so at the moment, we're not focused on -- or ready to announce any expansion markets because we're pretty occupied in where we are. But who knows what the future may have given -- post-election, what may happen there. So Dean, maybe a comment? Yes. I think -- I'm not an expert in that. But I think it's pretty clear that there are quite a number of scientists from other countries who have unique skill bases that are here under that visa category or designation, and it would be positive to keep that going, for sure. I know there is some sensitivity on -- and there have been a bunch written about people coming over from China working in universities with professors. And maybe there being some national security issue there that I know the government has looked pretty carefully at. But set that aside, I think it's been a very positive -- a positive program and certainly very helpful to the life science industry. Okay. Thank you very much. Sorry for a long call during this third quarter of COVID. Look forward to talking to you on fourth quarter and year-end. Thank you. And everybody, please stay safe."

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. \n Our essential real estate portfolio continues to provide highly innovative entities with mission-critical research facilities really focused on acceleration of innovation to advance human health. We're very proud to be the key partner to leading entities across pharma, biotech and AgTech, and have a highly experienced team delivering operational excellence quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. \n Our high-quality Class A properties and future development sites, combined with our stellar tenant roster, continues to generate high-quality and growing cash flows. Our growth in cash flows from operating activities continue to allow us to increase our common stock dividend, most recently, $1.06 per common share or $4.12 per share on an annual basis, and that was up 6% over the previous 12 months. We are on track to retain over $200 million in cash flows from operating activities after dividends in 2020 for reinvestment into our highly leased development pipeline.\n Our third quarter results were very solid, and 2020 is wrapping up as a strong year for our essential real estate business. Total revenues for the third quarter were up almost 17% over the third quarter of '19 and excluding the termination payment from Pinterest, really highlighting continued, solid execution on both internal and external growth.\n Adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 67% for the third quarter and remains one of the top stats within the REIT industry. The slight temporary decline in the third quarter was due to 2 items, about 1/3 of which was related to temporary vacancy for a space that will be delivered for occupancy in the fourth quarter and about 2/3 of that decline related to seasonal increases in utilities. Now the increase in utility expenses are recoverable from our tenants and did not impact net operating income. Importantly, our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve to 68% in the fourth quarter.\n Rent collections have been very strong, as Steve highlighted, at 99.7% for both 3Q and for October, and in line with our expectations for our mission-critical essential real estate. Now occupancy has been solid this year, 97.7% before the impact of vacancy from recently acquired priorities. And please refer to Page 24 of our supplemental package for a detailed list of vacancy that was acquired recently.\n Now the key takeaway is that recently acquired properties vacancy will provide growth in cash flows as our team executes on these lease-up opportunities. Now our operating results continue to benefit from contractual annual rent escalations averaging approximately 3% from one of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry. As highlighted on our second quarter earnings call, tenants took occupancy in the third quarter, closing out temporary vacancy as of June 30 and contractual rents commenced in 3Q pushing through third quarter same-property results in line for our expectations for 2020.\n Now same-property NOI growth was 2.9% and 4.9% on a cash basis for the third quarter. We reported continued and very strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-lease in the space at almost 40% and almost 31% on a cash basis for the third quarter.\n And quick comment on leasing activity for the quarter and for the 9 months. Two leases did impact the amount of TIs and leasing commitments related to lease renewals and re-lease in the space. One lease executed in the quarter related to re-tenanting of an older building that was occupied by a single tenant for 15 to 20 years, and the infrastructure was not really our traditional generic lab improvements. Also, consistent with our assumptions related to a recent acquisition, we successfully re-leased a portion of the property, along with the TI allowance to bring the space up to ARE standard really for high-quality facilities. \n Now these 2 leases are unusual, and did impact our quarterly average for TIs and leasing commissions. Excluding these 2 leases, our average TIs and LCs for the 3 months and 9 months ended September 30, would have been in line with historical amounts at approximately $17 and $20 per square foot, respectively.\n Now during the quarter, our General Counsel resigned for family reasons. And she really was one of our top leaders in the company. She built a really great team and had an amazing 2-decade career at Alexandria. We truly wish her well. In connection with her departure, we recognized a $4.5 million compensation expense in the third quarter.\n Now turning briefly to venture investments. Over the past year or so, we have been taking advantage of the strength of the portfolio and overall capital markets. Our net cash flows from -- have been about neutral for the first 3 quarters of 2020, highlighting that we have been strategically monetizing certain holdings. Unrealized gains have grown significantly to $542 million as of September 30. And realized gains have averaged about $16.1 million per quarter over the last 4 quarters and was $17.4 million for the third quarter.\n Now our team has been working diligently on our active and near-term development and redevelopment projects. Peter touched on a lot of the details, but key highlights included 4.1 million square feet of active and near-term projects that are highly leased or negotiating at 74% that will generate significant cash flows. This consisted of great progress on the active pipeline that we presented last quarter, which is now 80% leased or negotiating. We added over 900,000 square feet to our active pipeline in the quarter, which is now -- those projects are 54% leased and negotiating. And we also have an additional 500,000 square feet of near-term projects, which are 80% leased or negotiating with vertical construction starts ranging from the fourth quarter to the second quarter of '21. So a huge thanks to our entire team for their outstanding execution on our development and redevelopment pipeline.\n Moving to our balance sheet. I just want to say thank you to our relationship lenders and our team for completing an amendment to our unsecured senior line of credit, providing aggregate commitments of $3 billion, up $800 million and extending the maturity date by 2 years to early 2026. We completed a record low, 12-year bond deal at 1.875% in August of 2020. The all-in rate for 10-year bonds today for Alexandria remains very attractive at approximately 2%.\n Now we remain committed to our strong and improving credit profile and are on track to hit our year-end goal for net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.3x. And we're very proud to highlight one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry, ranking in the top 10 among all publicly traded REITs. We have liquidity of about $3.9 billion reflecting the increase in commitments from our October 2020 amendment to our line of credit. And our weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt was very solid at 10.6 years with very minimal debt maturities until 2024.\n We updated our 2020 guidance and narrowed the range for EPS diluted from $3 to $3.11 (sic) [ $3.09 to $3.11 ], and FFO per share diluted as adjusted from $7.29 to $7.31. Now our targeted dispositions for the remainder of 2020 include 2 key transactions, both of which are moving along very well, with one expected to close real soon. Both of the deals are in process and subject to confidentiality agreements, and therefore, we are unable to comment on either transaction until after closing.\n Now as usual, please refer to detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2020 guidance, beginning on Page 10 of our supplemental package. Additionally, consistent with prior years, we plan to provide our detailed guidance assumptions for 2021 later on -- at our Annual Investor Day on December 1, and therefore, we are unable to comment on 2021 until then.\n Let me turn it back over to Joel. Dave, Dean here. I'd say that the overall strategy for the venture portfolio has been to carefully manage that aspect of our business. If you look back over several years now, I think the aggregate dollars invested from a cost perspective has actually declined as a percentage of total assets or assets have grown on the real estate side over time. And like I shared in my commentary, we've -- from a cash flow perspective, the venture portfolio has been about neutral this year. So still always careful about selective new investment opportunities.\n But given what Joel had mentioned, if you look back over -- since 2013, there's been a real acceleration of innovation. So we're seeing a lot of exciting opportunities, but still being very selective, Dave.\n I think we've commented that the size of the venture portfolio will always moderate in size somewhere in that 3% to 5% from a cost basis perspective, and it's closer to 3.5% today, down from where it was a couple of years ago. Yes. So I just want to be sure it was off mute. The overall portfolio, I think, over the last number of quarters have been in the upper teens on average, both GAAP and cash. So I think the continued overall constraints and supply and good fundamentals in our core markets, I think, has held up good upside on the overall portfolio. It turns out, I don't have that specific analysis for this quarter. But if I think back to the last several quarters, net effective rents have trended nicely. I think the only change in -- that I can see that might make that picture a little bit harder to see as we go forward is you've got to -- through the acquisitions, we've got a broader mix of assets in the portfolio, including this Research Triangle project as well as The Arsenal on the Charles as a couple of examples. But net effective rent generally has been trending very well for the last number of years as well as the last several quarters. I can't tell you specifically for this quarter right now, though."

            "name": "Stephen A. Richardson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenna. Good afternoon, everyone. \n The very strong results we've achieved during the third quarter are a testament to both the clear vision the company has had since its inception more than 25 years ago, and a highly creative and entrepreneurial team that has skillfully adapted to this tumultuous time. Alexandria's mega campuses are now not only essential and mission-critical, but they are also especially desirable in capturing a significant majority of the life science growth in the marketplace. \n The Alexandria brand is highly valued across the entire life cycle -- life science ecosystem for its well-earned trusted relationships, impeccable integrity and unparalleled expertise and experience. These timeless elements are the foundation for a tenant's decisions to continue to seek out a collaborative and mutually beneficial multidimensional platform for their growth with Alexandria. As the challenges only increased for navigating success in the quest to eradicate disease and improve nutrition globally, particularly with a once-in-a-century pandemic upon us, Alexandria stands out and is recognized as an innovative, insightful and unique partner as the following results clearly demonstrate.\n In the realm of operational excellence, the company has collected 99.7% of its accounts receivable during the third quarter and 99.7% during October. The 24/7 nature of these labs and the fundamental value they provide for our tenants is clearly evident with these operational statistics.\n On the leasing front, we have continued outperformance. During the third quarter, we outperformed the second quarter leasing activity with a total of 1.2 million square feet leased, which brings us to nearly 3 million square feet leased year-to-date during 2020, which is pretty impressive considering our 10-year leasing average is 3.9 million square feet. Alexandria's team is fully engaged, and our tenant base is thriving and continuing to grow.\n To underscore the leasing outperformance, this quarterly run rate during the time of COVID is approximately equal to or better than the leasing run rate during the first quarter, the second quarter and the third quarter of 2019. And of particular note is the 80% leased or negotiation status of the development pipeline for the same set of projects detailed in our Q2 supplemental, so very solid progress with our on-balance sheet growth engine, and Peter will provide further details during his remarks.\n Our core continues to be strong with rental rate increases of 30.9% cash and 39.9% GAAP for renewals and re-leases. And early renewals for the third quarter are above our historic levels and reached 86%, so the sense of urgency remains strong for our tenant base. Our mark-to-market is at 16.4% cash, a 90 bps increase from the second quarter and 17.1% GAAP, up 120 bps over the second quarter.\n Occupancy continues to be solid at 94.9% across 31.2 million square feet in the operating portfolio. And after taking into account the recently acquired lease-up opportunities, we would otherwise be at 97.7% occupancy, up 60 bps from the second quarter.\n Market health continues to be strong with robust lab demand of 3.2 million square feet in the Bay Area of San Francisco, 2.5 million square feet in the greater Boston region and 2.1 million square feet in San Diego. But importantly, there's a market acceleration to high-quality, COVID-safe campuses and evidenced, again, by our ability to capture a dominant market share of promising and strong credit life science companies.\n So in conclusion, Alexandria's pioneering efforts have placed the company at the actual and virtual intersection of science and global health. The team is entrepreneurial, creative and fully prepared to meet and decisively capitalize on this opportunity to partner with our tenants for the benefit of health across the globe.\n With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Yes. I would add, Jamie, that our South San Francisco portfolio for the lab product is essentially 100% leased. At Haskins now, we're at 88% leased and negotiating so very well positioned there. The entirety of the Phase 1 of Kilroy's project is 100% leased. Blackstone is substantially leased. Peak is substantially leased. So we did monitor it, as Joe mentioned a couple of years ago, but there has been very robust demand. You have a combination of big pharma coming into South San Francisco that's anchored it with probably 4 or 5 global pharma companies coming in that were not there before. You have the second cohort of companies that have matured to commercialization. So we continue to see that very healthy and do monitor supply certainly very closely, but not overly worried as we might have been a couple of years ago. Right. Yes, I think that was really a unique situation as the market was extremely tight. When they were making that decision, they were looking for opportunities to have additional buildings for expansion, so they did make the move to South San Francisco. You had a particular tax regime in San Francisco. That might have been troublesome as well. So that -- we'll see if that's a harbinger for future tech locations, which will only increase demand in South San Francisco. But it is -- it was an important and kind of unique situation. Yes. Sheila, it's Steve here. Yes, Stripe's plans for subleasing, I think, were always the case with the relocation of South San Francisco. They haven't done anything official yet. I think they're just putting some feelers out. So that's very much a TBD. \n And then with 88 Bluxome, we have important preconstruction activities that we'll be undertaking in the next several quarters here. When you look at that building, it is a lab-ready shell. So as Peter was highlighting that contrast between office product and lab product, we'll have the floor to floor, the live load, the capability, shipping and receiving. So when you start looking at a mid-rise facility, a lot of outdoor space, the capability to go lab, we think it's going to be an extremely desirable product. So we'll see this time next year where we're at. Rich, it's Steve. Again, from the very outset, we designed that as a lab-ready shell. So we do not need to make any modifications. And we have the ability to both accommodate lab and technology users. Sure. Dave, it's Steve. Yes, when we looked at that asset, to receive an unsolicited offer and then also to look at its location along Market Street, was somewhat of a one-off kind of at the edge of the cluster at best of SoMa, it really did make sense to go ahead and exit. And I just think the scale and the size of 88 Bluxome is much, much different and qualitatively in a different position. You're really at the edge of Mission Bay there. So I do think we have the opportunity at scale to help life science or technology. Whereas the Market Street location was just a -- ultimately, a smaller project there. We weren't really going to build a cluster adjacent to that. And again, as Peter said, receiving an unsolicited offer and recycling that capital with these other opportunities just made great sense. I think you just have to look at that in isolation, Dave, and the circumstances that led us to make that decision."

            "name": "Jenna Foger",
            "content": "Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. \n So as this unprecedented pandemic races on, giving rise to a new record high resurgence in COVID cases across the country and forging an indelible mark on the global economy, society and, of course, the future of public health, the imminent need for safe and effective treatments of vaccines to combat this coronavirus is paramount. And those skepticism and impatience have set in as each and every one of us navigates this uncomfortably discomforting human experience of waiting, never before has the work of our tenants in the life science industry have been more important. \n In the mission-critical and absolutely essential efforts of our nearly 100 tenants with meaningful COVID programs represent the beacon of hope for an end to this COVID-19 pandemic. In aggregate, our tenants in the life science industry also represents the solution for the longer-term impact to human health, which COVID has urged us all to rethink an increased focus on prevention, overdue innovation and infectious disease and other neglected therapeutic areas, and new paradigms for R&D collaboration, next-generation manufacturing, supply chain efficiency and improved distribution and access to new medicines. \n Clearly, a safe and effective vaccine should help bring about the effective end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is absolutely a requisite to meaningfully reopen society and restore the global economy. As such, researchers around the world are working with unprecedented speed and collaboration on at least 135 distinct coronavirus vaccine programs, of which nearly 50 vaccine candidates are already in human trials. As Joel mentioned, a cornerstone of the U.S. government's effort to expedite the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines is, of course, the Operation Warp Speed initiative with the vast majority of its grant recipients being to Alexandria tenants. \n So among these efforts, I want to call your attention to 4 of the most advanced vaccine programs from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Novavax, each a top tenant for Alexandria in their respective regions, and each applying a slightly different underlying technology and approach to vaccine development. Each one of these companies has reported clinical data that suggest initial safety and efficacy, and each are currently conducting major Phase III studies with tens of thousands of subjects around the world. Key data readouts from each of these companies are expected in the fourth quarter of this year spanning between now probably November and December. Together, these 4 companies alone are building capacity to provide over 6 billion doses next year. \n So what do we make of all of this? And it's the constant flow of headlines. It is highly likely that at least one, and likely more than one of these initial Phase III trials will report interim efficacy results in November and December of this year. If they do, the FDA could grant emergency use authorization by year-end or very early into 2021, which would enable the highest risk populations like health care workers and others to begin to receive the vaccine over the coming months. \n The FDA has set the minimum standard efficacy threshold for all COVID vaccines at 50%, meaning that a vaccine will have to protect at least 50% of those receiving it to receive emergency use authorization. And based on some of the data that's come out to date and the time that it's taken for companies like Pfizer or Moderna and others to report their data, health care analysts have begun to predict efficacy more likely in the range of at least 70%, but all obviously remains to be seen. \n As more data becomes available and the vaccines begin to be distributed, if safety and efficacy persists, these companies and others could receive FDA approval in the first half of 2021 with widespread distribution of safe and effective vaccines to the public sometime in the next year. Given the addressable population, pretty much the entire world, this will not be a winner-take-all opportunity and no one company alone will supply the global demand in the near term. Over time, the most effective vaccines will likely have more upside. \n Of course, many questions remain, and we'll continue to learn more in the coming months as more data rolls out. Just as it remains unclear how long natural immunity lasts after a person becomes infected with COVID-19, similarly, the durability of a COVID-19 vaccine is still a wide open question. Will COVID be a pandemic like SARS or MERS that will subside over time? Or will it be more endemic or flu-like, creating a longer-term market opportunity for the current treatments and development? \n In addition to safety and efficacy questions, challenges related to capacity, access, distribution, logistics and early adoption are all being navigated in real time. Meaningful strides are being taken by our tenants in the life science industry to preempt as many of these complexities as possible. \n And of course, in the meantime, new antibody therapies by companies such as tenants Vir in collaboration with GSK, Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca could serve as a bridge to a vaccine, taken prophylactically and/or to help reduce the severity of COVID-19, especially if taken early in the course of disease, as we see now with the Eli Lilly's antibody. Key data readouts will be forthcoming over the next few months while Eli Lilly's single-agent antibody and Regeneron's antibody cocktail have filed for emergency use authorization and await approval. \n Other notable advances in the treatment of COVID-19 included the FDA's first COVID-specific approval of tenant Gilead's antiviral drug Veklury or remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization. The FDA has also granted emergency use authorization for the use of convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with severe disease. And the NIH has also included within its guidance the use of dexamethasone or steroids in hospitalized COVID patients requiring supplemental oxygen.\n These notable and expedient efforts across our tenant base and the life science industry are in large part to the fact that as the coronavirus made itself known to the world almost a year ago now, these companies were already well equipped with the R&D infrastructure, technology platforms, resources and talent in place such that they were able to mobilize quickly and meaningfully to combat this global health crisis. It is our honor to continue to serve at the vanguard of this essential life science industry and to support the heroic work of our tenants and campus communities, focused on bringing an end to this pandemic, addressing the 10,000-plus diseases already known to us today and innovating the future of drug discovery to solve tomorrow's risks to human health. \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. \n I'm going to briefly update you all on our development pipeline, the impact of Prop 15 on Alexandria and touch on a recent third-party asset sale in one of our submarkets. So as with developments, overall, the leasing activity was very robust. We had over 300,000 square feet of leases completed and approximately 490,000 square feet of space put under LOI in the development, redevelopment pipeline during the quarter. And that was led by a significant demand at our 2 Bay Area projects, 201 Haskins and the Alexandria District project in San Carlos.\n There have been a few adjustments to the development, redevelopment pipeline from last quarter. 975 (sic) [ 945 ] Market Street in SoMa was sold for $198 million as noted in our dispositions disclosure. Accepting the unsolicited offer really made a lot of sense to us as an opportunity to really recycle that capital into our already robust pipeline. 704 Quince Orchard Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland and 9880 Campus Point Drive in San Diego were successfully completed during the quarter and put into operation.\n So as those assets were removed from the pipeline, 2 new assets have been added including the Parmer campus in Research Triangle that Joel referenced. That was acquired in the third quarter and has been rebranded as Alexandria Center for Life Science \u2013 Durham, approximately 650,000 square feet of the 2.2 million square foot campus is slated for redevelopment into research and development lab space for manufacturing space, and it has already been 50% pre-leased. The second asset, Alexandria Center for Advanced Technologies is also in the Triangle, and features research and manufacturing space in 2 buildings that are a combined 40% pre-leased.\n We have also disclosed 3 new pre-leased projects in our San Diego region: 3115 Merryfield Row, also referred to as Spectrum 3, is 146,456 square foot ground-up development. That will be the fourth and final phase of our Spectrum 3 -- for our Spectrum campus in Torrey Pines. The project has considerable interest. 80% of the building is already under letter of intent.\n At Alexandria Point, we have pre-leased 100% of a new ground-up -- once ground-up 171,102 square foot development on that mega campus to a credit tenant. And at the San Diego Tech by Alexandria project, we've kicked off our first ground-up development with a 59% pre-leasing of 176,428 square foot building to an exciting genetic sequencing company, a technology that's really a major strength of the San Diego region.\n On to Prop 15, we're sure everybody is aware of the details of California's Proposition 15 ballot measure that would overhaul the state's property tax limitation of 2% increases per year and replace it with market value assessments every 3 years for commercial properties that have values in excess of $3 million. If Proposition 15 is passed, the property taxes for some of our properties in California could substantially increase. \n Our current assessment is that we're in pretty good position to absorb the impact of this proposition should it pass as our California asset base is relatively young, with approximately 60% of our California properties purchased or developed, redeveloped over the past 10 years, and our triple-net leases allow us to pass-through, among other costs, substantially all real estate and rent-related taxes to our tenants in the form of additional rent tenant recoveries. Consequently, as a result of having triple-net leases and a relatively new asset base, we do not expect potential increases of property taxes resulting from tax reassessments to significantly impact our operating results, and they will have almost no impact on NOI.\n Moving to the asset sale I mentioned. So over the past 2 quarters, we've discussed strong interest in lab office assets from a diverse set of investors mentioning Healthpeak's purchase of The Post and Waltham at a 5.1% cap rate and a healthy price per square foot of $751 a foot for a suburban asset. Their purchase of 35 Cambridge Park Drive for almost $1,500 a square foot in a 4.8% cap rate. And Beacon's purchase, I think, referenced last quarter of 27 Drydock, subject to a very onerous ground lease in the Seaport area of Boston at a 4.8% cap rate and a $916 per square foot value. It is still a good time to be in the market with assets in life science markets.\n During the third quarter, Ventas purchased the Genesis Towers and 4000 Shoreline in South San Francisco for $1.02 billion or $1,301 per square foot and a 4.75% cap rate. We were somewhat surprised by that valuation as the Towers sit oddly and alone on the west side of the 101 Freeway and the south tower's an actual converted office building, which as we've been talking about at a number of recent meetings, can cause less than ideal conditions for tenants. For instance, the low clear height of the base building design led to lower finished -- a lower-finished ceiling than what you would normally find in a Class A lab building. And since the building had an office tenant in the top floors during its conversion, much of the ducting resides on the exterior of the building, making for less than ideal aesthetics and the freight elevator does not reach the building's other floors. All of these things really put the project at a competitive disadvantage to others in the rental market.\n Look, despite the exuberance of our product type, we are going to continue to maintain our highly disciplined approach to underwriting. And know that our deep knowledge, expertise and experience will continue to provide us with great opportunities to grow our asset base at reasonable valuations. \n And with that, I will pass it over to Dean. Yes. I mean I -- just yesterday, an article came out in the Bisnow website of San Francisco, titled, \"Too Low, Too Fragile, Too Short-Term: Life Sciences Conversions Are Popular But Hard To Pull Off\" by -- author's name was Dean Boerner. And I think it's just -- it's a pretty summary-level article. But like we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters, office buildings just don't have the infrastructure needed for a laboratory that will be efficient and flexible at the end of the day. So convert one, you can, but the tenants are going to have to make sacrifices in order to occupy that space. And they could be very material as far as like how many chemicals they can store, where they can put equipment. It's very inefficient compared to Alexandria's portfolio which was purpose-built for labs.\n So we feel like any requirement in any of our submarkets that comes around, we're going to be the first choice. We're going to have a building that's flexible, that works and has a staff that knows how to run it. I mean that's the other thing. There's more than just bricks-and-mortar here. There's operational expertise and that can get very technical. And these are mission-critical facilities. Can't -- our companies can't really afford to go into a building when somebody doesn't know what they're doing because time is money, and especially in the life science industry. Yes, sure. Rich, I mean, it's obviously a great question. Look, would it be much better if this doesn't pass? It would be because it would just maybe give people confidence that California isn't necessarily going to continue to search for revenue sources from business. That said, as I mentioned, we pass through the cost. And you inferred, well, eventually, your occupancy cost is going to go up. It will. But our analysis is that it would be in the low or low single digits overall for a company.\n And I would take you back to a lot of questions we get about just when rents are rising in a market very quickly, people are always like, well, at what point is it going to just get so expensive, people will go elsewhere? And the answer is, well, it really won't because these companies need to be anchored where they are because they're typically located where they are because of institutions that they collaborate with.\n So the increase in operating expenses is not something anyone wants to see. Is it going to cause them to move? We would think probably not. And then the overwhelming amount of annual revenue that comes through Alexandria is from very large pharma and biotech, where the OpEx, that rent and operating expenses in the context of their overall cost structure is like 1% to 3%. So it's not going to move that needle. It's going to be an annoyance. But again, wanting to be near the institutions, which is why work in these markets, is going to really win the location selection at the end of the day and an annoyance about property tax increase will ultimately be absorbed. Steve, do you want to take that? And I would just add -- I was just going to add that 88 Bluxome is a much closer extension of Mission Bay than Market Street. So it makes a lot more sense to be our next development to build on that cluster than Market Street would. Yes. No. There are -- I think it's -- I don't have the exact number, but there are a few assets that are currently used as office and leased as office that we consider as future upside. There's either 1- or 2-story buildings that could be converted to labs. So there are -- all of the assets that were on the campus were sold to us, and we own all of them. Yes, absolutely. I mean Cambridge is still the place everybody wants to be. The opportunities there are very limited. We fortunately have one. But we've been very proactive to figure out where people could go that need to be in close proximity. \n Watertown was one of our strategies. It's working out very well. The demand there has been even stronger than we would have imagined. And it makes a lot of sense that the Seaport would also be as attractive, in a way, maybe a bit more to those that are more Cambridge-centric because it is linked by the Red Line, you can get from South Station to Kendall Square in about 12 to 15 minutes. And obviously, the amenities and the Fort Point Channel area mimic what you can find in Cambridge as well. So we think it's a good, natural extension for those that may not have the ability to be in Cambridge but needed to be close by. Yes. And Joel, it's Peter. I can add -- I mean there's a total of 6 tenants there, 5 of the 6 are credit tenants. The sixth one's actually probably also a credit tenant now. And only Duke is university related. So I'll echo what Joel said, this is nothing like a university play that Ventas would have done."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nPaula Schwartz: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  \n I now would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel. \nJoel Marcus: Thank you very much, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to Alexandria's second quarter earnings call and our first full quarter done virtually. And as I always do, I want to thank the entire Alexandria family for an outstandingly executed second quarter, really in all respects and by all metrics, as I said, our first full reporting quarter virtually.  \n It was once said -- a couple of notes about change. Everything changes but change. And as I've quoted before, the award-winning visionary author Jim Collins noted, \"To be built to last must be built to change.\" And Stephen Hawking said, \"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.\" So Alexandria is, has always been, I think, resilient and very responsive to a changing environment. We're all blessed compared to many who are struggling during this pandemic, and I want to -- my heart goes out and wish everyone both safety and good health here.  And Dean will talk about this, but entire -- our huge kudos to the entire accounting and finance team on our win of NAREIT's Best Communications Gold Award once again.  \n In our first quarter call in -- or on our first quarter call, I should say, we dialed back our growth in light of the uncertainties of the COVID onslaught in all realms. But now that we've gotten through that quarter and through part of -- gotten through the second quarter certainly and into the third quarter, we have a much clearer, I think, view of the landscape going forward.  \n I want to say a couple of things about corporate responsibility. It's a lot in the press, but we're not new to this. And we've included in our press release the panoply of corporate responsibility initiatives. We've worked on very hard over many, many years many long-standing and impactful activities in our regional communities, our truly positively impactful sustainability initiatives, including, our pioneering zero carbon building in South San Francisco. And more recently, in response to the COVID pandemic, we are, in fact, at the vanguard of the life science industry in advancing the search for solutions to COVID-19.  \n I want to also harken you back to our project OneFifteen with Alphabet, the subsidiary of Alphabet, Verily. 72,000 Americans died last year, hard to imagine half of the number that have died of COVID this year but an enormous number and more than in the entire Vietnam War, of opioid addiction. In 2020, deaths are up 13%, and one could imagine why that may be. Last year, we announced our OneFifteen project in Dayton, Ohio to serve as a unique and complete care model -- comprehensive care model really to attack the opioid crisis in America. Our hope was we would build a model that other communities could copy. We pioneered the design and development of the almost 60,000-square-foot campus, and thank you to the great team that worked on this on about 4 acres, which opened to outpatients in the fall of 2019. This month, we completed OneFifteen Living, the residential housing component of the campus. This facility is the so-called sober living facility for patients suffering from opioid addiction to live while accessing full on-campus treatment that will come over time and really, the first full treatment care facility from detox to job placement.  \n Let me shift gears here for a moment and talk about the life science industry, and then I'm going to have Jenna speak after I finish and talk specifically about the 3 most advanced vaccine projects. As we all know, we're living in truly unprecedented times in history with the onslaught of a pandemic, the resultant recession and civil strife in many of our cities. We've seen a significant uptick, however, in demand this quarter across all of our markets, both from new and existing tenants, and that's given us, I think, good comfort. There's been strong bipartisan government support for life science R&D to solve COVID-19. For example, $10 billion has been committed to Operation Warp Speed, and they brought together some amazingly talented people. Of that amount -- or in addition to that, there's a large number, over $7 billion for CDC, over $6.5 billion to the so-called BARDA group, over $3.6 billion to the NIH and over $160 million to the NIH, all supporting COVID-19 pandemic.  \n So far this year, the FDA has approved 25 new drugs. Last year, they approved 48, so we're on our way to maybe beating of the 2019 number. During the first half of 2020, funds raised by life science companies via IPOs and follow-ons almost matched all of 2019. And this is amazing because this happened despite COVID. Venture capital was strong to the tune of about $9.5 billion and 10% more than 1Q this year. And we're pleased to say 80% of all venture capital funding in 2020 has been in Alexandria's region.  \n So before I turn it over to Jenna, let me make a comment. Life probably won't return to normal until we have a widely distributed COVID-19 vaccine, and the good news is this may happen sooner than expected, thanks to years of private investment and new cooperation between U.S. government and drug companies. This taxpayer money could not have been spent better even if some vaccines may -- candidates may actually end up failing. The potential return from resuming normal life is far greater than from all the transfer payments Congress has spent so far, and we hope that this combination of private innovation with faster regulatory action truly pays off.  \n And with that, let me turn it over to Jenna Foger, our Senior Vice President, who coleads our life science team. \nJenna Foger: Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. Against the backdrop of this COVID-19 pandemic that has made an indelible mark on our society, the economy and the future of public health, as Joel noted, life science fundamentals remain strong as the biopharma industry represents the beacon of hope and absolutely essential in the fight against COVID-19. We are currently tracking over 80 tenants across our cluster markets who are advancing solutions for COVID-19, and we owe a tremendous set of gratitude to their heroic work. Clearly, as Joel mentioned, the state manufactured vaccine should help bring about the effective end of the COVID-19 pandemic and as a prerequisite to fully reopen society and restore the global economy. As a reminder, given the global demand for a vaccine, multiple vaccines by multiple company sponsors are absolutely required. As such, researchers around the world are working with unprecedented speed and collaboration on at least 165 distinct coronavirus vaccine programs, of which nearly 30 vaccine candidates are already in human trials. And the cornerstone of the U.S. government's effort to expedite the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, as Joel mentioned, the administration had allocated $10 billion with Operation Warp Speed initiatives and has awarded grants to a handful of company partners, almost all of which are Alexandria tenants, including AstraZeneca, Emergent BioSolutions, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Novavax and Pfizer.  \n Among these efforts, I want to call to your attention -- your attention to the 3 most advanced vaccine programs from Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, each a top tenant for Alexandria in their respective regions. Each of these companies has reported early clinical data that points to initial safety and efficacy. And all 3 companies' vaccine programs have now officially enrolled major late-stage pivotal studies and tens of thousands of patients around the world. Moderna in partnership with NIAID and Pfizer partnered with German biotech, BioNTech, are both developing messenger RNA-based vaccines. These vaccines contain instructions that tell ourselves to effectively build the same spike protein that is found on the coronavirus, which helps the virus invade human cells. Our immune system then make antibodies to latch onto and neutralize the vaccine and do spike proteins, such that when a vaccinated person encounters a virus in the future, those vaccine-stimulated antibodies should prevent the virus from infecting healthy cells.  \n Moderna was, of course, the first U.S.-based company to enter its vaccine into human trials, marking an extraordinary and historic fast-tracking of a vaccine construct into the clinic. To date, Moderna has received just shy of $1 billion from BARDA to expedite the clinical development and manufacturing of its lead vaccine candidate. After reporting positive initial safety and efficacy data from their Phase I and II studies earlier this month, demonstrating that healthy volunteers receiving their vaccines produce significant neutralizing antibodies against the coronavirus as well as downstream T cells implying some degree of lasting immunity, both Moderna and Pfizer began to enroll 30,000-plus patients late-stage Phase II/III studies just this past week. Pfizer stated that they should have efficacy data to report as soon as October, and they've also received a $1.95 billion contract from the U.S. government to help deliver over $1 billion of their vaccine by the end of 2021. \n And finally, AstraZeneca, in partnership with the University of Oxford, uses a slightly different approach to their vaccine development effort using a genetically engineered viral vector to deliver coronavirus genes into cells that similarly encodes the coronavirus' signature spike protein and provoke an immune response. Based on results announced last week, AstraZeneca also shows a relatively safe vaccine with only mild to moderate side effects that successfully engages the human system -- excuse me, that successfully engages the immune system to fight the coronavirus. AstraZeneca has received up to $1.2 billion from the U.S. government to deliver up to 2 billion doses of their vaccine in 2021.  \n So where are we now? Though it is challenging to predict exactly when the vaccine will become widely available, we do expect interim data readouts from each of these 3 pivotal programs and potentially others over the coming few months, which should directionally inform us about the broad safety profile of each vaccine candidate and/or whether each shows continued signs of efficacy. If results are positive, there is, of course, the potential for Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA for any of these vaccine candidates by year-end 2021 and into early -- excuse me, by year-end 2020 and into early 2021. Given that each of these companies is already scaling its manufacturing capabilities to be able to deliver at least 1 billion doses of each vaccine next year, there is a clear path towards the widespread availability of a safe and effective vaccine in the first half of 2021. However, just as it remains unclear how long natural immunity last after a person becomes infected with COVID-19, the durability of a COVID-19 vaccine also remains an open question. Also yet to be determined are the anticipated frequency and cadence at which we will need to get vaccinated, which segment of the population may respond better or worse to the vaccine and what proportion of the population needs to get vaccinated to ultimately drive herd immunity and eradicate COVID-19 altogether. \n But in the meantime, new antibody therapies by companies such as tenants Eli Lilly and Bayer Biotechnology and others could serve as a bridge to a vaccine and help reduce the severity of COVID-19 in infected patients. There are an additional 300-plus new and repurposed therapies in clinical development and in parallel with increased widespread testing and continued socially responsible behavior, we're hopeful that this virus will become more manageable and less fatal overall. Needless to say, we look forward to continuing to support the mission-critical work of our tenants to overcome this global pandemic within the coming year.  \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. \nStephen A. Richardson: Thank you, Jenna. Steve Richardson here, everybody. Good afternoon. As we stated during the Q1 earnings call, Alexandria's role as a proven leader in providing mission-critical and indispensable strategic national health infrastructure is only becoming more important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge our country. I'd like to acknowledge with a loud shout-out to our full operations team the stellar work they're undertaking as they've been on the job 24/7, providing exceptional and high-quality service to our tenants at Alexandria's essential services facilities, which have been open and fully operational every day throughout this difficult time. The increasing complexity of construction, delivery and ongoing operations of this mission-critical infrastructure is formidable and not an easy task and requires a highly skilled and talented team that Alexandria has carefully built since its inception. We are pleased to report a healthy, dynamic and positive operations and market reality for the company, and I'll tick through a number of pieces of that.  \n Brand loyalty is evident as Alexandria's tenants garner great value in our delivery of excellence in all operational matters. And as such, the company has collected 99.5% of accounts receivable during the second quarter and 99.3% during July so far, truly a testament to both the quality of the companies we serve and the great work by our operations team.  \n Outperformance. During Q2, we outperformed our Q1 leasing activity with a total of 1,077,000 square feet leased. And as we've noted now the past several quarters, this contribution is coming from all regions, with this quarter's significant leasing statistics highlighted by San Diego's activity. Great kudos to the team there.  \n Strong quarter. The rental rate increases continue to be strong with 15% cash and 37.2% GAAP during Q2. Early renewals year-to-date are consistent at our historic levels of 69%. And during Q2, we exceeded that with a figure of 78%. Mark-to-market is at 15.6% cash and 16.1% GAAP, which is pretty amazing when you consider the large number of new Class A facilities we've delivered during the past few years in core markets. \n Solid occupancy. We were at 94.8% across 28.8 million square feet in the operating portfolio, and taking into account lease-up opportunities at 2 recent key projects in San Diego and South San Francisco, would otherwise be at 97.1%. \n Finally, market health. Alexandria's core clusters have experienced no significant lab subleases coming to market during the pandemic, an important harbinger for Alexandria's ability to continue solid occupancy levels and consistent cash and GAAP rental rate increases for the balance of the year. As an additional data point, the lab demand has remained steady in the San Francisco Bay area with 2.3 million square feet today versus 2.2 million square feet during Q2 2019. A few requirements were, in fact, on pause during Q2, but we are actively touring prospects again. Tech demand, however, is weaker, falling by approximately 50% compared with 1 year ago, and we will be closely monitoring this segment over the coming months. \n In conclusion, the Alexandria team is fully engaged, providing operational excellence and importantly, Alexandria's long-term and historic commitment to the life science industry, as evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of leasing this quarter is with executive management teams we worked with as a trusted partner for many years and in some instances, decades. This is a truly unique and irreplaceable competitive advantage and one we relentlessly pursue in an honorable fashion each and every day. \n With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. \nPeter M. Moglia: Thanks, Steve. This is Peter Moglia. I'm going to briefly update you on all of our development pipeline activity, acquisitions closed in the second quarter and touch on some capital markets activity. \n So coming into 2020, we had 11 development/redevelopment projects, and we added 2 this quarter, including the second phase of our 5 Laboratory Drive project in the Research Triangle and 9877 Waples in the San Diego submarket of Sorrento Mesa, which is 100% pre-leased. These development projects are spread among a number of regions and give us a great mix of Alexandria-branded projects to meet the growing demand in all of our regions. Whenever possible, tenants want to locate their mission-critical operations in our high-quality and expertly managed assets. \n Although we achieved 196,000 square feet of leasing in our development pipeline during the COVID-impacted quarter, the leasing percentage remained 61% as the new leasing was offset by the additional project we added in the Triangle and a positive development at our Arsenal on the Charles project, where we were able to take back a poor performing leased retail space that will be converted to high-value lab office space. Our redevelopment of Arsenal on the Charles of that project has met our high expectations for it. To date, we have signed 3 LOIs for approximately 144,000 square feet. And remember, we only closed on this asset in mid-December, and we have a number of prospects for more. Tenants really like this location and our development plans for it. \n Despite the continuing overhang of COVID-19, we had an uptick in activity at many of our development/redevelopment projects. In Long Island City, we are in serious negotiations with groups representing 86,000 square feet of demand. At the Alexandria District in San Carlos, we have solid interest from a number of companies aggregating in excess of 200,000 square feet of demand. And up at 101 and 201 Haskins, we're working with 6 companies for space ranging from 20,000 square feet to 100,000 square feet. But COVID-19 is causing some companies to move deliberately. \n Last quarter, we mentioned that our 7 -- of our 7 projects experiencing -- or 7 of our projects experienced temporary pause in construction, and we're pleased to report that all of them are going forward with no current delays. We reported that we expected about a 1 quarter delay on average for those projects and did not anticipate any material movement in yields. That assessment has been confirmed in our 2Q numbers and is due to the remarkable job of our highly experienced real estate development teams that have done an amazing job managing the impact of delays and other COVID-19-related costs, which include the impact of social distancing, which has reduced our construction efficiency, added costs for safety measures such as the procurement of PPE, a dedicated COVID-19 Safety Officer required in many locations and added security. \n In addition to the contribution by our highly skilled seasoned team, the minor impact of our yields can also be credited to our highly disciplined underwriting, starting at the acquisition of these opportunities through the development and leasing phases. In the second quarter, we closed on 987-1075 Commercial Street project we discussed last quarter. And we added a prime parcel in the UTC submarket of San Diego across from our 9363 and 9393 Towne Centre Drive project that will be developed into a Class A 200,000 square foot lab office project with the potential of making it larger through an upzoning process. \n As far as sales activity goes, last quarter, we discussed the strong interest in lab office assets from a diverse set of investors, mentioning Healthpeak's purchase of The Post and Waltham at a 5.1% cap rate and a healthy price per square foot for a suburban asset of $751. We have since learned that Healthpeak has also paid a significant price for the 224,000 square foot 35 Cambridge Park Drive asset in Alewife for a reported $1,484 per square foot at a 4.8% cap rate. \n We also mentioned last quarter that a reliable source had disclosed that a transaction in the Boston area had gone under contract while in shutdown, and we can confirm that sale occurred. 27 Drydock, a 286,000 square foot lab office project in the Seaport area of Boston, was acquired by Beacon Capital Partners at an estimated cap rate of 4.8% and a price per foot of $916. This pricing was somewhat surprising as the asset is subject to a very onerous lessor-favored ground lease. \n It's really a good time to be in the market with assets in life science submarkets. We will continue to maintain our highly disciplined approach to underwriting, and we're going to keep you informed of our opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions over the coming quarters. \n So before I pass the baton, I would -- or we would like to encourage everyone to read Chip Cutter's article that appeared in Friday's Wall Street Journal titled Companies Start to Rethink Remote Work Isn't So Great After All as an alternative to all the press speculating that the office market is headed for the crypt. Laboratory office is not part of the work-from-home trend, but nonetheless, we believe traditional office product is not going anywhere. There will likely be some shifts in use such as workers not coming in every day and a reverse of the densification trend that permeated over the last decade. But there are a lot of reasons to have people physically together, and this article goes into some of them. \n So with that, I'll pass it over to Dean. \nDean Shigenaga: Okay. Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our national essential real estate platform, really combined with our trusted partnerships with some of the most innovative entities in the world, continues to generate high-quality growth in cash flows. 51% of our annual rental revenue is generated from investment grade-rated or large-cap publicly traded companies, really highlighting that our team has curated one of the best tenant rosters in the REIT industry. This high-quality tenant base continues to support growth in our common stock dividends that is currently $1.06 per common share or $4.12 per share on an annual basis and was up 6% over the previous 12-month period. We remain in a great position and continue to benefit from a very strong and flexible balance sheet, the best in the history of the company, really to support our strategic growth initiatives. And more on this in a moment. In June, we published our annual corporate responsibility report, which, along with our supplemental package, highlights our long-standing commitment to ESG, our focus on making a positive and meaningful impact on society and Alexandria's critical role at the forefront of the life science ecosystem, advancing solutions for COVID-19. \n Thank you to our ESG team for an outstanding job over the last year.  \n Before jumping into the second quarter, I also want to share a shout-out with a huge thank you to our entire team for their 5-time recognition as NAREIT's Gold Award winner for Communication and Reporting Excellence. So congratulations, team. \n The second quarter results were solid and in line with our expectations. Rental revenue was up almost 20% over the first half 2019. NOI was up approximately 19% over the first half of '19. And adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 69% and continues to be one of the top within the REIT industry. Rent collections are now over 99.5%. And our outstanding AR balance as of June 30 represents the lowest balance in the last 12 years. Occupancy trends have been positive this year. However, this is hidden by the 2.3% of vacancy from recently acquired leases. Please refer to Page 23 of our supplemental package for details of this acquired vacancy. \n Occupancy as of June 30 was reported at 94.8% and included 2.3% of recently acquired vacancies. So occupancy before this vacancy was 97.1%, actually up 38 basis points since December 31. In addition to this key takeaway, it's important to highlight that recently acquired vacancy will provide growth in cash flows as our team executes on these leasing opportunities. \n Now on internal growth, our operating results continue to benefit from contractual annual rent escalations, averaging almost 3% today. Continued strong same-property NOI growth remains on track with our 2020 midpoint guidance of 5.5% on a cash basis. We also reported continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing of space of 37.2% and 15% on a cash basis for the second quarter. Our rental rate growth has been amazing since 2015 and has averaged 29% and 15% on a cash basis. \n Now while our outlook for 2020 same-property NOI growth remains strong, the second quarter same-property performance was slightly impacted by 2 items. First, the second quarter results was impacted slightly by temporary vacancy of about 152,000 rentable square feet from leases primarily located in Cambridge and South San Francisco. About 2/3 of this square footage or 100,000 rentable square feet has been leased with occupancy commencing in the third quarter. If we normalize for this temporary vacancy, the second quarter same-property NOI growth would have been 1.6% and 4.2% on a cash basis and closer in line with our outlook for the full year. Now additionally, we also have other contractual rent increases that will begin in the second half of 2020 for leases at properties located in Greater Boston, San Francisco and Seattle that will bring same-property NOI growth on track with our 2020 midpoint guidance of 2% on a GAAP basis and 5.5% on a cash basis. \n Now the second item to highlight that impacted same-property NOI growth for the second quarter was retail and transient parking. Now as a reminder, retail represents only 0.7% of annual rental revenue. Approximately half of our retail is paying rent monthly. About half is not paying rent at the moment, and this drives a slight reduction to both GAAP and cash same-property NOI income growth. \n Now as I wrap up my comments on same property, I just want to reiterate that we are on track for solid same-property and net income -- net operating income growth for 2020. \n Switching briefly to our venture investments. Over the past year or so, we have been taking advantage of the strength of the capital markets. Our cost basis has remained about the same over the past year, really highlighting that we have been strategically monetizing certain holdings. Additionally, over the past year or so, unrealized gains have grown significantly to $556 million as of June 30. Now realized gains have averaged about $15.3 million per quarter over the last 4 quarters and was $17.7 million in the second quarter of 2020. \n Now moving on to external growth. Our team completed approximately 200,000 square feet of leasing related to current and future development and redevelopment projects located in our San Diego market. Our active pipeline of development and redevelopment projects consist of 2.3 million rentable square feet and is 65% leased and negotiating today. We also have important near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects, aggregating an additional 7.6 million rentable square feet. \n Now congratulations again to our team for transforming our balance sheet over the past decade. Our overall corporate credit rating ranks in the top 10% among all publicly traded REITs. We have one of the highest quality tenant rosters that is driving growth and cash flows. We remain committed to our strong and improving credit profile. Liquidity was about $3.7 billion as of June 30 and even higher after consideration of our $1.1 billion forward equity offering that we completed in early July. \n Now our debt maturities are well-laddered with no maturities until 2023. The bond market today is extremely attractive. Long-term fixed-rate debt for Alexandria is in the sub-2% range for 10-year bonds. And then this is really amazing when you compare it to cash yields on our development projects in the 6% to 7% range or higher. \n Concurrent with our common stock offering on July 6, we provided key updates on our sources and uses of capital for 2020. This update reflected continued demand for our well-positioned development and redevelopment projects and our solid outlook for 2020. Our construction spend outlook moved closer to our initial guidance for 2020 and is now $1.35 billion at the midpoint. Additionally, our updated guidance on July 6, that was also reaffirmed yesterday, reflects a strong outlook for acquisition opportunities and builds upon our strong initial outlook that we gave for 2020. Now the midpoint of the range of our acquisition guidance is $1.8 billion. \n On July 6, we also announced our target for real estate dispositions, including partial interest sales at an aggregate midpoint guidance of $1.25 billion. Now more details on this will be provided over the next quarter or so. We updated our 2020 guidance to a range for EPS diluted from $3 to $3.08 and for FFO per share diluted as adjusted from $7.26 to $7.34. Now as usual, please refer to our detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2020 guidance beginning on Page 9 of our supplemental package. \n With that, let me turn it back over to Joel. \nJoel Marcus: Okay. We're ready for questions from the group. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Manny Korchman with Citi. \nEmmanuel Korchman: Dean, if we think about the accelerated disposition program, a couple of questions there. Maybe just if you could help us figure out how you're weighing or thinking about doing dispositions versus even more equity than you've already done. And maybe helpful on that would be to talk about what types of assets or maybe what markets you're thinking about selling those in and also timing of those sales. \nDean Shigenaga: So Manny, let me kick off with a little color. If you look back over probably 5 to 7 years now, we pretty much have been consistent with our sources of capital being from a range of opportunities to blend our long-term cost to capital, and dispositions have been a component going back to 2014, 2015 now. A lot of them have ranged from a partial interest sale, and these are high-valued core assets that we want to retain an ownership in. And so I would say, without getting into a whole lot of details because the deal flow is in process right now, we're looking at opportunities from an outright sale to partial interest sales. These are high-value assets in order to generate some equity capital to reinvest in the business. \n And then, Manny, just touching on the difference between dispositions and equity capital, there obviously are considerations to be taken when you consider both. I think, for us, it's always been a blend of capital. And our cost of equity has been fairly attractive over the time that I was chatting about since 2014, '15. Looking forward -- and our multiple has only improved, which has improved our cost of equity capital. \n I do think though it's still prudent to consider dispositions from time to time. And as a result, our program for 2020, given the needs for our business this year, we felt it was prudent to balance the equity needs with some dispositions. I think as we give some color to that program over the coming quarter or so, it will help bring a little more clarity to what we're focused on here. So I think you'll have to stay tuned for market information and details for at least a quarter. \nEmmanuel Korchman: Right. And maybe just thinking about how tenants, especially the ones that are so involved in searching for the treatment, the cure, the vaccine, whatever it be, how are they thinking about their growth in real estate needs? Is that on the back burner? Or is it just that there's separate teams that are doing one versus the other, and so those are same entities that are looking to lease more space from you or others? \nJoel Marcus: So Steve, you want to maybe fill that? \nStephen A. Richardson: Sure. Manny, it's Steve. Manny, I'd say it's a combination of both. You have existing platforms that the capital markets are very liquid. As Joel was mentioning and Jenna, the strength of the venture and IPO markets, we know of a company that did a virtual road show and went public during this time. So they're using that capital, both for their existing platforms and for any COVID initiatives. In addition to that, we're also seeing manufacturing become a real and viable dimension as well, which is further driving demand. So you've really got 2 elements, the COVID R&D and then the COVID kind of very early manufacturing as well continuing to drive demand. And that is broad-based across a number of markets. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. You could also note, Manny, that there was an announcement yesterday that the U.S. government would loan Eastman Kodak, a company that failed to adopt Jim Collins' notion of change, $765 million as part of a wider attempt to bring pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing back to the United States. So I think you're going to see a lot of activity in the entire supply chain issue when it comes to biopharma. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. \nSheila McGrath: I was wondering if you could give us more insight on the Sorrento Mesa leasing that you mentioned. Did you have a tenant in hand before you purchased 9877 Waples? \nJoel Marcus: We did. And it was -- yes, Sheila. And it was a COVID-related requirement. So the answer is yes. \nSheila McGrath: Okay. And then on the quarter, I was surprised that you had over 1 million square feet of leasing activity. Was that just other activity that's spilled into the quarter? Or were there any new requirements during 2Q? \nJoel Marcus: So Steve, you could give color, but I hope you weren't surprised that we had 1 million square feet. We weren't. We thought it would even be bigger. But anyway, Steve? \nStephen A. Richardson: Yes, Sheila, a couple of things there. Again, it has, as we've talked about for a number of quarters, been broad-based across nearly all markets. As I did highlight, San Diego, in particular, was kind of a standout there. But nevertheless, all markets were contributing. \n No, not necessarily surprising. The impetus for space, the sense of urgency is still there. Literally, 78% were early renewals during this Q2 time period. So we have very, very close long-standing relationships with these tenants. So this was to be expected during this quarter. \nSheila McGrath: Okay. And last question. You did just mention, I think, Steve or Joel, on the manufacturing being a new source of demand. Would Alexandria be interested in owning any of the pharma or vaccine manufacturing facilities? \nJoel Marcus: Well, we already do, and some of them are embedded in assets we own. Some are dedicated manufacturing. Others are pilot manufacturing or other clinical trial, scale manufacturing. It kind of spans the gamut. But yes, we're finding that there is a need, I think, hopefully, that we can bring a bunch of the critical manufacturing and other supply chain needs of biopharma products back from overseas, including China, for our own protection. And yes, we are very interested. And now we wouldn't be interested in a random manufacturing in the middle of nowhere. But if they're in strong submarkets that are tied to core markets, that's a good thing. \nOperator: And our next question will come from James Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nJames Feldman: I wanted to just get your thoughts on the election and even with Prop 13 coming up before we know it. What are you concerned about most if it's a Biden win? And how do you think about the risks? \nJoel Marcus: Yes. I'm not sure I want to comment out about 100 days. I think on the third quarter call, it will be better. We'll have a more triangulated view who Biden's Vice President is. We don't know that yet. It's very important who may be in the cabinet. But to me, it's a worry for everybody because to elect somebody who may not be in the best of health would be a worry there, and that's unfortunate. It's too bad we don't have 2 45- or 50-year-olds running, but that's the way it worked. So I think I'll reserve comment until the third quarter, and we'll have a better view on things. \n The other part of your question, I'm sorry, I forgot. \nJames Feldman: Just you guys are sitting in California, just your thoughts on Prop 13. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. So I don't know, Peter or Steve, you guys want to talk about Prop 13? \nPeter M. Moglia: Yes, sure. This is Peter. I have sat in on some calls with a committee that is running the campaign against it. They feel like there's a better than 50% chance it does not pass, but I'm sure it's tight enough to make everybody a little bit nervous. I think we're in good shape because a number of our assets in California are -- were developed by us in the last few years. So I don't think from a -- and plus we have a triple net lease structure so we would fare better than others. But given the current economy, I don't think it would be good news to help California out of its troubles by making it harder to do business. \nJames Feldman: Okay. That's helpful. And then Peter, you had mentioned the Wall Street Journal article, I just want to get your thoughts. I know that tech is a smaller part of your business, but you do have Facebook, Uber and Stripe on your top tenants list. When you think about the Bay Area specifically, from your vantage point on the ground there, what do you think changes in terms of how people use office space? And especially more among the tech companies, do you think they will be doing more work from home or more flexible work arrangements, which will have a longer-term impact or even satellite offices? I'm just curious what you guys are hearing on the ground. \nPeter M. Moglia: I think Steve can talk to the San Francisco specifics, but I think there's been a lot of talk over whether or not offices is going away or not. I think the consensus is that things are going to work differently that the majority of people, 75% to 90%, depending on the survey you look at, want to go to work. They want to separate their home life from work. I know I personally do because it just becomes very odd to live your life in a constant state of work. But the advantages are becoming more and more apparent. It's very difficult to train people when they work from home. So you're onboarding people on a Zoom. Very difficult to transfer your culture. How do you celebrate a win? How do you commiserate a loss? You're not going to just get on Zoom and say, \"Hey, let's celebrate.\" You're in the office, something great happens. You high-five your colleagues, everybody goes and gets a cup of coffee or whatever and talks about it and just develops a bond. That does not work on Zoom. Same thing when you lose a deal, the debrief, the commiseration. What did we do wrong? How can we do better next time? Ideas, strategies in front of a whiteboard. One of my rare trips into the office recently was to meet somebody so we could get on a whiteboard because we needed a storyboard presentation. And I just couldn't do it on Zoom. \n So I think companies are going to realize that for retaining employees, they're going to have to establish a culture with those employees because otherwise, it just becomes a battle of salary and benefits. If people don't really feel connected to the company, why should they stay there? Somebody else is offering a few more shillings. \n So I think you're going to hear more and more about that. I think we've done really well as a business community in the United States in managing productivity and keeping it going. But I think cracks are starting to appear, and that's what that article kind of goes into. I don't know, Steve, if you want to talk about the tech company. \nStephen A. Richardson: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Jamie, Steve here. Yes, if you look at tech demand from San Francisco down to the peninsula, say, Palo Alto as I referenced, it has fallen by about half. We had a little over 7 million square feet of demand this time last year. Now it's about 3.5 million. I think a lot of that is as a result of exactly what Peter is saying. People are navigating this. In the scheme of things, it's still kind of early innings as to the outcome. So we're certainly monitoring it closely. Having said that, the context is -- SoMa, for instance, now has a 4% vacancy rate versus 1.3% vacancy rate. When you've got big floor plates, kind of lower mid-rise construction in those areas, which is probably more desirable COVID-wise, the peninsula has gone from 7% to 9.9%. So on a relative context, it's still healthy there. \n And then I talked with somebody this morning who had a little bit of insight into Google's stay at home until summer '21. And their understanding, chatting with people at Google is it's really primarily driven by the school year. They were trying to provide certainty to families as the next school year is still highly uncertain. And ultimately, it's voluntary at this point. So we're monitoring it closely. We are getting direct intel. I think it's still kind of early innings, and we'll keep everybody updated as it unfolds. \nJames Feldman: Okay. Thank you, and congratulations on the quarter. \nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Jamie. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. \nAnthony Paolone: On the tech demand side, you mentioned down 50%. Can you talk about whether that has any impact on how you're looking at any of the developments in your pipeline? Was anything dual tracked? Or does it make you change directions on anything that you're planning if that piece of the demand picture pulls back? \nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think, in general, no. \nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then in terms of you are increasing your net investment activity as you look to the back half of the year. But you also talked about just the amount of capital out there that has paid some big numbers for deals, and it just seems anecdotally that there's a lot of folks that certainly like your business right now. I mean how did you think about just increasing the capital deployment, returns? And what have you been seeing in terms of competing to buy product, whether it's land or existing assets in this environment? \nJoel Marcus: It's a pretty broad question. I don't know, maybe try to be more specific, if you could, because I'm not sure we want to get into acquisition pipeline discussions or things like that until we can actually disclose something. \nAnthony Paolone: Yes. I'm just trying to bridge sort of what seems to be more capital being pointed towards your markets and your space, at the same time not driving up activity. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think the 3 sectors, generally, people are seeing today that have been fairly COVID-resistant or resilient is obviously logistics, data centers, life science. There are others, but those have been the primary ones. And so it's natural for people to think about how do I do this. But it's a lot more difficult in a sense because it's not like a company is moving into a generic office. These are fairly mission-critical facilities for companies and entities, and they really don't -- they're pretty picky about locations. They're pretty picky about the details of the improvements in the deliveries and the certifications and things like that and how they're going to operate. So there may be money and so forth. But if people mess up, they won't be given a second chance by tenants. That's for darn sure because when you have millions of dollars of experiments at stake, it's different if you're JPMorgan in an office versus a COVID therapeutics company and something goes wrong. So that's kind of a perspective. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. \nWilliam Catherwood: Following up on Tony's question on acquisitions. Joel, last quarter, you had been maybe a little -- call it a little cagey on the potential for acquisitions to ramp back up, especially with maybe more product coming to market. So my question then, given that, obviously, you acquired a bunch this quarter and there's more to come and you raised guidance. The additional acquisitions, were those primarily ones that you were already looking at prior to COVID? Or were those acquisitions that have come up kind of since COVID? And then the second part to that is, what do you think the opportunity set looks like moving forward? Is there a chance for kind of more assets coming on? Is there any chance for distress out there in the acquisition field? \nJoel Marcus: Well, so first, let me correct the characterization. I don't think I was being cagey. I think, honestly, when we reported the end of April, I think, in the first quarter, think about we had only been shelter-in-place for 45 days. And so when the executive management team looked at our balance sheet, which is in great shape and looked at our prospects, at our pipeline, we wanted to be really careful having lived through '99, 2000, having lived through '08, '09. We wanted to be very careful about really reining back our commitments. And so we did do that in a very, very, I thought, thoughtful and careful way. So I don't think it was caginess at all. It was really one out of concern that we don't know what this thing is. I mean we know what it is, but we don't know what damage it can do, COVID-19. We don't know -- we had no real information from China as to what went on there in places that were hard hit and so forth. It just was a very nontransparent situation. So none of us had any idea what to -- what it was going to happen. So we had to be very conservative about our go-forward game plan. \n But I think as time wore on in the second quarter and it was clear that the industry was really being marshaled to really come up, as Jim had talked about, whether it's testing, the diagnostics side, therapeutic side and importantly, the all-important vaccine side, the government's real ramp up, especially on this Warp Speed project on the vaccine or Warp Speed project. I think it gave us better confidence that we could ease our concerns and go back to a more growth plan, but still, I think, carefully guarded. Now some of the acquisitions -- I mean, acquisitions don't hang on for months and months. So I'm not sure there were a lot that were before that we may be still looking at, and there are processes that go on. But I think from time to time, people see a pretty buoyant real estate market. Peter cited pretty low cap rates on secondary location assets that are pretty strong. So people are thinking of maybe trying to maybe exit or other people are trying to come in. And I think we've just tried to be super thoughtful and super smart and disciplined, most importantly. We learned that from the teachings of Jim Collins about what we do and how we do it. I think the Arsenal that I think Peter, Steve alluded to, campus that we bought last quarter in Watertown is a great example. So I think that's how we have journeyed through this last couple of months. \nWilliam Catherwood: That's completely fair. And I think your -- the conservative classification is much better than the one that I gave. And then you're absolutely right with that. \n Along those lines, Joel, Seattle has obviously been a key area of growth for you guys over the last few years. Most of your portfolio has been focused in the South Lake Union submarket. But this quarter, you disclosed some previous acquisitions in the Pioneer Square submarket, and it looks like you've added a substantial development site outside of your core markets in Seattle as well. So can you kind of speak to the -- your investment strategy in Seattle and maybe what's driving you or what you're seeing in other submarkets that's increasing your interest? \nJoel Marcus: Well, let me say, overall in Seattle, where we have an important presence there. We started back in 1996. So we've been in that market for a long time, and it's an important market for us. It is one of the markets that, thankfully, has taken advantage of the confluence of life science and information technology. We just topped out Adaptive's building on the lake at Eastlake Union 1165. We're building for them and the big -- or a big joint venture with Microsoft focused on COVID-19 issues. \n We have a very small presence in Pioneer Square that we kind of put our toe in the water a couple of years ago. I think the most recent acquisitions are south of that, so they're really not in Pioneer Square. They're more really in the Stadium area, and those are more long-term kind of thinking. But we just want to be careful because Seattle has been one of those hotspots for civil unrest. And some people have attacked, I think, without any real fair balance on -- they've gone after Amazon and Starbucks. Starbucks certainly is one of the most heralded and great companies. Amazon certainly is. But Starbucks, in particular, has done a great job for, I think, people. And so you see some of that stuff that's pretty disconcerting. But we hope that comes under control and that the city and the state really try to really go forward with a very positive game plan. So I think it's a little bit of a wait and see on some of those things. But that was a little bit forward thinking. I'm not sure we would -- those wouldn't be coming to the -- in the development in the near term, for sure. \nOperator: And the next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC. \nRichard Anderson: So I just want to make sure I kind of understand this. When we talk about the vaccine and the duration by which you would be -- it would maintain antibodies and thereby, protect people from the disease. I've heard in spots that it could be maybe 6 months where you'd have to go twice a year to get another kind of booster. Correct me if I'm wrong on that, number one. \n Number two, would that be a good thing from your tenants' perspective or a bad thing? I'm trying to sort of triangulate how permanent the condition COVID-19 will be for the underlying workings of your tenants, if vaccine happens and it's like a measles vaccine, it's good for life. Maybe things go back to normal in that regard. I'm just curious if you can sort of kind of explain that logic to me. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. So I'll have Jenna answer that in a second, but let me just say that each of the 3 most advanced candidate cases that she talked about, each have varying antibody immunity. I think Moderna probably is shown among the best, but no one really knows at this point the duration. But remember, much like everything in life, there will be in -- certainly in the biotech and pharma area, there will be dramatic improvements. I mean there'll be vaccine 2.0, 3.0, 4.0. So I wouldn't get too hung up about 1.0. \n But Jenna, you want to maybe comment on Rich's question? \nJenna Foger: Sure. Rich. So yes, on the booster question, I think the idea is that there likely will need to be booster for some of these vaccine programs. I don't think that, that is necessarily a bad thing. \n I think Joel kind of hit the nail on the head that we really just don't know. The virus has only been known to us for 6 months, 7 months, 8 months. So we really need to learn more. But I think as far as these vaccines, in general, I do think that this will be -- if approved, they will be a revenue stream for these -- our tenants for the foreseeable future. But I also think that the knowledge that has been gained and the approach to vaccine development, in general, that has been gleaned from this experience will be absolutely lasting and so will poise a lot of these companies to develop additional products thereafter. \nRichard Anderson: Great. Great. I kind of asked a version of this last time, but let me ask it again. Have you seen a change in how your tenants are sort of attacking the situation, reallocation of IP or hiring more people? Is there more demand for space because of COVID-19 juxtaposed to their core drug research business that was near and dear than before COVID-19? I'm just curious if this has all created more manpower within your buildings. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think the answer is a simple yes. I think it's an add-on. It's a bolt-on. Some companies, it's dramatic. Other companies, it may not be existent. In other companies, it may be more minor. But the answer is yes. And the amount of money going into this because think about there's testing, all kinds of diagnostics, then you've got the holy grail of therapeutics and vaccines. So -- and then remember, COVID-19 isn't likely to be the last infectious disease agent that we see. I mean I think people worry about -- I mean the big worry would be would somebody try to weaponize these things so you get into a whole government need to prevent -- or to stockpile antibiological agents. So this is a big, big thing that's going to go on for quite a while here. \nRichard Anderson: Okay. And then Peter, last question, you mentioned some of the investment activity happening around your portfolios. Are you seeing any different money come in capital-wise, looking at these life science assets? Or is it pretty much the same players just being more -- perhaps a little bit more aggressive in the space? \nPeter M. Moglia: There's been a pretty large cohort of investors that we've been tracking ever since we started selling assets in '13. I don't think the mix of them has changed much. It's just they're probably a little bit more aggressive today. \nRichard Anderson: Thanks very much. Great quarter. \nJoel Marcus: Thank you very much. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Baird. \nDave Rodgers: Peter, you mentioned earlier that construction timing was really not having a big impact on your yield returns expectations, costs, et cetera, which was great. Maybe take it a step further. Is there anywhere where this kind of work-at-home environment for cities is causing zoning or entitlement issues? And then how do you look at construction costs and the impact on kind of zoning entitlement and construction costs on that next wave of development? Any thoughts on that? \nPeter M. Moglia: Yes. It's funny. It's like 2 things that just offset each other. On the one hand, there's less staff, and we are submitting plans for permits and things, and they're going to people that are working from home. So that would say, \"'Jeez, inefficiency, timing delays.\" But on the other hand, nobody else is developing really much anymore. So the activity is down. So I think that net-net, we're going to be fine as far as getting our permits and things like that. To the extent that something needed to be done, and I hear public hearing or something, it can get a little tricky. But so far, we've been able to get through those hurdles. \nDave Rodgers: On the construction cost side, any early reads on where that might be as you're buying kind of the future jobs? \nPeter M. Moglia: We actually have been analyzing that in detail. I know Dean and I have both been looking at it. It's all theoretical right now that the pace of work could slow down, taking pressure off material and labor costs. I will say we haven't seen it yet, but it would -- it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that at least costs would flatten out. \nDave Rodgers: Fair enough. I think in your release, there was a comment about maybe a project that you guys have written off that you were acquiring that you decided not to acquire. I read it as maybe being incremental to the one you discussed on the last call. But if it's the same, then it doesn't matter. But if it was incremental, any details that have maybe more of an office component or more retail to it that just you couldn't get comfortable with. \nJoel Marcus: I think it was the same thing. We... \nPeter M. Moglia: Yes. It was the same one. \nDave Rodgers: Okay. I wanted to double-check. Dean, moving on to you. I think $29 million of free rent burn-off, you mentioned, coming from leases that have started but not burned off that free rent yet. Is that in the second half of this year? We get that next year? \nDean Shigenaga: It -- I think, for the most part, is being absorbed over about 4 quarters, Dave? Generally, those numbers we update every quarter. And on average, almost all of it is rolling in over 4 quarters. The number is updated the next quarter because some has come in and some deliveries may have occurred. So over time, it's a different mix. But historically, it's generally been burning off over 4 quarters. \nDave Rodgers: Great. And then lastly, Dean, maybe with you again on maybe guidance around the realized gains for the second half. I know it's really what you guys choose to sell. It's how you get there. You've made a lot of money in the business. You gave a really good disclosure about it in the supplement. It's running about -- if you annualize the second quarter, it's about $0.55 a share of earnings. But any thoughts on how that would kind of play out in the second half with the strong market that we've seen so far. Do you anticipate continuing to sell? \nDean Shigenaga: Yes. I think pretty consistent, Dave, with what I've mentioned over the last few quarters. The portfolio has done well. And I think you pointed that out. But the run rate I touched on specifically, it's averaging $15.3 million per quarter, maybe a little bit upward this quarter at $17 million approaching $18 million. So that run rate historically, I think, is a good view for how you should think about the run rate over the next number of quarters. We -- I think it's prudent for us to monetize some of these investments at this point. We've made money. Some of them might -- we believe strongly, and we'll make more money, so we're going to hold a number of them. But I think it's prudent to prune. So you should have a decent run rate looking forward. \nDave Rodgers: Okay. And then I don't know if this last one is maybe for Steve. I'll just throw one more in. I think you have about -- and I might ask something similar to last quarter, but 420,000 square feet of lease is still expiring this year that are negotiating, it looks like, or that may have an unclear resolution yet, another 1.1 million next year. I realize that you have a lot of small leases in there, and it's kind of hard to get visibility far out on those. But in terms of what's yet to be committed, is there anything known to be moving out besides those redevelopment assets? Or are you feeling really good about the remaining renewals? \nStephen A. Richardson: Yes. Dave, it's Steve. Yes, we just got about 3% to resolve back in the second half of the year here. We started at 6.7% so we're already 60%, 70% through that. We've really just got 3 different suites, San Francisco, Boston, San Diego, that are in excess of 70,000 feet. So nothing overly challenging. I think we're making good progress on one of them. Another one, I think we'll be able to reposition successfully. So yes, nothing to be too concerned about there in 2020, for sure. \n And then '21, again, when you look at the early renewals, we've only got 5.7% in rollovers happening in '21. So we'd expect kind of consistent with what we've seen historically with early renewals and just a handful of any size, over 70,000 feet, just a couple there. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. \nMichael Carroll: Peter, can you provide some color on the recent and the pending acquisition? I guess, specifically, there's a fairly large pending bucket, I think, totaling about $780 million. I mean how far along is the company on these negotiations? Have these deals already been awarded to ARE? It's just a timing issue right now? \nPeter M. Moglia: Yes. So let me jump in and say, I think we'd prefer not to comment on those. But just I think Dean mentioned, stay tuned for third quarter. It just can't do it at the moment. \nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then I guess, on some of the assets that you've acquired, obviously, the recent acquisitions, there's a lot of future developable sites. What's the timing typically on these types of properties? And when do you expect to start breaking ground? Is there a plan there? \nPeter M. Moglia: Yes. Everyone is totally different. So if you looked at -- I mean, 2 examples, I mentioned the question on Seattle, that's more into-the-future development site. And if you compare that to, say, the Watertown, that would be maybe more in the near to medium term. So each one is different based on the campus, the location, what's going on, demand, what's going on in that market. So there's no general way to generalize. Each one is highly specific and kind of cultivated. \nStephen A. Richardson: And I can confirm that we know they're going into it. So we put a lot of carry costs into our future basis as we underwrite these things. \nMichael Carroll: Okay. And I think that you did a pretty good job, I think, in the supplement for the -- you talked about the percent of, I guess, covered land plays that you have. Is a lot of these deals that you're looking at now, too, that you're willing to have and maybe a little bit of longer development time you have the covered land place? \nPeter M. Moglia: Yes. Again, each one is different. So let us not characterize anything at the moment. Sorry about that. \nOperator: And our last question today will come from Tayo Okusanya with Mizuho. \nOmotayo Okusanya: Congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit about acquisitions going forward. In the past year or 2, a lot of the acquisitions have kind of focused very heavily on purchasing assets that have a lot of future development potential. Is that the way we should still be thinking about acquisitions going forward? Or do we kind of start to see acquisitions as kind of operating assets going forward? \nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think Mike Carroll just asked that question maybe in a different way. I think every situation is different. So I don't think there's -- we don't want to characterize anything at this point. So I'm not sure it's good to think about one way or another just -- they'll be what they'll be, and they'll stand on their own. And let's just wait for each one to unfold as appropriate. \nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. Just thank you, everybody. Please stay safe and be well, and we'll talk to you on the third quarter call. Thank you again very much. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to Alexandria's second quarter earnings call and our first full quarter done virtually. And as I always do, I want to thank the entire Alexandria family for an outstandingly executed second quarter, really in all respects and by all metrics, as I said, our first full reporting quarter virtually.  \n It was once said -- a couple of notes about change. Everything changes but change. And as I've quoted before, the award-winning visionary author Jim Collins noted, \"To be built to last must be built to change.\" And Stephen Hawking said, \"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.\" So Alexandria is, has always been, I think, resilient and very responsive to a changing environment. We're all blessed compared to many who are struggling during this pandemic, and I want to -- my heart goes out and wish everyone both safety and good health here.  And Dean will talk about this, but entire -- our huge kudos to the entire accounting and finance team on our win of NAREIT's Best Communications Gold Award once again.  \n In our first quarter call in -- or on our first quarter call, I should say, we dialed back our growth in light of the uncertainties of the COVID onslaught in all realms. But now that we've gotten through that quarter and through part of -- gotten through the second quarter certainly and into the third quarter, we have a much clearer, I think, view of the landscape going forward.  \n I want to say a couple of things about corporate responsibility. It's a lot in the press, but we're not new to this. And we've included in our press release the panoply of corporate responsibility initiatives. We've worked on very hard over many, many years many long-standing and impactful activities in our regional communities, our truly positively impactful sustainability initiatives, including, our pioneering zero carbon building in South San Francisco. And more recently, in response to the COVID pandemic, we are, in fact, at the vanguard of the life science industry in advancing the search for solutions to COVID-19.  \n I want to also harken you back to our project OneFifteen with Alphabet, the subsidiary of Alphabet, Verily. 72,000 Americans died last year, hard to imagine half of the number that have died of COVID this year but an enormous number and more than in the entire Vietnam War, of opioid addiction. In 2020, deaths are up 13%, and one could imagine why that may be. Last year, we announced our OneFifteen project in Dayton, Ohio to serve as a unique and complete care model -- comprehensive care model really to attack the opioid crisis in America. Our hope was we would build a model that other communities could copy. We pioneered the design and development of the almost 60,000-square-foot campus, and thank you to the great team that worked on this on about 4 acres, which opened to outpatients in the fall of 2019. This month, we completed OneFifteen Living, the residential housing component of the campus. This facility is the so-called sober living facility for patients suffering from opioid addiction to live while accessing full on-campus treatment that will come over time and really, the first full treatment care facility from detox to job placement.  \n Let me shift gears here for a moment and talk about the life science industry, and then I'm going to have Jenna speak after I finish and talk specifically about the 3 most advanced vaccine projects. As we all know, we're living in truly unprecedented times in history with the onslaught of a pandemic, the resultant recession and civil strife in many of our cities. We've seen a significant uptick, however, in demand this quarter across all of our markets, both from new and existing tenants, and that's given us, I think, good comfort. There's been strong bipartisan government support for life science R&D to solve COVID-19. For example, $10 billion has been committed to Operation Warp Speed, and they brought together some amazingly talented people. Of that amount -- or in addition to that, there's a large number, over $7 billion for CDC, over $6.5 billion to the so-called BARDA group, over $3.6 billion to the NIH and over $160 million to the NIH, all supporting COVID-19 pandemic.  \n So far this year, the FDA has approved 25 new drugs. Last year, they approved 48, so we're on our way to maybe beating of the 2019 number. During the first half of 2020, funds raised by life science companies via IPOs and follow-ons almost matched all of 2019. And this is amazing because this happened despite COVID. Venture capital was strong to the tune of about $9.5 billion and 10% more than 1Q this year. And we're pleased to say 80% of all venture capital funding in 2020 has been in Alexandria's region.  \n So before I turn it over to Jenna, let me make a comment. Life probably won't return to normal until we have a widely distributed COVID-19 vaccine, and the good news is this may happen sooner than expected, thanks to years of private investment and new cooperation between U.S. government and drug companies. This taxpayer money could not have been spent better even if some vaccines may -- candidates may actually end up failing. The potential return from resuming normal life is far greater than from all the transfer payments Congress has spent so far, and we hope that this combination of private innovation with faster regulatory action truly pays off.  \n And with that, let me turn it over to Jenna Foger, our Senior Vice President, who coleads our life science team. Okay. We're ready for questions from the group. So Steve, you want to maybe fill that? Yes. You could also note, Manny, that there was an announcement yesterday that the U.S. government would loan Eastman Kodak, a company that failed to adopt Jim Collins' notion of change, $765 million as part of a wider attempt to bring pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing back to the United States. So I think you're going to see a lot of activity in the entire supply chain issue when it comes to biopharma. We did. And it was -- yes, Sheila. And it was a COVID-related requirement. So the answer is yes. So Steve, you could give color, but I hope you weren't surprised that we had 1 million square feet. We weren't. We thought it would even be bigger. But anyway, Steve? Well, we already do, and some of them are embedded in assets we own. Some are dedicated manufacturing. Others are pilot manufacturing or other clinical trial, scale manufacturing. It kind of spans the gamut. But yes, we're finding that there is a need, I think, hopefully, that we can bring a bunch of the critical manufacturing and other supply chain needs of biopharma products back from overseas, including China, for our own protection. And yes, we are very interested. And now we wouldn't be interested in a random manufacturing in the middle of nowhere. But if they're in strong submarkets that are tied to core markets, that's a good thing. Yes. I'm not sure I want to comment out about 100 days. I think on the third quarter call, it will be better. We'll have a more triangulated view who Biden's Vice President is. We don't know that yet. It's very important who may be in the cabinet. But to me, it's a worry for everybody because to elect somebody who may not be in the best of health would be a worry there, and that's unfortunate. It's too bad we don't have 2 45- or 50-year-olds running, but that's the way it worked. So I think I'll reserve comment until the third quarter, and we'll have a better view on things. \n The other part of your question, I'm sorry, I forgot. Yes. So I don't know, Peter or Steve, you guys want to talk about Prop 13? Thank you, Jamie. Yes. I think, in general, no. It's a pretty broad question. I don't know, maybe try to be more specific, if you could, because I'm not sure we want to get into acquisition pipeline discussions or things like that until we can actually disclose something. Yes. I think the 3 sectors, generally, people are seeing today that have been fairly COVID-resistant or resilient is obviously logistics, data centers, life science. There are others, but those have been the primary ones. And so it's natural for people to think about how do I do this. But it's a lot more difficult in a sense because it's not like a company is moving into a generic office. These are fairly mission-critical facilities for companies and entities, and they really don't -- they're pretty picky about locations. They're pretty picky about the details of the improvements in the deliveries and the certifications and things like that and how they're going to operate. So there may be money and so forth. But if people mess up, they won't be given a second chance by tenants. That's for darn sure because when you have millions of dollars of experiments at stake, it's different if you're JPMorgan in an office versus a COVID therapeutics company and something goes wrong. So that's kind of a perspective. Well, so first, let me correct the characterization. I don't think I was being cagey. I think, honestly, when we reported the end of April, I think, in the first quarter, think about we had only been shelter-in-place for 45 days. And so when the executive management team looked at our balance sheet, which is in great shape and looked at our prospects, at our pipeline, we wanted to be really careful having lived through '99, 2000, having lived through '08, '09. We wanted to be very careful about really reining back our commitments. And so we did do that in a very, very, I thought, thoughtful and careful way. So I don't think it was caginess at all. It was really one out of concern that we don't know what this thing is. I mean we know what it is, but we don't know what damage it can do, COVID-19. We don't know -- we had no real information from China as to what went on there in places that were hard hit and so forth. It just was a very nontransparent situation. So none of us had any idea what to -- what it was going to happen. So we had to be very conservative about our go-forward game plan. \n But I think as time wore on in the second quarter and it was clear that the industry was really being marshaled to really come up, as Jim had talked about, whether it's testing, the diagnostics side, therapeutic side and importantly, the all-important vaccine side, the government's real ramp up, especially on this Warp Speed project on the vaccine or Warp Speed project. I think it gave us better confidence that we could ease our concerns and go back to a more growth plan, but still, I think, carefully guarded. Now some of the acquisitions -- I mean, acquisitions don't hang on for months and months. So I'm not sure there were a lot that were before that we may be still looking at, and there are processes that go on. But I think from time to time, people see a pretty buoyant real estate market. Peter cited pretty low cap rates on secondary location assets that are pretty strong. So people are thinking of maybe trying to maybe exit or other people are trying to come in. And I think we've just tried to be super thoughtful and super smart and disciplined, most importantly. We learned that from the teachings of Jim Collins about what we do and how we do it. I think the Arsenal that I think Peter, Steve alluded to, campus that we bought last quarter in Watertown is a great example. So I think that's how we have journeyed through this last couple of months. Well, let me say, overall in Seattle, where we have an important presence there. We started back in 1996. So we've been in that market for a long time, and it's an important market for us. It is one of the markets that, thankfully, has taken advantage of the confluence of life science and information technology. We just topped out Adaptive's building on the lake at Eastlake Union 1165. We're building for them and the big -- or a big joint venture with Microsoft focused on COVID-19 issues. \n We have a very small presence in Pioneer Square that we kind of put our toe in the water a couple of years ago. I think the most recent acquisitions are south of that, so they're really not in Pioneer Square. They're more really in the Stadium area, and those are more long-term kind of thinking. But we just want to be careful because Seattle has been one of those hotspots for civil unrest. And some people have attacked, I think, without any real fair balance on -- they've gone after Amazon and Starbucks. Starbucks certainly is one of the most heralded and great companies. Amazon certainly is. But Starbucks, in particular, has done a great job for, I think, people. And so you see some of that stuff that's pretty disconcerting. But we hope that comes under control and that the city and the state really try to really go forward with a very positive game plan. So I think it's a little bit of a wait and see on some of those things. But that was a little bit forward thinking. I'm not sure we would -- those wouldn't be coming to the -- in the development in the near term, for sure. Yes. So I'll have Jenna answer that in a second, but let me just say that each of the 3 most advanced candidate cases that she talked about, each have varying antibody immunity. I think Moderna probably is shown among the best, but no one really knows at this point the duration. But remember, much like everything in life, there will be in -- certainly in the biotech and pharma area, there will be dramatic improvements. I mean there'll be vaccine 2.0, 3.0, 4.0. So I wouldn't get too hung up about 1.0. \n But Jenna, you want to maybe comment on Rich's question? Yes. I think the answer is a simple yes. I think it's an add-on. It's a bolt-on. Some companies, it's dramatic. Other companies, it may not be existent. In other companies, it may be more minor. But the answer is yes. And the amount of money going into this because think about there's testing, all kinds of diagnostics, then you've got the holy grail of therapeutics and vaccines. So -- and then remember, COVID-19 isn't likely to be the last infectious disease agent that we see. I mean I think people worry about -- I mean the big worry would be would somebody try to weaponize these things so you get into a whole government need to prevent -- or to stockpile antibiological agents. So this is a big, big thing that's going to go on for quite a while here. Thank you very much. I think it was the same thing. We... Yes. I think Mike Carroll just asked that question maybe in a different way. I think every situation is different. So I don't think there's -- we don't want to characterize anything at this point. So I'm not sure it's good to think about one way or another just -- they'll be what they'll be, and they'll stand on their own. And let's just wait for each one to unfold as appropriate. Yes. Just thank you, everybody. Please stay safe and be well, and we'll talk to you on the third quarter call. Thank you again very much."

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our national essential real estate platform, really combined with our trusted partnerships with some of the most innovative entities in the world, continues to generate high-quality growth in cash flows. 51% of our annual rental revenue is generated from investment grade-rated or large-cap publicly traded companies, really highlighting that our team has curated one of the best tenant rosters in the REIT industry. This high-quality tenant base continues to support growth in our common stock dividends that is currently $1.06 per common share or $4.12 per share on an annual basis and was up 6% over the previous 12-month period. We remain in a great position and continue to benefit from a very strong and flexible balance sheet, the best in the history of the company, really to support our strategic growth initiatives. And more on this in a moment. In June, we published our annual corporate responsibility report, which, along with our supplemental package, highlights our long-standing commitment to ESG, our focus on making a positive and meaningful impact on society and Alexandria's critical role at the forefront of the life science ecosystem, advancing solutions for COVID-19. \n Thank you to our ESG team for an outstanding job over the last year.  \n Before jumping into the second quarter, I also want to share a shout-out with a huge thank you to our entire team for their 5-time recognition as NAREIT's Gold Award winner for Communication and Reporting Excellence. So congratulations, team. \n The second quarter results were solid and in line with our expectations. Rental revenue was up almost 20% over the first half 2019. NOI was up approximately 19% over the first half of '19. And adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 69% and continues to be one of the top within the REIT industry. Rent collections are now over 99.5%. And our outstanding AR balance as of June 30 represents the lowest balance in the last 12 years. Occupancy trends have been positive this year. However, this is hidden by the 2.3% of vacancy from recently acquired leases. Please refer to Page 23 of our supplemental package for details of this acquired vacancy. \n Occupancy as of June 30 was reported at 94.8% and included 2.3% of recently acquired vacancies. So occupancy before this vacancy was 97.1%, actually up 38 basis points since December 31. In addition to this key takeaway, it's important to highlight that recently acquired vacancy will provide growth in cash flows as our team executes on these leasing opportunities. \n Now on internal growth, our operating results continue to benefit from contractual annual rent escalations, averaging almost 3% today. Continued strong same-property NOI growth remains on track with our 2020 midpoint guidance of 5.5% on a cash basis. We also reported continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing of space of 37.2% and 15% on a cash basis for the second quarter. Our rental rate growth has been amazing since 2015 and has averaged 29% and 15% on a cash basis. \n Now while our outlook for 2020 same-property NOI growth remains strong, the second quarter same-property performance was slightly impacted by 2 items. First, the second quarter results was impacted slightly by temporary vacancy of about 152,000 rentable square feet from leases primarily located in Cambridge and South San Francisco. About 2/3 of this square footage or 100,000 rentable square feet has been leased with occupancy commencing in the third quarter. If we normalize for this temporary vacancy, the second quarter same-property NOI growth would have been 1.6% and 4.2% on a cash basis and closer in line with our outlook for the full year. Now additionally, we also have other contractual rent increases that will begin in the second half of 2020 for leases at properties located in Greater Boston, San Francisco and Seattle that will bring same-property NOI growth on track with our 2020 midpoint guidance of 2% on a GAAP basis and 5.5% on a cash basis. \n Now the second item to highlight that impacted same-property NOI growth for the second quarter was retail and transient parking. Now as a reminder, retail represents only 0.7% of annual rental revenue. Approximately half of our retail is paying rent monthly. About half is not paying rent at the moment, and this drives a slight reduction to both GAAP and cash same-property NOI income growth. \n Now as I wrap up my comments on same property, I just want to reiterate that we are on track for solid same-property and net income -- net operating income growth for 2020. \n Switching briefly to our venture investments. Over the past year or so, we have been taking advantage of the strength of the capital markets. Our cost basis has remained about the same over the past year, really highlighting that we have been strategically monetizing certain holdings. Additionally, over the past year or so, unrealized gains have grown significantly to $556 million as of June 30. Now realized gains have averaged about $15.3 million per quarter over the last 4 quarters and was $17.7 million in the second quarter of 2020. \n Now moving on to external growth. Our team completed approximately 200,000 square feet of leasing related to current and future development and redevelopment projects located in our San Diego market. Our active pipeline of development and redevelopment projects consist of 2.3 million rentable square feet and is 65% leased and negotiating today. We also have important near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects, aggregating an additional 7.6 million rentable square feet. \n Now congratulations again to our team for transforming our balance sheet over the past decade. Our overall corporate credit rating ranks in the top 10% among all publicly traded REITs. We have one of the highest quality tenant rosters that is driving growth and cash flows. We remain committed to our strong and improving credit profile. Liquidity was about $3.7 billion as of June 30 and even higher after consideration of our $1.1 billion forward equity offering that we completed in early July. \n Now our debt maturities are well-laddered with no maturities until 2023. The bond market today is extremely attractive. Long-term fixed-rate debt for Alexandria is in the sub-2% range for 10-year bonds. And then this is really amazing when you compare it to cash yields on our development projects in the 6% to 7% range or higher. \n Concurrent with our common stock offering on July 6, we provided key updates on our sources and uses of capital for 2020. This update reflected continued demand for our well-positioned development and redevelopment projects and our solid outlook for 2020. Our construction spend outlook moved closer to our initial guidance for 2020 and is now $1.35 billion at the midpoint. Additionally, our updated guidance on July 6, that was also reaffirmed yesterday, reflects a strong outlook for acquisition opportunities and builds upon our strong initial outlook that we gave for 2020. Now the midpoint of the range of our acquisition guidance is $1.8 billion. \n On July 6, we also announced our target for real estate dispositions, including partial interest sales at an aggregate midpoint guidance of $1.25 billion. Now more details on this will be provided over the next quarter or so. We updated our 2020 guidance to a range for EPS diluted from $3 to $3.08 and for FFO per share diluted as adjusted from $7.26 to $7.34. Now as usual, please refer to our detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2020 guidance beginning on Page 9 of our supplemental package. \n With that, let me turn it back over to Joel. So Manny, let me kick off with a little color. If you look back over probably 5 to 7 years now, we pretty much have been consistent with our sources of capital being from a range of opportunities to blend our long-term cost to capital, and dispositions have been a component going back to 2014, 2015 now. A lot of them have ranged from a partial interest sale, and these are high-valued core assets that we want to retain an ownership in. And so I would say, without getting into a whole lot of details because the deal flow is in process right now, we're looking at opportunities from an outright sale to partial interest sales. These are high-value assets in order to generate some equity capital to reinvest in the business. \n And then, Manny, just touching on the difference between dispositions and equity capital, there obviously are considerations to be taken when you consider both. I think, for us, it's always been a blend of capital. And our cost of equity has been fairly attractive over the time that I was chatting about since 2014, '15. Looking forward -- and our multiple has only improved, which has improved our cost of equity capital. \n I do think though it's still prudent to consider dispositions from time to time. And as a result, our program for 2020, given the needs for our business this year, we felt it was prudent to balance the equity needs with some dispositions. I think as we give some color to that program over the coming quarter or so, it will help bring a little more clarity to what we're focused on here. So I think you'll have to stay tuned for market information and details for at least a quarter. It -- I think, for the most part, is being absorbed over about 4 quarters, Dave? Generally, those numbers we update every quarter. And on average, almost all of it is rolling in over 4 quarters. The number is updated the next quarter because some has come in and some deliveries may have occurred. So over time, it's a different mix. But historically, it's generally been burning off over 4 quarters. Yes. I think pretty consistent, Dave, with what I've mentioned over the last few quarters. The portfolio has done well. And I think you pointed that out. But the run rate I touched on specifically, it's averaging $15.3 million per quarter, maybe a little bit upward this quarter at $17 million approaching $18 million. So that run rate historically, I think, is a good view for how you should think about the run rate over the next number of quarters. We -- I think it's prudent for us to monetize some of these investments at this point. We've made money. Some of them might -- we believe strongly, and we'll make more money, so we're going to hold a number of them. But I think it's prudent to prune. So you should have a decent run rate looking forward."

            "name": "Stephen A. Richardson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenna. Steve Richardson here, everybody. Good afternoon. As we stated during the Q1 earnings call, Alexandria's role as a proven leader in providing mission-critical and indispensable strategic national health infrastructure is only becoming more important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge our country. I'd like to acknowledge with a loud shout-out to our full operations team the stellar work they're undertaking as they've been on the job 24/7, providing exceptional and high-quality service to our tenants at Alexandria's essential services facilities, which have been open and fully operational every day throughout this difficult time. The increasing complexity of construction, delivery and ongoing operations of this mission-critical infrastructure is formidable and not an easy task and requires a highly skilled and talented team that Alexandria has carefully built since its inception. We are pleased to report a healthy, dynamic and positive operations and market reality for the company, and I'll tick through a number of pieces of that.  \n Brand loyalty is evident as Alexandria's tenants garner great value in our delivery of excellence in all operational matters. And as such, the company has collected 99.5% of accounts receivable during the second quarter and 99.3% during July so far, truly a testament to both the quality of the companies we serve and the great work by our operations team.  \n Outperformance. During Q2, we outperformed our Q1 leasing activity with a total of 1,077,000 square feet leased. And as we've noted now the past several quarters, this contribution is coming from all regions, with this quarter's significant leasing statistics highlighted by San Diego's activity. Great kudos to the team there.  \n Strong quarter. The rental rate increases continue to be strong with 15% cash and 37.2% GAAP during Q2. Early renewals year-to-date are consistent at our historic levels of 69%. And during Q2, we exceeded that with a figure of 78%. Mark-to-market is at 15.6% cash and 16.1% GAAP, which is pretty amazing when you consider the large number of new Class A facilities we've delivered during the past few years in core markets. \n Solid occupancy. We were at 94.8% across 28.8 million square feet in the operating portfolio, and taking into account lease-up opportunities at 2 recent key projects in San Diego and South San Francisco, would otherwise be at 97.1%. \n Finally, market health. Alexandria's core clusters have experienced no significant lab subleases coming to market during the pandemic, an important harbinger for Alexandria's ability to continue solid occupancy levels and consistent cash and GAAP rental rate increases for the balance of the year. As an additional data point, the lab demand has remained steady in the San Francisco Bay area with 2.3 million square feet today versus 2.2 million square feet during Q2 2019. A few requirements were, in fact, on pause during Q2, but we are actively touring prospects again. Tech demand, however, is weaker, falling by approximately 50% compared with 1 year ago, and we will be closely monitoring this segment over the coming months. \n In conclusion, the Alexandria team is fully engaged, providing operational excellence and importantly, Alexandria's long-term and historic commitment to the life science industry, as evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of leasing this quarter is with executive management teams we worked with as a trusted partner for many years and in some instances, decades. This is a truly unique and irreplaceable competitive advantage and one we relentlessly pursue in an honorable fashion each and every day. \n With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Sure. Manny, it's Steve. Manny, I'd say it's a combination of both. You have existing platforms that the capital markets are very liquid. As Joel was mentioning and Jenna, the strength of the venture and IPO markets, we know of a company that did a virtual road show and went public during this time. So they're using that capital, both for their existing platforms and for any COVID initiatives. In addition to that, we're also seeing manufacturing become a real and viable dimension as well, which is further driving demand. So you've really got 2 elements, the COVID R&D and then the COVID kind of very early manufacturing as well continuing to drive demand. And that is broad-based across a number of markets. Yes, Sheila, a couple of things there. Again, it has, as we've talked about for a number of quarters, been broad-based across nearly all markets. As I did highlight, San Diego, in particular, was kind of a standout there. But nevertheless, all markets were contributing. \n No, not necessarily surprising. The impetus for space, the sense of urgency is still there. Literally, 78% were early renewals during this Q2 time period. So we have very, very close long-standing relationships with these tenants. So this was to be expected during this quarter. Yes. Thanks, Peter. Jamie, Steve here. Yes, if you look at tech demand from San Francisco down to the peninsula, say, Palo Alto as I referenced, it has fallen by about half. We had a little over 7 million square feet of demand this time last year. Now it's about 3.5 million. I think a lot of that is as a result of exactly what Peter is saying. People are navigating this. In the scheme of things, it's still kind of early innings as to the outcome. So we're certainly monitoring it closely. Having said that, the context is -- SoMa, for instance, now has a 4% vacancy rate versus 1.3% vacancy rate. When you've got big floor plates, kind of lower mid-rise construction in those areas, which is probably more desirable COVID-wise, the peninsula has gone from 7% to 9.9%. So on a relative context, it's still healthy there. \n And then I talked with somebody this morning who had a little bit of insight into Google's stay at home until summer '21. And their understanding, chatting with people at Google is it's really primarily driven by the school year. They were trying to provide certainty to families as the next school year is still highly uncertain. And ultimately, it's voluntary at this point. So we're monitoring it closely. We are getting direct intel. I think it's still kind of early innings, and we'll keep everybody updated as it unfolds. Yes. Dave, it's Steve. Yes, we just got about 3% to resolve back in the second half of the year here. We started at 6.7% so we're already 60%, 70% through that. We've really just got 3 different suites, San Francisco, Boston, San Diego, that are in excess of 70,000 feet. So nothing overly challenging. I think we're making good progress on one of them. Another one, I think we'll be able to reposition successfully. So yes, nothing to be too concerned about there in 2020, for sure. \n And then '21, again, when you look at the early renewals, we've only got 5.7% in rollovers happening in '21. So we'd expect kind of consistent with what we've seen historically with early renewals and just a handful of any size, over 70,000 feet, just a couple there. And I can confirm that we know they're going into it. So we put a lot of carry costs into our future basis as we underwrite these things."

            "name": "Jenna Foger",
            "content": "Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. Against the backdrop of this COVID-19 pandemic that has made an indelible mark on our society, the economy and the future of public health, as Joel noted, life science fundamentals remain strong as the biopharma industry represents the beacon of hope and absolutely essential in the fight against COVID-19. We are currently tracking over 80 tenants across our cluster markets who are advancing solutions for COVID-19, and we owe a tremendous set of gratitude to their heroic work. Clearly, as Joel mentioned, the state manufactured vaccine should help bring about the effective end of the COVID-19 pandemic and as a prerequisite to fully reopen society and restore the global economy. As a reminder, given the global demand for a vaccine, multiple vaccines by multiple company sponsors are absolutely required. As such, researchers around the world are working with unprecedented speed and collaboration on at least 165 distinct coronavirus vaccine programs, of which nearly 30 vaccine candidates are already in human trials. And the cornerstone of the U.S. government's effort to expedite the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, as Joel mentioned, the administration had allocated $10 billion with Operation Warp Speed initiatives and has awarded grants to a handful of company partners, almost all of which are Alexandria tenants, including AstraZeneca, Emergent BioSolutions, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Novavax and Pfizer.  \n Among these efforts, I want to call to your attention -- your attention to the 3 most advanced vaccine programs from Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, each a top tenant for Alexandria in their respective regions. Each of these companies has reported early clinical data that points to initial safety and efficacy. And all 3 companies' vaccine programs have now officially enrolled major late-stage pivotal studies and tens of thousands of patients around the world. Moderna in partnership with NIAID and Pfizer partnered with German biotech, BioNTech, are both developing messenger RNA-based vaccines. These vaccines contain instructions that tell ourselves to effectively build the same spike protein that is found on the coronavirus, which helps the virus invade human cells. Our immune system then make antibodies to latch onto and neutralize the vaccine and do spike proteins, such that when a vaccinated person encounters a virus in the future, those vaccine-stimulated antibodies should prevent the virus from infecting healthy cells.  \n Moderna was, of course, the first U.S.-based company to enter its vaccine into human trials, marking an extraordinary and historic fast-tracking of a vaccine construct into the clinic. To date, Moderna has received just shy of $1 billion from BARDA to expedite the clinical development and manufacturing of its lead vaccine candidate. After reporting positive initial safety and efficacy data from their Phase I and II studies earlier this month, demonstrating that healthy volunteers receiving their vaccines produce significant neutralizing antibodies against the coronavirus as well as downstream T cells implying some degree of lasting immunity, both Moderna and Pfizer began to enroll 30,000-plus patients late-stage Phase II/III studies just this past week. Pfizer stated that they should have efficacy data to report as soon as October, and they've also received a $1.95 billion contract from the U.S. government to help deliver over $1 billion of their vaccine by the end of 2021. \n And finally, AstraZeneca, in partnership with the University of Oxford, uses a slightly different approach to their vaccine development effort using a genetically engineered viral vector to deliver coronavirus genes into cells that similarly encodes the coronavirus' signature spike protein and provoke an immune response. Based on results announced last week, AstraZeneca also shows a relatively safe vaccine with only mild to moderate side effects that successfully engages the human system -- excuse me, that successfully engages the immune system to fight the coronavirus. AstraZeneca has received up to $1.2 billion from the U.S. government to deliver up to 2 billion doses of their vaccine in 2021.  \n So where are we now? Though it is challenging to predict exactly when the vaccine will become widely available, we do expect interim data readouts from each of these 3 pivotal programs and potentially others over the coming few months, which should directionally inform us about the broad safety profile of each vaccine candidate and/or whether each shows continued signs of efficacy. If results are positive, there is, of course, the potential for Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA for any of these vaccine candidates by year-end 2021 and into early -- excuse me, by year-end 2020 and into early 2021. Given that each of these companies is already scaling its manufacturing capabilities to be able to deliver at least 1 billion doses of each vaccine next year, there is a clear path towards the widespread availability of a safe and effective vaccine in the first half of 2021. However, just as it remains unclear how long natural immunity last after a person becomes infected with COVID-19, the durability of a COVID-19 vaccine also remains an open question. Also yet to be determined are the anticipated frequency and cadence at which we will need to get vaccinated, which segment of the population may respond better or worse to the vaccine and what proportion of the population needs to get vaccinated to ultimately drive herd immunity and eradicate COVID-19 altogether. \n But in the meantime, new antibody therapies by companies such as tenants Eli Lilly and Bayer Biotechnology and others could serve as a bridge to a vaccine and help reduce the severity of COVID-19 in infected patients. There are an additional 300-plus new and repurposed therapies in clinical development and in parallel with increased widespread testing and continued socially responsible behavior, we're hopeful that this virus will become more manageable and less fatal overall. Needless to say, we look forward to continuing to support the mission-critical work of our tenants to overcome this global pandemic within the coming year.  \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Sure. Rich. So yes, on the booster question, I think the idea is that there likely will need to be booster for some of these vaccine programs. I don't think that, that is necessarily a bad thing. \n I think Joel kind of hit the nail on the head that we really just don't know. The virus has only been known to us for 6 months, 7 months, 8 months. So we really need to learn more. But I think as far as these vaccines, in general, I do think that this will be -- if approved, they will be a revenue stream for these -- our tenants for the foreseeable future. But I also think that the knowledge that has been gained and the approach to vaccine development, in general, that has been gleaned from this experience will be absolutely lasting and so will poise a lot of these companies to develop additional products thereafter."

            "name": "Peter M. Moglia",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. This is Peter Moglia. I'm going to briefly update you on all of our development pipeline activity, acquisitions closed in the second quarter and touch on some capital markets activity. \n So coming into 2020, we had 11 development/redevelopment projects, and we added 2 this quarter, including the second phase of our 5 Laboratory Drive project in the Research Triangle and 9877 Waples in the San Diego submarket of Sorrento Mesa, which is 100% pre-leased. These development projects are spread among a number of regions and give us a great mix of Alexandria-branded projects to meet the growing demand in all of our regions. Whenever possible, tenants want to locate their mission-critical operations in our high-quality and expertly managed assets. \n Although we achieved 196,000 square feet of leasing in our development pipeline during the COVID-impacted quarter, the leasing percentage remained 61% as the new leasing was offset by the additional project we added in the Triangle and a positive development at our Arsenal on the Charles project, where we were able to take back a poor performing leased retail space that will be converted to high-value lab office space. Our redevelopment of Arsenal on the Charles of that project has met our high expectations for it. To date, we have signed 3 LOIs for approximately 144,000 square feet. And remember, we only closed on this asset in mid-December, and we have a number of prospects for more. Tenants really like this location and our development plans for it. \n Despite the continuing overhang of COVID-19, we had an uptick in activity at many of our development/redevelopment projects. In Long Island City, we are in serious negotiations with groups representing 86,000 square feet of demand. At the Alexandria District in San Carlos, we have solid interest from a number of companies aggregating in excess of 200,000 square feet of demand. And up at 101 and 201 Haskins, we're working with 6 companies for space ranging from 20,000 square feet to 100,000 square feet. But COVID-19 is causing some companies to move deliberately. \n Last quarter, we mentioned that our 7 -- of our 7 projects experiencing -- or 7 of our projects experienced temporary pause in construction, and we're pleased to report that all of them are going forward with no current delays. We reported that we expected about a 1 quarter delay on average for those projects and did not anticipate any material movement in yields. That assessment has been confirmed in our 2Q numbers and is due to the remarkable job of our highly experienced real estate development teams that have done an amazing job managing the impact of delays and other COVID-19-related costs, which include the impact of social distancing, which has reduced our construction efficiency, added costs for safety measures such as the procurement of PPE, a dedicated COVID-19 Safety Officer required in many locations and added security. \n In addition to the contribution by our highly skilled seasoned team, the minor impact of our yields can also be credited to our highly disciplined underwriting, starting at the acquisition of these opportunities through the development and leasing phases. In the second quarter, we closed on 987-1075 Commercial Street project we discussed last quarter. And we added a prime parcel in the UTC submarket of San Diego across from our 9363 and 9393 Towne Centre Drive project that will be developed into a Class A 200,000 square foot lab office project with the potential of making it larger through an upzoning process. \n As far as sales activity goes, last quarter, we discussed the strong interest in lab office assets from a diverse set of investors, mentioning Healthpeak's purchase of The Post and Waltham at a 5.1% cap rate and a healthy price per square foot for a suburban asset of $751. We have since learned that Healthpeak has also paid a significant price for the 224,000 square foot 35 Cambridge Park Drive asset in Alewife for a reported $1,484 per square foot at a 4.8% cap rate. \n We also mentioned last quarter that a reliable source had disclosed that a transaction in the Boston area had gone under contract while in shutdown, and we can confirm that sale occurred. 27 Drydock, a 286,000 square foot lab office project in the Seaport area of Boston, was acquired by Beacon Capital Partners at an estimated cap rate of 4.8% and a price per foot of $916. This pricing was somewhat surprising as the asset is subject to a very onerous lessor-favored ground lease. \n It's really a good time to be in the market with assets in life science submarkets. We will continue to maintain our highly disciplined approach to underwriting, and we're going to keep you informed of our opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions over the coming quarters. \n So before I pass the baton, I would -- or we would like to encourage everyone to read Chip Cutter's article that appeared in Friday's Wall Street Journal titled Companies Start to Rethink Remote Work Isn't So Great After All as an alternative to all the press speculating that the office market is headed for the crypt. Laboratory office is not part of the work-from-home trend, but nonetheless, we believe traditional office product is not going anywhere. There will likely be some shifts in use such as workers not coming in every day and a reverse of the densification trend that permeated over the last decade. But there are a lot of reasons to have people physically together, and this article goes into some of them. \n So with that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Yes, sure. This is Peter. I have sat in on some calls with a committee that is running the campaign against it. They feel like there's a better than 50% chance it does not pass, but I'm sure it's tight enough to make everybody a little bit nervous. I think we're in good shape because a number of our assets in California are -- were developed by us in the last few years. So I don't think from a -- and plus we have a triple net lease structure so we would fare better than others. But given the current economy, I don't think it would be good news to help California out of its troubles by making it harder to do business. I think Steve can talk to the San Francisco specifics, but I think there's been a lot of talk over whether or not offices is going away or not. I think the consensus is that things are going to work differently that the majority of people, 75% to 90%, depending on the survey you look at, want to go to work. They want to separate their home life from work. I know I personally do because it just becomes very odd to live your life in a constant state of work. But the advantages are becoming more and more apparent. It's very difficult to train people when they work from home. So you're onboarding people on a Zoom. Very difficult to transfer your culture. How do you celebrate a win? How do you commiserate a loss? You're not going to just get on Zoom and say, \"Hey, let's celebrate.\" You're in the office, something great happens. You high-five your colleagues, everybody goes and gets a cup of coffee or whatever and talks about it and just develops a bond. That does not work on Zoom. Same thing when you lose a deal, the debrief, the commiseration. What did we do wrong? How can we do better next time? Ideas, strategies in front of a whiteboard. One of my rare trips into the office recently was to meet somebody so we could get on a whiteboard because we needed a storyboard presentation. And I just couldn't do it on Zoom. \n So I think companies are going to realize that for retaining employees, they're going to have to establish a culture with those employees because otherwise, it just becomes a battle of salary and benefits. If people don't really feel connected to the company, why should they stay there? Somebody else is offering a few more shillings. \n So I think you're going to hear more and more about that. I think we've done really well as a business community in the United States in managing productivity and keeping it going. But I think cracks are starting to appear, and that's what that article kind of goes into. I don't know, Steve, if you want to talk about the tech company. There's been a pretty large cohort of investors that we've been tracking ever since we started selling assets in '13. I don't think the mix of them has changed much. It's just they're probably a little bit more aggressive today. Yes. It's funny. It's like 2 things that just offset each other. On the one hand, there's less staff, and we are submitting plans for permits and things, and they're going to people that are working from home. So that would say, \"'Jeez, inefficiency, timing delays.\" But on the other hand, nobody else is developing really much anymore. So the activity is down. So I think that net-net, we're going to be fine as far as getting our permits and things like that. To the extent that something needed to be done, and I hear public hearing or something, it can get a little tricky. But so far, we've been able to get through those hurdles. We actually have been analyzing that in detail. I know Dean and I have both been looking at it. It's all theoretical right now that the pace of work could slow down, taking pressure off material and labor costs. I will say we haven't seen it yet, but it would -- it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that at least costs would flatten out. Yes. It was the same one. Yes. So let me jump in and say, I think we'd prefer not to comment on those. But just I think Dean mentioned, stay tuned for third quarter. It just can't do it at the moment. Yes. Everyone is totally different. So if you looked at -- I mean, 2 examples, I mentioned the question on Seattle, that's more into-the-future development site. And if you compare that to, say, the Watertown, that would be maybe more in the near to medium term. So each one is different based on the campus, the location, what's going on, demand, what's going on in that market. So there's no general way to generalize. Each one is highly specific and kind of cultivated. Yes. Again, each one is different. So let us not characterize anything at the moment. Sorry about that."

And with me today, virtually, I think, our first virtual quarterly call. In order presentation is Jenna Foger, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. And we're pleased to present the first quarter earnings call. This will forever be known as the COVID-19 quarter for all public reporting companies. And as I always do, I want to thank our entire team for a truly stellar operationally excellent first quarter 2020 under extraordinary lead difficult COVID-19 circumstances. Our current and go-forward operating and financial status is excellent. On the fourth quarter and 2019 year-end earnings call on February 4, I commented on the novel coronavirus global health emergency and what Alexandria and our client tenants, we're already working on astoundingly, it was not until March 11, 2020, that the World Health organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 virus is a tiny 120-nanometer particle, roughly the wavelength of ultraviolet light that has rippled and replicated across the globe with very ultra violence. And more than 3 million cases worldwide to date.Tiny things have immense impact, especially when everything and everyone is so interconnected and vulnerable. And some have kind of dubbed this China's chernobyl. In a few minutes, I'll ask Jenna to update you on the COVID-19 fight regarding testing therapeutics and vaccines, which is moving forward in a rapid pace literally every day. We had Alexandria laser-focused and enormously proud of our collective accomplishments during this very challenging first quarter, which none of us will ever forget.Our team's tireless and truly outstanding performance really by all metrics, and we are staying lean, mean and laser-focused on our mission with no ego. Our teams acquired and delivered over 35,000 individual pieces of PPE, mostly N95 masks and delivered those to hospitals in 6 cities, New York City, Boston, Seattle were our top priorities. We also delivered them to Dayton, San Diego and LA Hospitals. We consider this to be a truly great execution of our corporate responsibility.Alexandria is among the industry leaders in total shareholder return. Alexandria has best-in-class tenants. Alexandria has best-in-class assets and a powerful and inspiring cluster market presence design and place-making really second to another. We have world-class trusted relationships. And importantly, our fortress balance sheet gives us great flexibility and optionality going forward.We, in the life science industry are at the forefront of this multifaceted fight against COVID-19, while still innovating each and every day novel technologies and new products to also treat cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological and other serious, serious diseases. While most REITs compare their business today, the COVID-19 in the COVID-19 pandemic to the great financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. I think for us, we like to look at 4 years after that time really in 2013. This industry and its innovation really catapulted its capabilities and impact starting in 2013, which really was the start of the great bull run of this industry. And as we sit here today, the life science industry is really the true solution to winning the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. A return to the days when Merck and is then CEO, Ray Vagelos, were the most admired company and the most admired CEO in America.The first quarter of 2020 set an all-time record quarterly high of $8.1 billion invested in venture-backed life science companies, a very high level and accelerated pace, over 80 of biopharma R&D collaborations took place in the first quarter, including the blockbuster, $483 million Moderna and BARDA government funding to -- and Moderna being 1 of our important tenants to advance and scale clinical testing and the manufacturer for a novel COVID-19 vaccine really the key to the solution here.Biopharma continues to outperform the broad market in the first quarter amidst the COVID-19 reality. While most industries are adversely affected by acute changes in consumer demand, this is not the case for biopharma. As the need for new medicines is fundamental to our human condition. This discrepancy is one of the reasons why biopharma outperformed other sectors during the great financial crisis and the tech bubble crash of 2001. NIH funding support remains very strong with a 7% budget increase for fiscal 2020, up to $41.7 billion, a very favorable regulatory environment continues with the FDA, especially in light of COVID-19 and 11 new product approvals were achieved in the first quarter.Medical research philanthropy has also hit an all-time high as well. How I think it's fair to say that the much like flying was before and after 911, things will never again be quite the same as they were pre-COVID-19 and the international pandemic. How quickly we return to what will be a new normal, depends on how we solve the public health situation, restore public confidence and safety. Jim Collins, the famous business author and writer. Research clearly evidences to be built to last, you have to be built to change. And more importantly, in Jim's introduction to his book built to last states, the real focus is it is really about building something that is worthy of lasting. It's about building a company of such intrinsic excellence that the world would lose something important if that organization cease to exist.Jim Collins further stated, we are more convinced than ever that building an enduring great company, 1 that is truly worthy of lasting is a noble cause. And our mission at Alexandria is now more important than ever, and we are in the fight each and every day. Making a tangible and positive impact. And we're great -- we were really graced by Jim Collins on the cover of our 2016 annual report, where he indicated Alexandria has achieved the 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And with that, let me turn it over to Jenna Foger.\nJenna Foger: Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. Against that backdrop and the backdrop of the unprecedented economic, public health and social impact of this global coronavirus pandemic. As Joel elegantly described, life science fundamentals remain strong as the biopharma industry represents the beacon of hope in the fight against COVID-19. Effective diagnostics, therapies and vaccines are absolutely mission-critical to solving this crisis, and we truly owe a debt of gratitude to the heroic work being spearheaded by so many of our tenants to help test for, treat and prevent COVID-19. The countless efforts we are tracking, not to mention the many philanthropic initiatives across our cluster campus communities, providing medical supplies and protective equipment to neighboring hospitals is profound and inspiring. We are currently tracking over 60 tenants across our cluster markets with publicly disclosed COVID-19 programs with dozens of intercompany and public-private collaborations transpiring across our portfolio.Our tenants position at the forefront of fighting COVID-19 reflects the strength, quality and fortitude of our tenant base. As you all know, we take tremendous pride in the tenants we attract, each of which is strategically underwritten by our science and technology team, which I have a profound honor of being a part of alongside 20 of our colleagues with deep background in science and business. So I would like to briefly highlight the mission-critical work of our tenant companies across 3 major categories: one, improving testing, quality and capacity, 2, advancing new and repurposed treatments; and three, developing preventative vaccines. So in the area of improving test and quality and capacity, tenant companies, including Abbott labs, LabCorp, Roche, Quest Diagnostics, Thermo Fisher, UCSS color genomics and several others are working to enhance the quality and capacity for rapid and accessible testing to determine who actively has the virus, who has been exposed and who has developed immunity against it. The availability of widespread screening and serological testing of this nature will be instrumental for track and trace initiatives and, of course, the safe and healthy reopening of society and return to work.In terms of therapies and vaccines, over 180 potential drug treatments and vaccines are being studied in more than 250 clinical trials around the world, with well over 100 preclinical stage programs in development. As you can imagine a substantial number of these programs are sponsored by our tenants. Headlining efforts among them include Gilead sciences Remdesivir, which is in late-stage studies for the treatment of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, which, if positive, will likely form the basis for the first FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19.Tenant company Adaptive Biotechnologies is partnered with Amgen to identify and develop therapies from the blood of sick or recently recovered COVID-19 patients. Other tenant biotechnology has announced partnerships with fellow tenants, Alnylam, Biogen, GSK and others to develop new and existing antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventative options to come back to COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Several other tenants, including AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Fiber and Novartis are similarly endeavoring to develop novel therapies and repurpose existing drugs to provide near-term treatments for moderate and severe COVID-19 patients and those at highest risk.And lastly, vaccines. So clearly, a prophylactic vaccine represents the effective end of this global COVID-19 pandemic. Our tenants Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases NIAD partnered as Moderna's mRNA-based vaccine into the clinic last month. Subsequently, as Joel mentioned, BARDA committed up to $483 million to support the clinical development and manufacturing scale-up of Moderna's vaccine candidate. To help expedite FDA approval over the next 9 to 12 months an unprecedented pace for the sort of activity and facilitate the supply of tens of millions of doses of that vaccine for a month thereafter.Other tenants, including Johnson & Johnson, Medicago, Novavax, Fiber, PS, Sanofi, are leveraging their vaccine development expertise and technology platforms with the goal of expediting the delivery of a safe and effective vaccine to the public in 2021. These noble and expedient efforts across our tenant base are in large part to the fact that as the new coronavirus made itself known to the world, these companies were already well equipped with the R&D infrastructure, resources and talent in place such that they were able to mobilize at nearly a moment's notice to combat this unprecedented global health emergency.And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Richardson: Thank you, Jenna. Good afternoon, everyone. Steve here. We've discussed the mission-critical nature of our laboratory office facilities since our inception 26 years ago. It is clear now more than ever that Alexandria is the proven leader in providing mission-critical an indispensable strategic national health infrastructure in these unique facilities. As Joel and Jenna outlined earlier, we have 60 companies directly engaged in the fight against COVID-19. Our unique platform is leading to healthy activity at Alexandria's Class A laboratory facilities. During Q1, we leased 700,000 rentable square feet at very strong rental rate increases. Actually, the highest during the past 10 years with 22.3% on a cash basis and 46.3% on a GAAP basis, led by a large lease in our flagship Tech Square campus in Cambridge. Our mark-to-market continues to be strong at 15.8% GAAP and 14.3% cash.Lab supply constraints continue with nearly 0 lab subleases coming to market since the inception of the pandemic and continued strong occupancy at 97.5% in our campuses when excluding the vacancy of the recently acquired campuses in San Diego and South San Francisco that will provide future growth opportunities. Executed leases now for the month of April are on pace with Q1 leasing velocity. And important to note that we do have ongoing demand in the form of serious interest and negotiations with tenants on renewals and expansions and our new ground-up developments and redevelopment projects. It's also important to highlight that Alexandria has long been a pioneer, an early adopter in the discipline of designing and constructing state-of-the-art healthy facilities. We currently have 39 total fit well and we well health certification initiatives with 12 projects completed and another 27 projects underway. One of these facilities in Cambridge, in fact, received the highest score fit well ever awarded. Our mission-critical facilities already feature many state of the art mechanical and filtration attributes and are easily adaptable as may be needed going forward guided by our skilled operational teams who are well versed in the types of measures needed to deliver enhanced environments.Finally, Alexandria is fully prepared and well positioned at all strategic and operational levels to protect the inherent value of our unique Class A facilities and continue to grow as a trusted partner to the life science industry to beat this pandemic.With that, I'll hand it off to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thank you, Steve. I'm going to quickly update you all on our development pipeline. Acquisitions closed in 1Q and touch on some capital markets activity. Coming into 2010, we have 11 development and redevelopment projects in our pipeline that are 61% leased, with another 7% under negotiation. One of the many things that we like about our pipeline is that it is spread among 6 markets and 9 submarkets, which really shows that the ecosystems we've built in all of our clusters are contributing to our growth and our story is not just about any particular region. Despite the shelter in place orders, reducing our ability to tour potential tenants, there is good activity on partially leased assets that are progressing at various levels from initial online presentations to paper being traded. As Steve mentioned, we are still seeing healthy activity in our markets. And these leasing percentages should accelerate given the pent-up demand and the new COVID-19 related requirements.As you may have noted, by looking on Page 38 of the supplemental, 7 projects have had a temporary pause in construction, but 3 of them have restarted as they've been deemed essential. Delays related to shelter in place orders or I'll refer to as SIP, are not day for day. They are likely between day for day and 2 days per day of delay, depending on how long it takes to remobilized the subcontractors back on-site and where we were in the staging of the work. We do not anticipate any material supply chain issues. The amount of delay is really going to depend upon the subcontractor labor and what other work they are performing elsewhere. In general, we anticipate about 1/4 delay on average for those projects that are in temporary work stoppages due to SIP orders and assuming construction recommences upon lifting of the current orders, and they are not further extended. We do anticipate or we do not anticipate any material movement in yields at this time due to these delays. In the -- touching on acquisitions, in the first quarter, we closed on 2 projects, we discussed on last quarter's call, 275 grove in the Route 128 corridor and the JV with Boston properties in South San Francisco.In addition to those, we closed on 9808 and 9868 Scranton Road in Sereno Mesa. And 3330 and 3412 Hill view in the Stanford Research Park. The Scranton Road assets total 220,000 square feet and are located directly across the street from and will be incorporated into our SD tech campus. They are currently 88% leased with the predominant tenants being investment-grade companies. The assets present us the opportunity to achieve a strong 6.8% stabilized cash yield by leasing the vacant space and future value creation opportunities as they are convertible to lab. A 50% interest in these assets was subsequently sold into a joint venture, and we received $51.1 million from net asset sale.As mentioned, in addition, we closed on 3330 and 3412 Hillview in the Stanford Research Park for $105 million. These 2 high-quality Class A office properties total approximately 106,000 square feet and are fully leased to credit tenants. The rents are considerably under market and offer near-term value creation in an irreplaceable location. The buildings are also convertible to lab offering us long-term optionality and further value creation opportunities down the road.Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed on 975 to 1075 Commercial Street and 915 to 1063 old County Road, a 12.7 acre site that is the fourth and final piece of our 25 Acre assemblage branded as the Alexandria district in St. Carlos. This campus is in close proximity to the Caltrain station and will reach 2 million square feet upon full development. First phase of a little over 500,000 square feet is currently under construction and has been well received as the only purpose-built Class A lab campus in the Greater Stanford cluster illustrated by it being 56% pre-leased with another 9% under negotiation.I'll wrap up by mentioning that conversations with a number of brokers indicate that there is still strong interest in lab office assets from a diverse set of investors. To that end, the post 426,000 square foot campus in Waltham in Massachusetts closed on April 2 at a 5.1% cap rate, the lowest suburban cap rate we know of. And a reliable source has told us another life science transaction in the Boston area has gone under contract while in the shutdown. With a positive light shining on the industry, it is not surprising that demand for our product type remains robust.And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm just going to quickly rattle through my commentary, kicking off with really outstanding results for the first quarter. Revenues were up 22.6% over the first quarter of '19. NOI was up 22.9% as well over the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 68%. Contractual and annual rent escalations average almost 3% today. Our value creation pipeline is 61% leased and will generate significant revenue and cash flows, and I'll come back to this topic in a moment. We also have about $37 million of annual cash net operating income that will commence as free rent burns off primarily over the next 4 quarters. Related to recently placed into service development and redevelopment projects. Same-property NOI growth was very solid at 2.4% and 6.1% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth, as you heard from Steve earlier, on lease renewals and releasing the space was very strong, up 46% and 22% on a cash basis. And our properties are open and operating today and through this environment. Our business is not absolutely immune from this unusual and unprecedented environment. But is doing very well on a relative basis. The NASDAQ biotech index, as some of you may have noted, was up 5.8% year-to-date as of yesterday. And our stock has outperformed on a relative basis, roughly down about 7% year-to-date, again through as of yesterday.Our team is working diligently on our annual corporate responsibility report, which we expect to issue around mid year. Now as Joel had highlighted, our balance sheet really remains in the best shape in the history of the company. We had about $4 billion of liquidity. We have an excellent maturity profile with no debt maturities until 2023. And the top we rank roughly in the top 10% on a relative ranking with our credit profile when compared to all publicly traded REITs. We have a real high-quality tenant roster, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, these are just some of the best statistics in the REIT industry today. And we remain committed to our strong and improving credit profile. Our dividend is well covered with an FFO payout ratio just under 60% today. This strategically allows us to use a portion of our cash flows from operating activities after dividends, which is just above $200 million today. For investment into our value creation ground-up development projects.Now briefly on rent deferrals and an update on rent collections, we've only received a handful of requests for rent deferrals, which is primarily on the retail side of our tenancy. And we've really taken these requests 1 by one, and we'll review each review these each 1 month at a time. The total rent deferrals were in the low $600,000 range for the month of April. Now we're very proud of our research and property management teams for really building an outstanding and high-quality tenant roster and for really taking care of these long-term relationships. We've collected 98.4% of our April rent and expense recoveries, which is just outstanding.Our AR balance as of Friday, April 24, was $7.3 million, representing the lowest balance since 2012. And our team has successfully decreased our AR balance, both when we look back to the depth of the great financial crisis. So our goal was clear from the beginning of April that we would continue to make this a priority each month. We're feeling really good now that we're at the end of April. We've collected almost all of our account receivable balances our business is doing really well, again, relative to other REITs. However, this is an unprecedented environment, and we have forecasted a relatively minor impact to our outlook for the last 3 quarters of 2020. We're forecasting about an $0.08 or 1% reduction in FFO per share as adjusted at the midpoint of the range of our guidance. And this is really related to a very limited retail tenancy that we have as well as transient and short-term parking of the $0.08, 60% of this is related to retail, and the remainder is primarily related to transient and short-term parking. To put this into perspective, this $0.08 is roughly 60 to 70 basis points of our annual rental revenue, and we believe this will only be about a 50 basis point decline to our year end occupancy.As of March 31, our annual rental revenue from retail was about $10.4 million. We recognized an allowance of about $3.8 million related to NOI for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2020, and most of the impact to retail revenue will really occur in the second quarter since GAAP requires cash basis revenue recognition related to these leases that now have specific allowances or reserves. And our retail-related occupancy declines, which we expect to be very minor, may not occur right away since these leases are still in effect today. And keep in mind, retail is a very minor part of our operating results, but we hope these details are useful.Parking income for ARE is primarily from urban or CBD markets. And these markets have very limited parking to service tenants and daily parking needs. For example, Juno Therapeutics in Seattle has about 600 employees, but they only have parking for about 50% of that employee base. So these really dense urban CBD submarkets generally have lower risk of a major decline in parking income due to the very limited supply of spaces in the markets.Our outlook for same-property performance for 2020 remains very strong, down only about 50 basis points. The $0.08 of FFO per share related to retail and parking revenue. Translates to about 60 to 70 basis points of same-property results. And this was offset by our same-property results in our forecast running at the upper end of the range prior to this guidance adjustment.Now turning to real estate impairments. We spent quite a bit of time analyzing options for 1 of our unconsolidated retail joint ventures. To put this into perspective, this deal came together back in 2015 as we were looking for opportunities to monetize certain assets, including this land parcel, now in this case, we found an opportunity to contribute our land into a joint venture with a local retail developer in Maryland. And this project was really doing well on its way to solid, stabilized NOI, until COVID-19 arrived and almost every tenant was required to comply with executive orders and close their business. Now we concluded that we're not going to recover our bases and wrote off our investment of approximately $7.6 million.Turning to our venture investment portfolio. The portfolio has done really well to date. For example, our venture investments aggregate about $1.1 billion. But this includes unrealized gains of $384 million. During the first quarter, we did recognize impairments aggregating about $19.8 million, primarily related to 3 privately held investments. One is focused on Parkinson's and ALS, another in the dermatology area. And the third is a smart glass technology-related company. Now each of these companies really have great innovation and technology. However, we do not expect to recover our entire investment.On the positive note, realized gains for the first quarter were $15.1 million. Recent quarterly gains were put on -- for 2020 really are on track to exceed the $50.3 million in realized gains recognized in 2019.Turning to our value creation pipeline. We're uniquely positioned with flexibility to be prudent during this unprecedented time, while we're also very well positioned to address future demand. Now construction has been impacted in urban markets with more of our suburban markets having limited to no impact. COVID-19 and other projects continue while following appropriate guidelines.Now we felt it was prudent to significantly reduce our 2020 capital plan with a reduction of $640 million in construction spend and $300 million of acquisitions, both at the midpoint of our guidance. Now our remaining construction spend for 2020 is now primarily focused on construction that is committed to tenants. Importantly, though, we remain uniquely positioned for opportunities on a project-by-project basis to meet the demand for our well-located pipeline of future ground-up development projects. Now we updated our 2020 guidance to a range for EPS dilutive from $1.69 to $1.79 and for FFO per share diluted as adjusted from $7.25 to $7.35, as usual, please refer to the detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2020 guidance, beginning on Page 9 of our supplemental package.Let me pause there and turn it back to Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Operator, let's open it up for Q&A, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore ISI.\nSheila McGrath: Joel, I was wondering if you could talk big picture, your thoughts on research funding for life science tenants in the race for the cure, do you think the laser focus will have some positive outcome for R&D funding for your tenants? And you also mentioned 60 tenants working on COVID responses. Are they dominated in any 1 or 2 single markets or across the portfolio?\nJoel Marcus: Sheila, welcome to the call. So the -- I talked about NIH being up 7% this year, who knows where Congress may decide to additionally, focus there was $25 billion in the recent care bill this, I think, the second addition focused on testing. In fact, I was on a call the other day, where there's going to be some rollout of some pretty amazing novel testing. So a lot of money is going into that sector. In fact, it may be that the nasal swab will actually be old technology at some point, and people will be using there's some research out of practical research out of Rutgers and Yale, indicating that you can actually find virus in spit. And if you could imagine, you could do that simply on a daily basis. And be alerted on your smartphone that you aren't able to go to work, that would be a pretty unique solution. So we see a fair amount of money, both from pharma, from Bio, from the venture side, obviously, from philanthropy and from the government. I think the BARDA deal that I mentioned and Jenna mentioned almost $500 million to try to ramp up testing and the vaccine with Moderna is 1 example of, I think, extraordinary focus in this area. So I think it's broad-based and really across multiple regions.\nSheila McGrath: Okay. Great. And then on leasing spreads for the quarter, I think Steve mentioned they're the strongest in 10 years. I was wondering if you could give us more detail on the mix of the increases geographically? And if there was any 1 lease that was well below market that might have impacted the numbers?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, I'll have Steve comment. It was somewhat broad-based. One of the important leases was a renewal in Tech Square. I don't want to get into the details of that, but that was certainly an important part of driving. But Steve, any further comments?\nStephen Richardson: Sheila, it's Steve. No, that's exactly right. We do have, as we said, mark-to-market strong across most of the regions, and it is typically broad-based for this particular quarter, we did have that 1 lease at Tech square that was a particular driver. But in general, we do have nice mark-to-market opportunities.\nSheila McGrath: Last question. On the North Tower, your 10-Q mentioned that, that project would be postponed. I'm just wondering if that -- in York, is that indefinitely postponed? Or what's the status of that future development?\nJoel Marcus: Right, as you maybe even have seen on television when some of the news media reports go to that site, which is right next to our 2 towers, the pad that was the location of OCME, the Office of County Medical Examiner was occupied for many, many years. So the white tent with the unidentified remains of the world trade center victims. They've vacated that site, and then we began a diligence there. They reclaim that site for a temporary period just a number of weeks ago, they have mobile morgues there because of the number of people dying in the New York City area. We would expect them to probably vacate that by the summer or the fall, and then we would look to see where we are with the economy and so forth. But I don't think it's going to be an indefinite postponement in the sense of how long they'll be there. We just don't know at this point.\nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone: You talked about just the continued demand for space from your life science companies. And reading these headlines about Google, maybe changing some of their space plans. And so I was wondering if you could talk about when you net all of this, maybe what's happening on Tech and what's happening on life science together, what do you think is happening with your rents? And what do you think will happen with occupancy on the ground in some of your markets?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I'll ask Steve to come in a minute. But I think in general, we're a dominantly life science focused business. As you know, Tony, for a long, long time. We do have a number of important single-tenant buildings where we have companies like Google. They have the original campus. They started in Facebook, et cetera. We don't typically have multi-tenant office buildings that have lots of different tenants and lots of different in the office. And so we don't think that's going to have any particular impact on us. It may -- more broadly. But Steve, you could comment what you're seeing on the ground?\nStephen Richardson: Tony, it's Steve. Yes. Broadly, when you look at just the overall vacancy in these markets, they're typically mid-single digits and even low single digits. Look at Cambridge, 1.8% vacancy, San Francisco, 2.2% availability and on with other regions as well. And then my comment as well, there has not been really any significant sublease space that's come to market since the pandemic. So you do have again, a constrained supply situation. We think pricing power will be maintained the level of demand continues to be strong. Again, April's activity was consistent with what we saw during Q1 and of this year. So the markets are, in fact, healthy at this point, and we're very, very close to them as well with our installed tenant base.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think the bigger question, Tony, that you may be asking, too, is, will these companies somehow decide to put people in more remote locations or even at home. And that's something we just don't know yet. There are obviously a number of office tenants who've indicated that they will have a new way of working, maybe in shifts or, in fact, maybe will wait and do telecommuting until there's either an effective therapeutic or hopefully an effective vaccine as well. So we haven't seen that roll out. But again, in the office world, most of our leases are really full building leases with the major tech companies. We don't have lots of spaces rolling and smaller spaces to deal with. So that's a good thing on the office side.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then in terms of the acquisition, you walked away from in the quarter. Can you give us a sense as to the size of it? And what changed or what your view of value was and maybe is now to prompt, leaving the $10 million on the table?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So maybe I'll have Dean comment and then maybe Steve as well.\nDean Shigenaga: Tony, Dean here. So the size of the deal is roughly $150 million to $160 million in that range. And it really came down to economics at the end of the day, during the diligence period, Tony. We constantly revisit the cash flow analysis and our views on the performance of the holding in the near-term was meaningfully different. And when we took it in totality with our business today, and where we want to deploy capital. It was a pretty simple decision, even though we don't take these decisions lightly because you're talking about $10 million. But it's the only transaction I can think of in the history of the company where we've had to do that. And it was well thought through, and I think the prudent decision for us as well as our investors to pause and terminate the deal.\nJoel Marcus: Was -- keep in mind, it was an office asset in the city of San Francisco. Steve, anything else you'd want to add?\nStephen Richardson: No, Dean really covered it there.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. But just to make us understand, was it more you just saw your capital better situated somewhere else giving what's unfolded? Or was there some -- it wasn't a matter of the tenant crapped out or something?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think in this -- remember what I said, this was an office asset, a multi-tenant office assets. So you can imagine your first question really went to the heart of that as we saw things unfolding in the office sector. Our underwriting changed. And so that kind of alert you to is this where you would want to deploy your capital in this particular kind of environment? The answer was no.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Catherwood from BTIG.\nWilliam Catherwood: Peter, it was helpful your comments on the seven active construction projects that had been delayed in the three that had been restarted. But you also have another 2.1 million square feet of near-term development opportunities. Have your capital spending plans impacted these projects? And are there some that you're prioritizing over others at this point?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. So maybe let me ask Dean to kind of take first shot at that.\nDean Shigenaga: So Tom, the way we thought about our capital, and this is true for many years now. The large portion of our capital spend is in the category that we always have the flexibility to moderate, like we did just now with our earnings release. These are future projects in the pipeline that have not yet commenced vertical construction not committed to tenants yet. We move them along to shrink the time to deliver, which means everything from entitlement to site work. We could be doing anything below grade, which could include a obviously, infrastructure, but a parking garage, if necessary, just the strength of time to deliver. Now there's still important costs continuing, but the bulk of the spend has been temporarily paused because we think that's the most prudent thing to do in this environment. And I think as we get clarity to COVID clearing out and things getting closer to normal. I'm pretty confident we're going to see opportunities that will present themselves, i.e., tenants looking for expansion capacity within this portfolio of land holdings that we have. And we could do these deals 1 deal at a time, Tom. I think that's the beauty of the position we're in. We can moderate the spend like we have, but we also can be opportunistic when appropriate. And I think that's what we really want to convey. The projects, by and large, remain in the priority, the way they've been disclosed from near term, medium and future. And that's how we rank them generally. But the specific ones that will pull the trigger around will be more demand driven.\nJoel Marcus: And keep in mind, as we said in our guidance, Tom, one of our overriding goals, having lived through the great financial crisis was to give ourselves maximum optionality so that we adjusted our spend and our go-forward business plan almost on a dime, pivoting very quickly so that we don't need any further -- to raise any further capital this year to accomplish what we presented here on the call.\nWilliam Catherwood: Got it. That makes total sense. I guess the kind of follow-on to that then would be -- so I assume then you get those projects that are near-term to a level where there aren't startup -- significant start-up costs again. I guess we're thinking longer-term for yield impacts, and obviously, it's very early to be able to tell on that. But I would imagine if it was shut down midstream without full entitlements or without full approval that there would be kind of restart up costs or delays. So all that is part of the calculation?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Yes. And I mean, we -- to some extent, did something similar was different, but yet there is kind of a similarity during the great financial crisis when we continue to build the East tower in New York and we shut down the West tower having finished the foundation, but we didn't go vertical, and it turned out to be a really great call.\nWilliam Catherwood: Understood. And over to acquisitions. Obviously, acquisitions came in higher-than-expected over the past two years. The lower guidance for 2020 makes sense as you talk through your capital allocation plans. But I want to get more color on the transaction market in general. Is part of the lower guidance that you're seeing sellers pull their properties because they're not getting the pricing they want and on the flip side of that -- sorry, go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: I was going to say, let me just respond quickly. Now I think that's part and parcel of giving ourselves the maximum optionality where we don't have an assumption of as many acquisitions as we had earlier so that we don't have to tap either the debt or the equity markets at all or even raise money through partial interest sales or whatever. So part of that was -- had nothing to do with the outside state of the market. It had to do with giving ourselves total and maximum optionality here. That was the driving force.\nWilliam Catherwood: Got it. Got it. I was just wondering as far as if there were opportunities out there that you might like that we missed out on because of the lower guidance, but it doesn't sound like that is the driving force.\nJoel Marcus: No. Although given where we are today and our balance sheet, as Dean articulated, we have optionality to do a lot of things that maybe we wouldn't have had to do in a different environment. So it really puts us in a in a unique and, I think, excellent position, which is where you want to be if you can be.\nOperator: Our next question is from Manny Korchman from Citi.\nEmmanuel Korchman: In your press release, you talked about the fact that a lot of the new ground-up development in your pipeline is supportive of COVID-19 Research. That would obviously imply that, that's a shift as to the work that's happening in those facilities. So one, is that simply an overlap with the tenants that were already signed up and now they're going to be doing that type of work in those facilities? And two, does that mean that there should be more shadow demand for all of the other stuff that they thought they would be doing in those spaces pre covered?\nJoel Marcus: Well, so maybe the first question, the COVID-19 type requirements or COVID-19 type infrastructure requirements, I should say, in the buildings. These are companies who are already focused in areas of therapeutic need in the antiviral areas and certain testing areas, certain infectious disease areas. I mean, Vera is a good example. That was their business before. And to be able to move from a particular focus in infectious disease or in therapies in the antiviral side to COVID-19 is not much of a stretch. Because the basic capabilities and technology and manpower is already there. So there isn't a lot of big pivoting among tenants who were working at. I mean, the East Lake development for Adaptive. I mean, they are all over the COVID-19 area, but it was a natural progression from where they were. But the second part of your question, yes, we've been already contacted. I can think of personally about a half a dozen e-mails, I've got from individuals from companies where they are looking for additional capability additional facilities for their ramp-up on COVID-19, whether it be vaccine, therapeutics or in fact, in testing. And so we do think there will be some pent-up demand there.\nEmmanuel Korchman: Great. And then on your comment about sort of the retail environment within your assets, what does that retail look like on the other side of this? Is it going to be a different mix of retail? Is it going to be not retail at all? Sort of help us get out there first of all, what those retail spaces and what will look like?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. That's really hard to say. My sense is that given that we're not a heavily retail-oriented developer and operator. We think that one by one, we're going to look at the retail operations and see, does this make sense in a new environment, people are going to want clean, prepackaged, probably not so quickly to sit down. So I think there's going to be some shift. Some operators will be pretty facile at being able to do that. And others probably won't. And I think those will just be done on a one by one basis. Luckily, as being said, we don't have immense numbers of retail tenants. So for us, we'll be pretty methodical to try to go through that analysis. But I think it's fair to say until there is a truly effective vaccine, people are not going to be socializing and eating the way they used it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America.\nJames Feldman: I was hoping you could talk about your tenant base in the life science tenant base that's not involved in COVID-19. I mean, are those tenants basically still open for business?\nJoel Marcus: They are.\nJames Feldman: And any pushing for rent relief or any kind of issues on earnings or revenue?\nJoel Marcus: No. I think what's happening is many of the office type people are working virtually. Because you've got a component in every company depending upon size of people who are just office users. And then people in the labs, labs, by their very nature are essentially, you've got good spacing between people. In fact, when we've done tours in the past, especially a member in San Diego people saying, \"Oh, my God, are there anybody working in the labs. So because on a beautiful day, a lot of times, people worked through the night rather than during the day. But they -- I think people have adapted pretty well, so they have essential crews going in to do continue experiments and mission-critical work in those -- and they shift around on days and weeks, and then those who don't need to be there aren't there until the stay in place orders are lifted. But everything is essentially open and working. But under new rules and new rules of the road, if you will.\nJames Feldman: Okay. And then as you think about long-term building design, do you think there's a lot of talk about what might be different in the office sector. But if you think about the lab sector, do you think this is a catalyst for any changes in space design?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Peter, you want to maybe comment?\nPeter Moglia: Sure. So Jamie, one of the things that we used to get asked about was the densification trend for office going to affect lab, and the answer was always no because for one, lab spaces as much about equipment as it is about people. So the way that just research has done right now with people kind of that every other bench with equipment filling in, social distancing is really already factored into the design. There may be some things that can be done with circulation within a lab that will examine to make things even safer. But by and large, we've already been studying this. Our traditional lab product is probably already safe in this environment. We're looking at some of our proprietary products that might be a little bit more dense, and we've already got plans in place for some practical reconfigurations that will not be costly, but we'll just create a little bit more safety.\nJames Feldman: Okay. And there's a lot of talk about air quality just for traditional office. Mean are there things in your lab development business that you think are strategic assets or knowledge assets that might actually help you even more in the office business? Or that if you think how that design might change going forward?\nJoel Marcus: Well, that you're running up, if you don't mind you off, you really answer. Yes, you bring up a really good point. We actually even have one of our large tech tenants, which I won't name because I'm not sure they would want that publicity. But has come to us, they were put into 1 of our large lab buildings and as the only non-lab tenant they really have fallen in love with the high ceiling and the 100% fresh air. This is pre-COVID, by the way, that they had such great experience and such great feedback from their employees that when they go out now with RFPs for new space, they're asking for the same floors and the same air filtration, air changes that we provide. So look, everything that we have that is office with potentially a couple of minor exceptions, is built for laboratory. And therefore, it does have high ceilings. It may have MEP design that is a bit more efficient for office, but we have thought about and put in infrastructure that would enable it to be lab in the future.So we do have the ability to provide an atmosphere from a mechanical standpoint, that mirrors lab. And I think to the extent that office tenants are growing and expanding. We'll see when that happens. But that they will look at buildings like ours, like they have been because we have that advantage. And Steve even mentioned the fit well and the wealth standards, which factor in such things as the amount of natural light that comes into the space, the amount of actual space people have to move around the building, the outdoor space people have to work in. All of those things in this environment are going to be really important as people decide where they want to office. And so our thought to getting into these well and fit well-designed standards is going to pay off not only in our lab business, but for anybody who is leasing office from us as well.\nJames Feldman: Okay. That's helpful. And then finally for me, as you look across the competitive landscape, are there buildings owned by landlords that have balance sheets that may not be so strong? And you kind of see -- you could see some distressed opportunities? Or do you think the better quality buildings that would fit with your portfolio are pretty well owned at this point?\nJoel Marcus: I would say it's possible. So stay tuned.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rick Anderson from SMBC.\nRichard Anderson: So this question has kind of been asked and kind of answered, but not quite. And I wanted to sort of ask it a different way. The 60 tenants, in some way, shape or form involved in the process here and doing awesome things to try to move things along. But is there a -- I know on suggesting they shouldn't be doing that, of course, but is there a short-term potential impact on their own profitability as they -- some amount of resources are redirected towards COVID-19 and their own core drug research business perhaps gets a little bit of a delay. Is that a reasonable way to think about this? Or am I completely off base on?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think for those that -- certainly for the bigger pharma and bigger biotech, who actually report quarterly earnings, I think that's a possibility. Saw a little bit of that in Merck's report today, where it's pretty clear that when people can't go visit the doctor can't go into the hospital for normal procedures and you're stuck kind of in your home, your access to medical care. And in fact, pharmaceuticals is a little more problematic. I think for the private biotechs or the biotech companies that haven't reached profitability, I don't think that's such a big issue because it's the pipeline and the value of the pipeline that really counts. I don't know, Jenna, do you want to make any other comments?\nJenna Foger: Yes. I think the other thing that I would add, Rich, is really that the platforms themselves that they're optimizing. So in the case of or Moderna, the learnings and the pure intelligence that they're getting by optimizing the platform in this rapid speed and rapid notion is actually incredibly valuable for the company overall. Hopefully, they'll be successful. But even if they're not. So I think that's the way to think about it. And I think, as Joel mentioned, clearly, the large pharma folks will have some trouble of their own as far as clinical trials and progressing. But as far as refocusing efforts to COVID, it's actually not all that expensive for them to do that. So if they're successful, I think it's great and I'll come back to them. And if they're not, it's really not that much because a lot of it is either in collaboration with other biotech companies that they're doing the work or using repurposing old drugs. So I think that's just the overview.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. Great. And then the other reference earlier in the call was sort of different utilization of office space in the longer-term aftermath of all this. But when I think of your lab buildings, perhaps maybe the build-out there is 50-50 office and lab space. Do you think for that 50 that's on the office side that your tenants might start thinking about a work from home type of strategy? Or is it just too soon to sort of make that call even for the life science component of your business, not the pure office?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think at the moment and when they reintegrate into the -- whatever will be the new opening and that's going to be different city by city, state-by-state and even company by company. I think you'll find people working maybe shifts to begin with. Those who can work from home over time will probably be brought back into the system because I think it's pretty clear you -- it's hard to build a culture when you have people or maintain a culture when you have people working from home consistently. And especially a number of those people are senior management of a lot of these companies. So I don't think that's going to be a big issue, but I think it will be a time frame issue. But there's a light at the end of the tunnel because once there's a -- if there is, and we think there probably will be an effective vaccine. Hopefully, that goes away, although the age-old habit of shaking hands, hugging, being close to people probably will be rethought a lot by people and that may never change, except in family settings or things like that. So there will be some long-term changes. But I think as I've described the reintegration, I think that's likely what would happen on the office side.\nRichard Anderson: Right. Lastly. Sure. Peter?\nPeter Moglia: If you don't mind. This is Peter. Yes. The people -- a lot of that office space is actually the office space for the people working in the lab. So they do their experiments in the lab, and then they go back to their office and write things up and communicate about those things. So you actually can't work from home. You have -- that office has to be next to the lab because you're going in and out of that. And the majority of our space is revenue-producing space. It's research and development. It's not has nothing to do with back office. I'm sure there's a few companies that we have that may have some back office in there. But by and large, the majority of that office space are people that are actually working in the lab. So that can't be brought home.\nRichard Anderson: Next question for me is on the VC side. Obviously, some noise, not to be unexpected this quarter. But has it caused you to rethink or tweak that strategy at all? And the answer could be completely no or perhaps...\nJoel Marcus: Slightly, no. Okay. Yes, the three items that Dean mentioned are all very unique situations. One has to do with just the market. It's more of a consumer kind of product. Another one has to do with -- actually, the other 2 are really primarily due to management issues, not fundamental underlying business issues. And so in any venture portfolio, you're going to expect some don't perform. And yes, no change whatsoever.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: I wanted to see if we can talk a little bit about the Mercer mega block. It seems like that asset was delayed. I'm not sure if it was delayed because of the current COVID environment or if there's something unique that's going on right there. So how is that acquisition going right now? And is there any changes within expectations?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I don't think there's any delays other than COVID. It's just hard to get -- we're in diligence. And it's hard to get things done. Sometimes when cities are shut down when we're shut down to the extent that we have to be and when you're working virtually and mobilely, so I don't see any -- we were -- the anticipation is to close that either toward the end of the year or early '21. And I don't think that's materially changed.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Great. And then can we talk a little bit about the leasing activity? And I know you made several comments throughout this call, and it seems like leasing trends are still very healthy. But has it changed, I guess, in the current environment compared to three months ago? Is it harder for people to see certain assets? And is that potentially delaying transactions, but not stopping those transactions? I guess, what's the good way to think about that?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Steve, you can take that, but I don't think there's any huge delays and people are virtually looking at assets.\nStephen Richardson: Michael, it's Steve. No, that's right. I mean the demand continues, the need for lab space, as Peter has outlined, is qualitatively different than office space. As people's programs and the funding that Joel highlighted in the beginning, come to fruition. They want to keep moving forward. They want to lock down lab space. The markets are very tight. Again, no major subleases have come to the market. So people are still acting with a sense of the need to move forward and do that deliberately and diligently we have been able to go into the market. These are all essential service buildings. In the orders, they are very clearly and explicitly defined biotech and pharma buildings as essential services. So they are open so we continue to see healthy demand.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And as you saw from the press release and supplement, we announced that we had considerably upzoned our asset at 325 in and that's a good example during this last month or two of COVID shutdown, we've still seen a remarkable amount of interest in that development as a good example.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then just last one for me, I guess. I know that it seems like there's been a lot of funding coming into the space. I mean, in the post COVID environment, do you think it's logical to assume that there's going to be more funding coming into biotech that could drive, I guess, incremental demand? Or is the demand that you've seen is already pretty at record levels? And that's a pretty good pace.\nJoel Marcus: I think there's going to be more, and I don't know how things are going to sort out with China, whether they really open up the -- what really happened in Wuhan? I mean, there are a lot of different theories, as you guys know. But whether it was pure research, whether it was maybe a biological weapon. I don't think the web markets were necessarily the exact cause of that, but I'm not the expert. But I think there's going to be a much more intense federal, state and local effort to try to stockpile medicines, therapeutics, testing capabilities, vaccines. And remember, there are more than 1 strain of the coronavirus. And we don't know what other ones are out there and do to come. So I think this is with us maybe for the history of humanity here.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dave Rogers from Baird.\nDavid Rodgers: And maybe following up on Mike's question and some things that both Steve and Peter mentioned earlier. You talked about the activity in the proposal consistent with prior quarters, and that's pretty consistent with what we've talked in the private market as well. But leasing, new leasing activity in the first quarter was just slower. So maybe that -- you could just address that specifically, was that always going to be a little slower just the way the pipeline was materializing? And then maybe take that question to the future and say, second quarter, do we see a spike in COVID leases, third quarter, maybe the core portfolio, fourth quarter, we start to see people committing to kind of multiyear developments? Or do you think it happens more quickly than that? Can you give us maybe just a little bit more color on kind of how you're feeling today about some of the timing around that?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I'm not sure anybody really knows, given so many different state local and even commentary on what to do in different locations. But Steve, you could take a crack at that?\nStephen Richardson: Dave, it's Steve here. Yes, again, the activity remains consistent. It is consistent across all of the regions. So I think we're very well positioned to capture that demand. We'll just have to see exactly the intensity of the velocity and the magnitude of it. It is high-quality demand, but I think it is still a little bit TBD, but nevertheless, again, April was very encouraging. We're in the full throes of the pandemic, and it was consistent with what we saw during Q1.\nDavid Rodgers: In terms of the COVID leasing or the activity that you're seeing there, would that be a notable spike that we'll see coming? Or is it just kind of incremental to the demand that you've already been seeing?\nJoel Marcus: I think it's hard to say. I think it's possible that when you say spike, I mean, if there's an additional building or 2 requirements, or half a dozen? I mean, don't know if that's considered a spike or a natural evolution of the pandemic response. But we would expect that there are going to be a range of requirements out there, given the amount of money flowing into testing therapeutics and vaccines. I think you have to believe that don't know if it's a Tsunami or a wave, but it'll -- it's going to happen.\nDavid Rodgers: Last for me. Dean, I think your comment, if I heard it right, was that you thought gains this year, the realized gains from your equity investments would beat last year's $50.3 million. Talk about maybe the confidence and liquidity around those? Are those largely already identified and likely to be public market sales, so that gives you kind of the confidence in the liquidity for that market. Any thoughts would be helpful.\nDean Shigenaga: Sure, Dave. So my comment is really just driven by the historical trend of realized gains. So if you look back over the last number of quarters, it's been roughly in that $14 million a quarter range this quarter, about 15%. And so I think over the last number of quarters, I've always mentioned, I think the best way of thinking about it is to watch the historical trend of where we're headed. And at that run rate at 15 a quarter, just as an example, we're already ahead on an annualized basis to the $50 million that we recognized in 2019. There's a tremendous amount of unrealized gains today in the portfolio, $384 million today. So there's good value still to be tapped.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Mizuho Securities.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Just one quick question. I was curious if there was any what the interest in other markets you're currently not in right now, whether there was more interest in some of those markets or less? I think at the Investor Day, there had been some conversation about some markets that you could potentially be looking at outside your current core clusters today?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think in this environment, that's not something that we're thinking about at this time. But I think over the long term, there will likely be other markets, but probably nothing we'd comment on at this point.\nOperator: Our next question is from Manny Korchman from Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman. I had two questions. One, and you talked a little bit about this deal that you walked away from the multi-tenant tech office building. Do you have sort of a broader sort of perspective on how you sort of think about your capital investment going forward, whether you view that 100% targeted towards lab and life science, where a lot of the office opportunities you've been involved with have been a byproduct of the markets that you've been in and the relationships that you've developed, does this whole pandemic change the sort of single-use office, either for a single user or a multi-tenant building going forward where you could see the company being going back to being exclusively focused on life sciences and labs?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think, Michael, one thing is for sure, we have always put our always allocated capital to our core, which will never change, which is the life science industry. But as you know, the intersection of life science and the whole you might call it, the whole IT world is really booming. And so I mean, telemedicine went from something that millennials or Gen Z or Gen Xers would occasionally use because they're pretty healthy too. Right now, it's -- I think, I've got a note because we're involved with the company that's kind of at the forefront that it's spiked up 85% of what it was 2 months ago. So I think you can't ever forget, I mean, tenants of ours, Google, Verily , Microsoft, others that are heavily, heavily involved in the health care sector. So the 2 overlap in ways that are pretty fundamental. So that will always be of great interest. I don't think we'll have as much interest in pure tech office buildings. But I think where we see a building, as Peter described, that may be an office tenant today, but that's in a great location that we can convert in the future. That -- those would still be of interest. And I don't think we've ever really had interest in owning lots of office buildings, multi-tenant office buildings. Per se. That's never really been a focus of ours. So I think we continue our focus.\nMichael Bilerman: And then you talked a little bit about sort of all the focus on COVID-19 right now from your tenant base and that there may be clearly some effects from other activities that are not occurring for those tenants. How do you sort of think about the academia side with schools potentially not opening up in the fall. Clearly, a lot of your buildings are in close proximity to key academic institutions, whether it's MIT, UCFS. How do you think about that aspect and what potentially could come out of that of schools don't physically reopen?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Well, I think number one, those are mostly for undergraduates. If you look at MIT, a lot of the professors and a lot of the labs are still open. They've gone to COVID related operations where people are cycling in, not at all at the same time. But labs and a lot of the graduate students and professors are still working. So in that sense, that's -- we're not so tied to the undergraduate populations. We don't -- we aren't kind of just out there being near university campus, that's kind of not our business model. But what we are focused on are being close to the fundamental institutions in the United States that have pretty strong computational, biological, chemical, all the right kind of areas where they're going to continue to work and people will continue to visit labs and work in labs. So I don't think that changes anything we're doing any Iota.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: Okay. It's been a long call, so sorry for that. Thank you, everybody, and look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call and most importantly, stay safe.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephen Richardson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenna. Good afternoon, everyone. Steve here. We've discussed the mission-critical nature of our laboratory office facilities since our inception 26 years ago. It is clear now more than ever that Alexandria is the proven leader in providing mission-critical an indispensable strategic national health infrastructure in these unique facilities. As Joel and Jenna outlined earlier, we have 60 companies directly engaged in the fight against COVID-19. Our unique platform is leading to healthy activity at Alexandria's Class A laboratory facilities. During Q1, we leased 700,000 rentable square feet at very strong rental rate increases. Actually, the highest during the past 10 years with 22.3% on a cash basis and 46.3% on a GAAP basis, led by a large lease in our flagship Tech Square campus in Cambridge. Our mark-to-market continues to be strong at 15.8% GAAP and 14.3% cash.Lab supply constraints continue with nearly 0 lab subleases coming to market since the inception of the pandemic and continued strong occupancy at 97.5% in our campuses when excluding the vacancy of the recently acquired campuses in San Diego and South San Francisco that will provide future growth opportunities. Executed leases now for the month of April are on pace with Q1 leasing velocity. And important to note that we do have ongoing demand in the form of serious interest and negotiations with tenants on renewals and expansions and our new ground-up developments and redevelopment projects. It's also important to highlight that Alexandria has long been a pioneer, an early adopter in the discipline of designing and constructing state-of-the-art healthy facilities. We currently have 39 total fit well and we well health certification initiatives with 12 projects completed and another 27 projects underway. One of these facilities in Cambridge, in fact, received the highest score fit well ever awarded. Our mission-critical facilities already feature many state of the art mechanical and filtration attributes and are easily adaptable as may be needed going forward guided by our skilled operational teams who are well versed in the types of measures needed to deliver enhanced environments.Finally, Alexandria is fully prepared and well positioned at all strategic and operational levels to protect the inherent value of our unique Class A facilities and continue to grow as a trusted partner to the life science industry to beat this pandemic.With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Sheila, it's Steve. No, that's exactly right. We do have, as we said, mark-to-market strong across most of the regions, and it is typically broad-based for this particular quarter, we did have that 1 lease at Tech square that was a particular driver. But in general, we do have nice mark-to-market opportunities. Tony, it's Steve. Yes. Broadly, when you look at just the overall vacancy in these markets, they're typically mid-single digits and even low single digits. Look at Cambridge, 1.8% vacancy, San Francisco, 2.2% availability and on with other regions as well. And then my comment as well, there has not been really any significant sublease space that's come to market since the pandemic. So you do have again, a constrained supply situation. We think pricing power will be maintained the level of demand continues to be strong. Again, April's activity was consistent with what we saw during Q1 and of this year. So the markets are, in fact, healthy at this point, and we're very, very close to them as well with our installed tenant base. No, Dean really covered it there. Michael, it's Steve. No, that's right. I mean the demand continues, the need for lab space, as Peter has outlined, is qualitatively different than office space. As people's programs and the funding that Joel highlighted in the beginning, come to fruition. They want to keep moving forward. They want to lock down lab space. The markets are very tight. Again, no major subleases have come to the market. So people are still acting with a sense of the need to move forward and do that deliberately and diligently we have been able to go into the market. These are all essential service buildings. In the orders, they are very clearly and explicitly defined biotech and pharma buildings as essential services. So they are open so we continue to see healthy demand. Dave, it's Steve here. Yes, again, the activity remains consistent. It is consistent across all of the regions. So I think we're very well positioned to capture that demand. We'll just have to see exactly the intensity of the velocity and the magnitude of it. It is high-quality demand, but I think it is still a little bit TBD, but nevertheless, again, April was very encouraging. We're in the full throes of the pandemic, and it was consistent with what we saw during Q1."

            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome to everybody. And with me today, virtually, I think, our first virtual quarterly call. In order presentation is Jenna Foger, Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. And we're pleased to present the first quarter earnings call. This will forever be known as the COVID-19 quarter for all public reporting companies. And as I always do, I want to thank our entire team for a truly stellar operationally excellent first quarter 2020 under extraordinary lead difficult COVID-19 circumstances. Our current and go-forward operating and financial status is excellent. On the fourth quarter and 2019 year-end earnings call on February 4, I commented on the novel coronavirus global health emergency and what Alexandria and our client tenants, we're already working on astoundingly, it was not until March 11, 2020, that the World Health organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 virus is a tiny 120-nanometer particle, roughly the wavelength of ultraviolet light that has rippled and replicated across the globe with very ultra violence. And more than 3 million cases worldwide to date.Tiny things have immense impact, especially when everything and everyone is so interconnected and vulnerable. And some have kind of dubbed this China's chernobyl. In a few minutes, I'll ask Jenna to update you on the COVID-19 fight regarding testing therapeutics and vaccines, which is moving forward in a rapid pace literally every day. We had Alexandria laser-focused and enormously proud of our collective accomplishments during this very challenging first quarter, which none of us will ever forget.Our team's tireless and truly outstanding performance really by all metrics, and we are staying lean, mean and laser-focused on our mission with no ego. Our teams acquired and delivered over 35,000 individual pieces of PPE, mostly N95 masks and delivered those to hospitals in 6 cities, New York City, Boston, Seattle were our top priorities. We also delivered them to Dayton, San Diego and LA Hospitals. We consider this to be a truly great execution of our corporate responsibility.Alexandria is among the industry leaders in total shareholder return. Alexandria has best-in-class tenants. Alexandria has best-in-class assets and a powerful and inspiring cluster market presence design and place-making really second to another. We have world-class trusted relationships. And importantly, our fortress balance sheet gives us great flexibility and optionality going forward.We, in the life science industry are at the forefront of this multifaceted fight against COVID-19, while still innovating each and every day novel technologies and new products to also treat cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological and other serious, serious diseases. While most REITs compare their business today, the COVID-19 in the COVID-19 pandemic to the great financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. I think for us, we like to look at 4 years after that time really in 2013. This industry and its innovation really catapulted its capabilities and impact starting in 2013, which really was the start of the great bull run of this industry. And as we sit here today, the life science industry is really the true solution to winning the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. A return to the days when Merck and is then CEO, Ray Vagelos, were the most admired company and the most admired CEO in America.The first quarter of 2020 set an all-time record quarterly high of $8.1 billion invested in venture-backed life science companies, a very high level and accelerated pace, over 80 of biopharma R&D collaborations took place in the first quarter, including the blockbuster, $483 million Moderna and BARDA government funding to -- and Moderna being 1 of our important tenants to advance and scale clinical testing and the manufacturer for a novel COVID-19 vaccine really the key to the solution here.Biopharma continues to outperform the broad market in the first quarter amidst the COVID-19 reality. While most industries are adversely affected by acute changes in consumer demand, this is not the case for biopharma. As the need for new medicines is fundamental to our human condition. This discrepancy is one of the reasons why biopharma outperformed other sectors during the great financial crisis and the tech bubble crash of 2001. NIH funding support remains very strong with a 7% budget increase for fiscal 2020, up to $41.7 billion, a very favorable regulatory environment continues with the FDA, especially in light of COVID-19 and 11 new product approvals were achieved in the first quarter.Medical research philanthropy has also hit an all-time high as well. How I think it's fair to say that the much like flying was before and after 911, things will never again be quite the same as they were pre-COVID-19 and the international pandemic. How quickly we return to what will be a new normal, depends on how we solve the public health situation, restore public confidence and safety. Jim Collins, the famous business author and writer. Research clearly evidences to be built to last, you have to be built to change. And more importantly, in Jim's introduction to his book built to last states, the real focus is it is really about building something that is worthy of lasting. It's about building a company of such intrinsic excellence that the world would lose something important if that organization cease to exist.Jim Collins further stated, we are more convinced than ever that building an enduring great company, 1 that is truly worthy of lasting is a noble cause. And our mission at Alexandria is now more important than ever, and we are in the fight each and every day. Making a tangible and positive impact. And we're great -- we were really graced by Jim Collins on the cover of our 2016 annual report, where he indicated Alexandria has achieved the 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And with that, let me turn it over to Jenna Foger. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A, please. Sheila, welcome to the call. So the -- I talked about NIH being up 7% this year, who knows where Congress may decide to additionally, focus there was $25 billion in the recent care bill this, I think, the second addition focused on testing. In fact, I was on a call the other day, where there's going to be some rollout of some pretty amazing novel testing. So a lot of money is going into that sector. In fact, it may be that the nasal swab will actually be old technology at some point, and people will be using there's some research out of practical research out of Rutgers and Yale, indicating that you can actually find virus in spit. And if you could imagine, you could do that simply on a daily basis. And be alerted on your smartphone that you aren't able to go to work, that would be a pretty unique solution. So we see a fair amount of money, both from pharma, from Bio, from the venture side, obviously, from philanthropy and from the government. I think the BARDA deal that I mentioned and Jenna mentioned almost $500 million to try to ramp up testing and the vaccine with Moderna is 1 example of, I think, extraordinary focus in this area. So I think it's broad-based and really across multiple regions. Yes, I'll have Steve comment. It was somewhat broad-based. One of the important leases was a renewal in Tech Square. I don't want to get into the details of that, but that was certainly an important part of driving. But Steve, any further comments? Right, as you maybe even have seen on television when some of the news media reports go to that site, which is right next to our 2 towers, the pad that was the location of OCME, the Office of County Medical Examiner was occupied for many, many years. So the white tent with the unidentified remains of the world trade center victims. They've vacated that site, and then we began a diligence there. They reclaim that site for a temporary period just a number of weeks ago, they have mobile morgues there because of the number of people dying in the New York City area. We would expect them to probably vacate that by the summer or the fall, and then we would look to see where we are with the economy and so forth. But I don't think it's going to be an indefinite postponement in the sense of how long they'll be there. We just don't know at this point. Well, I'll ask Steve to come in a minute. But I think in general, we're a dominantly life science focused business. As you know, Tony, for a long, long time. We do have a number of important single-tenant buildings where we have companies like Google. They have the original campus. They started in Facebook, et cetera. We don't typically have multi-tenant office buildings that have lots of different tenants and lots of different in the office. And so we don't think that's going to have any particular impact on us. It may -- more broadly. But Steve, you could comment what you're seeing on the ground? Yes. I think the bigger question, Tony, that you may be asking, too, is, will these companies somehow decide to put people in more remote locations or even at home. And that's something we just don't know yet. There are obviously a number of office tenants who've indicated that they will have a new way of working, maybe in shifts or, in fact, maybe will wait and do telecommuting until there's either an effective therapeutic or hopefully an effective vaccine as well. So we haven't seen that roll out. But again, in the office world, most of our leases are really full building leases with the major tech companies. We don't have lots of spaces rolling and smaller spaces to deal with. So that's a good thing on the office side. Yes. So maybe I'll have Dean comment and then maybe Steve as well. Was -- keep in mind, it was an office asset in the city of San Francisco. Steve, anything else you'd want to add? Well, I think in this -- remember what I said, this was an office asset, a multi-tenant office assets. So you can imagine your first question really went to the heart of that as we saw things unfolding in the office sector. Our underwriting changed. And so that kind of alert you to is this where you would want to deploy your capital in this particular kind of environment? The answer was no. And keep in mind, as we said in our guidance, Tom, one of our overriding goals, having lived through the great financial crisis was to give ourselves maximum optionality so that we adjusted our spend and our go-forward business plan almost on a dime, pivoting very quickly so that we don't need any further -- to raise any further capital this year to accomplish what we presented here on the call. Yes. Yes. And I mean, we -- to some extent, did something similar was different, but yet there is kind of a similarity during the great financial crisis when we continue to build the East tower in New York and we shut down the West tower having finished the foundation, but we didn't go vertical, and it turned out to be a really great call. I was going to say, let me just respond quickly. Now I think that's part and parcel of giving ourselves the maximum optionality where we don't have an assumption of as many acquisitions as we had earlier so that we don't have to tap either the debt or the equity markets at all or even raise money through partial interest sales or whatever. So part of that was -- had nothing to do with the outside state of the market. It had to do with giving ourselves total and maximum optionality here. That was the driving force. No. Although given where we are today and our balance sheet, as Dean articulated, we have optionality to do a lot of things that maybe we wouldn't have had to do in a different environment. So it really puts us in a in a unique and, I think, excellent position, which is where you want to be if you can be. Well, so maybe the first question, the COVID-19 type requirements or COVID-19 type infrastructure requirements, I should say, in the buildings. These are companies who are already focused in areas of therapeutic need in the antiviral areas and certain testing areas, certain infectious disease areas. I mean, Vera is a good example. That was their business before. And to be able to move from a particular focus in infectious disease or in therapies in the antiviral side to COVID-19 is not much of a stretch. Because the basic capabilities and technology and manpower is already there. So there isn't a lot of big pivoting among tenants who were working at. I mean, the East Lake development for Adaptive. I mean, they are all over the COVID-19 area, but it was a natural progression from where they were. But the second part of your question, yes, we've been already contacted. I can think of personally about a half a dozen e-mails, I've got from individuals from companies where they are looking for additional capability additional facilities for their ramp-up on COVID-19, whether it be vaccine, therapeutics or in fact, in testing. And so we do think there will be some pent-up demand there. Yes. That's really hard to say. My sense is that given that we're not a heavily retail-oriented developer and operator. We think that one by one, we're going to look at the retail operations and see, does this make sense in a new environment, people are going to want clean, prepackaged, probably not so quickly to sit down. So I think there's going to be some shift. Some operators will be pretty facile at being able to do that. And others probably won't. And I think those will just be done on a one by one basis. Luckily, as being said, we don't have immense numbers of retail tenants. So for us, we'll be pretty methodical to try to go through that analysis. But I think it's fair to say until there is a truly effective vaccine, people are not going to be socializing and eating the way they used it. They are. No. I think what's happening is many of the office type people are working virtually. Because you've got a component in every company depending upon size of people who are just office users. And then people in the labs, labs, by their very nature are essentially, you've got good spacing between people. In fact, when we've done tours in the past, especially a member in San Diego people saying, \"Oh, my God, are there anybody working in the labs. So because on a beautiful day, a lot of times, people worked through the night rather than during the day. But they -- I think people have adapted pretty well, so they have essential crews going in to do continue experiments and mission-critical work in those -- and they shift around on days and weeks, and then those who don't need to be there aren't there until the stay in place orders are lifted. But everything is essentially open and working. But under new rules and new rules of the road, if you will. Yes. So Peter, you want to maybe comment? Well, that you're running up, if you don't mind you off, you really answer. Yes, you bring up a really good point. We actually even have one of our large tech tenants, which I won't name because I'm not sure they would want that publicity. But has come to us, they were put into 1 of our large lab buildings and as the only non-lab tenant they really have fallen in love with the high ceiling and the 100% fresh air. This is pre-COVID, by the way, that they had such great experience and such great feedback from their employees that when they go out now with RFPs for new space, they're asking for the same floors and the same air filtration, air changes that we provide. So look, everything that we have that is office with potentially a couple of minor exceptions, is built for laboratory. And therefore, it does have high ceilings. It may have MEP design that is a bit more efficient for office, but we have thought about and put in infrastructure that would enable it to be lab in the future.So we do have the ability to provide an atmosphere from a mechanical standpoint, that mirrors lab. And I think to the extent that office tenants are growing and expanding. We'll see when that happens. But that they will look at buildings like ours, like they have been because we have that advantage. And Steve even mentioned the fit well and the wealth standards, which factor in such things as the amount of natural light that comes into the space, the amount of actual space people have to move around the building, the outdoor space people have to work in. All of those things in this environment are going to be really important as people decide where they want to office. And so our thought to getting into these well and fit well-designed standards is going to pay off not only in our lab business, but for anybody who is leasing office from us as well. I would say it's possible. So stay tuned. Well, I think for those that -- certainly for the bigger pharma and bigger biotech, who actually report quarterly earnings, I think that's a possibility. Saw a little bit of that in Merck's report today, where it's pretty clear that when people can't go visit the doctor can't go into the hospital for normal procedures and you're stuck kind of in your home, your access to medical care. And in fact, pharmaceuticals is a little more problematic. I think for the private biotechs or the biotech companies that haven't reached profitability, I don't think that's such a big issue because it's the pipeline and the value of the pipeline that really counts. I don't know, Jenna, do you want to make any other comments? Well, I think at the moment and when they reintegrate into the -- whatever will be the new opening and that's going to be different city by city, state-by-state and even company by company. I think you'll find people working maybe shifts to begin with. Those who can work from home over time will probably be brought back into the system because I think it's pretty clear you -- it's hard to build a culture when you have people or maintain a culture when you have people working from home consistently. And especially a number of those people are senior management of a lot of these companies. So I don't think that's going to be a big issue, but I think it will be a time frame issue. But there's a light at the end of the tunnel because once there's a -- if there is, and we think there probably will be an effective vaccine. Hopefully, that goes away, although the age-old habit of shaking hands, hugging, being close to people probably will be rethought a lot by people and that may never change, except in family settings or things like that. So there will be some long-term changes. But I think as I've described the reintegration, I think that's likely what would happen on the office side. Slightly, no. Okay. Yes, the three items that Dean mentioned are all very unique situations. One has to do with just the market. It's more of a consumer kind of product. Another one has to do with -- actually, the other 2 are really primarily due to management issues, not fundamental underlying business issues. And so in any venture portfolio, you're going to expect some don't perform. And yes, no change whatsoever. Yes. I don't think there's any delays other than COVID. It's just hard to get -- we're in diligence. And it's hard to get things done. Sometimes when cities are shut down when we're shut down to the extent that we have to be and when you're working virtually and mobilely, so I don't see any -- we were -- the anticipation is to close that either toward the end of the year or early '21. And I don't think that's materially changed. Yes. Steve, you can take that, but I don't think there's any huge delays and people are virtually looking at assets. Yes. And as you saw from the press release and supplement, we announced that we had considerably upzoned our asset at 325 in and that's a good example during this last month or two of COVID shutdown, we've still seen a remarkable amount of interest in that development as a good example. I think there's going to be more, and I don't know how things are going to sort out with China, whether they really open up the -- what really happened in Wuhan? I mean, there are a lot of different theories, as you guys know. But whether it was pure research, whether it was maybe a biological weapon. I don't think the web markets were necessarily the exact cause of that, but I'm not the expert. But I think there's going to be a much more intense federal, state and local effort to try to stockpile medicines, therapeutics, testing capabilities, vaccines. And remember, there are more than 1 strain of the coronavirus. And we don't know what other ones are out there and do to come. So I think this is with us maybe for the history of humanity here. Yes. I'm not sure anybody really knows, given so many different state local and even commentary on what to do in different locations. But Steve, you could take a crack at that? I think it's hard to say. I think it's possible that when you say spike, I mean, if there's an additional building or 2 requirements, or half a dozen? I mean, don't know if that's considered a spike or a natural evolution of the pandemic response. But we would expect that there are going to be a range of requirements out there, given the amount of money flowing into testing therapeutics and vaccines. I think you have to believe that don't know if it's a Tsunami or a wave, but it'll -- it's going to happen. Well, I think in this environment, that's not something that we're thinking about at this time. But I think over the long term, there will likely be other markets, but probably nothing we'd comment on at this point. Well, I think, Michael, one thing is for sure, we have always put our always allocated capital to our core, which will never change, which is the life science industry. But as you know, the intersection of life science and the whole you might call it, the whole IT world is really booming. And so I mean, telemedicine went from something that millennials or Gen Z or Gen Xers would occasionally use because they're pretty healthy too. Right now, it's -- I think, I've got a note because we're involved with the company that's kind of at the forefront that it's spiked up 85% of what it was 2 months ago. So I think you can't ever forget, I mean, tenants of ours, Google, Verily , Microsoft, others that are heavily, heavily involved in the health care sector. So the 2 overlap in ways that are pretty fundamental. So that will always be of great interest. I don't think we'll have as much interest in pure tech office buildings. But I think where we see a building, as Peter described, that may be an office tenant today, but that's in a great location that we can convert in the future. That -- those would still be of interest. And I don't think we've ever really had interest in owning lots of office buildings, multi-tenant office buildings. Per se. That's never really been a focus of ours. So I think we continue our focus. Yes. Well, I think number one, those are mostly for undergraduates. If you look at MIT, a lot of the professors and a lot of the labs are still open. They've gone to COVID related operations where people are cycling in, not at all at the same time. But labs and a lot of the graduate students and professors are still working. So in that sense, that's -- we're not so tied to the undergraduate populations. We don't -- we aren't kind of just out there being near university campus, that's kind of not our business model. But what we are focused on are being close to the fundamental institutions in the United States that have pretty strong computational, biological, chemical, all the right kind of areas where they're going to continue to work and people will continue to visit labs and work in labs. So I don't think that changes anything we're doing any Iota. Okay. It's been a long call, so sorry for that. Thank you, everybody, and look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call and most importantly, stay safe."

            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. I'm going to quickly update you all on our development pipeline. Acquisitions closed in 1Q and touch on some capital markets activity. Coming into 2010, we have 11 development and redevelopment projects in our pipeline that are 61% leased, with another 7% under negotiation. One of the many things that we like about our pipeline is that it is spread among 6 markets and 9 submarkets, which really shows that the ecosystems we've built in all of our clusters are contributing to our growth and our story is not just about any particular region. Despite the shelter in place orders, reducing our ability to tour potential tenants, there is good activity on partially leased assets that are progressing at various levels from initial online presentations to paper being traded. As Steve mentioned, we are still seeing healthy activity in our markets. And these leasing percentages should accelerate given the pent-up demand and the new COVID-19 related requirements.As you may have noted, by looking on Page 38 of the supplemental, 7 projects have had a temporary pause in construction, but 3 of them have restarted as they've been deemed essential. Delays related to shelter in place orders or I'll refer to as SIP, are not day for day. They are likely between day for day and 2 days per day of delay, depending on how long it takes to remobilized the subcontractors back on-site and where we were in the staging of the work. We do not anticipate any material supply chain issues. The amount of delay is really going to depend upon the subcontractor labor and what other work they are performing elsewhere. In general, we anticipate about 1/4 delay on average for those projects that are in temporary work stoppages due to SIP orders and assuming construction recommences upon lifting of the current orders, and they are not further extended. We do anticipate or we do not anticipate any material movement in yields at this time due to these delays. In the -- touching on acquisitions, in the first quarter, we closed on 2 projects, we discussed on last quarter's call, 275 grove in the Route 128 corridor and the JV with Boston properties in South San Francisco.In addition to those, we closed on 9808 and 9868 Scranton Road in Sereno Mesa. And 3330 and 3412 Hill view in the Stanford Research Park. The Scranton Road assets total 220,000 square feet and are located directly across the street from and will be incorporated into our SD tech campus. They are currently 88% leased with the predominant tenants being investment-grade companies. The assets present us the opportunity to achieve a strong 6.8% stabilized cash yield by leasing the vacant space and future value creation opportunities as they are convertible to lab. A 50% interest in these assets was subsequently sold into a joint venture, and we received $51.1 million from net asset sale.As mentioned, in addition, we closed on 3330 and 3412 Hillview in the Stanford Research Park for $105 million. These 2 high-quality Class A office properties total approximately 106,000 square feet and are fully leased to credit tenants. The rents are considerably under market and offer near-term value creation in an irreplaceable location. The buildings are also convertible to lab offering us long-term optionality and further value creation opportunities down the road.Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed on 975 to 1075 Commercial Street and 915 to 1063 old County Road, a 12.7 acre site that is the fourth and final piece of our 25 Acre assemblage branded as the Alexandria district in St. Carlos. This campus is in close proximity to the Caltrain station and will reach 2 million square feet upon full development. First phase of a little over 500,000 square feet is currently under construction and has been well received as the only purpose-built Class A lab campus in the Greater Stanford cluster illustrated by it being 56% pre-leased with another 9% under negotiation.I'll wrap up by mentioning that conversations with a number of brokers indicate that there is still strong interest in lab office assets from a diverse set of investors. To that end, the post 426,000 square foot campus in Waltham in Massachusetts closed on April 2 at a 5.1% cap rate, the lowest suburban cap rate we know of. And a reliable source has told us another life science transaction in the Boston area has gone under contract while in the shutdown. With a positive light shining on the industry, it is not surprising that demand for our product type remains robust.And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Yes. So maybe let me ask Dean to kind of take first shot at that. Sure. So Jamie, one of the things that we used to get asked about was the densification trend for office going to affect lab, and the answer was always no because for one, lab spaces as much about equipment as it is about people. So the way that just research has done right now with people kind of that every other bench with equipment filling in, social distancing is really already factored into the design. There may be some things that can be done with circulation within a lab that will examine to make things even safer. But by and large, we've already been studying this. Our traditional lab product is probably already safe in this environment. We're looking at some of our proprietary products that might be a little bit more dense, and we've already got plans in place for some practical reconfigurations that will not be costly, but we'll just create a little bit more safety. If you don't mind. This is Peter. Yes. The people -- a lot of that office space is actually the office space for the people working in the lab. So they do their experiments in the lab, and then they go back to their office and write things up and communicate about those things. So you actually can't work from home. You have -- that office has to be next to the lab because you're going in and out of that. And the majority of our space is revenue-producing space. It's research and development. It's not has nothing to do with back office. I'm sure there's a few companies that we have that may have some back office in there. But by and large, the majority of that office space are people that are actually working in the lab. So that can't be brought home."

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm just going to quickly rattle through my commentary, kicking off with really outstanding results for the first quarter. Revenues were up 22.6% over the first quarter of '19. NOI was up 22.9% as well over the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 68%. Contractual and annual rent escalations average almost 3% today. Our value creation pipeline is 61% leased and will generate significant revenue and cash flows, and I'll come back to this topic in a moment. We also have about $37 million of annual cash net operating income that will commence as free rent burns off primarily over the next 4 quarters. Related to recently placed into service development and redevelopment projects. Same-property NOI growth was very solid at 2.4% and 6.1% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth, as you heard from Steve earlier, on lease renewals and releasing the space was very strong, up 46% and 22% on a cash basis. And our properties are open and operating today and through this environment. Our business is not absolutely immune from this unusual and unprecedented environment. But is doing very well on a relative basis. The NASDAQ biotech index, as some of you may have noted, was up 5.8% year-to-date as of yesterday. And our stock has outperformed on a relative basis, roughly down about 7% year-to-date, again through as of yesterday.Our team is working diligently on our annual corporate responsibility report, which we expect to issue around mid year. Now as Joel had highlighted, our balance sheet really remains in the best shape in the history of the company. We had about $4 billion of liquidity. We have an excellent maturity profile with no debt maturities until 2023. And the top we rank roughly in the top 10% on a relative ranking with our credit profile when compared to all publicly traded REITs. We have a real high-quality tenant roster, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, these are just some of the best statistics in the REIT industry today. And we remain committed to our strong and improving credit profile. Our dividend is well covered with an FFO payout ratio just under 60% today. This strategically allows us to use a portion of our cash flows from operating activities after dividends, which is just above $200 million today. For investment into our value creation ground-up development projects.Now briefly on rent deferrals and an update on rent collections, we've only received a handful of requests for rent deferrals, which is primarily on the retail side of our tenancy. And we've really taken these requests 1 by one, and we'll review each review these each 1 month at a time. The total rent deferrals were in the low $600,000 range for the month of April. Now we're very proud of our research and property management teams for really building an outstanding and high-quality tenant roster and for really taking care of these long-term relationships. We've collected 98.4% of our April rent and expense recoveries, which is just outstanding.Our AR balance as of Friday, April 24, was $7.3 million, representing the lowest balance since 2012. And our team has successfully decreased our AR balance, both when we look back to the depth of the great financial crisis. So our goal was clear from the beginning of April that we would continue to make this a priority each month. We're feeling really good now that we're at the end of April. We've collected almost all of our account receivable balances our business is doing really well, again, relative to other REITs. However, this is an unprecedented environment, and we have forecasted a relatively minor impact to our outlook for the last 3 quarters of 2020. We're forecasting about an $0.08 or 1% reduction in FFO per share as adjusted at the midpoint of the range of our guidance. And this is really related to a very limited retail tenancy that we have as well as transient and short-term parking of the $0.08, 60% of this is related to retail, and the remainder is primarily related to transient and short-term parking. To put this into perspective, this $0.08 is roughly 60 to 70 basis points of our annual rental revenue, and we believe this will only be about a 50 basis point decline to our year end occupancy.As of March 31, our annual rental revenue from retail was about $10.4 million. We recognized an allowance of about $3.8 million related to NOI for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2020, and most of the impact to retail revenue will really occur in the second quarter since GAAP requires cash basis revenue recognition related to these leases that now have specific allowances or reserves. And our retail-related occupancy declines, which we expect to be very minor, may not occur right away since these leases are still in effect today. And keep in mind, retail is a very minor part of our operating results, but we hope these details are useful.Parking income for ARE is primarily from urban or CBD markets. And these markets have very limited parking to service tenants and daily parking needs. For example, Juno Therapeutics in Seattle has about 600 employees, but they only have parking for about 50% of that employee base. So these really dense urban CBD submarkets generally have lower risk of a major decline in parking income due to the very limited supply of spaces in the markets.Our outlook for same-property performance for 2020 remains very strong, down only about 50 basis points. The $0.08 of FFO per share related to retail and parking revenue. Translates to about 60 to 70 basis points of same-property results. And this was offset by our same-property results in our forecast running at the upper end of the range prior to this guidance adjustment.Now turning to real estate impairments. We spent quite a bit of time analyzing options for 1 of our unconsolidated retail joint ventures. To put this into perspective, this deal came together back in 2015 as we were looking for opportunities to monetize certain assets, including this land parcel, now in this case, we found an opportunity to contribute our land into a joint venture with a local retail developer in Maryland. And this project was really doing well on its way to solid, stabilized NOI, until COVID-19 arrived and almost every tenant was required to comply with executive orders and close their business. Now we concluded that we're not going to recover our bases and wrote off our investment of approximately $7.6 million.Turning to our venture investment portfolio. The portfolio has done really well to date. For example, our venture investments aggregate about $1.1 billion. But this includes unrealized gains of $384 million. During the first quarter, we did recognize impairments aggregating about $19.8 million, primarily related to 3 privately held investments. One is focused on Parkinson's and ALS, another in the dermatology area. And the third is a smart glass technology-related company. Now each of these companies really have great innovation and technology. However, we do not expect to recover our entire investment.On the positive note, realized gains for the first quarter were $15.1 million. Recent quarterly gains were put on -- for 2020 really are on track to exceed the $50.3 million in realized gains recognized in 2019.Turning to our value creation pipeline. We're uniquely positioned with flexibility to be prudent during this unprecedented time, while we're also very well positioned to address future demand. Now construction has been impacted in urban markets with more of our suburban markets having limited to no impact. COVID-19 and other projects continue while following appropriate guidelines.Now we felt it was prudent to significantly reduce our 2020 capital plan with a reduction of $640 million in construction spend and $300 million of acquisitions, both at the midpoint of our guidance. Now our remaining construction spend for 2020 is now primarily focused on construction that is committed to tenants. Importantly, though, we remain uniquely positioned for opportunities on a project-by-project basis to meet the demand for our well-located pipeline of future ground-up development projects. Now we updated our 2020 guidance to a range for EPS dilutive from $1.69 to $1.79 and for FFO per share diluted as adjusted from $7.25 to $7.35, as usual, please refer to the detailed underlying assumptions included in our 2020 guidance, beginning on Page 9 of our supplemental package.Let me pause there and turn it back to Joel. Tony, Dean here. So the size of the deal is roughly $150 million to $160 million in that range. And it really came down to economics at the end of the day, during the diligence period, Tony. We constantly revisit the cash flow analysis and our views on the performance of the holding in the near-term was meaningfully different. And when we took it in totality with our business today, and where we want to deploy capital. It was a pretty simple decision, even though we don't take these decisions lightly because you're talking about $10 million. But it's the only transaction I can think of in the history of the company where we've had to do that. And it was well thought through, and I think the prudent decision for us as well as our investors to pause and terminate the deal. So Tom, the way we thought about our capital, and this is true for many years now. The large portion of our capital spend is in the category that we always have the flexibility to moderate, like we did just now with our earnings release. These are future projects in the pipeline that have not yet commenced vertical construction not committed to tenants yet. We move them along to shrink the time to deliver, which means everything from entitlement to site work. We could be doing anything below grade, which could include a obviously, infrastructure, but a parking garage, if necessary, just the strength of time to deliver. Now there's still important costs continuing, but the bulk of the spend has been temporarily paused because we think that's the most prudent thing to do in this environment. And I think as we get clarity to COVID clearing out and things getting closer to normal. I'm pretty confident we're going to see opportunities that will present themselves, i.e., tenants looking for expansion capacity within this portfolio of land holdings that we have. And we could do these deals 1 deal at a time, Tom. I think that's the beauty of the position we're in. We can moderate the spend like we have, but we also can be opportunistic when appropriate. And I think that's what we really want to convey. The projects, by and large, remain in the priority, the way they've been disclosed from near term, medium and future. And that's how we rank them generally. But the specific ones that will pull the trigger around will be more demand driven. Sure, Dave. So my comment is really just driven by the historical trend of realized gains. So if you look back over the last number of quarters, it's been roughly in that $14 million a quarter range this quarter, about 15%. And so I think over the last number of quarters, I've always mentioned, I think the best way of thinking about it is to watch the historical trend of where we're headed. And at that run rate at 15 a quarter, just as an example, we're already ahead on an annualized basis to the $50 million that we recognized in 2019. There's a tremendous amount of unrealized gains today in the portfolio, $384 million today. So there's good value still to be tapped."

            "name": "Jenna Foger",
            "content": "Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. Against that backdrop and the backdrop of the unprecedented economic, public health and social impact of this global coronavirus pandemic. As Joel elegantly described, life science fundamentals remain strong as the biopharma industry represents the beacon of hope in the fight against COVID-19. Effective diagnostics, therapies and vaccines are absolutely mission-critical to solving this crisis, and we truly owe a debt of gratitude to the heroic work being spearheaded by so many of our tenants to help test for, treat and prevent COVID-19. The countless efforts we are tracking, not to mention the many philanthropic initiatives across our cluster campus communities, providing medical supplies and protective equipment to neighboring hospitals is profound and inspiring. We are currently tracking over 60 tenants across our cluster markets with publicly disclosed COVID-19 programs with dozens of intercompany and public-private collaborations transpiring across our portfolio.Our tenants position at the forefront of fighting COVID-19 reflects the strength, quality and fortitude of our tenant base. As you all know, we take tremendous pride in the tenants we attract, each of which is strategically underwritten by our science and technology team, which I have a profound honor of being a part of alongside 20 of our colleagues with deep background in science and business. So I would like to briefly highlight the mission-critical work of our tenant companies across 3 major categories: one, improving testing, quality and capacity, 2, advancing new and repurposed treatments; and three, developing preventative vaccines. So in the area of improving test and quality and capacity, tenant companies, including Abbott labs, LabCorp, Roche, Quest Diagnostics, Thermo Fisher, UCSS color genomics and several others are working to enhance the quality and capacity for rapid and accessible testing to determine who actively has the virus, who has been exposed and who has developed immunity against it. The availability of widespread screening and serological testing of this nature will be instrumental for track and trace initiatives and, of course, the safe and healthy reopening of society and return to work.In terms of therapies and vaccines, over 180 potential drug treatments and vaccines are being studied in more than 250 clinical trials around the world, with well over 100 preclinical stage programs in development. As you can imagine a substantial number of these programs are sponsored by our tenants. Headlining efforts among them include Gilead sciences Remdesivir, which is in late-stage studies for the treatment of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, which, if positive, will likely form the basis for the first FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19.Tenant company Adaptive Biotechnologies is partnered with Amgen to identify and develop therapies from the blood of sick or recently recovered COVID-19 patients. Other tenant biotechnology has announced partnerships with fellow tenants, Alnylam, Biogen, GSK and others to develop new and existing antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventative options to come back to COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Several other tenants, including AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Fiber and Novartis are similarly endeavoring to develop novel therapies and repurpose existing drugs to provide near-term treatments for moderate and severe COVID-19 patients and those at highest risk.And lastly, vaccines. So clearly, a prophylactic vaccine represents the effective end of this global COVID-19 pandemic. Our tenants Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases NIAD partnered as Moderna's mRNA-based vaccine into the clinic last month. Subsequently, as Joel mentioned, BARDA committed up to $483 million to support the clinical development and manufacturing scale-up of Moderna's vaccine candidate. To help expedite FDA approval over the next 9 to 12 months an unprecedented pace for the sort of activity and facilitate the supply of tens of millions of doses of that vaccine for a month thereafter.Other tenants, including Johnson & Johnson, Medicago, Novavax, Fiber, PS, Sanofi, are leveraging their vaccine development expertise and technology platforms with the goal of expediting the delivery of a safe and effective vaccine to the public in 2021. These noble and expedient efforts across our tenant base are in large part to the fact that as the new coronavirus made itself known to the world, these companies were already well equipped with the R&D infrastructure, resources and talent in place such that they were able to mobilize at nearly a moment's notice to combat this unprecedented global health emergency.And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Yes. I think the other thing that I would add, Rich, is really that the platforms themselves that they're optimizing. So in the case of or Moderna, the learnings and the pure intelligence that they're getting by optimizing the platform in this rapid speed and rapid notion is actually incredibly valuable for the company overall. Hopefully, they'll be successful. But even if they're not. So I think that's the way to think about it. And I think, as Joel mentioned, clearly, the large pharma folks will have some trouble of their own as far as clinical trials and progressing. But as far as refocusing efforts to COVID, it's actually not all that expensive for them to do that. So if they're successful, I think it's great and I'll come back to them. And if they're not, it's really not that much because a lot of it is either in collaboration with other biotech companies that they're doing the work or using repurposing old drugs. So I think that's just the overview."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Alexandria Real Estate Equities Fourth Quarter 2021 Conference Call. . Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaula Schwartz: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our fourth quarter and 2021 year-end call. With me today are Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. And with that, welcome. I wanted to thank you for joining, and wish everybody a happy Chinese New Year starting today, the year of the Tiger. We, at Alexandria, are very honored and pleased to report on a truly historical -- historic and remarkable fourth quarter and 2021 year-end results, really demonstrating operational and strategic excellence by really each and every metric. And what I think is truly unique and audacious is that Alexandria has operated during this past 2 years, the 2021 -- 2020 and 2021 will be known as the COVID era, really at the highest operational tempo ever and as the sophistication and scale that few REITs could ever accomplish.  And in the words of Jim Collins, Alexandria has truly achieved 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And I want to thank profoundly each and every one of the extraordinary Alexandria family team members on a sensational performance during 2021. Napoleon I said, strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle. And over the last 25 years, we came public in May 97. So we'll have our 25th anniversary in May. We took this small company public 3 years after we started it with $19 million Series A. And as of the end of the year, December 31, 2021, we had reached a phenomenal total market cap of $44 billion. For the period of COVID, the 2020 and 2021, Alexandria's TSR approximated 45-plus percent, exceeding by a wide margin in the office index with a total return of minus 0.5%. And since our IPO 25 years ago in May '97, we've been proud and fortunate that our total shareholder return has exceeded 2,500%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 and office REIT indices at 939% and 552%, respectively. And we're always playing the long game. Speaking about fourth quarter and year-end, very robust results. Our life science markets, as evidenced by our fourth quarter and full year results, truly were a blowout in many respects and most of which in -- as clearly highlighted, has been leasing. And that really sets us up nicely for a very strong 2022 and beyond. The continued robust demand from really 1 of the most innovative and transformative industries in the United States, the life science industry, one which is not really cyclical, but which is event driven, I think, does set us up and enables us, our brand and our talented and special operational lab space, affords us a very strong pricing power in each of our cluster markets. And really, in many ways, sets us up to have a very strong earnings growth year here in 2022 and into '23 and '24.  We continue to create highly accretive value creation opportunities to meet the current demand of over our 850 innovative tenants and importantly, provide a path for future growth. And although we've reiterated 2022 guidance, and Dean will speak more about that in a moment, the $8.26 to $8.46 FFO per share, we will clearly revisit and update that in the first quarter earnings release. We have very strong momentum at our backs. As most of you know and we often comment, with 10,000 known diseases to human kind, less than 10% really have addressable therapies today, and we are truly in the early days of the golden age of biotechnology and biology. Advances in innovation are happening at unprecedented speed and driving human health and quality of life in a positive direction. Steve Jobs commented many years ago when he predicted he thought that the biggest innovations of the 21st century would be the integration of biology and technology. We've achieved historic milestones in many respects. And hopefully, you enjoyed the press release and supplement where we tried to highlight those in both graphical and word form truly. And others will speak about this in a moment, the highest leasing volume in the company's history, 9.5 million square feet, just an awesome achievement. Doubled annual revenues. At our 2017 Investor Day, we gave a framework that we would hope to double annual rental revenues in 5 years, and we exceeded that about 1.5 years ahead of time. We also concluded the largest acquisition in the company's history during 2021, our entry into the Fenway submarket and over 1 million square feet was leased to our longtime tenant and very close relationship, Moderna. And I would say probably most importantly, and I think Dean, Peter and Steve will probably all comment on this, our historically high and strong leasing value-creation pipeline really foreshadows outside growth coming for the -- coming into the upcoming years, including 2022. Nearly 8 million rentable square feet under construction are expected to commence over the next 6 quarters to generate over $610 million of incremental annual revenue, we think really sets us up in an extraordinary fashion. So with that, let me turn it over to Steve for some important commentary.\nSteve Richardson: Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. Steve Richardson here. 2021 was indeed a year of historic demand, as Joel has just outlined in the life science industry. And for leasing milestones from the Alexandria team, the 9.5 million square feet of total leasing was a record shattering figure and the 4.1 million square feet during Q4 alone doubled the previous highest quarterly leasing run rate. The highlight, however, may have been the 3.8 million square feet of leasing in the value creation, development and redevelopment pipeline with the emphasis on quality. We had 2 large-scale ground-up Class 8 plus facilities featuring long-term leases to credit tenants. The 462,000 rentable square foot facility at 325 Binney leased to Moderna for their lab headquarters and the 231,000 rentable square foot facility at 751 Gateway for Genentech Roche's lab facility were ably led by our teams on the ground in Greater Boston and the San Francisco Bay Area. And important to note, both Moderna and Genentech Roche are long-time lab tenants of Alexandria, and a hearty shout out as well to our teams for a superb year during 2021. We also look to the metric we don't normally analyze but consider the following: the 9.5 million square feet of total leasing provides in excess of $6 billion of contractual triple-net base rents. $6 billion of contractual base rents are a significant financial metric, but maybe more important is the market reality of this leasing success. The meaningful expansion of the formidable moat the Alexandria team has carefully and strategically created since the company's inception 28 years ago. Also, consider that this 9.5 million square feet of total leasing comprised 318 lease transactions with 280 different life science tenants in our core clusters. This dynamic activity could not be a starker contrast with other entities and random groups who may be leasing 25,000 to 50,000 square feet and occasionally 100,000 square feet here or there to a handful of life science tenants oftentimes outside of our core clusters.  As an investor, the value proposition offered by Alexandria is very clear. We are laser focused on the life science industry. This is not a side car or a new initiative for the company. And as we continue to execute on creative and long-standing relationships to drive growth in our core markets, the dominant presence of our brand and mega campuses provides a singularly compelling story in the life science real estate market with our stellar reputation for delivery of high-quality, on-time and on-budget infrastructure and incomparable complex lab operations. Now let me elaborate on a few additional highlights for our milestone late in 2021. The core continues to outperform with impressive renewal and re-leasing spreads of 22.6% cash and 37.9% GAAP during 2021. And we have significant embedded upside with mark-to-market now at 31% plus. This is nearly double the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of Q4 2020. AR for 2021 was 99.9%, huge kudos to our best-in-class operations teams for their continued close relationships with our tenants throughout COVID, these past 2 years. Early renewals during 2021 were 82% compared with our historical 71% rate. And the exceptional health of Alexandria's value creation pipeline at scale, 7.4 million square feet is 1 of the largest and highest quality pipelines amongst our REITs. We've increased the lease negotiating percentage to 83%, and Peter will comment on the details later, has significantly derisked the delivering of the incremental revenues of $610 million noted on Page 34 of the supp. Let me turn to supply and demand for a moment. On demand, as we've highlighted throughout the recent Investor Day presentation and these fresh statistics clearly indicate, Alexandria's compelling by proposition for tenant base at our unique mega campuses has enabled us to capture not only a very large market share but also the highest quality tenants in our core clusters. And as we analyze supply, again, we do not foresee any major supply disruptions during 2022 and 2023.  And the delivery of large-scale supply actually materializing is highly uncertain during 2024 and beyond for other potential new entrants. They face entitlement risk, operational risk for tenants considering unproven landlords, capital market risk with the recent increased volatility related to construction starts, supply chain risk as they consider plunging into a new technical and complicated product type and the very significant underwriting risk posed by the nature of the biotechnology in your street. So we are monitoring supply closely, but consider these risks to be very strong headwinds for others. So in conclusion, as we start 2022 with enthusiasm for the highly disruptive therapies for huge unmet medical needs on the horizon by our more than 850 innovative tenants, we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on the value creation pipeline. I'm going to discuss what we're seeing with construction costs and supply chain issues and summarize our fourth quarter asset sales, which should bring to light the great opportunity investors have right now to benefit from the disconnect between our stock price and NAV due to overlooking the strength of our fundamentals and the reality on the ground in favor of macro themes. Just look at our quarterly and annual performance, even in volatile times, we've been able to post exceptional results. Less than a handful of REITs can operate at the scale of operational excellence, and even fewer have a dominant share in each of their major markets, a high-quality tenant base and own the vast majority of a scarce asset class. Investors seem to be missing this. Projects that are either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters are projected to deliver greater than $610 million in incremental rental revenues, primarily from the first quarter of this year through 2024. What Joel and others termed as the Golden Age of biotech today and during Investor Day, due to the accelerating discovery and development of effective new modalities, such as cell gene and RNA and DNA therapies, continue to accelerate demand for life science real estate throughout the year and especially in the fourth quarter, resulting in Alexandria shattering a number of leasing records, including the total annual and quarterly leasing volumes of our development and redevelopment pipeline. In addition to this outstanding leasing, our best-in-class development teams have done a tremendous job continuing to deliver high-quality purpose-built laboratory space to our tenants on time and on budget, even in challenging environments, which I'll touch on in a moment. During the year, we delivered a little over 2 million square feet in 14 projects with at least 1 project located in each of our core markets, illustrative of the depth and breadth of demand we see in all of our markets. During the quarter, we delivered 600,000 square feet, spanning 10 of those markets, which when fully delivered, will add approximately $34 million in NOI to our bottom line. Stabilized yields for these projects averaged 6.2% on a cash basis, which is a very healthy spread to the cap rates we are seeing in our partial interest sales, which I will also discuss later. Our current projects under construction are largely pre-committed with 75% of the space leased and 82% leased or under negotiation. Near-term projects expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters totaled 10.2 million square feet and are already 67% leased and 83% leased or under negotiation.  These projects include ground-up development at Arsenal on the Charles, a development in the Seaport submarket of Boston at 15 Necco, which is fully committed; 2 ground-up projects at Torrey Pines that will aggregate properties on North Torrey Pines Road and adjacent streets into our new 1 Alexandria Square Mega campus; 2 fully committed ground-up developments at Alexandria\u2019s Point Mega campus in the UTC; and 3 ground-up developments at our Alexandria Center for Life Science Mega campus that are 89% committed in aggregate. Truly a remarkable pipeline to fuel earnings growth for years to come. We continue to monitor construction costs and supply chain disruptions with a laser focus. As reported in past calls, 2021 was a very challenging environment with overall cost indexes indicating a full year inflation of 13-plus percent, driven largely by materials costs and a lack of available labor. Conversations with general contractors and examination of industry reports are consistent in concluding that things are improving. And it's expected that as factories, ports and logistics issues settle down, materials pricing will become favorable. Expectations are things will remain elevated in 2022, but we will see a return to normal in 2023. For example, according to IHS Global Insight, steel increased by approximately 27% in 2021, but is expected to increase by approximately 14% this year before decreasing by 13% in 2023 and again by 9% in 2024. Almost every material line item tracked by IHS is expected to start decreasing in price by 2023, with the remaining items increasing at historic inflation rates. The bigger risk we face is delay caused by supply chain problems. A poll of our project managers indicated that although we have some problems with items we typically include in our core and shell development, such as generators being delayed by 6 to 8 months, we are, by and large, able to mitigate delays by making early commitments on design and equipment specifications, a luxury we have because of our years of experience in developing life science buildings, enabling us to make quick decisions based on proven standards we have developed over 2 decades.  A status few others have and the result has been no material delays in the core and shell delivery of our project. Experience matters.  However, it's a different story with FF&E, which puts most of the burden on our tenants. Things like benches and other fixtures such as glass watching equipment are tough to get right now. Fortunately, we're able to leverage our scale and relationships for our tenants and ensure the advantages we have and nurture their benefit, so they can get up and running with little inconvenience. In the fourth quarter, we completed the previously disclosed recapitalization of 1,500 Owens at 409/499 Illinois in Mission Bay and completed partial interest sales at 50-60 Binney in Cambridge, 455 Mission Bay Boulevard and 1,700 Owens in Mission Bay with the Binney assets raising nearly $800 million in proceeds at a sub-4% cap rate, realizing a profit of approximately $450 million over cash invested, and the Mission Bay assets raising nearly $400 million of capital while achieving a 3.8% cap rate. We also sold our 49% interest in our Menlo Gateway Tech Office Project, generating almost $400 million in proceeds and achieving a profit of a little over $100 million in just under a 5-year hold period. Overall, these sales generated $1.97 million in proceeds at an average cap rate of 4.3% and a per square foot value of $1,497.  When you put that into the context of yesterday's $194.84 closing price of our stock, which implies a per square foot value of our operating assets of only $906. It supports my earlier statement about a disconnect between the stock price and the reality on the ground. High-quality life science assets with high-quality tenants are scarce, and we have hundreds of them. We are a bargain right now. With that, I'll pass it over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: Thanks, Peter. Dean here. Good afternoon, everyone. 2021 was a historic and record year of financial and operating performance for Alexandria. We are very well positioned for another exceptional year. We are the go-to brand. Our team delivers a very high level of operational excellence. We benefit from our important and strategic life science industry relationships plus over 850 tenant relationships. We generate strong core growth through same-property NOI growth. We have tremendous visibility into future growth with $610 million of incremental annual rental revenue from our value creation pipeline. Our team has delivered consistent execution of bottom line FFO per share growth year-to-year, and we have 1 of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry. We reported total revenues of $2.1 billion, up 12.1% over 2020 and FFO per share as adjusted per diluted share of $7.76 for the full year, outperforming our initial outlook for 2021 by $0.06 per share. 2021 generated many financial metrics that reflect outperformance relative to our initial guidance for the year, which I'll cover throughout my commentary. Core growth in key financial statistics were exceptional. Growth in cash NOI of $280 million to $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter annualized was supported by 1 of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 51% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade rated or large-cap public companies. We had an industry-leading EBITDA margin of 71%, highlighting efficient execution by our team. We had 100 basis points growth in occupancy for the full year of 2021, excluding the impact of vacancy from recently acquired properties. Now importantly, 48% of the 1.8 million rentable square feet of vacancy from recently acquired properties is expected to commence occupancy and rental revenue over the next 2 quarters. That's pretty amazing execution by our team. Now turning to 2022. The midpoint of our occupancy guidance is 95.5%, which is 150 basis points higher than occupancy of 94% as of 12/31/21. Now demand for space from our life science industry relationships and tenant relationships drove record leasing volume with over 9.5 million rentable square feet executed, double the rentable square feet of leases executed annually in recent years. And we achieved record rental rate growth of 37.6% and 22.6% on a cash basis. Now rental rate growth outperformed our initial outlook for 2021 by 740 basis points and 510 basis points above the midpoint of the range of our guidance, again, pretty spectacular results. And importantly, for 2022, we expect continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space at roughly 32.5% and 20% on a cash basis at the midpoint of our guidance. Same-property NOI growth was very strong for 2021 at 4.2% and 7.1% on a cash basis. GAAP rental rate growth was about double and cash results were up about 40%, above the midpoint of our initial outlook for 2021. Our outlook for 2022 same-property NOI growth at the midpoint of our guidance is also very strong at 6.5% and 7.5% on a cash basis, above our strong performance in 2021 and reflects 170 basis point growth in same-property occupancy for 2022. Now leasing activity in the fourth quarter continued to reflect a very favorable environment for Alexandria. Occasionally, though, there is a lease or 2 that skews this particular statistic in the quarter. The fourth quarter included lease extensions with 2 tenants with higher tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions. But the key takeaway is that net effective rent, which is GAAP rent less the impact of tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions, is up 50% on average for these leases. Now TIs and leasing commissions for lease renewals and releasing of space, excluding these leases was about $34 per square foot and consistent with historical amounts.  Now we are in an outstanding position today with tremendous visibility for future growth in annual rental revenue of over $610 million from 7.4 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are 80% leased or under executed LOI or advanced lease negotiations. Now what truly stands out as exceptional is that 94% of the 7.4 million rentable square feet that is leased or negotiating is from existing relationships, highlighting the strength of our brand, operational excellence, our mega campus offerings and many other features. Now during 2021, we completed a record level of leasing with 3.9 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment space leased, including a whopping 1.8 million rentable square feet in the fourth quarter. We delivered about 2 million square feet of development and redevelopment projects in the year with about $1.6 billion in basis that was on average completed in July of 2021. Now looking forward, NOI from development and redevelopment projects is expected to increase significantly in 2022 in comparison to 2021, and we expect significant year-over-year increases in NOI from development and redevelopment projects to continue into 2023. Turning to venture investments. The investments performed really well in 2021 and generated $216 million in realized gains, including $106 million that was included in FFO per share. Now unrealized gains as of December 31 was almost $800 million, up about $44 million from the beginning of the year. And looking forward into 2022, venture investment gains, we expect to include an FFO per share, should be relatively consistent with 2021 at roughly flat to up 10%. Turning to our balance sheet. Looking back, actually, it was about 10 years ago that our team completed our debut investment-grade bond offering of 10-year notes at 4.66%. Now 10 years later, our team is very pleased with Alexandria's corporate rating that ranks in the top 10% of the REIT industry. So congratulations, team. Now thinking about where rates are today, we could issue 10-year bonds at an all-in rate just under 3% today, highlighting very attractive long-term fixed rate debt for our company. In October, S&P upgraded our credit rating outlook to positive, highlighting our unique and differentiated business model, strong brand and execution, high-quality cash flows and strong credit profile among many other items. Now we met or exceeded our strong balance sheet goals with net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at 5.2x and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.3x, and we ended 2021 with over $3.8 billion in liquidity. Now turning to guidance. There were no changes in the detailed disclosures for 2021 guidance. We reaffirmed our strong outlook for 2022, included EPS diluted ranging from $2.65 to $2.85 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted ranging from $8.26 to $8.46. Now as a reminder, please refer to Page 8 of our supplemental information for detailed underlying assumptions included in our guidance for 2022. And with that, I'll turn it back to Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you very much, and let's open it up for questions, please.\nOperator:  Our first question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI.\nSheila McGrath: I was wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail on some of the recent acquisitions and your vision or the opportunity you see, specifically the land purchases in Research Triangle and maybe comment on the demand drivers in RTP. The acquisition of the Strip Center in San Diego. And finally, Texas, what drove this new market decision?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Sheila. Let me start your couple of questions in North Carolina. We have substantially increased our holdings there in a number of ways and recent land parcels are aimed at creating and expanding -- actually expanding the mega campus, which was the former Glaxo campus there that we bought and have turned into kind of a mega campus, if you will, that will be well over 1 million square feet. Leasing has been very, very strong there, and we're adding some adjacent land to expand that campus and the capabilities there. You asked about what's driving the demand in North Carolina, particularly in the triangle. And I think you could argue -- it goes back to our thesis when we started the company that, clusters are really by 4 factors: one, you got to have a there's there, here's here, so to speak. So the Triangle is they're there, here's here, anchored by North Carolina, UNC, Duke and North Carolina State.  The talent base is a second critical factor and one, as you know, there's kind of a war for talent across America in corporate America, even in just average individual-owned companies, small businesses I guess, as you would call them, with so many people leaving the workforce. And North Carolina has an amazing blend of great talent and highly trained skilled people, especially for life science, agricultural tech and certainly technology industries. The third factor is risk capital. There's a good abundance of capital in that market that are fueling companies. And then finally, there's a real plethora of scientific and technical -- you might say, technology where translational work is coming out of the labs and moving into companies.  So those are the 4 things that are really driving. And also next-gen manufacturing is found North Carolina to be an important place. I think Lilly announced today, they're building a billion campus, I think just outside Charlotte, a little surprised it wasn't closer to the Triangle, but they also have operations there. But that's what's driving North Carolina. In San Diego -- I think you asked about San Diego was the second location?\nSheila McGrath: Yes. I think you acquired a strip center there to redevelop or something?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, that is a -- Dean has been working on that for quite a while. That is a really great location in the heart of University Town Center, which has been a hallmark of our presence down there since probably 1998 and an attempt to create a mini campus there in a really great location driven by -- heavily by great transport. And obviously, you know the history of the San Diego market, San Diego has really emerged as 1 of the top markets with a great talent base and really strong capital base, strong scientific prowess and obviously, the land there has been very cherished. And I think the final market you asked about was Texas. So for a variety of legal reasons, I can't say anything until the first quarter, and we'll talk about that. But much like New York, when we started in New York, we really spent before we opened the Alexandria Center for Life Science in 2010, we had started an effort in New York back in 2001 as part of Sandy Wild's effort to bring commercial life science to New York City, where none literally existed.  And I would say the same is true of Texas. Literally, no real presence of commercial life science down there today, but our intent is to create a market and really bring early-stage commercial life science to Texas, much like we did in New York. So with that, hopefully, long-winded answer.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America.\nJamie Feldman : Alexandria recently put out a press release saying that you\u2019re the number 1 most active corporate investor in biopharma in terms of new deal volume, and I believe it was for the last 5 years. I just want to get your thoughts on your appetite for investment now. Our economists are calling for 7 rate hikes this year, fed funds for hikes this year and more next year. I want to get your thoughts on both what \u2013 how ARE thinks about putting capital to work in a rising rate environment and just what your sense is of deal flow and capital raising we\u2019ll see in biotech and biopharma in this environment?\nJoel Marcus : Yes, Jamie. Thanks for your question. It\u2019s a really good question. So remember, and I said in my earnings commentary just a few minutes ago, the industry is not a cyclical industry. The mature companies have large amounts of revenue and operate at scale and aren\u2019t really influenced by the cyclicality in any way quite like the very interest rate sensitive industries are. So that\u2019s number one.  Number two, you have to remember that this industry, hopefully, the compression time for bringing new therapies to market to address so many really terrible things that we don\u2019t currently have therapies for \u2013 takes a number of years. It\u2019s not like tech where you can create a software program and bring it out instantaneously. So when we met and began our work with Moderna was 2011, that was a pretty tough year, as I recall. We were just getting our investment grade rating. As I remember, Steve, I always said we didn\u2019t have a single tour at Mission Bay for maybe 18 months and the capital markets were pretty, pretty bleak. So we think long term. So investing now for the future, there\u2019s \u2013 this is a good time to do it especially as Peter said, the new modalities will change the face of, I think, health care of the future. So we\u2019re very bullish on that. And I\u2019m not sure what more I can say, but interest rates and the economy really are \u2013 you have to obviously pay attention. We\u2019re very mindful. We certainly lived through a number of ups and downs, the \u201899, 2000 tech bust and then the \u201808, \u201809 financial meltdown. So we\u2019re pretty judicious about what we do and how we do it, but we\u2019re out there looking for the next Moderna\u2019s.\nJamie Feldman : Okay. And have you sensed the change in the market \u2013 competitive investment market, given the pullback we\u2019ve seen in the stocks? I know it hasn\u2019t been very long, but any\u2026\nJoel Marcus : For sure. I mean, yes, the \u2013 it certainly is well recognized that the public markets have had major adjustments in valuations over the last, say, 3 quarters. I think that\u2019s starting to leak into the private market because a number of companies who have clinical programs are selling at cash, which is a bargain today. So investors are looking at those with big appetites. So I think you\u2019ll see some of that froth go out of the private markets. My guess is you\u2019re seeing the same thing on the tech side as well. Public markets are resetting valuations in the private markets. But truly great companies are going to get funded. There\u2019s a huge amount of venture that\u2019s been raised over the past couple of years, gigantic amounts, historic amounts. And those are investable dollars for the coming handful of years that those aren\u2019t running out anytime soon.\nJamie Feldman : So in terms of demand for your portfolio, do you think it will be a noticeable change or no?\nJoel Marcus : Well, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to repeat the high watermark of 9.5 million square feet for 2021 on over 4 million square feet for 4Q. But as I think Peter and Steve has said, we have a huge wind at our back. We\u2019ve got over 850 innovative tenants most of whom we service for their current demand and future growth. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable about where we are. And certainly, our value creation pipeline super highly leased. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at risk, but we\u2019re mindful. I mean, if Russia invades the Ukraine, then things are going to change pretty rapidly for everybody, right?\nOperator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC Nikko.\nRich Anderson : So earlier on the call, I was -- I think, Joel, you mentioned had this incredible quarter and year of leasing and that you'll take another look at guidance, not making any commitments, of course, the following quarter. But is it not true that you -- when you issued your guidance in the -- on December 1st, you had already seen what was happening at that point? Or it was part of what you're reporting today, a surprise to you even from the beginning of December, hence, you could have like an earn-in type of event for 2022 as the success in the fourth -- late part of fourth quarter rolls into the coming year?\nJoel Marcus : Well, I think I'll let Dean answer that, but I think the commentary is we try to be conservative with how we project the future until we start to see things roll out, December was a record-breaking leasing year. We have a good amount of leasing on the precipice of happening. And I think we feel pretty good we gave a range, and I think you'll see us go forward in the first quarter and give you a fulsome update.  But Dean, do you want to make any comments on that?\nDean Shigenaga: Yes. Maybe just to somewhat reiterate what you said, Joel, Rich, the way to think about it, we had good tailwinds behind us last year -- this time last year, as we started '21, and we were able to outperform a lot of our underlying guidance assumptions, including overall bottom line FFO per share. We're off to a great start at the very beginning of 2022 with good tailwinds behind us. So we're pretty optimistic, but stay tuned, I guess.\nRich Anderson : I guess the answer is record December, which didn't happen until after the earnings Investor Day. So next question, maybe to Peter. You mentioned the $906 per square foot valuation on the stock. Can you kind of book in that for me? Because there are few ways to skin that analysis depending on what you have in the denominator. So is there a high and low end range depending on some of the assumptions you put into that math?\nPeter Moglia: It's the same back of the napkin formula we used a while back when I was commenting on this kind of once the stock implied per foot doesn't match up with our asset sales. And you just take our total market cap at the close -- or I'm sorry, at the end of the year of about $39.5 billion and then you take out our CIP from our developments, our venture assets and our cash and restricted cash, and that gives you the estimated value of our properties divided by our operating square footage. So that's plus or minus, I'm sure, it's not completely specific, but it's in the ballpark. Even if it was way off, there's still a huge disconnect.\nRich Anderson : And then following on the investment side for you. When you -- a lot of times when you guys make acquisitions, there is a component of operating assets and very often a future development or redevelopment opportunity to your credit. When you -- would you allocate total cost to those types of transactions that have kind of multiple layers of opportunity in them? How do you do that? I mean is there a rule of thumb of how much the operating assets get versus the development assets in a given transaction? I'm just curious how that -- how we should think about that?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. So Dean, maybe --\nDean Shigenaga: Yes, Rich. I wish there was a simple answer to help for your modeling. But as you can imagine, every transaction is very unique and specific. And the component of operating relative to value creation is also very unique. So there's nothing general that I could guide you towards. We did include, though, for modeling in our acquisition disclosures, in the footnote there, there is a breakdown of how much NOI was brought on board for the current quarter acquisitions and the exact date on a weighted average basis that, that was added for the fourth quarter. So at least you have the NOI to model, but the basis is much harder to get to, Rich.\nOperator: Next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Peter, I wanted to come back on this valuation question, and I recognize this is a drum that you beat for a little while as the stock has traded below where you\u2019ve been able to sell assets and certainly where private market values are. How do you think about \u2013 the last 2 years, you\u2019ve issued, I think it\u2019s about 30% of your share base, clearly a pretty significant discounts to what you perceive market to be?  You\u2019re obviously investing that capital accretively into highly pre-leased development and redevelopment as well as acquisitions. But at some point, if your view is that the stock should be worth significantly more than illustrating today, you\u2019re issuing that equity at a massive discount. Hence, you need the things you\u2019re investing in to offset the dilution that you\u2019re putting on the company from issuing at such a low value below what you think NAV is. So can you just sort of step back from it because if you had issued 5% of your share base, it\u2019s 1 thing, but you\u2019ve issued 30% over the last 2 years. So how do you sort of put all that together as you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation and raising?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. So maybe, Dean, do you want to comment on that first and maybe let Peter give color.\nDean Shigenaga: Sure, Joel. So Michael, I think what you described at a super high level, generally has been a challenge that the growing company like Alexandria has faced. As you know, as we grow cash flows pretty consistently quarter-to-quarter take the macro environment way, our stock price should be higher the next quarter. If we wait too long to use stock then we have an equity overhang. So I think \u2013 what we\u2019ve tried to do, Michael, is to be balanced here. I think Peter\u2019s commentary from time to time is just to highlight the opportunity on the stock price performance. Hopefully, it catches the attention of investors. While we do our job to execute the business and do it as best we can to grow cash flows in a prudent way and fund it in a reasonable way with both debt equity as well as proceeds from dispositions. So yes, I think on average, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job being mindful of that overall challenge and opportunity in front of us. We are making money as we invest our capital at the price points that we have raised both debt equity as well as recycling capital from dispositions. So there\u2019s a balance we need to navigate that I think you\u2019re pointing out.\nJoel Marcus : Yes. So Dean, could you maybe just highlight the historical equity level to say a lot of --\nDean Shigenaga: Yes, that\u2019s important, too. And Michael, you might remember this from Investor Day, we had touched on just looking back at how much equity do we \u2013 common equity do we use to fund our growth. We all know that at our leverage profile at a stabilized basis, an asset might require 65-plus percent of equity, the remainder being debt funded. And if you compare that to what we\u2019ve done historically, we\u2019re actually only using about 40% to 42% of common equity to fund growth. And what that\u2019s highlighting is tremendous cash flow is being reinvested in the business, which for $22 million is north of $300 million, but we\u2019re also taking advantage of recycling capital from high-value, low cap rate partial interest transactions and then EBITDA growth gives us some incremental benefit as well. So I think that also just highlights that we\u2019re being very disciplined in our approach, trying to minimize the amount of common equity we issue while being mindful. We want to keep our balance sheet in a super strong position.\nMichael Bilerman: Yes. And I get all those things and certainly tapping the asset sales and joint ventures over the last number of years has been another source of capital, but you\u2019ve also enlarged your acquisition opportunities, both development as well as straight transactions. And it just strikes me that sometimes, Peter, when you get on and you say we\u2019re a bargain or a bargain and throwing out $1,500 a foot, I think people start to really try to get into your head of, what do you perceive in to be \u2013 we recognize the most recent sales are indicative of where the market is for life sciences, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to guide people towards that your entirety of your portfolio is worth $1,500 a foot and every $100 per foot is, call it, almost $20 a share of NAV. So trading at $900, what is the value that you have in your mind? You must have a sense of when you\u2019re issuing \u2013 a couple of weeks ago, right, you issued $1.7 billion at 186. You must have had a view whether that equity in your view, is worth 250. Is it 275? Are you saying it --\nJoel Marcus : Yes. I think, Michael, the point of that is we were at an all-time high, and we felt very comfortable in taking the market risk of issuing equity, especially before a pretty \u2013 what\u2019s likely to shape up is a pretty volatile year. NAV is a little bit like beauty. It\u2019s in the minds of the beholder. And I think that we felt at that point, we were very comfortable issuing equity at that level. Let\u2019s just put that point to rest.\nMichael Bilerman: Yes, I was just trying to get to understand how the company thinks about is cost. The cost of equity and when it puts into what you\u2019re using it for, just how you\u2019re thinking about the accretion dilution from that, especially if you\u2019re telling investors that the stock is cheap. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how you thought about it --\nJoel Marcus : I didn\u2019t say that, Peter giving a view on an asset-by-asset basis, but at an all-time high, issuing the equity we did. We felt very good about what we\u2019re doing and the accretive uses we could put that equity too.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll : So I wanted to dive into the leasing stats a little bit. I know volumes were pretty high in the fourth quarter, both in the operating and the development portfolios. In the operating portfolio, I'm trying to connect the dots with the strong volume, but occupancy dipped albeit very slightly. Is this in part due to leases being signed but not yet commenced or is it explained by the lease extensions that Dean mentioned in his prepared remarks?\nJoel Marcus : I think it's primarily acquisitions, but Dean, you could comment.\nDean Shigenaga: So the acquisitions have been driving almost every quarter, face rate declines in reported occupancy. But if you strip that out, Michael, pretty consistently every quarter or 2, we're driving growth in overall occupancy. As an example, we highlighted in 2021, we had a 100 basis point increase in occupancy, if you exclude vacancy from recently acquired properties. And I think I highlighted in my commentary that we do expect, if you put any future acquisitions to decide that we can't model because we're not aware of them, we're expecting 150 basis point growth in occupancy in 2022. And I would suspect that given the tailwinds for our business and our portfolio here, that could continue looking out beyond '22 as well.\nMichael Carroll : Okay. No, great. That makes a lot of sense. And also, I like the new disclosure, at least the highlight disclosure that about 63% of your operating properties are in mega campuses. I mean, is there a way to quantify the importance of having these larger campuses? Do those buildings in these campuses drive stronger revenue growth and buildings outside of those campuses?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. I think if you remember back to Investor Day, Dan gave a specific example in San Diego, where our mega campus leasing effort was substantially above on a lease rate above a nearby building, which was owned by another REIT and demonstrated that is just kind of a sheer apples-to-apples. And 1 of the reasons it makes a big difference is because it provides not only the highly amenities and tailored services and facilities for tenants, but it gives them a space for growth right now, but a path for future growth in our industry today, that's kind of mission-critical.\nMichael Carroll : Great. And then, Joel, within the development pipeline, I guess do you have the percentage of the buildings that further build out your existing campuses or create new campuses?\nJoel Marcus : We do. I don't think we have that in any specific disclosure place. But if we go campus by campus, clearly, we do.\nOperator: Next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG.\nTom Catherwood: Steve, I appreciate your commentary on the new supply in your markets and demand is obviously strong, given record leasing volumes this quarter and year. With that said, though, can you provide some additional color on the demand in your markets and maybe how that demand is split between your core and emerging clusters if you have that information?\nStephen Richardson: Yes. Tom, it\u2019s Steve here. Certainly, on the demand side, and we\u2019ve said this now probably for a couple of years that it is broad-based in each of our core clusters. So it\u2019s not just 1 or 2 clusters with a proportion contribution. So Joel touched on what\u2019s happening on a research triangle, that\u2019s very encouraging, very healthy demand in Maryland and Seattle as well. And then certainly, San Diego, San Francisco and Greater Boston, very healthy there. So on the demand side, absolutely broad-based, and we continue to see that going forward in the future as well.\nTom Catherwood: Makes sense. And given that you\u2019ve added some of these emerging or new cluster locations, is it a case of, if you build it, they will come where you\u2019ve seen demand move as you have moved? Or has the demand kind of remained consistent from before and now after you\u2019re in those markets as well?\nStephen Richardson: Yes. I\u2019m not sure I would characterize it as new markets, Tom. I think what we\u2019ve done is either 1 double down literally in our core markets. I mean, look at 325 Binney as an example, here in Cambridge. Certainly, what\u2019s happened. Peter referenced the projects down in San Diego and Tory Pines. And then the second aspect of it is really expanding through adjacent expansions, but no real kind of new greenfield core markets as we\u2019ve talked about this broad-based demand.\nTom Catherwood: Got it. Makes sense. And last one for me. In the summit, you laid out next, I think, 11 developments and redevelopments that are slated to start over the next 6 quarters and their 89% leased store negotiation. Outside of those, are there others that could commence in the same time frame if pre-leasing gets done? Or are you kind of limited by entitlements or design or local approvals?\nDean Shigenaga: Tom, it\u2019s Dean here. There are projects beyond that 2.6 million square feet that is currently disclosed at 89% lease negotiating. So those are the projects that could start over the next 6 quarters. In addition, to be real clear here, we expect the potential for other starts. But we just wanted to highlight in these disclosures here that we\u2019ve got a very active pipeline under either leased or advanced negotiations. It just highlights how much we\u2019re working closely with our relationships to meet their current and future space needs.\nOperator: Next question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: Just maybe 2 questions. First, just on -- just pricing power across your markets. You've referenced really good rent spreads seems like they're sustainable given your guidance. But I'm wondering if you can just talk about how we think about the sustainability of these spreads maybe from 2 different perspectives. One, just in your view, what's sort of the mark-to-market of the portfolio today in your various clusters, but also just maybe top down, can you talk about just what life science tenants are paying in rent as a percent of their own revenue? Is there just an elongated runway, given where that is today?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. So the answer to your first question, I think, Steve addressed. Generally, on a mark-to-market basis, the portfolio would be about 31% up. So that gives you a good sense of how that would play out. And then when you look at life science companies, pharma, biopharma, small, medium, rent is generally a smaller part of -- I think, Steve or Peter, you guys may have the stats, but a fairly small part of the overall G&A, whereas if you go to service companies, law firms, securities firms, it's a much larger part. But I don't know, Steve or Peter, do you have that percentage in mind? It's sub-5%, I believe.\nStephen Richardson: Well, for our large cap bio and pharma companies, it's actually 1% to 2%. And then the kind of the mid-cap is in the 5% to 6% range.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay. That's helpful. And then just to clarify on some of your newer developments or in general, 1 of your office peers, I should say, referencing kind of a lot of demand even for life science assets from other categories, tech, especially, given the need for newer buildings and amenities. Are you seeing just unsolicited interest from just other groups given sort of where your buildings are?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. We've seen that for a decade or more. I mean, Steve, maybe just a tutorial on Mission Bay for a moment, which is kind of where a lot of this started.\nStephen Richardson: Sure. Yes. In Mission Bay, might know, we had a significant influx of technology with Uber establishing a 4-building million square foot campus there. So the combination of not only UCSF as a center of learning there, but waterfront location. Now the Chase Center really did make that very desirable for technology companies -- and a lot of those other elements are true when you look at all of the attributes of our mega campuses in San Diego, Seattle, certainly Cambridge and Greater Boston as well. So -- and then you have -- and Joel mentioned this too, you've got the integration of science and technology, really spawning new companies and new growth, and those are all happening in each of our clusters.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Dave Rodgers of Baird.\nDave Rodgers : Joel, I just wanted to ask about New York. Most of my other questions were answered. With the New York cluster, I know over time, you\u2019ve talked about it in kind of the long-term development track for some of these clusters. I think historically, demand was 1 side but also crowding out of investment capital in things in New York City was an impact on that particular cluster. With a weaker New York City office market. Are you seeing either more tenants interested? Or are you seeing more capital or ARE more interested in kind of moving more aggressively in New York to take advantage of the weak office market like you see maybe in San Diego or is that just not really a foot?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening. I think we won the RFP for the first commercial life science campus in 2005 under Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s direction. We delivered our first building in 2010. And at that point, there was only a single commercial 1 incubator up in the northwest side of Manhattan that had commercial life science tenants. And that was it. Everything else was clinical, academic, but not commercial. And so over the past decade, we\u2019ve built New York. We have our campus today over 800,000 square feet, and we have the prospect of going significantly more. We\u2019ve got some 60-plus companies there, only 1 of which really existed before we started the campus in the city. And so the New York City market is still \u2013 it\u2019s a small company market. It\u2019s a small market. We felt that it was a good one to enter because of our cluster model and the drivers. But if you look at last year, there were only about 250,000 square feet of new leases. So in Boston, that\u2019s probably a day\u2019s work. So you have to look at it with respect to all of the clusters. And it still is \u2013 it\u2019s a 25-year gestation period, as I\u2019ve said, to build a cluster. And we\u2019re just now entering the second decade. So New York has got a long way to go.  And over the past couple of years, New York has been a tough slog with crime and civil disturbances and things like that. So that\u2019s been a challenge. Big companies aren\u2019t going to go to New York, New York State because of high taxes. So it remains a small company market. We\u2019re committed, and you build it from the ground up.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus : Well, thank you, everybody. We look forward to updating you on our first quarter call. Be safe. Take care.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our fourth quarter and 2021 year-end call. With me today are Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. And with that, welcome. I wanted to thank you for joining, and wish everybody a happy Chinese New Year starting today, the year of the Tiger. We, at Alexandria, are very honored and pleased to report on a truly historical -- historic and remarkable fourth quarter and 2021 year-end results, really demonstrating operational and strategic excellence by really each and every metric. And what I think is truly unique and audacious is that Alexandria has operated during this past 2 years, the 2021 -- 2020 and 2021 will be known as the COVID era, really at the highest operational tempo ever and as the sophistication and scale that few REITs could ever accomplish.  And in the words of Jim Collins, Alexandria has truly achieved 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And I want to thank profoundly each and every one of the extraordinary Alexandria family team members on a sensational performance during 2021. Napoleon I said, strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle. And over the last 25 years, we came public in May 97. So we'll have our 25th anniversary in May. We took this small company public 3 years after we started it with $19 million Series A. And as of the end of the year, December 31, 2021, we had reached a phenomenal total market cap of $44 billion. For the period of COVID, the 2020 and 2021, Alexandria's TSR approximated 45-plus percent, exceeding by a wide margin in the office index with a total return of minus 0.5%. And since our IPO 25 years ago in May '97, we've been proud and fortunate that our total shareholder return has exceeded 2,500%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 and office REIT indices at 939% and 552%, respectively. And we're always playing the long game. Speaking about fourth quarter and year-end, very robust results. Our life science markets, as evidenced by our fourth quarter and full year results, truly were a blowout in many respects and most of which in -- as clearly highlighted, has been leasing. And that really sets us up nicely for a very strong 2022 and beyond. The continued robust demand from really 1 of the most innovative and transformative industries in the United States, the life science industry, one which is not really cyclical, but which is event driven, I think, does set us up and enables us, our brand and our talented and special operational lab space, affords us a very strong pricing power in each of our cluster markets. And really, in many ways, sets us up to have a very strong earnings growth year here in 2022 and into '23 and '24.  We continue to create highly accretive value creation opportunities to meet the current demand of over our 850 innovative tenants and importantly, provide a path for future growth. And although we've reiterated 2022 guidance, and Dean will speak more about that in a moment, the $8.26 to $8.46 FFO per share, we will clearly revisit and update that in the first quarter earnings release. We have very strong momentum at our backs. As most of you know and we often comment, with 10,000 known diseases to human kind, less than 10% really have addressable therapies today, and we are truly in the early days of the golden age of biotechnology and biology. Advances in innovation are happening at unprecedented speed and driving human health and quality of life in a positive direction. Steve Jobs commented many years ago when he predicted he thought that the biggest innovations of the 21st century would be the integration of biology and technology. We've achieved historic milestones in many respects. And hopefully, you enjoyed the press release and supplement where we tried to highlight those in both graphical and word form truly. And others will speak about this in a moment, the highest leasing volume in the company's history, 9.5 million square feet, just an awesome achievement. Doubled annual revenues. At our 2017 Investor Day, we gave a framework that we would hope to double annual rental revenues in 5 years, and we exceeded that about 1.5 years ahead of time. We also concluded the largest acquisition in the company's history during 2021, our entry into the Fenway submarket and over 1 million square feet was leased to our longtime tenant and very close relationship, Moderna. And I would say probably most importantly, and I think Dean, Peter and Steve will probably all comment on this, our historically high and strong leasing value-creation pipeline really foreshadows outside growth coming for the -- coming into the upcoming years, including 2022. Nearly 8 million rentable square feet under construction are expected to commence over the next 6 quarters to generate over $610 million of incremental annual revenue, we think really sets us up in an extraordinary fashion. So with that, let me turn it over to Steve for some important commentary. Thank you very much, and let's open it up for questions, please. Yes. Sheila. Let me start your couple of questions in North Carolina. We have substantially increased our holdings there in a number of ways and recent land parcels are aimed at creating and expanding -- actually expanding the mega campus, which was the former Glaxo campus there that we bought and have turned into kind of a mega campus, if you will, that will be well over 1 million square feet. Leasing has been very, very strong there, and we're adding some adjacent land to expand that campus and the capabilities there. You asked about what's driving the demand in North Carolina, particularly in the triangle. And I think you could argue -- it goes back to our thesis when we started the company that, clusters are really by 4 factors: one, you got to have a there's there, here's here, so to speak. So the Triangle is they're there, here's here, anchored by North Carolina, UNC, Duke and North Carolina State.  The talent base is a second critical factor and one, as you know, there's kind of a war for talent across America in corporate America, even in just average individual-owned companies, small businesses I guess, as you would call them, with so many people leaving the workforce. And North Carolina has an amazing blend of great talent and highly trained skilled people, especially for life science, agricultural tech and certainly technology industries. The third factor is risk capital. There's a good abundance of capital in that market that are fueling companies. And then finally, there's a real plethora of scientific and technical -- you might say, technology where translational work is coming out of the labs and moving into companies.  So those are the 4 things that are really driving. And also next-gen manufacturing is found North Carolina to be an important place. I think Lilly announced today, they're building a billion campus, I think just outside Charlotte, a little surprised it wasn't closer to the Triangle, but they also have operations there. But that's what's driving North Carolina. In San Diego -- I think you asked about San Diego was the second location? Yes, that is a -- Dean has been working on that for quite a while. That is a really great location in the heart of University Town Center, which has been a hallmark of our presence down there since probably 1998 and an attempt to create a mini campus there in a really great location driven by -- heavily by great transport. And obviously, you know the history of the San Diego market, San Diego has really emerged as 1 of the top markets with a great talent base and really strong capital base, strong scientific prowess and obviously, the land there has been very cherished. And I think the final market you asked about was Texas. So for a variety of legal reasons, I can't say anything until the first quarter, and we'll talk about that. But much like New York, when we started in New York, we really spent before we opened the Alexandria Center for Life Science in 2010, we had started an effort in New York back in 2001 as part of Sandy Wild's effort to bring commercial life science to New York City, where none literally existed.  And I would say the same is true of Texas. Literally, no real presence of commercial life science down there today, but our intent is to create a market and really bring early-stage commercial life science to Texas, much like we did in New York. So with that, hopefully, long-winded answer. Yes, Jamie. Thanks for your question. It\u2019s a really good question. So remember, and I said in my earnings commentary just a few minutes ago, the industry is not a cyclical industry. The mature companies have large amounts of revenue and operate at scale and aren\u2019t really influenced by the cyclicality in any way quite like the very interest rate sensitive industries are. So that\u2019s number one.  Number two, you have to remember that this industry, hopefully, the compression time for bringing new therapies to market to address so many really terrible things that we don\u2019t currently have therapies for \u2013 takes a number of years. It\u2019s not like tech where you can create a software program and bring it out instantaneously. So when we met and began our work with Moderna was 2011, that was a pretty tough year, as I recall. We were just getting our investment grade rating. As I remember, Steve, I always said we didn\u2019t have a single tour at Mission Bay for maybe 18 months and the capital markets were pretty, pretty bleak. So we think long term. So investing now for the future, there\u2019s \u2013 this is a good time to do it especially as Peter said, the new modalities will change the face of, I think, health care of the future. So we\u2019re very bullish on that. And I\u2019m not sure what more I can say, but interest rates and the economy really are \u2013 you have to obviously pay attention. We\u2019re very mindful. We certainly lived through a number of ups and downs, the \u201899, 2000 tech bust and then the \u201808, \u201809 financial meltdown. So we\u2019re pretty judicious about what we do and how we do it, but we\u2019re out there looking for the next Moderna\u2019s. For sure. I mean, yes, the \u2013 it certainly is well recognized that the public markets have had major adjustments in valuations over the last, say, 3 quarters. I think that\u2019s starting to leak into the private market because a number of companies who have clinical programs are selling at cash, which is a bargain today. So investors are looking at those with big appetites. So I think you\u2019ll see some of that froth go out of the private markets. My guess is you\u2019re seeing the same thing on the tech side as well. Public markets are resetting valuations in the private markets. But truly great companies are going to get funded. There\u2019s a huge amount of venture that\u2019s been raised over the past couple of years, gigantic amounts, historic amounts. And those are investable dollars for the coming handful of years that those aren\u2019t running out anytime soon. Well, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to repeat the high watermark of 9.5 million square feet for 2021 on over 4 million square feet for 4Q. But as I think Peter and Steve has said, we have a huge wind at our back. We\u2019ve got over 850 innovative tenants most of whom we service for their current demand and future growth. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable about where we are. And certainly, our value creation pipeline super highly leased. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at risk, but we\u2019re mindful. I mean, if Russia invades the Ukraine, then things are going to change pretty rapidly for everybody, right? Well, I think I'll let Dean answer that, but I think the commentary is we try to be conservative with how we project the future until we start to see things roll out, December was a record-breaking leasing year. We have a good amount of leasing on the precipice of happening. And I think we feel pretty good we gave a range, and I think you'll see us go forward in the first quarter and give you a fulsome update.  But Dean, do you want to make any comments on that? Yes. So maybe, Dean, do you want to comment on that first and maybe let Peter give color. Yes. So Dean, could you maybe just highlight the historical equity level to say a lot of -- Yes. I think, Michael, the point of that is we were at an all-time high, and we felt very comfortable in taking the market risk of issuing equity, especially before a pretty \u2013 what\u2019s likely to shape up is a pretty volatile year. NAV is a little bit like beauty. It\u2019s in the minds of the beholder. And I think that we felt at that point, we were very comfortable issuing equity at that level. Let\u2019s just put that point to rest. I didn\u2019t say that, Peter giving a view on an asset-by-asset basis, but at an all-time high, issuing the equity we did. We felt very good about what we\u2019re doing and the accretive uses we could put that equity too. I think it's primarily acquisitions, but Dean, you could comment. Yes. I think if you remember back to Investor Day, Dan gave a specific example in San Diego, where our mega campus leasing effort was substantially above on a lease rate above a nearby building, which was owned by another REIT and demonstrated that is just kind of a sheer apples-to-apples. And 1 of the reasons it makes a big difference is because it provides not only the highly amenities and tailored services and facilities for tenants, but it gives them a space for growth right now, but a path for future growth in our industry today, that's kind of mission-critical. We do. I don't think we have that in any specific disclosure place. But if we go campus by campus, clearly, we do. Yes. So the answer to your first question, I think, Steve addressed. Generally, on a mark-to-market basis, the portfolio would be about 31% up. So that gives you a good sense of how that would play out. And then when you look at life science companies, pharma, biopharma, small, medium, rent is generally a smaller part of -- I think, Steve or Peter, you guys may have the stats, but a fairly small part of the overall G&A, whereas if you go to service companies, law firms, securities firms, it's a much larger part. But I don't know, Steve or Peter, do you have that percentage in mind? It's sub-5%, I believe. Yes. We've seen that for a decade or more. I mean, Steve, maybe just a tutorial on Mission Bay for a moment, which is kind of where a lot of this started. Yes. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening. I think we won the RFP for the first commercial life science campus in 2005 under Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s direction. We delivered our first building in 2010. And at that point, there was only a single commercial 1 incubator up in the northwest side of Manhattan that had commercial life science tenants. And that was it. Everything else was clinical, academic, but not commercial. And so over the past decade, we\u2019ve built New York. We have our campus today over 800,000 square feet, and we have the prospect of going significantly more. We\u2019ve got some 60-plus companies there, only 1 of which really existed before we started the campus in the city. And so the New York City market is still \u2013 it\u2019s a small company market. It\u2019s a small market. We felt that it was a good one to enter because of our cluster model and the drivers. But if you look at last year, there were only about 250,000 square feet of new leases. So in Boston, that\u2019s probably a day\u2019s work. So you have to look at it with respect to all of the clusters. And it still is \u2013 it\u2019s a 25-year gestation period, as I\u2019ve said, to build a cluster. And we\u2019re just now entering the second decade. So New York has got a long way to go.  And over the past couple of years, New York has been a tough slog with crime and civil disturbances and things like that. So that\u2019s been a challenge. Big companies aren\u2019t going to go to New York, New York State because of high taxes. So it remains a small company market. We\u2019re committed, and you build it from the ground up. Well, thank you, everybody. We look forward to updating you on our first quarter call. Be safe. Take care."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on the value creation pipeline. I'm going to discuss what we're seeing with construction costs and supply chain issues and summarize our fourth quarter asset sales, which should bring to light the great opportunity investors have right now to benefit from the disconnect between our stock price and NAV due to overlooking the strength of our fundamentals and the reality on the ground in favor of macro themes. Just look at our quarterly and annual performance, even in volatile times, we've been able to post exceptional results. Less than a handful of REITs can operate at the scale of operational excellence, and even fewer have a dominant share in each of their major markets, a high-quality tenant base and own the vast majority of a scarce asset class. Investors seem to be missing this. Projects that are either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters are projected to deliver greater than $610 million in incremental rental revenues, primarily from the first quarter of this year through 2024. What Joel and others termed as the Golden Age of biotech today and during Investor Day, due to the accelerating discovery and development of effective new modalities, such as cell gene and RNA and DNA therapies, continue to accelerate demand for life science real estate throughout the year and especially in the fourth quarter, resulting in Alexandria shattering a number of leasing records, including the total annual and quarterly leasing volumes of our development and redevelopment pipeline. In addition to this outstanding leasing, our best-in-class development teams have done a tremendous job continuing to deliver high-quality purpose-built laboratory space to our tenants on time and on budget, even in challenging environments, which I'll touch on in a moment. During the year, we delivered a little over 2 million square feet in 14 projects with at least 1 project located in each of our core markets, illustrative of the depth and breadth of demand we see in all of our markets. During the quarter, we delivered 600,000 square feet, spanning 10 of those markets, which when fully delivered, will add approximately $34 million in NOI to our bottom line. Stabilized yields for these projects averaged 6.2% on a cash basis, which is a very healthy spread to the cap rates we are seeing in our partial interest sales, which I will also discuss later. Our current projects under construction are largely pre-committed with 75% of the space leased and 82% leased or under negotiation. Near-term projects expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters totaled 10.2 million square feet and are already 67% leased and 83% leased or under negotiation.  These projects include ground-up development at Arsenal on the Charles, a development in the Seaport submarket of Boston at 15 Necco, which is fully committed; 2 ground-up projects at Torrey Pines that will aggregate properties on North Torrey Pines Road and adjacent streets into our new 1 Alexandria Square Mega campus; 2 fully committed ground-up developments at Alexandria\u2019s Point Mega campus in the UTC; and 3 ground-up developments at our Alexandria Center for Life Science Mega campus that are 89% committed in aggregate. Truly a remarkable pipeline to fuel earnings growth for years to come. We continue to monitor construction costs and supply chain disruptions with a laser focus. As reported in past calls, 2021 was a very challenging environment with overall cost indexes indicating a full year inflation of 13-plus percent, driven largely by materials costs and a lack of available labor. Conversations with general contractors and examination of industry reports are consistent in concluding that things are improving. And it's expected that as factories, ports and logistics issues settle down, materials pricing will become favorable. Expectations are things will remain elevated in 2022, but we will see a return to normal in 2023. For example, according to IHS Global Insight, steel increased by approximately 27% in 2021, but is expected to increase by approximately 14% this year before decreasing by 13% in 2023 and again by 9% in 2024. Almost every material line item tracked by IHS is expected to start decreasing in price by 2023, with the remaining items increasing at historic inflation rates. The bigger risk we face is delay caused by supply chain problems. A poll of our project managers indicated that although we have some problems with items we typically include in our core and shell development, such as generators being delayed by 6 to 8 months, we are, by and large, able to mitigate delays by making early commitments on design and equipment specifications, a luxury we have because of our years of experience in developing life science buildings, enabling us to make quick decisions based on proven standards we have developed over 2 decades.  A status few others have and the result has been no material delays in the core and shell delivery of our project. Experience matters.  However, it's a different story with FF&E, which puts most of the burden on our tenants. Things like benches and other fixtures such as glass watching equipment are tough to get right now. Fortunately, we're able to leverage our scale and relationships for our tenants and ensure the advantages we have and nurture their benefit, so they can get up and running with little inconvenience. In the fourth quarter, we completed the previously disclosed recapitalization of 1,500 Owens at 409/499 Illinois in Mission Bay and completed partial interest sales at 50-60 Binney in Cambridge, 455 Mission Bay Boulevard and 1,700 Owens in Mission Bay with the Binney assets raising nearly $800 million in proceeds at a sub-4% cap rate, realizing a profit of approximately $450 million over cash invested, and the Mission Bay assets raising nearly $400 million of capital while achieving a 3.8% cap rate. We also sold our 49% interest in our Menlo Gateway Tech Office Project, generating almost $400 million in proceeds and achieving a profit of a little over $100 million in just under a 5-year hold period. Overall, these sales generated $1.97 million in proceeds at an average cap rate of 4.3% and a per square foot value of $1,497.  When you put that into the context of yesterday's $194.84 closing price of our stock, which implies a per square foot value of our operating assets of only $906. It supports my earlier statement about a disconnect between the stock price and the reality on the ground. High-quality life science assets with high-quality tenants are scarce, and we have hundreds of them. We are a bargain right now. With that, I'll pass it over to Dean. It's the same back of the napkin formula we used a while back when I was commenting on this kind of once the stock implied per foot doesn't match up with our asset sales. And you just take our total market cap at the close -- or I'm sorry, at the end of the year of about $39.5 billion and then you take out our CIP from our developments, our venture assets and our cash and restricted cash, and that gives you the estimated value of our properties divided by our operating square footage. So that's plus or minus, I'm sure, it's not completely specific, but it's in the ballpark. Even if it was way off, there's still a huge disconnect. Yes. So Dean, maybe --"

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Dean here. Good afternoon, everyone. 2021 was a historic and record year of financial and operating performance for Alexandria. We are very well positioned for another exceptional year. We are the go-to brand. Our team delivers a very high level of operational excellence. We benefit from our important and strategic life science industry relationships plus over 850 tenant relationships. We generate strong core growth through same-property NOI growth. We have tremendous visibility into future growth with $610 million of incremental annual rental revenue from our value creation pipeline. Our team has delivered consistent execution of bottom line FFO per share growth year-to-year, and we have 1 of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry. We reported total revenues of $2.1 billion, up 12.1% over 2020 and FFO per share as adjusted per diluted share of $7.76 for the full year, outperforming our initial outlook for 2021 by $0.06 per share. 2021 generated many financial metrics that reflect outperformance relative to our initial guidance for the year, which I'll cover throughout my commentary. Core growth in key financial statistics were exceptional. Growth in cash NOI of $280 million to $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter annualized was supported by 1 of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 51% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade rated or large-cap public companies. We had an industry-leading EBITDA margin of 71%, highlighting efficient execution by our team. We had 100 basis points growth in occupancy for the full year of 2021, excluding the impact of vacancy from recently acquired properties. Now importantly, 48% of the 1.8 million rentable square feet of vacancy from recently acquired properties is expected to commence occupancy and rental revenue over the next 2 quarters. That's pretty amazing execution by our team. Now turning to 2022. The midpoint of our occupancy guidance is 95.5%, which is 150 basis points higher than occupancy of 94% as of 12/31/21. Now demand for space from our life science industry relationships and tenant relationships drove record leasing volume with over 9.5 million rentable square feet executed, double the rentable square feet of leases executed annually in recent years. And we achieved record rental rate growth of 37.6% and 22.6% on a cash basis. Now rental rate growth outperformed our initial outlook for 2021 by 740 basis points and 510 basis points above the midpoint of the range of our guidance, again, pretty spectacular results. And importantly, for 2022, we expect continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space at roughly 32.5% and 20% on a cash basis at the midpoint of our guidance. Same-property NOI growth was very strong for 2021 at 4.2% and 7.1% on a cash basis. GAAP rental rate growth was about double and cash results were up about 40%, above the midpoint of our initial outlook for 2021. Our outlook for 2022 same-property NOI growth at the midpoint of our guidance is also very strong at 6.5% and 7.5% on a cash basis, above our strong performance in 2021 and reflects 170 basis point growth in same-property occupancy for 2022. Now leasing activity in the fourth quarter continued to reflect a very favorable environment for Alexandria. Occasionally, though, there is a lease or 2 that skews this particular statistic in the quarter. The fourth quarter included lease extensions with 2 tenants with higher tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions. But the key takeaway is that net effective rent, which is GAAP rent less the impact of tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions, is up 50% on average for these leases. Now TIs and leasing commissions for lease renewals and releasing of space, excluding these leases was about $34 per square foot and consistent with historical amounts.  Now we are in an outstanding position today with tremendous visibility for future growth in annual rental revenue of over $610 million from 7.4 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are 80% leased or under executed LOI or advanced lease negotiations. Now what truly stands out as exceptional is that 94% of the 7.4 million rentable square feet that is leased or negotiating is from existing relationships, highlighting the strength of our brand, operational excellence, our mega campus offerings and many other features. Now during 2021, we completed a record level of leasing with 3.9 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment space leased, including a whopping 1.8 million rentable square feet in the fourth quarter. We delivered about 2 million square feet of development and redevelopment projects in the year with about $1.6 billion in basis that was on average completed in July of 2021. Now looking forward, NOI from development and redevelopment projects is expected to increase significantly in 2022 in comparison to 2021, and we expect significant year-over-year increases in NOI from development and redevelopment projects to continue into 2023. Turning to venture investments. The investments performed really well in 2021 and generated $216 million in realized gains, including $106 million that was included in FFO per share. Now unrealized gains as of December 31 was almost $800 million, up about $44 million from the beginning of the year. And looking forward into 2022, venture investment gains, we expect to include an FFO per share, should be relatively consistent with 2021 at roughly flat to up 10%. Turning to our balance sheet. Looking back, actually, it was about 10 years ago that our team completed our debut investment-grade bond offering of 10-year notes at 4.66%. Now 10 years later, our team is very pleased with Alexandria's corporate rating that ranks in the top 10% of the REIT industry. So congratulations, team. Now thinking about where rates are today, we could issue 10-year bonds at an all-in rate just under 3% today, highlighting very attractive long-term fixed rate debt for our company. In October, S&P upgraded our credit rating outlook to positive, highlighting our unique and differentiated business model, strong brand and execution, high-quality cash flows and strong credit profile among many other items. Now we met or exceeded our strong balance sheet goals with net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at 5.2x and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.3x, and we ended 2021 with over $3.8 billion in liquidity. Now turning to guidance. There were no changes in the detailed disclosures for 2021 guidance. We reaffirmed our strong outlook for 2022, included EPS diluted ranging from $2.65 to $2.85 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted ranging from $8.26 to $8.46. Now as a reminder, please refer to Page 8 of our supplemental information for detailed underlying assumptions included in our guidance for 2022. And with that, I'll turn it back to Joel. Yes. Maybe just to somewhat reiterate what you said, Joel, Rich, the way to think about it, we had good tailwinds behind us last year -- this time last year, as we started '21, and we were able to outperform a lot of our underlying guidance assumptions, including overall bottom line FFO per share. We're off to a great start at the very beginning of 2022 with good tailwinds behind us. So we're pretty optimistic, but stay tuned, I guess. Yes, Rich. I wish there was a simple answer to help for your modeling. But as you can imagine, every transaction is very unique and specific. And the component of operating relative to value creation is also very unique. So there's nothing general that I could guide you towards. We did include, though, for modeling in our acquisition disclosures, in the footnote there, there is a breakdown of how much NOI was brought on board for the current quarter acquisitions and the exact date on a weighted average basis that, that was added for the fourth quarter. So at least you have the NOI to model, but the basis is much harder to get to, Rich. Sure, Joel. So Michael, I think what you described at a super high level, generally has been a challenge that the growing company like Alexandria has faced. As you know, as we grow cash flows pretty consistently quarter-to-quarter take the macro environment way, our stock price should be higher the next quarter. If we wait too long to use stock then we have an equity overhang. So I think \u2013 what we\u2019ve tried to do, Michael, is to be balanced here. I think Peter\u2019s commentary from time to time is just to highlight the opportunity on the stock price performance. Hopefully, it catches the attention of investors. While we do our job to execute the business and do it as best we can to grow cash flows in a prudent way and fund it in a reasonable way with both debt equity as well as proceeds from dispositions. So yes, I think on average, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job being mindful of that overall challenge and opportunity in front of us. We are making money as we invest our capital at the price points that we have raised both debt equity as well as recycling capital from dispositions. So there\u2019s a balance we need to navigate that I think you\u2019re pointing out. Yes, that\u2019s important, too. And Michael, you might remember this from Investor Day, we had touched on just looking back at how much equity do we \u2013 common equity do we use to fund our growth. We all know that at our leverage profile at a stabilized basis, an asset might require 65-plus percent of equity, the remainder being debt funded. And if you compare that to what we\u2019ve done historically, we\u2019re actually only using about 40% to 42% of common equity to fund growth. And what that\u2019s highlighting is tremendous cash flow is being reinvested in the business, which for $22 million is north of $300 million, but we\u2019re also taking advantage of recycling capital from high-value, low cap rate partial interest transactions and then EBITDA growth gives us some incremental benefit as well. So I think that also just highlights that we\u2019re being very disciplined in our approach, trying to minimize the amount of common equity we issue while being mindful. We want to keep our balance sheet in a super strong position. So the acquisitions have been driving almost every quarter, face rate declines in reported occupancy. But if you strip that out, Michael, pretty consistently every quarter or 2, we're driving growth in overall occupancy. As an example, we highlighted in 2021, we had a 100 basis point increase in occupancy, if you exclude vacancy from recently acquired properties. And I think I highlighted in my commentary that we do expect, if you put any future acquisitions to decide that we can't model because we're not aware of them, we're expecting 150 basis point growth in occupancy in 2022. And I would suspect that given the tailwinds for our business and our portfolio here, that could continue looking out beyond '22 as well. Tom, it\u2019s Dean here. There are projects beyond that 2.6 million square feet that is currently disclosed at 89% lease negotiating. So those are the projects that could start over the next 6 quarters. In addition, to be real clear here, we expect the potential for other starts. But we just wanted to highlight in these disclosures here that we\u2019ve got a very active pipeline under either leased or advanced negotiations. It just highlights how much we\u2019re working closely with our relationships to meet their current and future space needs."

            "name": "Steve Richardson",
            "content": "Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. Steve Richardson here. 2021 was indeed a year of historic demand, as Joel has just outlined in the life science industry. And for leasing milestones from the Alexandria team, the 9.5 million square feet of total leasing was a record shattering figure and the 4.1 million square feet during Q4 alone doubled the previous highest quarterly leasing run rate. The highlight, however, may have been the 3.8 million square feet of leasing in the value creation, development and redevelopment pipeline with the emphasis on quality. We had 2 large-scale ground-up Class 8 plus facilities featuring long-term leases to credit tenants. The 462,000 rentable square foot facility at 325 Binney leased to Moderna for their lab headquarters and the 231,000 rentable square foot facility at 751 Gateway for Genentech Roche's lab facility were ably led by our teams on the ground in Greater Boston and the San Francisco Bay Area. And important to note, both Moderna and Genentech Roche are long-time lab tenants of Alexandria, and a hearty shout out as well to our teams for a superb year during 2021. We also look to the metric we don't normally analyze but consider the following: the 9.5 million square feet of total leasing provides in excess of $6 billion of contractual triple-net base rents. $6 billion of contractual base rents are a significant financial metric, but maybe more important is the market reality of this leasing success. The meaningful expansion of the formidable moat the Alexandria team has carefully and strategically created since the company's inception 28 years ago. Also, consider that this 9.5 million square feet of total leasing comprised 318 lease transactions with 280 different life science tenants in our core clusters. This dynamic activity could not be a starker contrast with other entities and random groups who may be leasing 25,000 to 50,000 square feet and occasionally 100,000 square feet here or there to a handful of life science tenants oftentimes outside of our core clusters.  As an investor, the value proposition offered by Alexandria is very clear. We are laser focused on the life science industry. This is not a side car or a new initiative for the company. And as we continue to execute on creative and long-standing relationships to drive growth in our core markets, the dominant presence of our brand and mega campuses provides a singularly compelling story in the life science real estate market with our stellar reputation for delivery of high-quality, on-time and on-budget infrastructure and incomparable complex lab operations. Now let me elaborate on a few additional highlights for our milestone late in 2021. The core continues to outperform with impressive renewal and re-leasing spreads of 22.6% cash and 37.9% GAAP during 2021. And we have significant embedded upside with mark-to-market now at 31% plus. This is nearly double the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of Q4 2020. AR for 2021 was 99.9%, huge kudos to our best-in-class operations teams for their continued close relationships with our tenants throughout COVID, these past 2 years. Early renewals during 2021 were 82% compared with our historical 71% rate. And the exceptional health of Alexandria's value creation pipeline at scale, 7.4 million square feet is 1 of the largest and highest quality pipelines amongst our REITs. We've increased the lease negotiating percentage to 83%, and Peter will comment on the details later, has significantly derisked the delivering of the incremental revenues of $610 million noted on Page 34 of the supp. Let me turn to supply and demand for a moment. On demand, as we've highlighted throughout the recent Investor Day presentation and these fresh statistics clearly indicate, Alexandria's compelling by proposition for tenant base at our unique mega campuses has enabled us to capture not only a very large market share but also the highest quality tenants in our core clusters. And as we analyze supply, again, we do not foresee any major supply disruptions during 2022 and 2023.  And the delivery of large-scale supply actually materializing is highly uncertain during 2024 and beyond for other potential new entrants. They face entitlement risk, operational risk for tenants considering unproven landlords, capital market risk with the recent increased volatility related to construction starts, supply chain risk as they consider plunging into a new technical and complicated product type and the very significant underwriting risk posed by the nature of the biotechnology in your street. So we are monitoring supply closely, but consider these risks to be very strong headwinds for others. So in conclusion, as we start 2022 with enthusiasm for the highly disruptive therapies for huge unmet medical needs on the horizon by our more than 850 innovative tenants, we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaula Schwartz: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everyone to Alexandria\u2019s third quarter \u201921 earnings call and our seventh consecutive quarter in the COVID-19, which for sure has forever changed our world and our lives in very fundamental ways. With me today are, Jenna Foger, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. In honor of my favorite NCAA Basket Ball Coach and in his final year as Head Coach for Duke men's basketball, Coach K has said imagination has a great deal to do with winning. And I'd like to say to our extraordinary Alexandria family, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for a spectacular third quarter, and operational pace and execution tempo that really defines the terms operational excellence, and for your great imagination as Coach K said in all things big and small. Moving on the keys to Alexandria's stellar third quarter performance by all metrics amid a historic demand environment, I think, and importantly, the best is yet to come. Continuing historic high demand for Alexandria's best-in-class lab space, the niche which we invented, and our mission-critical and operationally excellent lab operations. Year-to-date, and others will talk about this, we've leased 5.4 million square feet and looking for a great fourth quarter to end the year. Alexandria is at the vanguard in the heart of meeting this historic high in an unprecedented immediate lab space demand from many of our over 750 client tenants. Moderna is a prime example, and another one which Dean will talk about, a big tenant in South San Francisco for a full building, as well as critical paths for future growth which is so needed. Thus the need for acquisitions, redevelopment and developments, and has been repeated time and time again, by life science tenants and their brokers, if any other company is going up against Alexandria for leasing space, the tenant will almost always pick Alexandria. We are proud to partner with Moderna on their Cambridge headquarters and core R&D facility. And as Dean and others will talk about, it'll be the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge with very strong economics and really great value creation. We're very honored and proud that Alexandria has had very strategically significant tenant relationships, and stellar brand reputation across all of our cluster markets. We're also very fortunate to continue to have to truly demonstrate pricing power in each of our core cluster markets. And by the way, the war for talent, like other industries in the life science industry is creating an even greater space need, set of space needs and demands in the core key Life Science clusters and that is very good for Alexandria. And we see an accelerating leasing demand even above and beyond what we see this quarter in several of our key cluster markets continuing. Rental rate growth continues strongly and excess supply is not a current threat. Alexandria's differentiated expertise and unique platform with its compelling internal and external growth drivers and outlook translates into genuine earnings power. As indicated in the press release and supplemental, our visible multi-year highly leased development pipeline is expected to generate approximately $615 million in future incremental revenue. And beyond that the future leasing prospects really look extraordinary as I've said. The biotech boom and historic Life Science demand driven by the strong industry fundamentals is evident. The 21st century is really the biological century as biology is in transition from an empirical science of trial and error to really an [indiscernible 0:05:19.8] science with much more predictable and scalable outcomes. We're witnessing the industrial revolution in biotech. As we accelerate the application of new and innovative tools, we will see an acceleration in value creation. Products will come to market faster, for less capital and with fewer failures. The Life Science industry and its ecosystem and its positive impact on humanity is truly a crown jewel of the United States, and a testament to the free enterprise system of innovation. I think it's important to remember politically, those who seek to create a cradle to grave entitlement society should not use this industry as if fully covered. And then finally, I want to turn to the second anniversary of our OneFifteen Project in Dayton, Ohio, which this month we celebrate. Sad to say that overdoses have claimed a staggering 96,000 lives during the 12-months ended March of 2021, up 30% increase in the year before.  OneFifteen is an innovative data-driven non-profit evidence-based healthcare ecosystem dedicated to the full and sustained recovery of people with addiction and as I said, Dayton, Ohio, OneFifteen is revolutionizing the way addiction is treated through its tech enabled care platform, which applies analytics to measure the effectiveness of various treatments, and choices throughout the full continuum of care, and continuously evolves its approach based on insights derived. Since its opening in 2015, OneFifteen has served almost 4,000 individuals struggling with addiction, and conducted over 9,000 telehealth visits since the start of COVID-19 pandemic. With our OneFifteen partners, we\u2019re unwavering in our commitment to help people recover from addiction, live healthier lives, while revitalizing the community. We would like to see this model replicated across the country. But politicians seem wholly ineffective, even given the large amount of capital that came to the cities and states during COVID-19. And our goal is not only to have OneFifteen be a model for the success against opioid addiction, Dayton, Ohio. We hope to bring that model in a varied way to address the homeless crisis on the Wes Coast. And so, with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jenna Foger, who's going to comment on some important COVID-19 matters, the NIH and the FDA. Take it away, Jenna.\nJenna Foger: Thank you so much, Joes, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin to turn a new corner on this COVID-19 pandemic, which I'll speak to in a moment, life science industry fundamentals as Joes highlighted continue to be very strong, and provide the industry with the unique structural integrity to weather broader market volatility and cyclicality. The confidence of these drivers and key advances in our understanding of biology and next generation modalities will continue to fuel life science demands well into the future. So, as we spoke about last quarter, owing to the expediency at which the industry and our tenants move to protect the country in the world, we now have the tools and a roadmap at our disposal to end this pandemic, while also ushering in a historic new era for biotech and scientific innovation are none. So turning to our COVID-specific updates, by the numbers according to the World Health Organization, there has been a staggering 242 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, about 20% of these reported in the U.S. alone, including over 4.9 million cumulative deaths. In the U.S., the incidence of new COVID-19 cases has welcomingly declined over 55% from its recent September peak of over 160,000 new cases to now 70,000 new cases, and we hope to see this trend and decline continue, of course. Three of the most widely distributed vaccines worldwide and authorized by the FDA has been developed by [indiscernible 0:09:36.3], Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson. And roughly 67% of the vaccine eligible population in our country that's 12 and over have been fully vaccinated. So this is just over 57% of the total U.S. population. And we hope with boosters and expanding indications that this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to rise. As we saw last week, the FDA authorized the use of Moderna and Johnson and Johnson boosters, in addition to Pfizer's already authorized booster shots, as well as the mixing and matching of booster doses between Pfizer Moderna and J&J in eligible populations. In light of the evolving data on the duration of immunity and COVID-19 variants concerns, including the common Delta variant, and now the Delta plus variants hitting U.S. soil, it's highly likely that COVID-19 vaccines will be required long-term. With regard to vaccine efficacy, in a study evaluating the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines at preventing symptomatic illness, the Moderna vaccine had an efficacy rate of 96% and Pfizer at 89%. So as we've all heard, breakthrough infections have occurred in a high single digit percentage of vaccinated population. But, while current vaccines may not entirely prevent transmission or contraction of COVID-19, they do significantly prevent severe disease and deaths, with over 90% of all hospitalized COVID cases represented by unvaccinated individuals. With regard to vaccine safety, there have been very few vaccine related adverse events, less than seven per million reported overall, with nearly all cases resolving and without long-term side effects reported to-date. Given such a strong efficacy and safety profile, the FDA granted full approval for Pfizer's mRNA-based vaccine for people 16 and older, and Moderna\u2019s mRNA-based vaccine is likely to achieve full approval for its vaccine for 18 and older in the fourth quarter. With regard to pregnancy in women of childbearing age, based on the safety data generated to-date and how we know vaccines work in the body, the CDC and top health officials have encouraged any Americans who was pregnant, planning to become pregnant or currently breastfeeding to get vaccinated against the Coronavirus as soon as possible. With regard to children, Pfizer reported that its COVID-19 vaccine for ages 5 to 11 was safe and nearly 91% effective. And on the basis of this data, the FDA is expected to authorize Pfizer's vaccine for this population in the fourth quarter. Moderna also just announced yesterday that its COVID vaccine is both safe and highly effective in children ages 6 to 11, which they will also submit to the FDA. For young children ages six months to four years, vaccine authorization will likely come in early 2022. So despite these advances in vaccines, given that COVID will likely remain on the planet for the foreseeable future, albeit as an endemic virus, with seasonal and sporadic geographic peaks therapies are going to continue to be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19. And so most notably this past month, Alexandria tenant Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics submitted an EUA application to the FDA for oral antiviral molnupiravir.  This drug demonstrated a 50% reduction in hospitalization or death in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. If authorized, molnupiravir will be the first oral antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is a big deal. It's far easier and more cost effective to administer broadly compared to current antibody treatments in the mild and moderate COVID-19 population. So despite the COVID fatigue that we all absolutely feel on the multitude of challenges that this pandemic has placed on our countries or society and the world, of course, the scientific advances achieved at an unprecedented speed is the one saving grace of this tragic period in our history. The scientific attitude and adaptability of so many of our tenants to translate their broad platforms, and decades of work into safe and effective vaccines, therapies and testing in really a year's time is remarkable. And application of these tools will forever transform the way we develop vaccines against novel targets. It will also augment future surveillance testing and our nation's pandemic preparedness overall. So, to touch on another topic on the NIH and FDA leadership, the pandemic has also underscored how critical these agencies are, and that solid support for these key federal agencies is paramount for national security, for ensuring that the U.S. maintains its leadership in advancing scientific and biomedical innovation, and for maximizing our ability to address current and future health challenges. So interestingly, over the past several weeks the leadership positions at these two agencies have received increasing attention. On October 5, long tenured NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins announced that he would be stepping down as the Director of the agency by the end of the year. Dr. Collins is the longest serving presidentially appointed NIH Director, having served three U.S. Presidents over more than 12-years. During his tenure, the NIH has received increasing bipartisan support, and the agency's budget grew from $30 billion in 2009, when he started to nearly $50 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. The Biden administration is undergoing a formal process to name Collins replacement, which is expected later this year or more likely early next, and we're optimistic that his successor will continue to bolster biomedical and public health research in this country. As for the FDA, Acting Commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock has led the agency since the beginning of the Biden administration. Under her leadership in addition to the COVID-related emergencies authorizations that I just spoke about, the FDA\u2019s CDER has approved 40 new molecular entities through the third quarter, putting the agency on pace in the 2020s near record high of 53 approvals. So because Dr. Janet Woodcock sort of fires on November 15, the administration now needs to select and appoint a new Commissioner in the coming weeks. So similarly, on October 14, the Biden administration announced that it\u2019s likely to nominate Dr. Robert Califf as the next Commissioner of the FDA. Dr. Califf is a Cardiologist by training, and current Head of Clinical Policy and Strategy for Verily and Google Health.  Dr. Califf also served as FDA Commissioner from 2016 to 2017, end of the Obama administration after being appointed Deputy Commissioner in 2015. Dr. Califf is also very well-known and dear to us at Alexandria as a regular participant in the Alexandria Summit for the past several years, and a partner in our OneFifteen Project to address the opioid epidemic, as Joes just spoke about. Dr. Califf's nomination would be viewed very favorably by the life science industry, key investors and stakeholders. Clearly, the strength of the FDA is instrumental for ensuring the continued pace and vitality of biomedical innovation in our country. And I just wanted to highlight, in addition to the COVID-19-related updates that we'll likely see in the fourth quarter, the FDA will also announce a handful of major approval decisions before the end of the year. Decisions that have positive will bring critical new drugs to patients as well as billions of dollars of additional revenue to the sector. For example, Eli Lilly is expected to submit an application for accelerated approval of an Alzheimer's therapy, known as donanemab. And given all the controversy surrounding FDA\u2019s positive approval of Biogen's Aduhelm in the same application, the approval of Lilly's drug would likely inform future approvals in this area. There's also a major decision regarding a new class of drugs for severe atopic dermatitis from Pfizer and AbbVie, and several other awaited approvals for growing biotechs, including the approval of [indiscernible] for the treatment of bipolar disorder from longstanding Alexandria attendant and investment intracellular therapies. So just to wrap up, before I turn it to Steve, I wanted to share a quote from former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb in his new book, uncontrolled spread by COVID-19 cross death and how we can defeat the next pandemic. In his book, Gottlieb writes, the brief history of COVID shows that innovation can't always be predicted, we don't know which platform will yield answers for future threats. As part of our national preparedness, it will be important to stockpile countermeasures to some of the known risks. But it's equally important to support the development of novel technology platforms that have broad applicability over a range of potential threats. The use of mRNA to customize synthetic vaccines show the value of having agile competencies at the ready. These are the technologies we will need to produce our nation's vulnerability. So does this opportune focus and unique ability and responsibility as a life science industry that continues to reaffirm why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and our purpose to help drive this mission-critical industry forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Thank you.\nSteve Richardson: Thank you, Jenna. Good afternoon, everyone. Alexandria\u2019s brand power in the market is not only delivering the exceptional results today that you've seen, but also provides clarity for the potential trajectory of the company's future growth and enhanced dominant position in the life science ecosystem. Peter and I just completed an intensive on the ground tour through a few of our cluster markets. And the energy and enthusiasm for Alexandria's entirety of offerings as an integral part of the life science ecosystem was abundantly evident. The Class A plus quality and the mission-critical nature of the facilities that is so important during this time of COVID-19, coupled with the creation of true renaissance, like science centers on our mega campuses, provides for a set of highly desirable and sought after destinations. And the numbers the team are posting bear out this leadership position. The highlights include superb leasing milestones, year-to-date leasing is 5.4 million square feet. The highest annual leasing run rate in the company's history achieved during just these first three quarters of 2021. And as noted earlier by Joel, featuring the largest lease in the company's history to Moderna at 325 Binney Street for their 462,000 square foot state-of-the art headquarters. It's critical to note two important aspects of this leasing activity. One, it is occurring in our core sub-markets where we have high barriers to entry, low vacancy and a first mover advantage. And two, it is also occurring in the development and redevelopment pipeline at an accelerated rate, with the 1 million square foot of leasing in the segment during Q3 reaching the second highest leasing level for development and redevelopment projects, further validating Alexandria\u2019s strategic and robust acquisition activity during 2021. Let's turn to the strategic expansion of our asset base. Q3 was a very productive quarter with completed acquisitions totaling 5.6 million square feet. And a number of key aspects of this expansion of our asset base include the following: 4.9 million square feet of this total were highly accretive value creation opportunities. We are also able to continue either doubling down in our course of markets, as evidenced by 325 Binney Street or strategically expanding the boundaries of these sub-markets. These critical decisions on acquisitions are informed by our unrivaled network of 750 tenants to meet their current needs and provide a path for future growth. And in total, we have now increased the total asset base from 47 million square feet to 64 million square feet during the past four quarters, a significant increase of 36%. The core is also outperforming as renewal in releasing spreads of 19.3% cash and 35.3% gap during Q3 are impressive. But I also want to underscore and highlight that our mark to market across the portfolio has moved up to 25% on a cash basis today, nearly doubling and significantly up from 13.6% in Q1 of 2019. AR balance of 99.4% in October, continues our hard work there. And we really do have a dream team in the operational realm. And a big shout out to the folks who make this happen every day. Occupancy is increasing. As we've noted throughout the year, we expected occupancy to increase excluding the recently acquired projects with vacancy, we've delivered on those goals. We were at 97.1% as of June 2020, and we're now at 98.5%. Turning to market health, on the demand side, Joel and Jenna highlighted the key components driving demand in the life science industry. However, the seasoned executive Life Science management teams driving this demand are requiring high quality facilities and deeply experienced operational teams, as clearly evidenced by our leasing volume and velocity. These companies are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in life changing therapies, and require exceptional performance from a world-class team and technically sophisticated facilities. Downtime or mistakes that may destroy experiments in years of work are unacceptable risks. Alexandria, as a pioneer of this life science niche has earned a reputation as a trusted partner to provide operational excellence for these mission-critical facilities. On the supply side, as I mentioned earlier, Peter and I recently toured a few of our regions firsthand to also evaluate the competitive supply on a granular level. And it is clear that there is no aggregation of disruptive large scale projects delivering during the 2020 to 2023 timeframe. There are in fact a handful of one-off buildings in the market. But we have seen our qualitatively superior mega campuses compete very well against this type of offering. We are also closely monitoring the potential for projects beyond this timeframe that definitively advances genuine Life Science competition, but in many cases, they require many quarters or even years of entitlement, permitting, and horizontal infrastructure work before any decision to go vertical might be made. So in conclusion, as we close towards the end of 2021, the first three quarters of this year have yielded a tremendously productive foundation to continue the company's integral and indispensable role in the life science ecosystem. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thanks, Steve. Hello, everybody. I'm going to update you all on our high value creation development pipeline and construction cost trends. And then I'm going to comment on our recent partial interest sale in Mission Bay, and some market activity that we believe represents overzealous behavior by new entrants in the life science real estate market that should lead to challenges for such groups. As Joel mentioned in his opening, historic demand for our differentiated life science campuses has continued in the third quarter, and we expect this to continue to at least the near to medium-term, as record levels of government, venture capital and biopharma investment continues to disseminate into Alexandria's cluster markets to discover, develop and manufacture new modality, such as cell, gene and RNA and DNA therapies. The resulting growth of our underlying industry gives us high conviction to continue as an elevated pace of development, redevelopment and to acquire assets to backfill the pipeline we're advancing today. This historic demand paired with our long tenure development experience and expertise, resulted in another outstanding quarter for Alexandria.  We delivered 238,163 square feet spread over six assets, including Arsenal on the Charles in Watertown, which continues to be one of the hottest markets outside of Cambridge, 3160 Porter drive, which is now materially oversubscribed with tenants looking to tap into this unique partnership we have with Stanford, and our two ground up developments in Research Triangle, which are capitalizing on strong demand for research development, manufacturing space from therapeutic and agricultural technology companies. These deliveries will contribute $14.3 million in NOI over the next year. And as Joel and Steve noted in their comments, during the quarter we were very excited to add 325 Binney Street to our under construction pipeline. This new 462,000 square foot high performance development targeting LEED Zero Energy certification showcases Alexandria\u2019s climate resilient design solutions, as well as our mission-critical efforts to catalyze positive change to benefit human health and society. It is 100% leased to Moderna, an example of a highly disruptive and visionary company that has grown with Alexandria since shortly after it was founded. Early on, we identified the team and the transformational potential of its mRNA platform, and we have both invested and provided the company with mission-critical real estate over the past 10-years. This is truly a testament of our ability to recognize and become a trusted partner of the most impactful life science companies in the world. Including three to 325 Binney, we have added over 1.1 million square feet of new development to our pipeline, and net of deliveries increased assets under construction from 3.4 million square feet to 4.3 million square feet. This increase in our pipeline is warranted by the demand I mentioned previously, and evidenced by the tremendous leasing activity of over 1 million square feet for the quarter, truly a historic demand from the life science industry and tremendous execution by our leasing professionals. I\u2019ll now comment on cost trends, as reported over the past two quarters, construction costs remain elevated, driven by supply and demand dynamics for material. But two other factors have begun to exacerbate the problem, labor shortages and supply chain problems. Nine months into 2021, previous year projects that had been put on hold due to COVID and new 2021 projects have created a double barrel demand for construction resources at a time when fabrication shops are struggling to procure raw material and restart due to labor shortages. The result has been record escalation for concrete, steel, wood, aluminum and glass. Most of these commodities are sourced from the United States. But there are still a number that come from foreign sources such as steel from Canada, Asia, Mexico and Brazil, glass from Thailand and resins used for pipe and specialty products such as benchtops for labs from Asia and Europe. As we all know, there have been significant supply chain disruptions around the world, none more apparent than the backlog of cargo ships in Southern California, which last Tuesday reached an all-time high of over 100 ships waiting to unload thousands of containers outside the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, a bottleneck that is expected to continue into next year. In addition to supply disruptions, construction costs are being impacted by labor shortages. There is a lack of skilled workers to keep up with the accelerated demand caused by a number of factors including GC, finding that some of the workforce laid off or furloughed during COVID are not returning because of retirement or finding other jobs. And it could get worse, if OSHA adopts vaccine mandates, as the construction industry is one of the highest unvaccinated workforces. Unfortunately, higher costs are not the only consequence of material and labor shortages. Material shortages caused longer lead times that can delay deliveries. Based on our deep experience and expertise, lead times have generally increased by six to eight weeks for most common materials. Even longer for materials that are comprised of metal and PVC or have a need for computer ships, such as building control. Alexandria is employing a number of mitigation measures to offset these impacts. And to-date, we've been very successful in staying on budget and schedule the vast majority of our projects. Increases in rents have enabled us to maintain our yields, but future projects may trend slightly lower as escalations and longer lead times impact our underwriting. However, we are fortunate in that the demand for Life Science real estate investments continue to drive lower cap rates for stabilized buildings, allowing us to maintain our spread. And speaking of cap rate compression, during the quarter, we sold additional interest in our 409 and 499 Illinois and 1500 Owens assets, while recapitalizing them with a new partner. In our original recapitalization done in December 2015, we achieved a total valuation of $1,021 per square foot, and a blended cap rate of 4.6%. In this transaction, we achieved a blended cap rate of 4.2% and a price per square foot of approximately $1,362, representing 33% appreciation over the whole period. To-date, we've achieved a healthy unlevered IRR of 10.4% on those assets. Finally, an observation on those clamoring to position themselves to capture the growing Life Science real estate demand, I referenced earlier. City office REIT sale of two parcels in Sorento, Mesa to Sterling Bay and Harrison Street for $576 million illustrates a gold rush mentality proliferating across our markets. City REIT\u2019s announcement stated that the south portion of the site was allocated $181 million of purchase price. A rendering of the site shows a very tight 2.0 FAR density of development that would imply a purchase price of $261 per square foot of land. To give you some context, our basis in the recently acquired land at 6250 to 6460 Sequence Drive a far superior location in the same Sorento, Mesa sub-market would have a basis of approximately 25% of that, if we were to build it to the same density. Our plans contemplate a much more inviting campus with open space and amenities, so our basis will be more like 50% of theirs, but you get the point. This is a great example of why we are in an incredibly advantageous position to capture any tenant requirement we want to capture. We are highly disciplined and have superior locations, superior basis, superior execution and the superior brand. And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: All right, thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga, here. Good afternoon, everyone. Year-to-date 2021 really has been an exceptional year of financial and operating performance for Alexandria. Our brand trusted partnerships with some of the most innovative Life Science entities combined with operational excellence has allowed our team to generate strong results. Our internal growth has been very strong. Statistics from our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects are record breaking, and provide visibility for growth into the future. Total revenues, net operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter were very strong, and were up 20%, 21% and 22%, respectively, over the third quarter of 2020. All really amazing and impactful results. And I should point out that these stats exclude the impact of the termination fee that was recognized in the third quarter of 2020. Now internal growth and operating results continue to reflect the strength of our unique and differentiated business model and strength of our brand. Our same property performance represents one of the highest quality growth engines within the REIT industry, of which we are immensely proud. We have one of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade or large cap publicly traded companies, and an important statistic that should be noticed. And occupancy has been very strong and improving this year to 98.5% about 80 basis points from the beginning of the year, excluding the impact from vacancy and recently acquired properties. Now importantly, 1.4 million rentable square feet of vacancy from recent acquisitions represents about 4.1% of our operating rentable square footage, and is a significant opportunity to increase cash flows. Additionally, 41% of this 1.4 million rentable square feet of vacancy is leased or under lease negotiations. And as Joel has stated earlier, we are seeing increasing leasing demand in a number of our key Life Science cluster markets. Now same property NOI growth was strong at 4.1% and 7.3% on a cash basis, and headed toward the upper end of our ranges for 2021 guidance. Same property NOI growth projected for the full year of 2021 is very solid, and is up 100 basis points and 70 basis points on a GAAP and cash basis respectively, from our initial guidance for 2021, really highlighting the improvement in our outlook since the beginning of the year. And once again, very proud of the strong internal growth engine we have. Leases executed in the nine months ended September 30 at over 5.4 million rentable square feet, another company record and this leasing volume was completed with exceptional rental rate growth up 39% and 22.3% on the cash basis. Now let me take a moment to highlight the seasonality of operating expenses related to higher utility expenses. With warm summer weather, we had higher repairs and maintenance in the summer months versus what might occur during the winter months, and higher property insurance premiums were their policy renewal which took effect June 1. Now with 92% of our leases being triple net these increases are generally recoverable from our tenants, and therefore have minimal impact on net operating income. However, the increase in operating expenses has a slight and only temporary negative 1% to 2% impact on operating and EBITDA margins for the quarter. Additionally, vacancy from recent acquisitions also slightly reduced margins. But it's important to recognize that our adjusted EBITDA margins remain one of the top within the REIT industry, and we expect the favorably resolved vacancy from recently acquired properties over the next number of quarters. Now turning to real estate, our trusted partnership with key Life Science entities, our brand and operational excellence among many other items is really standing out today as highlighted by strong demand for our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects. We have 7.7 million rentable square feet either under construction or construction commencing over the next six quarters, with projects approximately 80% leased or under negotiation, highlighting continuing historic demand, 93% of which represents transactions with existing relationships, including a number of deals coming from our tenant base of over 750 entities. Now the 7.7 million rentable square foot pipeline is up 731,000 rentable square feet over June 30. And some of the key highlights in the quarter included that we commenced construction on 1.2 million rentable square feet that is on average 60% leased or under negotiation, including 325 Binney Street, which is 100% leased, and 751 Gateway in South San Francisco, which is 100% under negotiation. These are pretty amazing leasing statistics, and we just commenced construction. And in both cases, stellar existing relationships resulted in full building users. Now we added approximately 480,000 rentable square feet of space targeted to commence construction over the next six quarters, that\u2019s about 20% of the space is under LOI negotiations today. And importantly, our team executed 1 million rentable square feet of leasing in the third quarter related to the development and redevelopment space, including the 462,000 rentable square foot lease with Moderna for 100% at 325 Binney Street. And we expect demand from our development sites and projects will provide us the opportunity to commence construction of other development and redevelopment projects. Now turning to our venture investments, just want to shout out a huge thank you to our science and technology team for their leadership in underwriting life science industry trends, and high quality investment opportunities. Now our venture investment cost basis only represents about 3.2% of gross assets, and unrealized gains were $930 million on a cost basis of about $1 billion. In the third quarter, we realized individually significant gains from three separate transactions aggregating $52.4 million. And year-to-date through September 30, we realized individually significant gains from six separate transactions aggregating $110.1 million. Now this represents over $100 million of capital that we did not anticipate at the beginning of the year that we were able to reinvest into our business. Our team is very pleased for recognition of the overall improvement in our corporate credit profile, S&P just upgraded our rating to BBB plus with a positive outlook, highlighting our unique and differentiated business model, strong brand and execution, high quality cash flows and strong credit profile among many other items. So thank you to our entire team for continued solid execution across all areas of our business. We remain on track for net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 5.2 times, at fixed charges greater than 5 times by the end of the year. As we close in on the end of 2021, we are focused on wrapping up several key partial interest sales and high value low cap rate transactions and other dispositions. Each transaction is moving along as expected and we are targeting completion of the sales later this year, which will generate about $1.7 billion in capital. The timing of a couple of the key dispositions were subject to lease negotiations before we were able to put the deals in front of potential investors, and therefore are targeted to close in the fourth quarter. As our team continues to focus on making a positive and lasting impact on the world, they were very pleased for continued recognition of leadership in ESG. MSCI just released results highlighting an A rating for Alexandria, representing one of the top ratings within the REIT industry. GRESB also recently released results of the 2021 assessment, highlighting Alexandria as a global sector leader and a five star rating in the diversified sector for buildings and development, and one of the top two in the science and technology sector for buildings and operation. And our team commenced construction the 325 Binney Street, which is the ground up development fully leased to Moderna and is designed to be the most sustainable laboratory building in Cambridge. Now, key items of the design include use of geothermal energy for heating and cooling and innovative building envelope and building management system, and other sustainable attributes that is designed to eliminate 95% or more fossil fuels and achieve LEED zero energy.  Now this building has also been designed to mitigate risk associated with flood precipitation under a business as usual scenario. And we are extremely excited to be an important strategic partners to Moderna for about a decade now, and super pleased that they select their team to assist them with their strategic priorities, including development of their next super innovative and sustainable lab building. Now turning to guidance, we updated our conservative guidance for 2021 including narrowing the range for EPS and AFFO per share from a range of $0.08 to a range of $0.02 per share. Our 2021 guidance for EPS diluted is ranged from $3.91 to $3.93. And FFO per shares adjusted diluted to a range of $7.74 to $7.76, with no change in the midpoint of $7.75. Now, continue strong demand for space and our asset base has increased our outlook for rental rate growth on lease renewals and release in a space by 2% and 1% on a GAAP and cost basis, respectively. And we also updated our 2021 guidance for dispositions, and have four transactions in process that will generate $1.7 billion, as highlighted a moment ago. We updated construction span for an increase of about $200 million at the midpoint, primarily due to acceleration of leasing and tenant space requirements related to our development and redevelopment projects. And as a reminder, we are about five weeks away from issuance of our detailed guidance for 2022, and therefore, we're unable to comment on 2022 guidance related matters. Let me end there and turn it back to Joel.\nJoel Marcus: So, operator, if we could go to Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Manny Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead.\nManny Korchman: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. The topic of labor and materials potentially being an issue has come up, I think a couple of times in this call. I was wondering just from your tenants perspective, is labor an issue there? Certainly, this is a hot spot within the economy. And these companies are doing well. But are there enough scientists and other talented staff members to staff all these up incoming companies?\nJoel Marcus: Yeah. So Manny, welcome. This is Joel. And so, I alluded to that in my comments that there is in fact, truly across the U.S. for many industries kind of a war for talent. And this is true in the life science industry. So far, we haven't seen any egregious shortages. But what I did say is that if somebody is going to not only create a company, but try to scale a company, you've got to be in the critical key existing clusters. You can't wander off and try to scale a company in Chicago or Denver or someplace like that in a way that you could otherwise do say in Boston or San Francisco. It just doesn't work that way. The pool of talent doesn't exist if you look at R&D, commercial, clinical, et cetera. So, at the moment, the existing clusters things seem okay. But there clearly is a war for talent.\nMichael Bilerman: Joes, just taking that one step further, it's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Good afternoon. As you think about sort of just the overall space in the life science facility, outside of people, there's obviously an increased use of robotics and other things that have just gotten smaller over time. I think about our PCs that used to be the hunks on our desk that are now in our pocket. How do you think about sort of just the evolution of what's being done in your labs and life sciences buildings, just from an efficiency standpoint? And could you see that evolve, like the law libraries went out the window? Is that at all a risk? I'm not trying to undermine the demand of the business, I understand that side of it very well. But I'm just trying to think about the use of space and the use of robotics and all that to do more in less space.\nJoel Marcus: I think that trend has been going on for quite a while. There is a whole lot of innovation that have made things that are repetitive, and by nature lend themselves to a more automated approach. But, science is in fact executed by people with pretty sophisticated backgrounds, and so forth. And so the need, not only can't you do science at home, but you can't do science purely robotically. You've got to make a lot of judgments and a lot of insights. And I don't know, Jenna, you've worked at the bench. So maybe you can comment directly.\nJenna Foger: Yeah, I think on that point, I was just going to say that I think, robotics innovation broadly, I think, allow a lot these companies to build larger and broader and more robust platforms. So companies are working more efficiently, but they're working on kind of parallel streams at once. So I don't really think that that -- I think robotics has enhanced what companies are looking for, but not really change necessarily real space needs, I think just the whole because the track of the entire industry. I don't think that's like a real thing,\nMichael Bilerman: A real threat that you're sort of mindful of.\nJenna Foger: Yeah,\nJoel Marcus: No.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. Thank you.\nJenna Foger: Yep.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So I want to ask my first question on CapEx, and I looked at your supplemental looks like it's a lumpy number, TIs have been running anywhere from $20 million to $50 million in the past five quarters. I'm wondering, when I think about the triple net nature of your portfolio, the relative newness of your portfolio born from your own development largely, and just the strength of life science marketplace, do you feel as though that CapEx which seems to be all over the map, from the sell side perspective too is trending down? Or, relatively speaking to the size of your company?\nJoel Marcus: So, Dean, you want to take on that? Peter, and Steve, you can chime in there.\nDean Shigenaga: Hey, Rich, it\u2019s Dean here. I would say there's one overlay to your question, Rich, I think what you're highlighting is the newer assets may have a little longer time before it starts to generate some requirements for capital. But our portfolio has a range of assets generally, much on the newer side. But if you look back over an extended period of time, our CapEx, I'll call it the bad bucket of CapEx, anything except for redevelopment and development CapEx has ranged anywhere from 10% to 13%, maybe just a tad beyond that in a given year. So, I don't think it has generally moved in any one particular direction in the last five or eight years. It's been relatively consistent in that direction, Rich.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And Dean, while have you the $1.7 billion of dispositions targeted for the fourth quarter is a key variable to getting to your leverage target, I assume. What is the risk that one or some of that can kind of fall off completely or delay into next year, you'll have to sort of explain a little bit higher, at least temporary leverage position until they get done?\nDean Shigenaga: Well, I mean, the reality is there's always some risk, but I think we've moved the transactions along in a good fashion and have expressed expectations from both sides really, to bring closure to these transactions this year. So we feel comfortable, Rich, but we need to get them done as you point out.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And just a quick one maybe for Joel. Dr. Califf, new incoming FDA Commissioner, sort of a friend of the firm. Obviously, he's going to do his job, not play favorites, I'm not suggesting that. But what is his awareness of Alexandria? Is there anything beneficial that can come to you as a result of that relationship that you have? Or, is it just business as usual?\nJoel Marcus: No, I mean, I think that's something we would never even think about or have a mindset about. I think the relationship we have, I mean, Rob, was a practicing cardiologist, he worked at Duke for many years. So he has a wide network across the United States. And I think how we look at him is, he's served in the position before he's well liked. He's a very smart guy, he\u2019s a very compassionate.  And I think that nomination -- or if the nomination happens, he seems to be at the top of the administration's list, I think, would be very good for the industry as a whole, not singling us out in any way, shape, or form. Because he's been there, he's been at the FDA, he knows how to get things done, and I think that's the big benefit for the industry as a whole.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Thanks very much.\nJoel Marcus: Yep. Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Anthony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Yeah. Thank you. My first question relates to just the mark to market, just listening to Steve's comments about how that's changed and also just looking at your guidance for cash leasing spreads over the last several quarters. It seems like the market rents have been moving the last couple of years high single digits annually. And so, my question is, one, do you think it continues at that pace? And then two, it would seem that we haven't seen your peak mark to market leasing spreads yet. Is that fair?\nJoel Marcus: Yeah. So maybe, Steve, do you want to comment on that, because I think there's some pretty good observations there.\nSteve Richardson: Sure. Yeah, Tony, Steve, here. Look, this is across the entire portfolio. So this, number one is very broad based. I think that's important to emphasize here. And, as we've been seeing, when you see these leasing statistics, and the acquisition work we're doing, it's responding to the industry. So, with that, we'll see what's to come in the future. But, we do have a lot of confidence based upon our network of what the future holds. And, that relates to the mark to market as well, and the potential for further increases.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then for Peter, in the past, you've done a nice job going through cap rates. Can you can you maybe touch on that through your markets?\nPeter Moglia: I mean, I guess I\u2019d broadly say that a couple years ago, there were markets like Research Triangle or Maryland, where people thought you're in the 6.5 to 7.5 range. And I would say today, I would doubt that there'd be any asset we would sell on our balance sheet in any market that wouldn't have a cap rate with a handle greater than a 5. So that way, we're going to -- you're going to see sub 4 cap rates, you're going to see nothing really go below -- I mean, until interest rates go up and then all real estate kind of gets hurt by that. I don't think you're going to see anything above a 5 something cap rate, at least in life science for the near future.\nJoel Marcus: Yeah. In the core cluster markets.\nPeter Moglia: Correct.\nAnthony Paolone: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSheila McGrath: Yes, good afternoon. Joel, I was wondering if you could give us more detail on your thought process or strategic thinking on which buildings or which markets you're choosing to sell partial interest in. Is it -- are you looking to lighten up in California given the business environment? Just a little more color on that?\nJoel Marcus: Yeah, I want to be real careful there because we have transactions underway. So maybe I would say defer that to the next quarter, where we could come in on the full year. I think the mantra that we have is where we have assets that are -- where we've really maximized value for Alexandria in a sense are ones that we certainly think about and look at. But it's a sophisticated set of issues and thoughts that we go through, but I think I don't want to come in given just pending transactions.\nSheila McGrath: Okay. And then if you could give us some insights on the recent entitlements that you received at Fenway Park, was the timing and square footage in line with your expectation? And will this extra 450,000 square feet be near-term project?\nJoel Marcus: Yeah. So Peter, you could comment on the underwriting?\nPeter Moglia: Yeah, Sheila, we actually underwrote a lower amount of -- more conservative amount FDR [ph] that we get on that additional side. So we're quite pleased with the outcome. And we are already set to design a project on that site. It's underway. The leasing that was done at the current development on the site there has been terrific, as you can see we're in the in the 90% leased and negotiating, and we're just wrapping up any leases that we haven't ramped up so far over the next quarter. So, the Fenway market is exceeding our expectations. The outcome of the entitlements was tremendous and we'll be capitalizing on that in the near future.\nJoel Marcus: Yeah. And you guys, either Steve or Peter, you can comment on the leasing that was done there from when we started early in the year till now, and how we've been able to really bring our client base to that project.\nPeter Moglia: Yeah, I'll start with and then Steve, you can add anything. But, one of the things when we bought that asset, the one that was under developed was 17% leased at the time. And within, I think a quarter, I was looking at the statistics of when we were preparing their supplemental, and I called up our team and I said, guys, like you're making incredible progress here, what is going on. And what they told us was, what they've been -- what they were told by the market was essentially, this is a great project. And the developer was a very, very good developer, but not allowed developer and that the market was waiting to see who was going to acquire it. And once they saw it was us, then people were ready to commit to it. So we went again, from 17% to in the 19%, at least in negotiating in I think within two quarters. And it was all because, our brand was put on the building, and people could trust that we would do an excellent job of not only finishing the development, but operating it down the road.\nSheila McGrath: Okay, great. Thank you.\nJoel Marcus: Thanks, Sheila.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJamie Feldman: Thank you. Steve, in your remarks, I think you had commented that you and Peter just kind of made the rounds around the markets, and felt very good about supply through \u201822 and \u201823. Can you talk more about some of the details of what gives you that comfort?\nSteve Richardson: Sure, Jamie, Steve here. I think, as we toured through the markets and you drill down on a parcel by parcel or building by building basis, as I did comment, there are a number of single buildings that may be either redeveloped potentially from office to lab, or being advertised for that, or you may see a project or two that has some horizontal work going on, and people are talking about vertical for lab. That timeframe is here and now. So you actually have to see that activity to have a true delivery in \u201822 or \u201823. A lot of what is being talked about, still needs to be entitled, still needs to be permitted, still needs to actually have the horizontal work done before someone's going to make the decision to go vertical, and potentially go vertical without an anchor tenant. So I think it's just important to really bracket the timeframes here. And we just saw that time and time again, and each of these sub-markets really on a specific building and parcel by parcel basis.\nJoel Marcus: Yeah. And I think if you overlay that, Jamie, with what Peter said, about construction issues, it makes it all the more unbelievable that people could maybe broadcast something when in fact, they couldn't accomplish it. So I think that's the reality as well.\nPeter Moglia: It\u2019s Peter. I just would add that, we really didn't see anything that was going to reach the scale that we can provide our tenancy, as Steve mentioned. Lots of projects named, but they're essentially one-off. And, as we've discovered over the past few years, as we've assembled our mega campuses, there's just a lot of power and attraction that tenants have to that aggregation. And what we see in the markets when we were touring on our decent sites, but nothing that would compete with us on that scale. So anyway.\nJamie Feldman: And then, are there certain markets that you'll be watching more than others that maybe -- I mean, sounds like you're talking about 2024 at this point, but just generally, where do you see the most potential supply risk?\nSteve Richardson: We\u2019re tracking each and every one of the markets very closely, Jamie. Certainly, San Diego, San Francisco and Cambridge, tracking those closely, Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle as well. I don't know that there's any one market right now that is most concerning. Over the others, we're just monitoring it very closely broad based.\nJoel Marcus: Yeah. And I mean, the other thing, Jamie is, that's more than two years out, so we don't know what the macro environment will be or the micro demand environment as well. So, hard to predict.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And then Joel, just listening to your comments at the outset of the call, couple \u2013 it sounds like you're somewhat frustrated with the political environment. Can you\u2026\nJoel Marcus: I think, every -- yeah, that's just not me. I think we're speaking about everybody that days, the old days of bipartisanship are kind of gone. And everybody seems to want to railroad their ideas. I mean, I spoke about the infrastructure package, which is being held up kind of as ransom for this much broader cradle to grave social entitlement thing. And if infrastructure is so important, why isn't it just done, because that is bipartisan. But I've said, I think it's a 20th century infrastructure package, not a 21st century infrastructure package. And if we don't watch out China's going to eat our lunch here over the next decade or two.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. So I guess just to ask the question, I mean, what concerns you the most as it pertains to your business specifically?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I mean, I think the way \u2013 I think the folks that are in there, nobody knows who they are that are pushing this 3.5 trillion, but now slimmed down, because of likely Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to some number that still seems outrageous. It's like going into a store, buying things and then figuring out Gee, I don't have a credit card, I don't have a check, I can't cover this. What am I going to do to pay for this? That's what it seems to me, that's a good analogy. And the items are pretty crazy, too. Certainly, we can do much better in a bipartisan fashion, not just crazy stuff.\nJamie Feldman: Generally, it sounds like you're comfortable with the life science part of things.\nJoel Marcus: Well, I mean, I think early on they're going after all kinds of sources, without any regard to policy. This is maybe the point here, Jamie. It's not a policy decision. It's, oh, where can we try to get $1 trillion or $2 trillion or $3 trillion or $4 trillion or $5 trillion from a bunch of sources without thinking about tax policy or health care policy. It's all about -- let's just steal somewhere and put it somewhere so we can get the goodies we want. That's not how to run a government.\nJamie Feldman: Okay, understood. Thank you.\nJoel Marcus: Yep. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nTom Catherwood: Thank you so much. Good afternoon, everyone. Great to see the lease with Moderna at 325 Binney. And Dean, thank you for the color on that. In the past, you've worked with the Citi to add more density to your Cambridge sites. With the acquisition of One Rogers and One Charles Park, what\u2019s the opportunity for further densification in Cambridge?\nJoel Marcus: Yeah, so we don't want to give anybody else a roadmap. But I'd say there are unique opportunities we're looking at. And we think given our position in that market and our knowledge of that market, much like three to five, which we were able to substantially up zone, we had actually underwrote that site for something like 200,000 or 250,000 feet, and we're able to do much better. I would say, just wait and see. But there are things that we are doing and we will be doing that are pretty amazing. So, let me leave it at that.\nTom Catherwood: Got it. Thanks, Joel. And then last one for me. We've heard numerous examples of life science companies facing challenges with small molecule manufacturing, and especially products that have short half-lives, like radiology treatments. In the past, you've talked about specialized domestic drug manufacturing as an area of opportunity. And what's your current view on manufacturing up kind of build outs or development for Alexandria? And given the mission-critical nature of these, are tenants looking to own these instead of lease them?\nJoel Marcus: Yeah. So Peter, you've got a whole lot of recent experience on the integration of the R&D with the manufacturing. So maybe just kind of a quick overview of how to kind of think about that.\nPeter Moglia: Yeah, Tom, what you were alluding to more small molecule as -- the issue there's more just onshoring the materials that go into that, and hopefully, eventually manufacturing things there. But that's really not the opportunity we've been touting. The opportunity we've been touting is the next generation manufacturing of cell and gene therapy type, or even DNA and RNA type of drugs like Moderna manufacturers. Those drugs need to be near the research. They're living and breathing biologics that will take constant tweaking until they can be gotten right. And so, the tenants tend to need those facilities within even probably preferably 10, 20, 30 minute drive versus across the country, or in an area where maybe there's cheap labor. So that's the opportunity for us and we've taken advantage of it in acquiring some properties that will do well for manufacturing. There's certain attributes to a building that makes it better for manufacturing. But we've been also very careful in setting ourselves and putting ourselves in a good position to do that, by ensuring that where we're buying this real estate and real estate that we're buying would also work well for R&D. And so it's easy to do, because, as I said, the tenants will want these facilities to be very close to where they're doing the R&D now. And so, down the line, if we have a building or 20 in a market that is being used for manufacturing, and then they become available, they could also easily convert to R&D down the road. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nTom Catherwood: That that was really helpful. Thanks so much, everyone.\nJoel Marcus: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Yeah. There was a sizable increase, I guess, in your staff related projects under construction, or expected to break ground over the next six quarters. I know this stuff was about 57 versus 52 in the prior stuff. I know there's a lot of moving parts within these numbers, though. But I guess, my key or that my question is, how much of that increase is due to new projects who\u2019re planning breaking ground before 2022 versus kind of starting to bleed into maybe the beginning of 2023 into those numbers?\nJoel Marcus: Yeah, so I'll let Dean comment. But I would say keep in mind, the key driver here is immediate demand by our tenants and a path for future growth. So we're trying to kind of juggle both requirements. So Dean, you could comment.\nDean Shigenaga: Yeah, Michael, I think what you're trying to understand a little bit is as we look at the full year \u201822 versus something going into \u201823. And I think you'll see us quarter-to-quarter extend that horizon a little bit. It's nothing to do with timing of transactions slipping. You can actually see a number of changes, if you were in supplemental, a supplemental where we had a number of projects across the spectrum from near-term, intermediate to future, get accelerated forward in the timeline. And as we highlighted in our commentary, all of this has been driven by as Joel mentioned, as well, demand for the space and an acceleration of our timing outlook as a result of the requirements that we're dealing with, with our tenant base and other relationships as well.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. So, I guess if I'm understanding correctly, this is more of you're seeing near-term demand, so you're willing to break ground on new projects over the next six quarters, and that's driving the large part of that increase?\nDean Shigenaga: Yeah, exactly. And as I mentioned in my commentary, almost all the activity you're seeing has some level of leasing on it. So we're sitting in a pretty nice spot right now.\nMichael Carroll: Okay, great. And then can we talk a little bit more about the fundamental backdrop, I guess, particularly market rent growth? I mean, can you quantify how much market rents have increased this year compared to prior years? And is there any big differences among the top clusters, I guess, particularly Boston, San Fran, or San Diego?\nJoel Marcus: So Steve, maybe give a top side view of that. I want to be careful. We don't benchmark each and every market,\nSteve Richardson: Michael, look, again, it's been broad based. I know, we've said that, but it really is. And, I think you're probably in the mid to single digits in some of the markets and maybe even double digit, low teen growth in some of the markets. We are just going to have Investor Day in a number of weeks here, so why don't we push a little bit of this question to Investor Day?\nMichael Carroll: Okay, great. I appreciate it.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: Okay. Thank you very much, everybody for your time and attention. And stay safe and god bless.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everyone to Alexandria\u2019s third quarter \u201921 earnings call and our seventh consecutive quarter in the COVID-19, which for sure has forever changed our world and our lives in very fundamental ways. With me today are, Jenna Foger, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. In honor of my favorite NCAA Basket Ball Coach and in his final year as Head Coach for Duke men's basketball, Coach K has said imagination has a great deal to do with winning. And I'd like to say to our extraordinary Alexandria family, thank you from the bottom of our hearts for a spectacular third quarter, and operational pace and execution tempo that really defines the terms operational excellence, and for your great imagination as Coach K said in all things big and small. Moving on the keys to Alexandria's stellar third quarter performance by all metrics amid a historic demand environment, I think, and importantly, the best is yet to come. Continuing historic high demand for Alexandria's best-in-class lab space, the niche which we invented, and our mission-critical and operationally excellent lab operations. Year-to-date, and others will talk about this, we've leased 5.4 million square feet and looking for a great fourth quarter to end the year. Alexandria is at the vanguard in the heart of meeting this historic high in an unprecedented immediate lab space demand from many of our over 750 client tenants. Moderna is a prime example, and another one which Dean will talk about, a big tenant in South San Francisco for a full building, as well as critical paths for future growth which is so needed. Thus the need for acquisitions, redevelopment and developments, and has been repeated time and time again, by life science tenants and their brokers, if any other company is going up against Alexandria for leasing space, the tenant will almost always pick Alexandria. We are proud to partner with Moderna on their Cambridge headquarters and core R&D facility. And as Dean and others will talk about, it'll be the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge with very strong economics and really great value creation. We're very honored and proud that Alexandria has had very strategically significant tenant relationships, and stellar brand reputation across all of our cluster markets. We're also very fortunate to continue to have to truly demonstrate pricing power in each of our core cluster markets. And by the way, the war for talent, like other industries in the life science industry is creating an even greater space need, set of space needs and demands in the core key Life Science clusters and that is very good for Alexandria. And we see an accelerating leasing demand even above and beyond what we see this quarter in several of our key cluster markets continuing. Rental rate growth continues strongly and excess supply is not a current threat. Alexandria's differentiated expertise and unique platform with its compelling internal and external growth drivers and outlook translates into genuine earnings power. As indicated in the press release and supplemental, our visible multi-year highly leased development pipeline is expected to generate approximately $615 million in future incremental revenue. And beyond that the future leasing prospects really look extraordinary as I've said. The biotech boom and historic Life Science demand driven by the strong industry fundamentals is evident. The 21st century is really the biological century as biology is in transition from an empirical science of trial and error to really an [indiscernible 0:05:19.8] science with much more predictable and scalable outcomes. We're witnessing the industrial revolution in biotech. As we accelerate the application of new and innovative tools, we will see an acceleration in value creation. Products will come to market faster, for less capital and with fewer failures. The Life Science industry and its ecosystem and its positive impact on humanity is truly a crown jewel of the United States, and a testament to the free enterprise system of innovation. I think it's important to remember politically, those who seek to create a cradle to grave entitlement society should not use this industry as if fully covered. And then finally, I want to turn to the second anniversary of our OneFifteen Project in Dayton, Ohio, which this month we celebrate. Sad to say that overdoses have claimed a staggering 96,000 lives during the 12-months ended March of 2021, up 30% increase in the year before.  OneFifteen is an innovative data-driven non-profit evidence-based healthcare ecosystem dedicated to the full and sustained recovery of people with addiction and as I said, Dayton, Ohio, OneFifteen is revolutionizing the way addiction is treated through its tech enabled care platform, which applies analytics to measure the effectiveness of various treatments, and choices throughout the full continuum of care, and continuously evolves its approach based on insights derived. Since its opening in 2015, OneFifteen has served almost 4,000 individuals struggling with addiction, and conducted over 9,000 telehealth visits since the start of COVID-19 pandemic. With our OneFifteen partners, we\u2019re unwavering in our commitment to help people recover from addiction, live healthier lives, while revitalizing the community. We would like to see this model replicated across the country. But politicians seem wholly ineffective, even given the large amount of capital that came to the cities and states during COVID-19. And our goal is not only to have OneFifteen be a model for the success against opioid addiction, Dayton, Ohio. We hope to bring that model in a varied way to address the homeless crisis on the Wes Coast. And so, with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jenna Foger, who's going to comment on some important COVID-19 matters, the NIH and the FDA. Take it away, Jenna. So, operator, if we could go to Q&A. Yeah. So Manny, welcome. This is Joel. And so, I alluded to that in my comments that there is in fact, truly across the U.S. for many industries kind of a war for talent. And this is true in the life science industry. So far, we haven't seen any egregious shortages. But what I did say is that if somebody is going to not only create a company, but try to scale a company, you've got to be in the critical key existing clusters. You can't wander off and try to scale a company in Chicago or Denver or someplace like that in a way that you could otherwise do say in Boston or San Francisco. It just doesn't work that way. The pool of talent doesn't exist if you look at R&D, commercial, clinical, et cetera. So, at the moment, the existing clusters things seem okay. But there clearly is a war for talent. I think that trend has been going on for quite a while. There is a whole lot of innovation that have made things that are repetitive, and by nature lend themselves to a more automated approach. But, science is in fact executed by people with pretty sophisticated backgrounds, and so forth. And so the need, not only can't you do science at home, but you can't do science purely robotically. You've got to make a lot of judgments and a lot of insights. And I don't know, Jenna, you've worked at the bench. So maybe you can comment directly. No. So, Dean, you want to take on that? Peter, and Steve, you can chime in there. No, I mean, I think that's something we would never even think about or have a mindset about. I think the relationship we have, I mean, Rob, was a practicing cardiologist, he worked at Duke for many years. So he has a wide network across the United States. And I think how we look at him is, he's served in the position before he's well liked. He's a very smart guy, he\u2019s a very compassionate.  And I think that nomination -- or if the nomination happens, he seems to be at the top of the administration's list, I think, would be very good for the industry as a whole, not singling us out in any way, shape, or form. Because he's been there, he's been at the FDA, he knows how to get things done, and I think that's the big benefit for the industry as a whole. Yep. Thanks, Rich. Yeah. So maybe, Steve, do you want to comment on that, because I think there's some pretty good observations there. Yeah. In the core cluster markets. Yeah, I want to be real careful there because we have transactions underway. So maybe I would say defer that to the next quarter, where we could come in on the full year. I think the mantra that we have is where we have assets that are -- where we've really maximized value for Alexandria in a sense are ones that we certainly think about and look at. But it's a sophisticated set of issues and thoughts that we go through, but I think I don't want to come in given just pending transactions. Yeah. So Peter, you could comment on the underwriting? Yeah. And you guys, either Steve or Peter, you can comment on the leasing that was done there from when we started early in the year till now, and how we've been able to really bring our client base to that project. Thanks, Sheila. Yeah. And I think if you overlay that, Jamie, with what Peter said, about construction issues, it makes it all the more unbelievable that people could maybe broadcast something when in fact, they couldn't accomplish it. So I think that's the reality as well. Yeah. And I mean, the other thing, Jamie is, that's more than two years out, so we don't know what the macro environment will be or the micro demand environment as well. So, hard to predict. I think, every -- yeah, that's just not me. I think we're speaking about everybody that days, the old days of bipartisanship are kind of gone. And everybody seems to want to railroad their ideas. I mean, I spoke about the infrastructure package, which is being held up kind of as ransom for this much broader cradle to grave social entitlement thing. And if infrastructure is so important, why isn't it just done, because that is bipartisan. But I've said, I think it's a 20th century infrastructure package, not a 21st century infrastructure package. And if we don't watch out China's going to eat our lunch here over the next decade or two. Well, I mean, I think the way \u2013 I think the folks that are in there, nobody knows who they are that are pushing this 3.5 trillion, but now slimmed down, because of likely Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to some number that still seems outrageous. It's like going into a store, buying things and then figuring out Gee, I don't have a credit card, I don't have a check, I can't cover this. What am I going to do to pay for this? That's what it seems to me, that's a good analogy. And the items are pretty crazy, too. Certainly, we can do much better in a bipartisan fashion, not just crazy stuff. Well, I mean, I think early on they're going after all kinds of sources, without any regard to policy. This is maybe the point here, Jamie. It's not a policy decision. It's, oh, where can we try to get $1 trillion or $2 trillion or $3 trillion or $4 trillion or $5 trillion from a bunch of sources without thinking about tax policy or health care policy. It's all about -- let's just steal somewhere and put it somewhere so we can get the goodies we want. That's not how to run a government. Yep. Thank you. Yeah, so we don't want to give anybody else a roadmap. But I'd say there are unique opportunities we're looking at. And we think given our position in that market and our knowledge of that market, much like three to five, which we were able to substantially up zone, we had actually underwrote that site for something like 200,000 or 250,000 feet, and we're able to do much better. I would say, just wait and see. But there are things that we are doing and we will be doing that are pretty amazing. So, let me leave it at that. Yeah. So Peter, you've got a whole lot of recent experience on the integration of the R&D with the manufacturing. So maybe just kind of a quick overview of how to kind of think about that. Thanks, Tom. Yeah, so I'll let Dean comment. But I would say keep in mind, the key driver here is immediate demand by our tenants and a path for future growth. So we're trying to kind of juggle both requirements. So Dean, you could comment. So Steve, maybe give a top side view of that. I want to be careful. We don't benchmark each and every market, Okay. Thank you very much, everybody for your time and attention. And stay safe and god bless."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Hello, everybody. I'm going to update you all on our high value creation development pipeline and construction cost trends. And then I'm going to comment on our recent partial interest sale in Mission Bay, and some market activity that we believe represents overzealous behavior by new entrants in the life science real estate market that should lead to challenges for such groups. As Joel mentioned in his opening, historic demand for our differentiated life science campuses has continued in the third quarter, and we expect this to continue to at least the near to medium-term, as record levels of government, venture capital and biopharma investment continues to disseminate into Alexandria's cluster markets to discover, develop and manufacture new modality, such as cell, gene and RNA and DNA therapies. The resulting growth of our underlying industry gives us high conviction to continue as an elevated pace of development, redevelopment and to acquire assets to backfill the pipeline we're advancing today. This historic demand paired with our long tenure development experience and expertise, resulted in another outstanding quarter for Alexandria.  We delivered 238,163 square feet spread over six assets, including Arsenal on the Charles in Watertown, which continues to be one of the hottest markets outside of Cambridge, 3160 Porter drive, which is now materially oversubscribed with tenants looking to tap into this unique partnership we have with Stanford, and our two ground up developments in Research Triangle, which are capitalizing on strong demand for research development, manufacturing space from therapeutic and agricultural technology companies. These deliveries will contribute $14.3 million in NOI over the next year. And as Joel and Steve noted in their comments, during the quarter we were very excited to add 325 Binney Street to our under construction pipeline. This new 462,000 square foot high performance development targeting LEED Zero Energy certification showcases Alexandria\u2019s climate resilient design solutions, as well as our mission-critical efforts to catalyze positive change to benefit human health and society. It is 100% leased to Moderna, an example of a highly disruptive and visionary company that has grown with Alexandria since shortly after it was founded. Early on, we identified the team and the transformational potential of its mRNA platform, and we have both invested and provided the company with mission-critical real estate over the past 10-years. This is truly a testament of our ability to recognize and become a trusted partner of the most impactful life science companies in the world. Including three to 325 Binney, we have added over 1.1 million square feet of new development to our pipeline, and net of deliveries increased assets under construction from 3.4 million square feet to 4.3 million square feet. This increase in our pipeline is warranted by the demand I mentioned previously, and evidenced by the tremendous leasing activity of over 1 million square feet for the quarter, truly a historic demand from the life science industry and tremendous execution by our leasing professionals. I\u2019ll now comment on cost trends, as reported over the past two quarters, construction costs remain elevated, driven by supply and demand dynamics for material. But two other factors have begun to exacerbate the problem, labor shortages and supply chain problems. Nine months into 2021, previous year projects that had been put on hold due to COVID and new 2021 projects have created a double barrel demand for construction resources at a time when fabrication shops are struggling to procure raw material and restart due to labor shortages. The result has been record escalation for concrete, steel, wood, aluminum and glass. Most of these commodities are sourced from the United States. But there are still a number that come from foreign sources such as steel from Canada, Asia, Mexico and Brazil, glass from Thailand and resins used for pipe and specialty products such as benchtops for labs from Asia and Europe. As we all know, there have been significant supply chain disruptions around the world, none more apparent than the backlog of cargo ships in Southern California, which last Tuesday reached an all-time high of over 100 ships waiting to unload thousands of containers outside the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, a bottleneck that is expected to continue into next year. In addition to supply disruptions, construction costs are being impacted by labor shortages. There is a lack of skilled workers to keep up with the accelerated demand caused by a number of factors including GC, finding that some of the workforce laid off or furloughed during COVID are not returning because of retirement or finding other jobs. And it could get worse, if OSHA adopts vaccine mandates, as the construction industry is one of the highest unvaccinated workforces. Unfortunately, higher costs are not the only consequence of material and labor shortages. Material shortages caused longer lead times that can delay deliveries. Based on our deep experience and expertise, lead times have generally increased by six to eight weeks for most common materials. Even longer for materials that are comprised of metal and PVC or have a need for computer ships, such as building control. Alexandria is employing a number of mitigation measures to offset these impacts. And to-date, we've been very successful in staying on budget and schedule the vast majority of our projects. Increases in rents have enabled us to maintain our yields, but future projects may trend slightly lower as escalations and longer lead times impact our underwriting. However, we are fortunate in that the demand for Life Science real estate investments continue to drive lower cap rates for stabilized buildings, allowing us to maintain our spread. And speaking of cap rate compression, during the quarter, we sold additional interest in our 409 and 499 Illinois and 1500 Owens assets, while recapitalizing them with a new partner. In our original recapitalization done in December 2015, we achieved a total valuation of $1,021 per square foot, and a blended cap rate of 4.6%. In this transaction, we achieved a blended cap rate of 4.2% and a price per square foot of approximately $1,362, representing 33% appreciation over the whole period. To-date, we've achieved a healthy unlevered IRR of 10.4% on those assets. Finally, an observation on those clamoring to position themselves to capture the growing Life Science real estate demand, I referenced earlier. City office REIT sale of two parcels in Sorento, Mesa to Sterling Bay and Harrison Street for $576 million illustrates a gold rush mentality proliferating across our markets. City REIT\u2019s announcement stated that the south portion of the site was allocated $181 million of purchase price. A rendering of the site shows a very tight 2.0 FAR density of development that would imply a purchase price of $261 per square foot of land. To give you some context, our basis in the recently acquired land at 6250 to 6460 Sequence Drive a far superior location in the same Sorento, Mesa sub-market would have a basis of approximately 25% of that, if we were to build it to the same density. Our plans contemplate a much more inviting campus with open space and amenities, so our basis will be more like 50% of theirs, but you get the point. This is a great example of why we are in an incredibly advantageous position to capture any tenant requirement we want to capture. We are highly disciplined and have superior locations, superior basis, superior execution and the superior brand. And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean. I mean, I guess I\u2019d broadly say that a couple years ago, there were markets like Research Triangle or Maryland, where people thought you're in the 6.5 to 7.5 range. And I would say today, I would doubt that there'd be any asset we would sell on our balance sheet in any market that wouldn't have a cap rate with a handle greater than a 5. So that way, we're going to -- you're going to see sub 4 cap rates, you're going to see nothing really go below -- I mean, until interest rates go up and then all real estate kind of gets hurt by that. I don't think you're going to see anything above a 5 something cap rate, at least in life science for the near future. Correct. Yeah, Sheila, we actually underwrote a lower amount of -- more conservative amount FDR [ph] that we get on that additional side. So we're quite pleased with the outcome. And we are already set to design a project on that site. It's underway. The leasing that was done at the current development on the site there has been terrific, as you can see we're in the in the 90% leased and negotiating, and we're just wrapping up any leases that we haven't ramped up so far over the next quarter. So, the Fenway market is exceeding our expectations. The outcome of the entitlements was tremendous and we'll be capitalizing on that in the near future. Yeah, I'll start with and then Steve, you can add anything. But, one of the things when we bought that asset, the one that was under developed was 17% leased at the time. And within, I think a quarter, I was looking at the statistics of when we were preparing their supplemental, and I called up our team and I said, guys, like you're making incredible progress here, what is going on. And what they told us was, what they've been -- what they were told by the market was essentially, this is a great project. And the developer was a very, very good developer, but not allowed developer and that the market was waiting to see who was going to acquire it. And once they saw it was us, then people were ready to commit to it. So we went again, from 17% to in the 19%, at least in negotiating in I think within two quarters. And it was all because, our brand was put on the building, and people could trust that we would do an excellent job of not only finishing the development, but operating it down the road. It\u2019s Peter. I just would add that, we really didn't see anything that was going to reach the scale that we can provide our tenancy, as Steve mentioned. Lots of projects named, but they're essentially one-off. And, as we've discovered over the past few years, as we've assembled our mega campuses, there's just a lot of power and attraction that tenants have to that aggregation. And what we see in the markets when we were touring on our decent sites, but nothing that would compete with us on that scale. So anyway. Yeah, Tom, what you were alluding to more small molecule as -- the issue there's more just onshoring the materials that go into that, and hopefully, eventually manufacturing things there. But that's really not the opportunity we've been touting. The opportunity we've been touting is the next generation manufacturing of cell and gene therapy type, or even DNA and RNA type of drugs like Moderna manufacturers. Those drugs need to be near the research. They're living and breathing biologics that will take constant tweaking until they can be gotten right. And so, the tenants tend to need those facilities within even probably preferably 10, 20, 30 minute drive versus across the country, or in an area where maybe there's cheap labor. So that's the opportunity for us and we've taken advantage of it in acquiring some properties that will do well for manufacturing. There's certain attributes to a building that makes it better for manufacturing. But we've been also very careful in setting ourselves and putting ourselves in a good position to do that, by ensuring that where we're buying this real estate and real estate that we're buying would also work well for R&D. And so it's easy to do, because, as I said, the tenants will want these facilities to be very close to where they're doing the R&D now. And so, down the line, if we have a building or 20 in a market that is being used for manufacturing, and then they become available, they could also easily convert to R&D down the road. Hopefully, that answers your question."

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "All right, thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga, here. Good afternoon, everyone. Year-to-date 2021 really has been an exceptional year of financial and operating performance for Alexandria. Our brand trusted partnerships with some of the most innovative Life Science entities combined with operational excellence has allowed our team to generate strong results. Our internal growth has been very strong. Statistics from our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects are record breaking, and provide visibility for growth into the future. Total revenues, net operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter were very strong, and were up 20%, 21% and 22%, respectively, over the third quarter of 2020. All really amazing and impactful results. And I should point out that these stats exclude the impact of the termination fee that was recognized in the third quarter of 2020. Now internal growth and operating results continue to reflect the strength of our unique and differentiated business model and strength of our brand. Our same property performance represents one of the highest quality growth engines within the REIT industry, of which we are immensely proud. We have one of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade or large cap publicly traded companies, and an important statistic that should be noticed. And occupancy has been very strong and improving this year to 98.5% about 80 basis points from the beginning of the year, excluding the impact from vacancy and recently acquired properties. Now importantly, 1.4 million rentable square feet of vacancy from recent acquisitions represents about 4.1% of our operating rentable square footage, and is a significant opportunity to increase cash flows. Additionally, 41% of this 1.4 million rentable square feet of vacancy is leased or under lease negotiations. And as Joel has stated earlier, we are seeing increasing leasing demand in a number of our key Life Science cluster markets. Now same property NOI growth was strong at 4.1% and 7.3% on a cash basis, and headed toward the upper end of our ranges for 2021 guidance. Same property NOI growth projected for the full year of 2021 is very solid, and is up 100 basis points and 70 basis points on a GAAP and cash basis respectively, from our initial guidance for 2021, really highlighting the improvement in our outlook since the beginning of the year. And once again, very proud of the strong internal growth engine we have. Leases executed in the nine months ended September 30 at over 5.4 million rentable square feet, another company record and this leasing volume was completed with exceptional rental rate growth up 39% and 22.3% on the cash basis. Now let me take a moment to highlight the seasonality of operating expenses related to higher utility expenses. With warm summer weather, we had higher repairs and maintenance in the summer months versus what might occur during the winter months, and higher property insurance premiums were their policy renewal which took effect June 1. Now with 92% of our leases being triple net these increases are generally recoverable from our tenants, and therefore have minimal impact on net operating income. However, the increase in operating expenses has a slight and only temporary negative 1% to 2% impact on operating and EBITDA margins for the quarter. Additionally, vacancy from recent acquisitions also slightly reduced margins. But it's important to recognize that our adjusted EBITDA margins remain one of the top within the REIT industry, and we expect the favorably resolved vacancy from recently acquired properties over the next number of quarters. Now turning to real estate, our trusted partnership with key Life Science entities, our brand and operational excellence among many other items is really standing out today as highlighted by strong demand for our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects. We have 7.7 million rentable square feet either under construction or construction commencing over the next six quarters, with projects approximately 80% leased or under negotiation, highlighting continuing historic demand, 93% of which represents transactions with existing relationships, including a number of deals coming from our tenant base of over 750 entities. Now the 7.7 million rentable square foot pipeline is up 731,000 rentable square feet over June 30. And some of the key highlights in the quarter included that we commenced construction on 1.2 million rentable square feet that is on average 60% leased or under negotiation, including 325 Binney Street, which is 100% leased, and 751 Gateway in South San Francisco, which is 100% under negotiation. These are pretty amazing leasing statistics, and we just commenced construction. And in both cases, stellar existing relationships resulted in full building users. Now we added approximately 480,000 rentable square feet of space targeted to commence construction over the next six quarters, that\u2019s about 20% of the space is under LOI negotiations today. And importantly, our team executed 1 million rentable square feet of leasing in the third quarter related to the development and redevelopment space, including the 462,000 rentable square foot lease with Moderna for 100% at 325 Binney Street. And we expect demand from our development sites and projects will provide us the opportunity to commence construction of other development and redevelopment projects. Now turning to our venture investments, just want to shout out a huge thank you to our science and technology team for their leadership in underwriting life science industry trends, and high quality investment opportunities. Now our venture investment cost basis only represents about 3.2% of gross assets, and unrealized gains were $930 million on a cost basis of about $1 billion. In the third quarter, we realized individually significant gains from three separate transactions aggregating $52.4 million. And year-to-date through September 30, we realized individually significant gains from six separate transactions aggregating $110.1 million. Now this represents over $100 million of capital that we did not anticipate at the beginning of the year that we were able to reinvest into our business. Our team is very pleased for recognition of the overall improvement in our corporate credit profile, S&P just upgraded our rating to BBB plus with a positive outlook, highlighting our unique and differentiated business model, strong brand and execution, high quality cash flows and strong credit profile among many other items. So thank you to our entire team for continued solid execution across all areas of our business. We remain on track for net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 5.2 times, at fixed charges greater than 5 times by the end of the year. As we close in on the end of 2021, we are focused on wrapping up several key partial interest sales and high value low cap rate transactions and other dispositions. Each transaction is moving along as expected and we are targeting completion of the sales later this year, which will generate about $1.7 billion in capital. The timing of a couple of the key dispositions were subject to lease negotiations before we were able to put the deals in front of potential investors, and therefore are targeted to close in the fourth quarter. As our team continues to focus on making a positive and lasting impact on the world, they were very pleased for continued recognition of leadership in ESG. MSCI just released results highlighting an A rating for Alexandria, representing one of the top ratings within the REIT industry. GRESB also recently released results of the 2021 assessment, highlighting Alexandria as a global sector leader and a five star rating in the diversified sector for buildings and development, and one of the top two in the science and technology sector for buildings and operation. And our team commenced construction the 325 Binney Street, which is the ground up development fully leased to Moderna and is designed to be the most sustainable laboratory building in Cambridge. Now, key items of the design include use of geothermal energy for heating and cooling and innovative building envelope and building management system, and other sustainable attributes that is designed to eliminate 95% or more fossil fuels and achieve LEED zero energy.  Now this building has also been designed to mitigate risk associated with flood precipitation under a business as usual scenario. And we are extremely excited to be an important strategic partners to Moderna for about a decade now, and super pleased that they select their team to assist them with their strategic priorities, including development of their next super innovative and sustainable lab building. Now turning to guidance, we updated our conservative guidance for 2021 including narrowing the range for EPS and AFFO per share from a range of $0.08 to a range of $0.02 per share. Our 2021 guidance for EPS diluted is ranged from $3.91 to $3.93. And FFO per shares adjusted diluted to a range of $7.74 to $7.76, with no change in the midpoint of $7.75. Now, continue strong demand for space and our asset base has increased our outlook for rental rate growth on lease renewals and release in a space by 2% and 1% on a GAAP and cost basis, respectively. And we also updated our 2021 guidance for dispositions, and have four transactions in process that will generate $1.7 billion, as highlighted a moment ago. We updated construction span for an increase of about $200 million at the midpoint, primarily due to acceleration of leasing and tenant space requirements related to our development and redevelopment projects. And as a reminder, we are about five weeks away from issuance of our detailed guidance for 2022, and therefore, we're unable to comment on 2022 guidance related matters. Let me end there and turn it back to Joel. Hey, Rich, it\u2019s Dean here. I would say there's one overlay to your question, Rich, I think what you're highlighting is the newer assets may have a little longer time before it starts to generate some requirements for capital. But our portfolio has a range of assets generally, much on the newer side. But if you look back over an extended period of time, our CapEx, I'll call it the bad bucket of CapEx, anything except for redevelopment and development CapEx has ranged anywhere from 10% to 13%, maybe just a tad beyond that in a given year. So, I don't think it has generally moved in any one particular direction in the last five or eight years. It's been relatively consistent in that direction, Rich. Well, I mean, the reality is there's always some risk, but I think we've moved the transactions along in a good fashion and have expressed expectations from both sides really, to bring closure to these transactions this year. So we feel comfortable, Rich, but we need to get them done as you point out. Yeah, Michael, I think what you're trying to understand a little bit is as we look at the full year \u201822 versus something going into \u201823. And I think you'll see us quarter-to-quarter extend that horizon a little bit. It's nothing to do with timing of transactions slipping. You can actually see a number of changes, if you were in supplemental, a supplemental where we had a number of projects across the spectrum from near-term, intermediate to future, get accelerated forward in the timeline. And as we highlighted in our commentary, all of this has been driven by as Joel mentioned, as well, demand for the space and an acceleration of our timing outlook as a result of the requirements that we're dealing with, with our tenant base and other relationships as well. Yeah, exactly. And as I mentioned in my commentary, almost all the activity you're seeing has some level of leasing on it. So we're sitting in a pretty nice spot right now."

            "name": "Steve Richardson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenna. Good afternoon, everyone. Alexandria\u2019s brand power in the market is not only delivering the exceptional results today that you've seen, but also provides clarity for the potential trajectory of the company's future growth and enhanced dominant position in the life science ecosystem. Peter and I just completed an intensive on the ground tour through a few of our cluster markets. And the energy and enthusiasm for Alexandria's entirety of offerings as an integral part of the life science ecosystem was abundantly evident. The Class A plus quality and the mission-critical nature of the facilities that is so important during this time of COVID-19, coupled with the creation of true renaissance, like science centers on our mega campuses, provides for a set of highly desirable and sought after destinations. And the numbers the team are posting bear out this leadership position. The highlights include superb leasing milestones, year-to-date leasing is 5.4 million square feet. The highest annual leasing run rate in the company's history achieved during just these first three quarters of 2021. And as noted earlier by Joel, featuring the largest lease in the company's history to Moderna at 325 Binney Street for their 462,000 square foot state-of-the art headquarters. It's critical to note two important aspects of this leasing activity. One, it is occurring in our core sub-markets where we have high barriers to entry, low vacancy and a first mover advantage. And two, it is also occurring in the development and redevelopment pipeline at an accelerated rate, with the 1 million square foot of leasing in the segment during Q3 reaching the second highest leasing level for development and redevelopment projects, further validating Alexandria\u2019s strategic and robust acquisition activity during 2021. Let's turn to the strategic expansion of our asset base. Q3 was a very productive quarter with completed acquisitions totaling 5.6 million square feet. And a number of key aspects of this expansion of our asset base include the following: 4.9 million square feet of this total were highly accretive value creation opportunities. We are also able to continue either doubling down in our course of markets, as evidenced by 325 Binney Street or strategically expanding the boundaries of these sub-markets. These critical decisions on acquisitions are informed by our unrivaled network of 750 tenants to meet their current needs and provide a path for future growth. And in total, we have now increased the total asset base from 47 million square feet to 64 million square feet during the past four quarters, a significant increase of 36%. The core is also outperforming as renewal in releasing spreads of 19.3% cash and 35.3% gap during Q3 are impressive. But I also want to underscore and highlight that our mark to market across the portfolio has moved up to 25% on a cash basis today, nearly doubling and significantly up from 13.6% in Q1 of 2019. AR balance of 99.4% in October, continues our hard work there. And we really do have a dream team in the operational realm. And a big shout out to the folks who make this happen every day. Occupancy is increasing. As we've noted throughout the year, we expected occupancy to increase excluding the recently acquired projects with vacancy, we've delivered on those goals. We were at 97.1% as of June 2020, and we're now at 98.5%. Turning to market health, on the demand side, Joel and Jenna highlighted the key components driving demand in the life science industry. However, the seasoned executive Life Science management teams driving this demand are requiring high quality facilities and deeply experienced operational teams, as clearly evidenced by our leasing volume and velocity. These companies are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in life changing therapies, and require exceptional performance from a world-class team and technically sophisticated facilities. Downtime or mistakes that may destroy experiments in years of work are unacceptable risks. Alexandria, as a pioneer of this life science niche has earned a reputation as a trusted partner to provide operational excellence for these mission-critical facilities. On the supply side, as I mentioned earlier, Peter and I recently toured a few of our regions firsthand to also evaluate the competitive supply on a granular level. And it is clear that there is no aggregation of disruptive large scale projects delivering during the 2020 to 2023 timeframe. There are in fact a handful of one-off buildings in the market. But we have seen our qualitatively superior mega campuses compete very well against this type of offering. We are also closely monitoring the potential for projects beyond this timeframe that definitively advances genuine Life Science competition, but in many cases, they require many quarters or even years of entitlement, permitting, and horizontal infrastructure work before any decision to go vertical might be made. So in conclusion, as we close towards the end of 2021, the first three quarters of this year have yielded a tremendously productive foundation to continue the company's integral and indispensable role in the life science ecosystem. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Sure. Yeah, Tony, Steve, here. Look, this is across the entire portfolio. So this, number one is very broad based. I think that's important to emphasize here. And, as we've been seeing, when you see these leasing statistics, and the acquisition work we're doing, it's responding to the industry. So, with that, we'll see what's to come in the future. But, we do have a lot of confidence based upon our network of what the future holds. And, that relates to the mark to market as well, and the potential for further increases. Sure, Jamie, Steve here. I think, as we toured through the markets and you drill down on a parcel by parcel or building by building basis, as I did comment, there are a number of single buildings that may be either redeveloped potentially from office to lab, or being advertised for that, or you may see a project or two that has some horizontal work going on, and people are talking about vertical for lab. That timeframe is here and now. So you actually have to see that activity to have a true delivery in \u201822 or \u201823. A lot of what is being talked about, still needs to be entitled, still needs to be permitted, still needs to actually have the horizontal work done before someone's going to make the decision to go vertical, and potentially go vertical without an anchor tenant. So I think it's just important to really bracket the timeframes here. And we just saw that time and time again, and each of these sub-markets really on a specific building and parcel by parcel basis. We\u2019re tracking each and every one of the markets very closely, Jamie. Certainly, San Diego, San Francisco and Cambridge, tracking those closely, Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle as well. I don't know that there's any one market right now that is most concerning. Over the others, we're just monitoring it very closely broad based. Michael, look, again, it's been broad based. I know, we've said that, but it really is. And, I think you're probably in the mid to single digits in some of the markets and maybe even double digit, low teen growth in some of the markets. We are just going to have Investor Day in a number of weeks here, so why don't we push a little bit of this question to Investor Day?"

            "name": "Jenna Foger",
            "content": "Thank you so much, Joes, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin to turn a new corner on this COVID-19 pandemic, which I'll speak to in a moment, life science industry fundamentals as Joes highlighted continue to be very strong, and provide the industry with the unique structural integrity to weather broader market volatility and cyclicality. The confidence of these drivers and key advances in our understanding of biology and next generation modalities will continue to fuel life science demands well into the future. So, as we spoke about last quarter, owing to the expediency at which the industry and our tenants move to protect the country in the world, we now have the tools and a roadmap at our disposal to end this pandemic, while also ushering in a historic new era for biotech and scientific innovation are none. So turning to our COVID-specific updates, by the numbers according to the World Health Organization, there has been a staggering 242 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, about 20% of these reported in the U.S. alone, including over 4.9 million cumulative deaths. In the U.S., the incidence of new COVID-19 cases has welcomingly declined over 55% from its recent September peak of over 160,000 new cases to now 70,000 new cases, and we hope to see this trend and decline continue, of course. Three of the most widely distributed vaccines worldwide and authorized by the FDA has been developed by [indiscernible 0:09:36.3], Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson. And roughly 67% of the vaccine eligible population in our country that's 12 and over have been fully vaccinated. So this is just over 57% of the total U.S. population. And we hope with boosters and expanding indications that this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to rise. As we saw last week, the FDA authorized the use of Moderna and Johnson and Johnson boosters, in addition to Pfizer's already authorized booster shots, as well as the mixing and matching of booster doses between Pfizer Moderna and J&J in eligible populations. In light of the evolving data on the duration of immunity and COVID-19 variants concerns, including the common Delta variant, and now the Delta plus variants hitting U.S. soil, it's highly likely that COVID-19 vaccines will be required long-term. With regard to vaccine efficacy, in a study evaluating the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines at preventing symptomatic illness, the Moderna vaccine had an efficacy rate of 96% and Pfizer at 89%. So as we've all heard, breakthrough infections have occurred in a high single digit percentage of vaccinated population. But, while current vaccines may not entirely prevent transmission or contraction of COVID-19, they do significantly prevent severe disease and deaths, with over 90% of all hospitalized COVID cases represented by unvaccinated individuals. With regard to vaccine safety, there have been very few vaccine related adverse events, less than seven per million reported overall, with nearly all cases resolving and without long-term side effects reported to-date. Given such a strong efficacy and safety profile, the FDA granted full approval for Pfizer's mRNA-based vaccine for people 16 and older, and Moderna\u2019s mRNA-based vaccine is likely to achieve full approval for its vaccine for 18 and older in the fourth quarter. With regard to pregnancy in women of childbearing age, based on the safety data generated to-date and how we know vaccines work in the body, the CDC and top health officials have encouraged any Americans who was pregnant, planning to become pregnant or currently breastfeeding to get vaccinated against the Coronavirus as soon as possible. With regard to children, Pfizer reported that its COVID-19 vaccine for ages 5 to 11 was safe and nearly 91% effective. And on the basis of this data, the FDA is expected to authorize Pfizer's vaccine for this population in the fourth quarter. Moderna also just announced yesterday that its COVID vaccine is both safe and highly effective in children ages 6 to 11, which they will also submit to the FDA. For young children ages six months to four years, vaccine authorization will likely come in early 2022. So despite these advances in vaccines, given that COVID will likely remain on the planet for the foreseeable future, albeit as an endemic virus, with seasonal and sporadic geographic peaks therapies are going to continue to be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19. And so most notably this past month, Alexandria tenant Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics submitted an EUA application to the FDA for oral antiviral molnupiravir.  This drug demonstrated a 50% reduction in hospitalization or death in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. If authorized, molnupiravir will be the first oral antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is a big deal. It's far easier and more cost effective to administer broadly compared to current antibody treatments in the mild and moderate COVID-19 population. So despite the COVID fatigue that we all absolutely feel on the multitude of challenges that this pandemic has placed on our countries or society and the world, of course, the scientific advances achieved at an unprecedented speed is the one saving grace of this tragic period in our history. The scientific attitude and adaptability of so many of our tenants to translate their broad platforms, and decades of work into safe and effective vaccines, therapies and testing in really a year's time is remarkable. And application of these tools will forever transform the way we develop vaccines against novel targets. It will also augment future surveillance testing and our nation's pandemic preparedness overall. So, to touch on another topic on the NIH and FDA leadership, the pandemic has also underscored how critical these agencies are, and that solid support for these key federal agencies is paramount for national security, for ensuring that the U.S. maintains its leadership in advancing scientific and biomedical innovation, and for maximizing our ability to address current and future health challenges. So interestingly, over the past several weeks the leadership positions at these two agencies have received increasing attention. On October 5, long tenured NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins announced that he would be stepping down as the Director of the agency by the end of the year. Dr. Collins is the longest serving presidentially appointed NIH Director, having served three U.S. Presidents over more than 12-years. During his tenure, the NIH has received increasing bipartisan support, and the agency's budget grew from $30 billion in 2009, when he started to nearly $50 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. The Biden administration is undergoing a formal process to name Collins replacement, which is expected later this year or more likely early next, and we're optimistic that his successor will continue to bolster biomedical and public health research in this country. As for the FDA, Acting Commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock has led the agency since the beginning of the Biden administration. Under her leadership in addition to the COVID-related emergencies authorizations that I just spoke about, the FDA\u2019s CDER has approved 40 new molecular entities through the third quarter, putting the agency on pace in the 2020s near record high of 53 approvals. So because Dr. Janet Woodcock sort of fires on November 15, the administration now needs to select and appoint a new Commissioner in the coming weeks. So similarly, on October 14, the Biden administration announced that it\u2019s likely to nominate Dr. Robert Califf as the next Commissioner of the FDA. Dr. Califf is a Cardiologist by training, and current Head of Clinical Policy and Strategy for Verily and Google Health.  Dr. Califf also served as FDA Commissioner from 2016 to 2017, end of the Obama administration after being appointed Deputy Commissioner in 2015. Dr. Califf is also very well-known and dear to us at Alexandria as a regular participant in the Alexandria Summit for the past several years, and a partner in our OneFifteen Project to address the opioid epidemic, as Joes just spoke about. Dr. Califf's nomination would be viewed very favorably by the life science industry, key investors and stakeholders. Clearly, the strength of the FDA is instrumental for ensuring the continued pace and vitality of biomedical innovation in our country. And I just wanted to highlight, in addition to the COVID-19-related updates that we'll likely see in the fourth quarter, the FDA will also announce a handful of major approval decisions before the end of the year. Decisions that have positive will bring critical new drugs to patients as well as billions of dollars of additional revenue to the sector. For example, Eli Lilly is expected to submit an application for accelerated approval of an Alzheimer's therapy, known as donanemab. And given all the controversy surrounding FDA\u2019s positive approval of Biogen's Aduhelm in the same application, the approval of Lilly's drug would likely inform future approvals in this area. There's also a major decision regarding a new class of drugs for severe atopic dermatitis from Pfizer and AbbVie, and several other awaited approvals for growing biotechs, including the approval of [indiscernible] for the treatment of bipolar disorder from longstanding Alexandria attendant and investment intracellular therapies. So just to wrap up, before I turn it to Steve, I wanted to share a quote from former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb in his new book, uncontrolled spread by COVID-19 cross death and how we can defeat the next pandemic. In his book, Gottlieb writes, the brief history of COVID shows that innovation can't always be predicted, we don't know which platform will yield answers for future threats. As part of our national preparedness, it will be important to stockpile countermeasures to some of the known risks. But it's equally important to support the development of novel technology platforms that have broad applicability over a range of potential threats. The use of mRNA to customize synthetic vaccines show the value of having agile competencies at the ready. These are the technologies we will need to produce our nation's vulnerability. So does this opportune focus and unique ability and responsibility as a life science industry that continues to reaffirm why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and our purpose to help drive this mission-critical industry forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Thank you. Yeah, I think on that point, I was just going to say that I think, robotics innovation broadly, I think, allow a lot these companies to build larger and broader and more robust platforms. So companies are working more efficiently, but they're working on kind of parallel streams at once. So I don't really think that that -- I think robotics has enhanced what companies are looking for, but not really change necessarily real space needs, I think just the whole because the track of the entire industry. I don't think that's like a real thing, Yeah, Yep."

Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaula Schwartz: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

With me here today are, Jenna Foger, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. We want to welcome all to this second quarter call and also as I always try to do to recognize and thank the entire Alexandria family team for one of the best quarters in the entire history of the company with an operational tempo really like none other, while working virtually for many of us for most of the past, now we into our second year of COVID. Michael Jordan once said some people want it to happen, some people wish it to happen, others make it happen. Alexandria makes it happen. We are deeply mission-driven and thankful for all that we do and urge you to read about many of our important programs and activities in the corporate social responsibility area in our press release. For a moment keys to the second quarter, historic high demand for Alexandria's lab space and our critical lab operations, which go along with that. Alexandra is at the vanguard of meeting the historic and high unprecedented demand from many of our more than 750 tenants for growth needs now, and a critical path for future growth very importantly. Fundamental drivers of demand are the strongest we've ever seen. Rental rate growth continues unabated and no excess supply on the horizon at this time. We're very proud that we've got almost 7% quarter-to-quarter per share FFO growth, more than 40% rental rate growth, almost 18% NOI growth, almost 8% same store NOI growth and a $1.3 billion plus annual NOI run rate, not to mention about $545 million in incremental revenue in our development and redevelopment pipeline. Alexandria truly has a demonstrable pricing power advantage in each of our cluster markets. And when the Life Science tenants choose, they almost always prefer Alexandria's lab space and our operational excellence based on our critical lab operations. Nature, a biotechnology magazine back in April wrote the following; 2020 was a year that smashed many records, biotech savior role in the pandemic, attractive a stampede of private and public investors alike. The pandemic apparently reinforced the requirement for long term value based investors of any kind to have exposure to life sciences. And life science demand has in fact, at an all-time high as the world has recognized the importance of next generation therapies to solve current and future really difficult healthcare challenges, and Jen will talk a bit more about it.\nJenna Foger: Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joel highlighted last quarter, we continue to be reaffirmed by the fundamental future's shares is a tremendous paradox of this pandemic moment for the life sciences industry. Despite the challenges of these past many months, COVID has illuminated the power of science and the industry's ability to transform the future of human health. Not only as so many of our tenants in the industry, as Joel mentioned, risen to the challenge of combating this global pandemic, but R&D and bio innovation broadly have persisted with amazing productivity, resilience and expediency throughout this time and we cannot stress enough how critical it is for us as a whole to preserve and prioritize, and continue to catalyze this groundbreaking innovation has and will continue to save so many lives. Now turning to COVID specific update for a few moments. According to the World Health Organization, as of this morning on a global scale, over 194 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 including over 4.1 million death. A total of 3.7 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide with nearly 10% of these doses in the US alone. Roughly 57.5% of the vaccine eligible population in our country that's  over have been fully vaccinated by either tenant Pfizer or Moderna 2-shot mRNA-based vaccine or tenant Johnson & Johnson single-shot. This is just over 49% of the total US population and we hope this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to steadily rise. These numbers are astounding. And before we get into the where are we now, I want to emphasize that despite the COVID fatigue, we all continue to feel even despite some relief from the easing of restrictions over the past few months, albeit with the likely return of some new ones, none of where we are in the recovery process can be taken for granted. The fact that the biopharma industry spearheaded by many of our tenants was equipped with the know-how, resources and technology to create safe and effective vaccines to combat a novel viral pathogen would have been unimaginable just a few decades ago. The fact that our tenants Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson were able to develop, run robust clinical trials, manufacture and distribute billions of vaccines at scale in less than 12 months is absolutely unprecedented. These vaccines achieve such astounding safety and efficacy in the 90-plus percent range when the FDA has set the original bar at 50% with an amazingly low incidence of side effects reported from the millions of people who have now received that is truly astounding.\nSteve Richardson: Thank you, Jenna. I'd like to take a step back at the start of my comments and provide some historical context for the accelerating demand, which really translates into leasing at warp speed for Alexandria's mega campuses. At Alexandria's Annual Investor Day during December 2017, we presented a bold framework to nearly double the company's annual rental revenues from a little more than $800 million to $1.5 billion by the end of 2022. We are pleased to share those annualized revenues for Q2 2021 are in fact in excess of $1.5 billion, and so the Alexandria team has accomplished this lofty goal in an accelerated time frame more than one year sooner than anticipated. The company has also grown from a mission critical operating asset base and development pipeline of 29 million square feet at the end of 2017 to a total of 62 million square feet at the end of Q2 2021. Truly exceptional growth, more than doubling the footprint of the company, and importantly, concentrated in our core clusters with disciplined execution, enabling the continuation of high quality cash flows. And as we fielded questions during the 2020 as to whether the healthy leasing activity for Alexandria's mega campus platform was perhaps a short term blip driven by COVID-19, the second quarter of this year's leasing volume of more than 1.9 million square feet, the highest quarterly leasing volume in the history of the company is again evidence of the company's unique position as a trusted partner to the growing life science industry, providing a durable and sustainable competitive advantage in the market. I'll go ahead and review a few of the exceptional highlights, including the following, leasing outperformance. As we just stated, the 1.9 million square feet lease represents the highest quarterly leasing activity during the 27 year history of the company. Truly leasing at warp speed. I'll direct you to Page 2 of the supplemental where it indicates the 3.4 million square feet under construction is 80% leased and the additional 3.6 million square feet anticipated to commence construction during 2021, 2022 is 89% leased and negotiating. So robust leasing and our growth pipeline provides exceptional clarity, and these projects in total will drive incremental revenues in excess of $545 million. We also have exceptional core results. Cash increases this quarter of 25.4% and GAAP increases of 42.4%. Occupancy remained very solid at 94.3% in the operating portfolio, which would have been 98.1% if we're not for the 1.4 million square feet of vacancy in recently acquired properties, which provide for near term incremental annual rental revenues in excess of $55 million. In market health, demand, as we've outlined, continues to accelerate and Alexandria is branded in highly desirable mega campuses. And supply does continue to be restrained during 2021 across all of our markets, and we do not see any disruptive large-scale projects delivering 2022, '23. We're closely evaluating Greater Boston's ground up pipeline, which is 56% leased. And in the San Francisco area, we are monitoring leasing activity at two or two ground-up lab projects. And as we've stated before, there have been no significant lab sublease spaces put in the market for several quarters now. So in conclusion, the first half of 2021 continues the very strong outperformance by Alexandria and our intent focus on operational excellence has positioned the company very well to enhance its industry leading brand. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and construction cost trends, comment on our recent asset sales and report on a couple of comps that reflect that the private market appetite for life science assets is still very healthy. As Steve and Joel both noted, we're experiencing historic demand and have responded by executing our differentiated life science strategy at an accelerated pace through expanding our collaborative campuses and asset base in each of our cluster markets. A significant sign of the health of the underlying life science industry is that we're expanding significantly in almost all of our markets. In many of our submarkets, the supply and demand imbalance has been exacerbated by lack of near term opportunities to expand, leading Alexandria to push the boundaries of those markets. Examples of this are successful forays into Watertown and Seaport in Greater Boston, new mega campuses in Sorrento Mesa and expansion of San Diego Science sector to the north and east, and a highly successful mega campus underway in San Carlos. This high demand paired with our highly experienced development teams resulted in another very productive quarter for Alexandria. In the second quarter, we delivered 755,565 square feet, spread over five assets located in South San Francisco, San Carlos, Long Island City, San Diego and the Research Triangle. This is double what we delivered in the first quarter and these deliveries will provide more than $31 million in annual rental revenue over the next year. In addition, this historic demand has led to improved quarter-over-quarter leasing and leases under negotiation numbers despite adding two new assets that have had little marketing time. Assets contributing notably to this outcome include; 840 Winter Street and Waltham Mass, which is a testament to our ability to capture demand from companies needing facilities for next gen manufacturing; 3160 Porter Drive in Palo Alto, a joint effort with Stanford to commercialize the University's most innovative science; and 5505 Morehouse in Sorrento Mesa, which is benefiting from Alexandria's place making expertise and strong demand drivers in San Diego. As illustrated on Page 2 of the press release, this historic demand and our corresponding strategic response has led to our current pipeline growing to 3.4 million square feet in 33 properties that are, as Steve mentioned, 80% leased or under negotiation. In addition, we expect to have another 3.6 million square feet in 19 properties commenced construction this year and next that are already 89% leased or under negotiation. As Steve also mentioned, these properties will cumulatively add approximately $545 million of annual rental revenue once fully delivered. I felt it necessary to remind everybody of that. Construction costs remain elevated from some trades and commodities holding study and others continuing to be unexplainable and unprecedented levels. Lumber is a positive story and could be a microcosm for what will happen with other commodities. A year ago, lumber was $500 per thousand board feet, which was about $100 above its historical norm. It climbed to $1,700 per thousand board feet in early May but has since dropped back down to $600 per thousand board feet and is still dropping. The reason for the drop was a large number of residential projects were put on hold due to the price of lumber. With this pullback in demand, the mills have been able to catch up, leading to stabilization in pricing. A correction due to a decrease in demand is essentially what's going to eventually normalize all construction commodities. Copper has shown signs of signs of dropping but it's still 2 times above historical norms. Alternatives such as aluminum are being considered to alleviate the pricing pressures. And if there's enough adoption, it could lead to a stabilization in pricing. Despite the promising news with lumber and copper, rolled steel remains very volatile and is not showing any signs of stabilizing. Rolled steel is used for things such as metal decks, metal studs and duct work. So it's very impactful on multilevel buildings with large HVAC needs, such as lab buildings. So we have to keep our cost escalation assumptions on the high end despite the noted drop in some commodities. The reason being reported is both a commodity and labor issue at the shops that create the products from raw materials. COVID caused many to shut down. And then when demand exploded, the shops had a hard time getting the labor to come back. The shops try to solve this by scheduling longer shifts but the amount of rolled steel showing up was not enough to support those shops. Thus, prices remain very high with metal studs up 75% since January. We want to assure you that we're keeping a very close eye on commodities and have been developing strategies to counter these increases. And together with our prudent underwriting, we will continue to deliver our projects on time and on budget as we always have. I'll conclude by commenting on our recent sales and provide a couple of comps that were announced recently. I discussed our record 4% cap rate at 213 East Grand last quarter, but I want to add that in addition to achieving that cap rate, we also achieved an unlevered IRR of 9.6% and a value creation margin, which is calculated by dividing our gain by gross book value of 56%. This quarter, as disclosed on Page 3 of the press release, we once again demonstrated our ability to create tremendous value for our shareholders by selling 70% interest in 400 Dexter, located in the Lake Union submarket of Seattle for 4.2% cash cap rate with a gross value equaling $1,255 per square foot. We achieved 12% unlevered IRR on this sale and a value creation margin of 61%, a truly remarkable outcome and it's very reflective of the high quality assets we've developed and continue to develop in the Seattle region and elsewhere. Outside of those Alexandria transactions, there are a couple of transactions of note in our submarkets that reflect the high value that private investors are putting on life science assets today. In Sorrento Mesa, an asset known as The Canyons, which contains a little over a third of lab and manufacturing space with the balance being office sold at 4.48% cap rate and a value of $575 per square foot. The cash flow is from a credit tenant and there is no near term upside, so the cap rate really reflects the yield a private investor was willing to pay in a submarket that a couple of years ago would have commanded a cap rate with a six handle. In a similar vein, the other comp we're reporting comes from Rockville, Maryland, which was received to be a seven cap rate submarket by some analysts not too long ago. 9615 Medical Center Drive, located in the Shady Grove submarket and adjacent to a number of Alexandria properties, was sold to a US insurance company for 5.18% cap rate and a valuation of $610 per square foot. The asset is a leasehold interest subject to a long term ground lease that happens to be owned by Alexandria. Thank you. And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported exceptional operating and financial results for the first half of '21 and provided a very strong outlook for the remainder of the year. Revenue and net operating income for the second quarter was up 16.6% and 16.8% over the second quarter of 2020, respectively. And NOI for the second quarter was up 6.9% over the first quarter of '21. Now venture investment gains included in FFO per share were $25.5 million for the second quarter and was consistent with the first quarter of '21. Now looking back over the last two quarters, we raised our outlook for FFO per share $0.03 when we reported first quarter results. And during the second quarter, we raised our outlook for FFO per share again by another $0.02. Now this $0.02 increase was announced in connection with our Form 8-K filing date at June 14th when we were substantially through the second quarter and had solid visibility into the strength of core results for the quarter. Same property NOI growth for the first half of '21 continue to benefit from our high quality tenant roster with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade rated or large cap publicly traded companies. Same property NOI growth for the first half of '21 was very strong at 4.4% and 7.4% on a cash basis. High rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing the space was the key driver for the improvement in our outlook for 2021 same property net operating growth to 2% to 4% and 4.7% to 6.7%, an increase of 30 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. Now while the primary focus of our acquisitions for 2021 has been driven by strong demand from our tenant relationships for both current and future development and redevelopment projects, certain acquisitions have also included operating properties with opportunities to drive growth and cash flows through lease-up of vacancy. Now these operating properties have contributed to NOI growth in the first half of '21, it's important to highlight that the lease-up of 1.4 million rental square feet of vacancy at these properties will provide further growth in annual rental revenue in excess of $55 million. Now occupancy that we reported for June 30th was 94.3% and 98.1% on a pro forma basis, excluding vacancy from recently acquired properties. And it's also important to highlight that if we set aside recently acquired properties, our occupancy is on track to improve by 100 basis points in 2021. Now we believe it's important to highlight the strategic benefits of having the team with tremendous experience and expertise with designing, building and operating sophisticated laboratory office buildings and the team with decades of trusted partnerships with our highly innovative tenants. As mentioned earlier, we have one of the highest credit tenant rosters in the REIT industry. We have one of the highest adjusted EBITDA margins in the REIT industry at 69%. We reported our lowest AR balance since 2012 at $6.7 million, truly amazing when you consider that our total market capitalization was over $26 billion as of June 30th. And we continue to consistently report high collections at 99.4% for July. We reported record leasing velocity at over 3.6 million rentable square feet executed in the first half of this year. And this run rate is significantly exceeding the strong leasing volume for 2020 and on track for exceptional rental rate growth in the range of 31% to 34% and 18% to 21% on lease renewals and re-leasing the space, that last figure is on a cash basis, by the way. Now as a trusted partner with access to over 750 tenants in our portfolio, we are well positioned to capture the tremendous demand from our tenant roster and life science industry relationships. We have a super exciting pipeline of projects under construction, aggregating 3.4 million rentable square feet, 80% lease negotiating. Near term projects starts 89% leased were under negotiations, aggregating 3.7 million square feet. Now this aggregates about 6.9 million square feet, 90% of which is related to space requirements from our existing relationships. These projects will generate an amazing amount of incremental annual rental revenue exceeding $545 million or 34% increase above the second quarter rental revenues annualized of $1.6 billion. Now importantly, we also expect to start additional projects between now and December of 2022. Our venture investments portfolio continue to highlight the exceptional talent of our science and technology team for underwriting high quality innovative entities. As of June 30th, unrealized gains were $962 million on an adjusted cost basis of $990 million. Realized gains on our venture investments for the second quarter were $60.2 million, including $34.8 million of realized gains excluded from FFO per share. Now for the first half of '21, we realized gains aggregating about $57.7 million that related to significant gains in three investments that were excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. Now we're pleased that the venture investment program is generating capital exceeding our initial forecast for 2021, and we hope this will be in the range of about $100 million plus for the entire year. Now continuing on to our very strong and flexible balance sheet to support our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to be very pleased to have one of the best balance sheets in the REIT industry, providing us access to attractive long term cost of capital. We remain on track for net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.2 times by year-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio for the fourth quarter has increased to greater than 5 times. We continue to maintain significant liquidity of $4.5 billion as of June 30th. We're in a solid position with debt maturities with our next maturity, representing only $184 million comes due in 2024. And while it's challenging to predict when owners of real estate will decide to sell, two to three transactions drove most of the amount of acquisitions and accounted for about half of our target for 2021. For the remainder of the year, our goal is to remain very selective with acquisitions. Our team is advancing a number of important decisions, primarily focused on partial interest sales in high value, low cap rate properties for reinvestment into our strategic value creation development and redevelopment projects. Now to date, in 2021, we have completed $580 million at cap rates in the 4% to 4.2% range. And we have about $1.4 billion in process at various stages and expect to move along other dispositions that will push us well above the top end of our range for dispositions, which are currently at $2.2 billion. Now we are targeting about $1 billion in dispositions to close in the third quarter and the remainder in the fourth quarter. Importantly, each of these key pending transactions will continue to highlight the tremendous value we have and continue to create for our stakeholders. Now as a reminder, please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for a detailed and updated guidance assumptions for 2021. This guidance is an update to our guidance for the year that was disclosed on our Form 8-K dated June 14th. We narrowed the range of guidance from $0.10 to $0.08 for both EPS and FFO per share. EPS was updated to a range from $3.46 to $3.54 and FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range from $7.71 to $7.79 with no change in the midpoint of FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $7.75. Now as a reminder, since our initial FFO per share guidance for 2021, we have increased the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 for growth in 2021, representing an increase of 6.1% over 2020. Now before I turn it back over to Joel Marcus, I just wanted to highlight that we recently published our annual ESG report, highlighting continued leadership in sustainability, social and governance matters. I also wanted to express our team's appreciation for continued recognition by an independent panel of judges for a six NAREIT Gold Award for Communication and Reporting Excellence to the investment community. So congratulations to our team for outstanding execution, and I'll turn it back to Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thanks very much, Dean. Operator, we can go to questions, please.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session . Our first question will come from Manny Korchman with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: So Dean, in your last comment, you talked about going forward being more selective on acquisitions. I was wondering if you can, or maybe Peter, sort of talk about what's going to change in your approach or your underwriting, or the yields you're targeting relative to the feracious appetite that you've had in putting capital out, how will deals going forward be scrutinized versus the deals that you've done?\nJoel Marcus: Maybe it's best to amend that word, selective, and think about it as being a bit more patient. We've had -- if you just look at the quality of deals we've done, we don't change our underwriting. We don't change our focus. It hasn't changed for a very long time. We look at -- if you look at the two big deals we did this year, both were aimed at, one, creating a new submarket in Boston and the other was extending the Alexandria Center for Life Science at Kendall Square. Both of those to meet kind of historic high demand. But we're mindful of the overall capital markets. So I think we're being just a bit of a slower pace, but I wouldn't say the selectivity or the change in the underwriting or how we do things, or what we do is any way shape or form changed.\nMichael Bilerman: And from the capital markets, you've shown a lot of discipline in prefunding a lot of these deals through forward, through deb, or through straight equity offerings. Is it more of a concern about where the markets are going, Joel, in your mind about funding future deals?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think one has to just be mindful that if you look at -- we\u2019re probably at a historic high with GDP right now. We're probably peaking. And it's just hard to know where the market might go. So we're just going to be careful about, stepwise about how we do things. We also have no anticipation of when -- I think Dean said this pretty clearly. We don't know when an owner is going to bring an asset to market. And so that oftentimes drives decisions as to the 750 tenants, many of whom have active current requirements and many of whom want a path to future growth. So we just have to be -- maybe the best word to use is judicious rather than selective and that's not necessarily parsing words. So I think we're just going to be judicious about how we go forward. There's only so many big acquisitions one can continue to do and that actually exists. So I think the market will determine that.\nMichael Bilerman: I think judicious, it definitely sounds like more of the word rather than selective in the comments. And then secondly, just on supply, Joel, in your opening comments, you basically said that it's not a concern of yours. Now you're obviously, as an entity, building a ton, others are building a lot. Is it just the level of preleasing and tenant demand that causes you not to worry about the levels of development going on in life sciences and just the overall excitement that there is on behalf of a lot of corporate landlords to do it?\nJoel Marcus: So I'm going to ask Steve to comment. But I would say we're always worried about everything. I think when you look at -- and we're fans of Jim Collins. We always have productive paranoia. And so we're always -- every day we wake up, we assume nothing and we have to prove everything. And so I don't think it has to do with our not or our not worrying or so forth. But I think if you look in each of the key markets, you look in the Bay Area, you look at the Greater Boston area, the supply chart really is focused out several years. It's not focused on '21, '22 or even '23. You start to see bigger blips, for example, Kilroy's capability to do large scale projects in the Oyster Point area in South San Francisco. Pretty large numbers but those are out quite a number of years. They're also at a disadvantage because they have a substandard location to kind of the gateway location. But Steve, do you want to comment on kind of on the supply overall issue? I think you have a good perspective on that.\nSteve Richardson: Look, we have been in these markets for more than two decades. We track this on a building-by-building parcel-by-parcel basis. So we have absolute granular information and insight on these projects. And just to add to what Joel said, when you look at Greater Boston in that pipeline, projects that actually have gone vertical that are under construction, more than half of that is already leased, and those will extend into 2022 and 2023. So when you look at that, you really don't see very significant pieces being added to the overall inventory from that basis. Other people may be talking about supply but again, four or five years out, inevitably, the markets will change. Office will always be an alternative for all of these new entrants as well. And then in the Bay Area, as Joel said, there's two or three projects we're monitoring. There is leasing activity there. So there is additional supply but we don't see large, disruptive, very large projects that are well under construction that have no leasing activity. So again, we do monitor it on a very granular basis and that's what we're seeing over the next year or two or even two and half years.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI.\nSheila McGrath: Acquisition cap rates have compressed for life science as we can see at 400 Dexter. How should we think about the development yields for your current pipeline? Should we expect some of the newer projects to have a little bit or some compression in the development yields versus historic yields?\nJoel Marcus: So Peter\u2026\nPeter Moglia: I think it's fair to say that there's been a tremendous amount of growth in rents. So that will help keep the returns buoyant, but with that has come a growth in the cost of land. There's been some, obviously, some cost increases that I just went over in my comments. But I think it's fair to say that our goal of development, redevelopment, having a minimum spread of 150 bps over exit cap rates will continue. And so that's a very important number for us. We often exceed that well over 200 bps in many cases. But yes, just the cost of capital is advantageous. So you can develop something to a six and it'd be very accretive, especially if you can sell it for a four.\nSheila McGrath: And then I was wondering if you could provide a little more detail on the Sorrento Mesa acquisition of existing buildings. Will you redevelop those buildings and add density or knock some down, what are the plans there?\nPeter Moglia: I think we've got a number of scenarios that Dean and team have explored. But you're right, I mean the advantage or one of the great things about that acquisition is the ability to combine it with an existing property and create a 2 million square foot mega campus. Will that certainly contain new buildings? Whether they're all new and some are redeveloped is still to be undertaken or to be decided. But we're very comfortable with our basis there and we've got a lot of optionality with the existing buildings, but also our basis is good enough that if we take a couple down, we can build bigger ones at good yields.\nSheila McGrath: Okay. And last question. Leasing spreads were almost a record quarter. Was that driven by any one particular transaction or market? And where do you think in-place rents for your portfolio compared to market right now?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So, pretty broad, Sheila, and not based on any single one. But Steve, you could -- or Peter, you can give some view on that, on the uptick.\nSteve Richardson: Yes. The mark-to-market, Sheila, it's Steve here, has actually increased over the past several quarters. We're roughly 23.5% on a mark-to-market basis across the entire portfolio. So, I think, that's clear evidence of the continued healthy demand and rent growth.\nPeter Moglia: We were in the mid-teens not that long ago. So, that's a pretty significant increase.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Anthony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Joel, you mentioned some of the record capital formation in the form of venture capital IPOs, and I think the NIH as well. In the past, that -- those numbers have ebbed and flowed. I'm just wondering what you think happens to space demand, if there's any sort of pullback in that capital formation this time.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So, that's a really good question, and welcome to the call, Tony. This is a kind of a historic biotech bull market. It's really been going into its seventh year, which is pretty historic. I think, which gives us good comfort is on the private side, a number of the venture firms -- quite a number of the venture firms have raised record amounts of money, and those funds usually take multiple years to invest two, three, sometimes four. And so, that's going to give a runway to private companies, let's say there was a black swan event or something forbid happens that just causes the market to sell off pretty drastically. I think we're very fortunate. As Dean said, we have a historically high credit profile in our asset base. So, that's good. I think the companies that would be most at risk would be newly public companies now that are outside of the private venture or private equity financing. They're public now. And if the markets shut down, they have capital, they'll have to adjust their burn rate and be careful because they won't be able to go back to the capital market. So, I think that -- we saw that in '08 and '09. It was the newly public companies, companies that were preclinical particularly or in the clinic and needed a number of years of runway. So, that would be a downside scenario. But as I said, I think for -- at least for the coming couple of coming quarters, we see a pretty steady flow of capital. We don't see any interruption. But, you never know. If China decides to make Taiwan like Hong Kong or something like that and decide to reunify, that could cause the markets to certainly freeze up. I mean, they're already attacking a lot of the tech companies and so forth. So, I think, China remains a huge question as to the impact on the market and what their intention is.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then, just the other question I have is you mentioned your pricing power advantage and tenants wanting to be in your portfolio. Are you being asked to go to either new markets, new submarkets to satisfy some of the demands of your tenants? And just updated thoughts on potentially going to those places, if so?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think what is true of this industry for a long time, and I've said this for a long time, the life science clusters generally take a generation to grow, 25 years or more. And we see, for instance, New York\u2019s now just into the 12th year of that gestation period. And because of the density of players, the ecosystem being collaborative and cooperative as opposed to tech, which is more a little bit those guys like to be more isolated, there's an employee base there. Most companies looking to expand are opting to stay in the existing markets. I do not see and have not seen, and Steve or Peter can certainly comment, any big move toward new markets or other locations. Obviously, if somebody wants to go somewhere, I mean, we'll look at it and we'll think about it, but it's got to be a pretty convincing and persuasive situation.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJamie Feldman: Thanks. If I could just add on to Tony's question. I mean, what about on the international? I mean, clearly, your platform has absolutely proven itself. Do you have any thoughts about trying to do it again in other markets around the world?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think if you look at this quarter's results, you would ask the question why would you ever want to or need to. We spent time in India and exited India, realized that the Indian Supreme Court invalidated the Gleevec patent and so novel research just isn't going on there. We have one remaining project in China, which is partially leased up. We compete against government properties that get free rent for three years for Chinese tenants. So, that's not a really great market to grow in. I mean, Europe is fine, but it still is, by and large, their socialized medicine system. So, not a place you would think about booming R&D. So, we're very happy with the markets we're in and with our current operational view of things, Jamie.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And then -- that's helpful. And then, thinking about New York, can you give us an update on when you think you might start the new project there? And with Long Island City, it looks like 100% leased in the supplemental. Just how are you thinking about other opportunities there away from the center?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I'll have Peter comment on Long Island City. We're not 100% leased there. That's been a slower lease-up than we would have wanted, partially in due to what happened with Amazon and so forth kind of put a chill on that submarket overall. We're working with the city right now going through a process. And I would just say, stay tuned there. I think, New York is the one market that brokers tout like this big demand, but the reality is the demand is much less. And the demand is primarily organic companies that are starting up, being formed, spinning out. You don't see any big companies moving to New York for obvious reasons, high taxes, governance issues to some extent. And just it's an expensive place to be. So, we're doing great at our center. But, it's a tough market. It's a heavy lift market. You really have to create the entities that stay there, and we've helped do that over the last decade. But it's different than Boston, which is experiencing record high boom. So, just fundamentally different.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. So, you said the Long Island is not 100% leased, the supplemental\u2026\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Peter, do you want to talk about Long Island?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. Long Island, according to supplemental is 41% leased and -- 41% leased and under negotiation on page 38. So, that's actually -- the leased percentage went up 10%. So, we have started to make some progress. We meet weekly about demand there and the different companies we're talking to. Essentially, there's a lot of slow decision-making going on there. I don't know if it has to do with just the state of New York City and if people are wondering when COVID is going to not be as impactful to life there, could be one reason. But as Joel mentioned, it's definitely a market where we've had to almost create demand. It's very organic. The tenant prospects we're talking to are almost exclusively New York-created companies. And we're not getting a lot of help from in-migration. But, we are seeing everything and capitalizing on some. And admittedly, it's been a slow process, but we do think we'll get that stabilized in the near term.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. Thanks. By the way, I was looking at Page 34, which I think showed that it is, but I see what you're talking about. Thank you.\nPeter Moglia: 34, Jamie, is what we delivered to date.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Parts of the building already delivered not the full building.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: So, on the dispositions, you're looking at $2 billion for this year. And I look back at what you've done in previous years, and this is -- this will be the most by a fair margin in other years. And I'm curious, obviously, you described capital flowing into the business, like I think used the word stampede, and we're all seeing that for all the good reasons. But, are you getting any reverse inquiry where you would have maybe not sold a partial interest or whatnot, but you were just giving an offer that was too good to refuse. Is that happening to you, or is this stuff you would have sold one way or another eventually?\nJoel Marcus: I don't know. So, Peter, you could comment on that.\nPeter Moglia: Yes, Rich. I mean, I'm very confident in saying that if I made a few calls and said, hey, anything you like, want to make an offer? And the other party thought we'd sell anything that they wanted. There'd be a lot of them. So, we have been the ones that have selected what to sell. And obviously, we've done quite well. The typical profile is something that we have already really maxed the value out on at least in the near to medium to long term. So, it's a good time to monetize. But, it's fair to say that our whole portfolio is very attractive to many investors today given the shine on the life science industry.\nRich Anderson: Okay, great. And then on the development side, Peter, you mentioned you're underwriting cost inflation despite the comments on lumber. Can you say what type of inflation you're assuming when you underwrite a development? And on the other -- on the numerator side, what your assumption is for market rent growth? And, are you taking a discount to what you're seeing? I'm just curious if you could get a little bit more in the weeds of how you're underwriting a deal that so it pencils and it makes sense to go forward with it?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. I'm not getting -- not to give away too much secret sauce, but I -- last quarter I mentioned when I addressed the cost that we look at escalations in the 5% to 6% range right now. And that may not seem like a lot, but labor is fairly stable. So, these large commodity increases and with materials being about 30% of the project, you can get to a weighted average of about 5% to 6%. Now, that's -- that could be double what a normal year of escalations could be. In certain times, things obviously fluctuate. But we, along with our real estate development team, the underwriting team, communicate constantly about these things. So, we make sure we get them right. And the proof is in the pudding. The yields that we publish, we hit like pretty much 100%. So, other than that, we don't underwrite spikes in rents. I've talked about that before. We have a very good idea of what long-term growth looks like. We're probably more conservative than what actuals end up being, but that's great. Surprise the upside is always good. But yes, we're very comfortable with our current pipeline and the way we've underwritten it. And I think -- and I've been here for 23 years, been an underwriter for all that time and feel very comfortable with our process and that we'll continue to meet the numbers that we're publishing.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Yes. Thanks. Joel, in your comments you discussed the need for the U.S. to be the leader in next-gen drug manufacturing. I'm not sure if I heard you correctly or not, but did you say the U.S. only produces 11% to 13% today. I'm not sure if you're referring to semiconductor production or next-gen manufacturing?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, that was semiconductors.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Where is the next-gen manufacturing being done right now? I think, given the advancement we're seeing in technology, is it safe to assume that's going to be a bigger life science demand driver in general and for your industry?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. The answer is yes. One, it's still, in the early days; number two, because it's more integrated with the research and development side, they will tend to be either at the same location or nearby as opposed to a random manufacturing, if this was just normal synthetic chemistry pills and so forth. You could put it anywhere. You could put it in overseas or in any state. But, I think you'll see these will be much more integrated with the R&D function. And so, my guess is, the clusters as they are today, will be mostly benefited as opposed to other regions.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. And when you're looking at this, I guess, this demand driver, I guess, how close do they need to be to, I guess, the headquarters? I mean, are they going to be in Cambridge, or is it going to be in like suburban Boston, or how close does the manufacturing need to be to get that synergy with the mines within the headquarters?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Well, I think, it depends on the stage of scale-up. But, in the early clinical, preclinical and clinical, you could see that being a part of the R&D effort. But then, when it goes to full scale, you could see that being in adjacent locations. I mean, Moderna's example is a great example. They did a lot of work inside Tech Square, but then they rebuilt their plant in Norwood, et cetera. So I think that's not -- although that's a vaccine, but that's somewhat emblematic of what you could see happen.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then, I just want to -- I think, I heard you correctly, but this is going to be a driver for every cluster. I mean, is there some clusters that could benefit more than others?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think, the clusters that would benefit more are the really established clusters, obviously, the Boston market, San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego, Maryland, RTP, I mean, the ones that we're focused in. I think, secondary markets probably wouldn't do as well because you also need skilled workforce and you just don't find them. You're not going to find them in Charleston, South Carolina, per structure. Although that's a great place to be.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nTom Catherwood: Peter, maybe turning to the dispositions. Obviously, partial interest sales have been an important part of your capital sources over the past few years. When you're evaluating assets for disposition, past few years. When you're evaluating assets for disposition, how do you decide between an outright sale and a partial interest sale? And are you able to maintain enough control over the joint venture to make decisions kind of holistically across your cluster instead of prioritizing certain assets kind of to the detriment of others?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So maybe, Peter, let Dean take it first and then maybe you can kind of add the color around that.\nPeter Moglia: Sure.\nDean Shigenaga: Yes. So Tom, one part of your question really touches on the complexity of managing good governance around your joint venture relationships. And I think that's what our team has tried to do is to be very respectful of these important relationships that are being established in markets and sometimes across markets. We want to be long-term partners and be mindful as much as we've got joint venture assets and wholly owned assets in a particular market. And so, that's important. From a technical control perspective, I think we're working with partners that understand that we have the expertise to make these successful and we've asked for reasonable leeway in the relationship to be able to execute in that fashion. And so, that's been important, I think, as an attribute from a partner perspective for us. So hopefully, that helps a little bit there, Tom.\nTom Catherwood: Yes. That's really helpful. Thank you. Thank you, Dean. And then, maybe just focusing on a specific market, down in North Carolina. So back in August of 2020, you acquired the Alexandria Center for Life Science in Durham. And expectations at the time or that tenants would both expand within the research triangle ones that were there already, and then some would relocate to RTP from other areas to kind of looking for more talent. In the second quarter, occupancy in that Durham campus picked up I think almost 400 basis points alone. And then, you added another 885,000 square feet of development rights kind of in and around that campus. So, as you're now almost a year out from that large acquisition, how has the market performed there compared to underwriting? And then, what are your expectations for that going forward?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. It's been pretty spectacular. Peter, do you want to maybe give color on that?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. I can tell you that we're certainly above our rental assumptions, probably close to 10%. And then, we have definitely absorbed the vacancy faster than we had underwritten it. Yes, I give Joel a lot of credit. He definitely saw this trend coming towards RT when we made this deal and we've knocked it out of the park. It's really been great.\nTom Catherwood: And is the idea with the expansion adding the additional almost 100,000 square feet. Is that...\nPeter Moglia: Demand. There's great demand there, and that campus itself has built-in amenities. It has existing space that some tenants have gone into. And we know that those tenants will need to expand.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Tom, I think, what has distinguished Research Triangle for many years, it was kind of a 50-year-old backwater place that few companies went to and had a -- was a nice place to be. And then over the last number of years, it's emerged as a really powerhouse cluster. I mean, Apple is just now taking a gigantic stake down there. And I think what people see is, what they're looking at other places in the United States, people see a great quality of life, a modest cost environment, beautiful place anchored by three world class institutions and a really, really great workforce. So, we're seeing the incoming -- I mean, we kicked off the Beam next-gen manufacturing project. That's a company that's in Cambridge, but they came to us for their next-gen manufacturing gene therapy aimed at cancers and sickle cell, et cetera. And that was the best place because of the workforce. So, I think that, to me, has been the hallmark of that market. Great place to be, live, work, play, and really talented people, which you just can't find everywhere.\nTom Catherwood: No. That\u2019s really helpful. And it does sound like very different than what it was historically. So, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks everyone.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: Just to say thank you, everybody. And we look forward to talking to you on the third quarter earnings call. Take care. Be safe. God bless.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody to our second quarter call. With me here today are, Jenna Foger, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. We want to welcome all to this second quarter call and also as I always try to do to recognize and thank the entire Alexandria family team for one of the best quarters in the entire history of the company with an operational tempo really like none other, while working virtually for many of us for most of the past, now we into our second year of COVID. Michael Jordan once said some people want it to happen, some people wish it to happen, others make it happen. Alexandria makes it happen. We are deeply mission-driven and thankful for all that we do and urge you to read about many of our important programs and activities in the corporate social responsibility area in our press release. For a moment keys to the second quarter, historic high demand for Alexandria's lab space and our critical lab operations, which go along with that. Alexandra is at the vanguard of meeting the historic and high unprecedented demand from many of our more than 750 tenants for growth needs now, and a critical path for future growth very importantly. Fundamental drivers of demand are the strongest we've ever seen. Rental rate growth continues unabated and no excess supply on the horizon at this time. We're very proud that we've got almost 7% quarter-to-quarter per share FFO growth, more than 40% rental rate growth, almost 18% NOI growth, almost 8% same store NOI growth and a $1.3 billion plus annual NOI run rate, not to mention about $545 million in incremental revenue in our development and redevelopment pipeline. Alexandria truly has a demonstrable pricing power advantage in each of our cluster markets. And when the Life Science tenants choose, they almost always prefer Alexandria's lab space and our operational excellence based on our critical lab operations. Nature, a biotechnology magazine back in April wrote the following; 2020 was a year that smashed many records, biotech savior role in the pandemic, attractive a stampede of private and public investors alike. The pandemic apparently reinforced the requirement for long term value based investors of any kind to have exposure to life sciences. And life science demand has in fact, at an all-time high as the world has recognized the importance of next generation therapies to solve current and future really difficult healthcare challenges, and Jen will talk a bit more about it. Thanks very much, Dean. Operator, we can go to questions, please. Maybe it's best to amend that word, selective, and think about it as being a bit more patient. We've had -- if you just look at the quality of deals we've done, we don't change our underwriting. We don't change our focus. It hasn't changed for a very long time. We look at -- if you look at the two big deals we did this year, both were aimed at, one, creating a new submarket in Boston and the other was extending the Alexandria Center for Life Science at Kendall Square. Both of those to meet kind of historic high demand. But we're mindful of the overall capital markets. So I think we're being just a bit of a slower pace, but I wouldn't say the selectivity or the change in the underwriting or how we do things, or what we do is any way shape or form changed. Well, I think one has to just be mindful that if you look at -- we\u2019re probably at a historic high with GDP right now. We're probably peaking. And it's just hard to know where the market might go. So we're just going to be careful about, stepwise about how we do things. We also have no anticipation of when -- I think Dean said this pretty clearly. We don't know when an owner is going to bring an asset to market. And so that oftentimes drives decisions as to the 750 tenants, many of whom have active current requirements and many of whom want a path to future growth. So we just have to be -- maybe the best word to use is judicious rather than selective and that's not necessarily parsing words. So I think we're just going to be judicious about how we go forward. There's only so many big acquisitions one can continue to do and that actually exists. So I think the market will determine that. So I'm going to ask Steve to comment. But I would say we're always worried about everything. I think when you look at -- and we're fans of Jim Collins. We always have productive paranoia. And so we're always -- every day we wake up, we assume nothing and we have to prove everything. And so I don't think it has to do with our not or our not worrying or so forth. But I think if you look in each of the key markets, you look in the Bay Area, you look at the Greater Boston area, the supply chart really is focused out several years. It's not focused on '21, '22 or even '23. You start to see bigger blips, for example, Kilroy's capability to do large scale projects in the Oyster Point area in South San Francisco. Pretty large numbers but those are out quite a number of years. They're also at a disadvantage because they have a substandard location to kind of the gateway location. But Steve, do you want to comment on kind of on the supply overall issue? I think you have a good perspective on that. So Peter\u2026 Yes. So, pretty broad, Sheila, and not based on any single one. But Steve, you could -- or Peter, you can give some view on that, on the uptick. Yes. So, that's a really good question, and welcome to the call, Tony. This is a kind of a historic biotech bull market. It's really been going into its seventh year, which is pretty historic. I think, which gives us good comfort is on the private side, a number of the venture firms -- quite a number of the venture firms have raised record amounts of money, and those funds usually take multiple years to invest two, three, sometimes four. And so, that's going to give a runway to private companies, let's say there was a black swan event or something forbid happens that just causes the market to sell off pretty drastically. I think we're very fortunate. As Dean said, we have a historically high credit profile in our asset base. So, that's good. I think the companies that would be most at risk would be newly public companies now that are outside of the private venture or private equity financing. They're public now. And if the markets shut down, they have capital, they'll have to adjust their burn rate and be careful because they won't be able to go back to the capital market. So, I think that -- we saw that in '08 and '09. It was the newly public companies, companies that were preclinical particularly or in the clinic and needed a number of years of runway. So, that would be a downside scenario. But as I said, I think for -- at least for the coming couple of coming quarters, we see a pretty steady flow of capital. We don't see any interruption. But, you never know. If China decides to make Taiwan like Hong Kong or something like that and decide to reunify, that could cause the markets to certainly freeze up. I mean, they're already attacking a lot of the tech companies and so forth. So, I think, China remains a huge question as to the impact on the market and what their intention is. Well, I think what is true of this industry for a long time, and I've said this for a long time, the life science clusters generally take a generation to grow, 25 years or more. And we see, for instance, New York\u2019s now just into the 12th year of that gestation period. And because of the density of players, the ecosystem being collaborative and cooperative as opposed to tech, which is more a little bit those guys like to be more isolated, there's an employee base there. Most companies looking to expand are opting to stay in the existing markets. I do not see and have not seen, and Steve or Peter can certainly comment, any big move toward new markets or other locations. Obviously, if somebody wants to go somewhere, I mean, we'll look at it and we'll think about it, but it's got to be a pretty convincing and persuasive situation. Well, I think if you look at this quarter's results, you would ask the question why would you ever want to or need to. We spent time in India and exited India, realized that the Indian Supreme Court invalidated the Gleevec patent and so novel research just isn't going on there. We have one remaining project in China, which is partially leased up. We compete against government properties that get free rent for three years for Chinese tenants. So, that's not a really great market to grow in. I mean, Europe is fine, but it still is, by and large, their socialized medicine system. So, not a place you would think about booming R&D. So, we're very happy with the markets we're in and with our current operational view of things, Jamie. Yes. I'll have Peter comment on Long Island City. We're not 100% leased there. That's been a slower lease-up than we would have wanted, partially in due to what happened with Amazon and so forth kind of put a chill on that submarket overall. We're working with the city right now going through a process. And I would just say, stay tuned there. I think, New York is the one market that brokers tout like this big demand, but the reality is the demand is much less. And the demand is primarily organic companies that are starting up, being formed, spinning out. You don't see any big companies moving to New York for obvious reasons, high taxes, governance issues to some extent. And just it's an expensive place to be. So, we're doing great at our center. But, it's a tough market. It's a heavy lift market. You really have to create the entities that stay there, and we've helped do that over the last decade. But it's different than Boston, which is experiencing record high boom. So, just fundamentally different. Yes. So Peter, do you want to talk about Long Island? Yes. Parts of the building already delivered not the full building. I don't know. So, Peter, you could comment on that. Yes, that was semiconductors. Yes. The answer is yes. One, it's still, in the early days; number two, because it's more integrated with the research and development side, they will tend to be either at the same location or nearby as opposed to a random manufacturing, if this was just normal synthetic chemistry pills and so forth. You could put it anywhere. You could put it in overseas or in any state. But, I think you'll see these will be much more integrated with the R&D function. And so, my guess is, the clusters as they are today, will be mostly benefited as opposed to other regions. Yes. Well, I think, it depends on the stage of scale-up. But, in the early clinical, preclinical and clinical, you could see that being a part of the R&D effort. But then, when it goes to full scale, you could see that being in adjacent locations. I mean, Moderna's example is a great example. They did a lot of work inside Tech Square, but then they rebuilt their plant in Norwood, et cetera. So I think that's not -- although that's a vaccine, but that's somewhat emblematic of what you could see happen. Well, I think, the clusters that would benefit more are the really established clusters, obviously, the Boston market, San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego, Maryland, RTP, I mean, the ones that we're focused in. I think, secondary markets probably wouldn't do as well because you also need skilled workforce and you just don't find them. You're not going to find them in Charleston, South Carolina, per structure. Although that's a great place to be. Yes. So maybe, Peter, let Dean take it first and then maybe you can kind of add the color around that. Yes. It's been pretty spectacular. Peter, do you want to maybe give color on that? Yes. Tom, I think, what has distinguished Research Triangle for many years, it was kind of a 50-year-old backwater place that few companies went to and had a -- was a nice place to be. And then over the last number of years, it's emerged as a really powerhouse cluster. I mean, Apple is just now taking a gigantic stake down there. And I think what people see is, what they're looking at other places in the United States, people see a great quality of life, a modest cost environment, beautiful place anchored by three world class institutions and a really, really great workforce. So, we're seeing the incoming -- I mean, we kicked off the Beam next-gen manufacturing project. That's a company that's in Cambridge, but they came to us for their next-gen manufacturing gene therapy aimed at cancers and sickle cell, et cetera. And that was the best place because of the workforce. So, I think that, to me, has been the hallmark of that market. Great place to be, live, work, play, and really talented people, which you just can't find everywhere. Yes. Thanks. Just to say thank you, everybody. And we look forward to talking to you on the third quarter earnings call. Take care. Be safe. God bless."

            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and construction cost trends, comment on our recent asset sales and report on a couple of comps that reflect that the private market appetite for life science assets is still very healthy. As Steve and Joel both noted, we're experiencing historic demand and have responded by executing our differentiated life science strategy at an accelerated pace through expanding our collaborative campuses and asset base in each of our cluster markets. A significant sign of the health of the underlying life science industry is that we're expanding significantly in almost all of our markets. In many of our submarkets, the supply and demand imbalance has been exacerbated by lack of near term opportunities to expand, leading Alexandria to push the boundaries of those markets. Examples of this are successful forays into Watertown and Seaport in Greater Boston, new mega campuses in Sorrento Mesa and expansion of San Diego Science sector to the north and east, and a highly successful mega campus underway in San Carlos. This high demand paired with our highly experienced development teams resulted in another very productive quarter for Alexandria. In the second quarter, we delivered 755,565 square feet, spread over five assets located in South San Francisco, San Carlos, Long Island City, San Diego and the Research Triangle. This is double what we delivered in the first quarter and these deliveries will provide more than $31 million in annual rental revenue over the next year. In addition, this historic demand has led to improved quarter-over-quarter leasing and leases under negotiation numbers despite adding two new assets that have had little marketing time. Assets contributing notably to this outcome include; 840 Winter Street and Waltham Mass, which is a testament to our ability to capture demand from companies needing facilities for next gen manufacturing; 3160 Porter Drive in Palo Alto, a joint effort with Stanford to commercialize the University's most innovative science; and 5505 Morehouse in Sorrento Mesa, which is benefiting from Alexandria's place making expertise and strong demand drivers in San Diego. As illustrated on Page 2 of the press release, this historic demand and our corresponding strategic response has led to our current pipeline growing to 3.4 million square feet in 33 properties that are, as Steve mentioned, 80% leased or under negotiation. In addition, we expect to have another 3.6 million square feet in 19 properties commenced construction this year and next that are already 89% leased or under negotiation. As Steve also mentioned, these properties will cumulatively add approximately $545 million of annual rental revenue once fully delivered. I felt it necessary to remind everybody of that. Construction costs remain elevated from some trades and commodities holding study and others continuing to be unexplainable and unprecedented levels. Lumber is a positive story and could be a microcosm for what will happen with other commodities. A year ago, lumber was $500 per thousand board feet, which was about $100 above its historical norm. It climbed to $1,700 per thousand board feet in early May but has since dropped back down to $600 per thousand board feet and is still dropping. The reason for the drop was a large number of residential projects were put on hold due to the price of lumber. With this pullback in demand, the mills have been able to catch up, leading to stabilization in pricing. A correction due to a decrease in demand is essentially what's going to eventually normalize all construction commodities. Copper has shown signs of signs of dropping but it's still 2 times above historical norms. Alternatives such as aluminum are being considered to alleviate the pricing pressures. And if there's enough adoption, it could lead to a stabilization in pricing. Despite the promising news with lumber and copper, rolled steel remains very volatile and is not showing any signs of stabilizing. Rolled steel is used for things such as metal decks, metal studs and duct work. So it's very impactful on multilevel buildings with large HVAC needs, such as lab buildings. So we have to keep our cost escalation assumptions on the high end despite the noted drop in some commodities. The reason being reported is both a commodity and labor issue at the shops that create the products from raw materials. COVID caused many to shut down. And then when demand exploded, the shops had a hard time getting the labor to come back. The shops try to solve this by scheduling longer shifts but the amount of rolled steel showing up was not enough to support those shops. Thus, prices remain very high with metal studs up 75% since January. We want to assure you that we're keeping a very close eye on commodities and have been developing strategies to counter these increases. And together with our prudent underwriting, we will continue to deliver our projects on time and on budget as we always have. I'll conclude by commenting on our recent sales and provide a couple of comps that were announced recently. I discussed our record 4% cap rate at 213 East Grand last quarter, but I want to add that in addition to achieving that cap rate, we also achieved an unlevered IRR of 9.6% and a value creation margin, which is calculated by dividing our gain by gross book value of 56%. This quarter, as disclosed on Page 3 of the press release, we once again demonstrated our ability to create tremendous value for our shareholders by selling 70% interest in 400 Dexter, located in the Lake Union submarket of Seattle for 4.2% cash cap rate with a gross value equaling $1,255 per square foot. We achieved 12% unlevered IRR on this sale and a value creation margin of 61%, a truly remarkable outcome and it's very reflective of the high quality assets we've developed and continue to develop in the Seattle region and elsewhere. Outside of those Alexandria transactions, there are a couple of transactions of note in our submarkets that reflect the high value that private investors are putting on life science assets today. In Sorrento Mesa, an asset known as The Canyons, which contains a little over a third of lab and manufacturing space with the balance being office sold at 4.48% cap rate and a value of $575 per square foot. The cash flow is from a credit tenant and there is no near term upside, so the cap rate really reflects the yield a private investor was willing to pay in a submarket that a couple of years ago would have commanded a cap rate with a six handle. In a similar vein, the other comp we're reporting comes from Rockville, Maryland, which was received to be a seven cap rate submarket by some analysts not too long ago. 9615 Medical Center Drive, located in the Shady Grove submarket and adjacent to a number of Alexandria properties, was sold to a US insurance company for 5.18% cap rate and a valuation of $610 per square foot. The asset is a leasehold interest subject to a long term ground lease that happens to be owned by Alexandria. Thank you. And with that, I'll pass it over to Dean. I think it's fair to say that there's been a tremendous amount of growth in rents. So that will help keep the returns buoyant, but with that has come a growth in the cost of land. There's been some, obviously, some cost increases that I just went over in my comments. But I think it's fair to say that our goal of development, redevelopment, having a minimum spread of 150 bps over exit cap rates will continue. And so that's a very important number for us. We often exceed that well over 200 bps in many cases. But yes, just the cost of capital is advantageous. So you can develop something to a six and it'd be very accretive, especially if you can sell it for a four. I think we've got a number of scenarios that Dean and team have explored. But you're right, I mean the advantage or one of the great things about that acquisition is the ability to combine it with an existing property and create a 2 million square foot mega campus. Will that certainly contain new buildings? Whether they're all new and some are redeveloped is still to be undertaken or to be decided. But we're very comfortable with our basis there and we've got a lot of optionality with the existing buildings, but also our basis is good enough that if we take a couple down, we can build bigger ones at good yields. We were in the mid-teens not that long ago. So, that's a pretty significant increase. Yes. Long Island, according to supplemental is 41% leased and -- 41% leased and under negotiation on page 38. So, that's actually -- the leased percentage went up 10%. So, we have started to make some progress. We meet weekly about demand there and the different companies we're talking to. Essentially, there's a lot of slow decision-making going on there. I don't know if it has to do with just the state of New York City and if people are wondering when COVID is going to not be as impactful to life there, could be one reason. But as Joel mentioned, it's definitely a market where we've had to almost create demand. It's very organic. The tenant prospects we're talking to are almost exclusively New York-created companies. And we're not getting a lot of help from in-migration. But, we are seeing everything and capitalizing on some. And admittedly, it's been a slow process, but we do think we'll get that stabilized in the near term. 34, Jamie, is what we delivered to date. Yes, Rich. I mean, I'm very confident in saying that if I made a few calls and said, hey, anything you like, want to make an offer? And the other party thought we'd sell anything that they wanted. There'd be a lot of them. So, we have been the ones that have selected what to sell. And obviously, we've done quite well. The typical profile is something that we have already really maxed the value out on at least in the near to medium to long term. So, it's a good time to monetize. But, it's fair to say that our whole portfolio is very attractive to many investors today given the shine on the life science industry. Yes. I'm not getting -- not to give away too much secret sauce, but I -- last quarter I mentioned when I addressed the cost that we look at escalations in the 5% to 6% range right now. And that may not seem like a lot, but labor is fairly stable. So, these large commodity increases and with materials being about 30% of the project, you can get to a weighted average of about 5% to 6%. Now, that's -- that could be double what a normal year of escalations could be. In certain times, things obviously fluctuate. But we, along with our real estate development team, the underwriting team, communicate constantly about these things. So, we make sure we get them right. And the proof is in the pudding. The yields that we publish, we hit like pretty much 100%. So, other than that, we don't underwrite spikes in rents. I've talked about that before. We have a very good idea of what long-term growth looks like. We're probably more conservative than what actuals end up being, but that's great. Surprise the upside is always good. But yes, we're very comfortable with our current pipeline and the way we've underwritten it. And I think -- and I've been here for 23 years, been an underwriter for all that time and feel very comfortable with our process and that we'll continue to meet the numbers that we're publishing. Sure. Yes. I can tell you that we're certainly above our rental assumptions, probably close to 10%. And then, we have definitely absorbed the vacancy faster than we had underwritten it. Yes, I give Joel a lot of credit. He definitely saw this trend coming towards RT when we made this deal and we've knocked it out of the park. It's really been great. Demand. There's great demand there, and that campus itself has built-in amenities. It has existing space that some tenants have gone into. And we know that those tenants will need to expand."

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported exceptional operating and financial results for the first half of '21 and provided a very strong outlook for the remainder of the year. Revenue and net operating income for the second quarter was up 16.6% and 16.8% over the second quarter of 2020, respectively. And NOI for the second quarter was up 6.9% over the first quarter of '21. Now venture investment gains included in FFO per share were $25.5 million for the second quarter and was consistent with the first quarter of '21. Now looking back over the last two quarters, we raised our outlook for FFO per share $0.03 when we reported first quarter results. And during the second quarter, we raised our outlook for FFO per share again by another $0.02. Now this $0.02 increase was announced in connection with our Form 8-K filing date at June 14th when we were substantially through the second quarter and had solid visibility into the strength of core results for the quarter. Same property NOI growth for the first half of '21 continue to benefit from our high quality tenant roster with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade rated or large cap publicly traded companies. Same property NOI growth for the first half of '21 was very strong at 4.4% and 7.4% on a cash basis. High rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing the space was the key driver for the improvement in our outlook for 2021 same property net operating growth to 2% to 4% and 4.7% to 6.7%, an increase of 30 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. Now while the primary focus of our acquisitions for 2021 has been driven by strong demand from our tenant relationships for both current and future development and redevelopment projects, certain acquisitions have also included operating properties with opportunities to drive growth and cash flows through lease-up of vacancy. Now these operating properties have contributed to NOI growth in the first half of '21, it's important to highlight that the lease-up of 1.4 million rental square feet of vacancy at these properties will provide further growth in annual rental revenue in excess of $55 million. Now occupancy that we reported for June 30th was 94.3% and 98.1% on a pro forma basis, excluding vacancy from recently acquired properties. And it's also important to highlight that if we set aside recently acquired properties, our occupancy is on track to improve by 100 basis points in 2021. Now we believe it's important to highlight the strategic benefits of having the team with tremendous experience and expertise with designing, building and operating sophisticated laboratory office buildings and the team with decades of trusted partnerships with our highly innovative tenants. As mentioned earlier, we have one of the highest credit tenant rosters in the REIT industry. We have one of the highest adjusted EBITDA margins in the REIT industry at 69%. We reported our lowest AR balance since 2012 at $6.7 million, truly amazing when you consider that our total market capitalization was over $26 billion as of June 30th. And we continue to consistently report high collections at 99.4% for July. We reported record leasing velocity at over 3.6 million rentable square feet executed in the first half of this year. And this run rate is significantly exceeding the strong leasing volume for 2020 and on track for exceptional rental rate growth in the range of 31% to 34% and 18% to 21% on lease renewals and re-leasing the space, that last figure is on a cash basis, by the way. Now as a trusted partner with access to over 750 tenants in our portfolio, we are well positioned to capture the tremendous demand from our tenant roster and life science industry relationships. We have a super exciting pipeline of projects under construction, aggregating 3.4 million rentable square feet, 80% lease negotiating. Near term projects starts 89% leased were under negotiations, aggregating 3.7 million square feet. Now this aggregates about 6.9 million square feet, 90% of which is related to space requirements from our existing relationships. These projects will generate an amazing amount of incremental annual rental revenue exceeding $545 million or 34% increase above the second quarter rental revenues annualized of $1.6 billion. Now importantly, we also expect to start additional projects between now and December of 2022. Our venture investments portfolio continue to highlight the exceptional talent of our science and technology team for underwriting high quality innovative entities. As of June 30th, unrealized gains were $962 million on an adjusted cost basis of $990 million. Realized gains on our venture investments for the second quarter were $60.2 million, including $34.8 million of realized gains excluded from FFO per share. Now for the first half of '21, we realized gains aggregating about $57.7 million that related to significant gains in three investments that were excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. Now we're pleased that the venture investment program is generating capital exceeding our initial forecast for 2021, and we hope this will be in the range of about $100 million plus for the entire year. Now continuing on to our very strong and flexible balance sheet to support our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to be very pleased to have one of the best balance sheets in the REIT industry, providing us access to attractive long term cost of capital. We remain on track for net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.2 times by year-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio for the fourth quarter has increased to greater than 5 times. We continue to maintain significant liquidity of $4.5 billion as of June 30th. We're in a solid position with debt maturities with our next maturity, representing only $184 million comes due in 2024. And while it's challenging to predict when owners of real estate will decide to sell, two to three transactions drove most of the amount of acquisitions and accounted for about half of our target for 2021. For the remainder of the year, our goal is to remain very selective with acquisitions. Our team is advancing a number of important decisions, primarily focused on partial interest sales in high value, low cap rate properties for reinvestment into our strategic value creation development and redevelopment projects. Now to date, in 2021, we have completed $580 million at cap rates in the 4% to 4.2% range. And we have about $1.4 billion in process at various stages and expect to move along other dispositions that will push us well above the top end of our range for dispositions, which are currently at $2.2 billion. Now we are targeting about $1 billion in dispositions to close in the third quarter and the remainder in the fourth quarter. Importantly, each of these key pending transactions will continue to highlight the tremendous value we have and continue to create for our stakeholders. Now as a reminder, please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for a detailed and updated guidance assumptions for 2021. This guidance is an update to our guidance for the year that was disclosed on our Form 8-K dated June 14th. We narrowed the range of guidance from $0.10 to $0.08 for both EPS and FFO per share. EPS was updated to a range from $3.46 to $3.54 and FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range from $7.71 to $7.79 with no change in the midpoint of FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $7.75. Now as a reminder, since our initial FFO per share guidance for 2021, we have increased the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 for growth in 2021, representing an increase of 6.1% over 2020. Now before I turn it back over to Joel Marcus, I just wanted to highlight that we recently published our annual ESG report, highlighting continued leadership in sustainability, social and governance matters. I also wanted to express our team's appreciation for continued recognition by an independent panel of judges for a six NAREIT Gold Award for Communication and Reporting Excellence to the investment community. So congratulations to our team for outstanding execution, and I'll turn it back to Joel. Yes. So Tom, one part of your question really touches on the complexity of managing good governance around your joint venture relationships. And I think that's what our team has tried to do is to be very respectful of these important relationships that are being established in markets and sometimes across markets. We want to be long-term partners and be mindful as much as we've got joint venture assets and wholly owned assets in a particular market. And so, that's important. From a technical control perspective, I think we're working with partners that understand that we have the expertise to make these successful and we've asked for reasonable leeway in the relationship to be able to execute in that fashion. And so, that's been important, I think, as an attribute from a partner perspective for us. So hopefully, that helps a little bit there, Tom."

            "name": "Steve Richardson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenna. I'd like to take a step back at the start of my comments and provide some historical context for the accelerating demand, which really translates into leasing at warp speed for Alexandria's mega campuses. At Alexandria's Annual Investor Day during December 2017, we presented a bold framework to nearly double the company's annual rental revenues from a little more than $800 million to $1.5 billion by the end of 2022. We are pleased to share those annualized revenues for Q2 2021 are in fact in excess of $1.5 billion, and so the Alexandria team has accomplished this lofty goal in an accelerated time frame more than one year sooner than anticipated. The company has also grown from a mission critical operating asset base and development pipeline of 29 million square feet at the end of 2017 to a total of 62 million square feet at the end of Q2 2021. Truly exceptional growth, more than doubling the footprint of the company, and importantly, concentrated in our core clusters with disciplined execution, enabling the continuation of high quality cash flows. And as we fielded questions during the 2020 as to whether the healthy leasing activity for Alexandria's mega campus platform was perhaps a short term blip driven by COVID-19, the second quarter of this year's leasing volume of more than 1.9 million square feet, the highest quarterly leasing volume in the history of the company is again evidence of the company's unique position as a trusted partner to the growing life science industry, providing a durable and sustainable competitive advantage in the market. I'll go ahead and review a few of the exceptional highlights, including the following, leasing outperformance. As we just stated, the 1.9 million square feet lease represents the highest quarterly leasing activity during the 27 year history of the company. Truly leasing at warp speed. I'll direct you to Page 2 of the supplemental where it indicates the 3.4 million square feet under construction is 80% leased and the additional 3.6 million square feet anticipated to commence construction during 2021, 2022 is 89% leased and negotiating. So robust leasing and our growth pipeline provides exceptional clarity, and these projects in total will drive incremental revenues in excess of $545 million. We also have exceptional core results. Cash increases this quarter of 25.4% and GAAP increases of 42.4%. Occupancy remained very solid at 94.3% in the operating portfolio, which would have been 98.1% if we're not for the 1.4 million square feet of vacancy in recently acquired properties, which provide for near term incremental annual rental revenues in excess of $55 million. In market health, demand, as we've outlined, continues to accelerate and Alexandria is branded in highly desirable mega campuses. And supply does continue to be restrained during 2021 across all of our markets, and we do not see any disruptive large-scale projects delivering 2022, '23. We're closely evaluating Greater Boston's ground up pipeline, which is 56% leased. And in the San Francisco area, we are monitoring leasing activity at two or two ground-up lab projects. And as we've stated before, there have been no significant lab sublease spaces put in the market for several quarters now. So in conclusion, the first half of 2021 continues the very strong outperformance by Alexandria and our intent focus on operational excellence has positioned the company very well to enhance its industry leading brand. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Look, we have been in these markets for more than two decades. We track this on a building-by-building parcel-by-parcel basis. So we have absolute granular information and insight on these projects. And just to add to what Joel said, when you look at Greater Boston in that pipeline, projects that actually have gone vertical that are under construction, more than half of that is already leased, and those will extend into 2022 and 2023. So when you look at that, you really don't see very significant pieces being added to the overall inventory from that basis. Other people may be talking about supply but again, four or five years out, inevitably, the markets will change. Office will always be an alternative for all of these new entrants as well. And then in the Bay Area, as Joel said, there's two or three projects we're monitoring. There is leasing activity there. So there is additional supply but we don't see large, disruptive, very large projects that are well under construction that have no leasing activity. So again, we do monitor it on a very granular basis and that's what we're seeing over the next year or two or even two and half years. Yes. The mark-to-market, Sheila, it's Steve here, has actually increased over the past several quarters. We're roughly 23.5% on a mark-to-market basis across the entire portfolio. So, I think, that's clear evidence of the continued healthy demand and rent growth."

            "content": "Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joel highlighted last quarter, we continue to be reaffirmed by the fundamental future's shares is a tremendous paradox of this pandemic moment for the life sciences industry. Despite the challenges of these past many months, COVID has illuminated the power of science and the industry's ability to transform the future of human health. Not only as so many of our tenants in the industry, as Joel mentioned, risen to the challenge of combating this global pandemic, but R&D and bio innovation broadly have persisted with amazing productivity, resilience and expediency throughout this time and we cannot stress enough how critical it is for us as a whole to preserve and prioritize, and continue to catalyze this groundbreaking innovation has and will continue to save so many lives. Now turning to COVID specific update for a few moments. According to the World Health Organization, as of this morning on a global scale, over 194 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 including over 4.1 million death. A total of 3.7 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide with nearly 10% of these doses in the US alone. Roughly 57.5% of the vaccine eligible population in our country that's  over have been fully vaccinated by either tenant Pfizer or Moderna 2-shot mRNA-based vaccine or tenant Johnson & Johnson single-shot. This is just over 49% of the total US population and we hope this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to steadily rise. These numbers are astounding. And before we get into the where are we now, I want to emphasize that despite the COVID fatigue, we all continue to feel even despite some relief from the easing of restrictions over the past few months, albeit with the likely return of some new ones, none of where we are in the recovery process can be taken for granted. The fact that the biopharma industry spearheaded by many of our tenants was equipped with the know-how, resources and technology to create safe and effective vaccines to combat a novel viral pathogen would have been unimaginable just a few decades ago. The fact that our tenants Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson were able to develop, run robust clinical trials, manufacture and distribute billions of vaccines at scale in less than 12 months is absolutely unprecedented. These vaccines achieve such astounding safety and efficacy in the 90-plus percent range when the FDA has set the original bar at 50% with an amazingly low incidence of side effects reported from the millions of people who have now received that is truly astounding."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaula Schwartz: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody to our first quarter call. And with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson and Peter Moglia. And we want to wish everybody a safe and a healthy go forward year. We want to welcome all to this first quarter call as well and recognize and thank the entire Alexandria family team for the operationally excellent and truly stellar first quarter earnings report by all metrics and measures. We collectively continue to operate at an outstandingly high level into this second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. And as I\u2019m often fond of quoting Jim Collins of \u201cGood to Great\u201d theme, commented on Alexandria\u2019s feature in our Annual Report. Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a great company: Superior results, and we believe the first quarter is emblematic of that; distinctive impact, and we believe that our social responsibility programs have truly made a difference; and lasting endurance. And with respect to lasting endurance, we sit here at literally several decades after we were founded in 1994. And I\u2019ll talk more about that in a moment. We\u2019re particularly proud of the six pillars of our highly impactful and longstanding social responsibility efforts, accelerating groundbreaking medical research to advance lifesaving treatments and cures; harnessing the entire agrifood ecosystem to combat hunger, improve nutrition, and support human health at its most fundamental level; thirdly, bolstering the resilience of our military, our veterans and their families; fourth, conquering the opioid epidemic and revolutionizing addiction treatment; the fifth pillar that we\u2019ve spent a tremendous amount of time in over the last year and for a good part of the last decade, educationally empowering underserved students to achieve long-term success, and reach their potential as important principled leaders in the community; and then, finally, building a model for comprehensive sustainable solution to address homelessness. Alexandria is also proud to be the focus cover story of the January-February 2021 NAREIT magazine, showcasing that we have pioneered a novel data-driven comprehensive care model to overcome the opioid epidemic launched in Dayton, Ohio. We\u2019re now focused on adopting a similar model but in different respects to the homeless problem, which has really become pretty out of control in many urban cities. And it is fraught with a lot of complex stratified issues and actually is more of an issue of healthcare than it is simply of one of housing. We\u2019ve been recognized as a leader and continuing, and we continue to enhance our leadership in the area of sustainability. And we\u2019re on pace to achieve our first net zero energy building in South San Francisco, one of our important sub markets, and only one of 70 of such buildings in the entire world. So, we\u2019re very proud of that achievement when we finally get the designation. I always try to think about a theme on each quarter, and they are so different given macro and micro circumstances. And I would say, the theme for the first quarter has to be exceptional core and internal growth, and really stellar value creation and external growth, both of which have driven our continued outstanding earnings results. And as the absolute go to landlord and life science real estate. Leasing demand for Alexandria\u2019s owned and operated first-in-class assets is at a historical high. And as I alluded to a moment ago, first quarter of 1994, 27 years ago, this quarter, we completed our Series A financing led by Jacobs Engineering for $19 million. And here, we sit 27 years later to the quarter, with a total market cap of $32.5 billion and among the top 10 of all REITs. I remember attending the first REAT conference, I think it was in New Orleans in 1994, and I didn\u2019t know a single soul. So, we\u2019ve come a long way. And we still are in our fourth consecutive quarter of COVID-19, something we -- none of us will ever forget. The stellar results by any measure or metric is we\u2019re very proud and we thank each and every one of our great team members. Dean will speak to the outstanding core and internal growth results, driven in part by strong rental rate growth, and particularly featured this quarter in the San Francisco Bay region among others, one of our highest leasing quarters ever. And Steve and Peter will also speak to our stellar value-creation growth in part driven by our collaborative Fenway blockbuster transaction, and we greatly appreciate and recognize the team that put that together, a very highly leased valuation creation pipeline which will provide continuing growth for Alexandria. And so, we\u2019re very proud of that. Also important to note, and I think Steve, Peter and Dean will also allude to this. Our partial interest sale this quarter, I think set a true benchmark valuation for Alexandria owned and operated first-in-class lab space in the South San Francisco submarket, led by both Steve and Peter. And Peter in particular, who we brought here in 1998, who had special and unique joint venture talent and a stellar network, and we\u2019ve been added under his guidance there for 20-years. So, we thank those two very much for that execution and the teams that supported them. We completed our first quarter with a very strong balance sheet, Dean will talk about that with no debt maturities until 2024. And as some of you are aware, we filed an S-1 with the SEC to raise $250 million for an Alexandria sponsored SPAC, importantly, because we believe there was a real need for this in our core agrifoodtech industry. And as we are in a quiet period, we won\u2019t be discussing this at all. Moving on to life science industry for a moment, the velocity and continuing demand for Alexandria lab space across our cluster markets is as strong as we\u2019ve ever experienced. The pace of FDA approvals during the first quarter remained very strong with FDA approving 14 new drugs, 36% of those were Alexandria client tenants. We also note strong bipartisan support, and a proposed whopping 20% increase for the budgets of NIH, CDC and HHS. We don\u2019t know about FDA at this moment, and hopefully, the administration will select, in the not too distant future, a true great leader there, and we\u2019re hoping for that. Public markets continued their strong pace with $4.5 billion raised in 29 IPOs this past quarter and 100 -- I\u2019m sorry, $12.6 billion raised in follow-on offerings, truly kind of a stellar capital markets quarter. Biopharma continues to invest heavily in its own R&D, likely north of $225 billion for all of 2021. Let me comment a moment about some proposed corporate tax changes that were announced by the current administration, which if enacted in the law would foolishly and directly hurt U.S. manufacturing, U.S. R&D and the repatriation of crucial supply chains that became evident in the pandemic that we were really woefully unprepared and relied on 70% of our supply chain efforts outside of the United States. I would say mission-critical sectors, including biopharma certainly will not be will not be helped. In essence, the threat to the American competitiveness is way bigger and way more important than the everyday life of Americans, and higher rates -- than higher rates and a sad commentary and poor public policy. It\u2019s interesting to note, the paradox of this pandemic moment, large corporations have oftentimes been politically villainized derided by the left and the right, yet the main and perhaps only reason COVID-19 scourge is easing is the vaccines that were developed by biopharma and some in connection with the government in a groundbreaking effort with the warp speed effort. And we\u2019re very, very thankful for that. I think to quote, Alex Gorsky, CEO of J&J, he made a pretty important quote recently and said, \u201cWe fundamentally believe that having a market-based, innovation-based biopharmaceutical industry, as well as a medical-technology environment is critical long term to produce the best overall outcomes for healthcare.\u201d And I think that absolutely reigns true. So, as I do each quarter, let me finish with a -- or I did last quarter and will each quarter, a quote, kind of a timely quote. I quoted Confucius last quarter. Let me quote this quarter, Steve Prefontaine, one of the world-class runners of his time. \u201cTo give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift.\u201d And with that, let me turn it over to Steve Richardson.\nSteve Richardson: Thank you, Joel, and welcome everybody as well. As we presented during the last quarterly call, 2020 represented an exceptional year of high-quality growth for Alexandria, as we increased the asset base by 27% to nearly 50 million square feet. Now, the first quarter of 2021, a truly blowout quarter by all metrics, has clearly signaled the continuation of this exceptional growth trajectory and definitively affirms Alexandria\u2019s leadership role in the now core life science asset class, and it\u2019s highly valued status within the broad life science ecosystem. The Company\u2019s 27-year commitment to operational excellence at every level fuels the following outperformance highlights for Q1. Accounts receivable, we\u2019ve collected 99.4% of our April AR billings as of today. And again, Alexandria\u2019s labs are essential infrastructure and have been operational from day one of the pandemic. Some detail on leasing outperformance. During Q1, we leased approximately 1,677,000 square feet, which notably represents the second highest quarterly leasing activity during the past five years, an amazing statistic considering the broader turmoil in the office market. Peter will touch on this in more detail, but the current and near-term development pipeline continues to deliver value in a de-risked manner as we are at 76% leased and negotiating, even while adding 1 million square feet of new starts during this quarter. The core in particular is exceptionally strong. We continue to highlight and bring everyone\u2019s attention to the embedded growth and value within the core operating platform, comprised now of nearly 34 million square feet with cash increases this quarter of 17.4% and GAAP increases of 36.2%. On occupancy, also very, very solid with 94.5% which has grown in excess of 2 million square feet this quarter, compared to Q4 through our strategic acquisition activity. And we want to continue to bring to everyone\u2019s attention the near-term opportunity for increasing cash flows through the lease-up of 1.2 million square feet of existing inventory provided by these recent acquisitions. Overall, on market health, demand continues to be robust in our core clusters, and our mega campus offerings provide a significant competitive advantage to the Company. Importantly, subleases are in tight check as since the start of 2021, just two subleases have been brought to market in one of our clusters, and both of those subleases have already been put under LOI. Supply more broadly is constrained for 2021 across all of our markets. And in the two largest markets for 2022, we\u2019ve seen nearly 50% of the supply is pre-leased in Greater Boston, and in the San Francisco Bay Area, we\u2019re monitoring just two projects for potential vertical activity in 2022. And as we\u2019ve stated before, Alexandria\u2019s mega campus, high-quality Class A product offerings continue to outperform any inferior one-off Class B office conversions in isolated locations. The year 2020 was truly an amazing year for Alexandria at the vanguard and heart of the life science ecosystem. And now, the first quarter of 2021 has exceeded those accomplishments with stellar performance. And in conclusion, I\u2019d like to add to Joel, shout out to the entire Alexandria team for this quarter\u2019s achievements. With that, I\u2019ll hand it off to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thanks, Steve. I\u2019m going to update you all on our development pipeline, comment on construction cost escalations and discuss a couple of life science sales. We continue to work at a very productive pace, delivering 376,645 square feet during the quarter, including the full delivery of 9804 Medical Center Drive in Rockville, Maryland to a high-quality cell therapy company at an 8% cash yield, which was 80 basis points above our initial disclosure. The project\u2019s outperformance was the direct result of our best-in-class team who were able to drive down overall cost savings through a combination of adept schedule management, alternative construction techniques, and highly effective coordination with the tenants. In addition, we fully delivered the 100,086 square-foot, 1165 Eastlake Avenue East building in Seattle to Adaptive Biotechnologies, a cutting-edge public immune medicine company on the front lines of fighting COVID-19. This building is highly unique as it sits on the edge of Lake Union offering expansive views of the lake\u2019s clean end in downtown Seattle. Leasing activity on our pipeline continues to be robust with approximately 789,000 square feet leased during the quarter and another approximately 450,000 square feet in executed LOIs. Highlights include completing the lease-up of 3115 Merryfield Row, well in advance of its 2022 delivery date. Incremental progress at Alexandria Center for Life Long Island City, which is approaching being half leased and committed and a surge of activity in both, SD Tech and our newly acquired 201 Brookline asset in the Fenway area of Boston.  At SD Tech, we executed LOIs increasing its lease negotiating status by 37% as tenants affirm the attractiveness of our transformation of this historical midsized tech campus into a highly amenitized science and technology mega campus. As impressive as that is, the response by the market to our Fenway transaction and 201 Brookline has been even more remarkable. When we closed on that transaction in late January, the asset was 17% leased. As we sit today, we have letters of intent that when converted to leases, will bring that percentage up to 84%. This is a testament to the trust life science companies have in our best-in-class brand as these opportunities came to 201 Brookline in large part because of Alexandria. Overall, with the addition of five new projects and the full delivery of 9804 Medical Center Drive, we now have approximately 4 million square feet under construction that is 66% pre-leased and 76% committed when including signed LOIs. That is only 2% below the committed leasing percentage from last year\u2019s -- or from last quarter, and as Steve alluded to, despite the fact that we\u2019ve also added 1 million square feet of new projects. Given the recent news on anticipated inflation, we wanted to give you guys an update on construction cost escalations as it relates to our pipeline. Before we get into what is happening in the construction market, we want to note that the projects listed on page 42 that make up the 4 million square feet under construction, are largely subject to guaranteed maximum price contracts, which protect us from any escalations not already negotiated into the pricing. Under construction projects that are still in negotiations, those that -- well, the ones that are still in negotiations have been conservatively underwritten with a conservative escalation range applied in our underwriting. The 80 basis-point yield at 9804 Medical Center Drive that I spoke about earlier is a testament to our conservative underwriting and outstanding budget management. As we all know, coming into 2020, we all expected growth in the real estate sector to continue. And we were all taken by surprise when the global pandemic created disruption in our personal and professional lives. As reported in our 1Q call last year, Alexandria was required to temporarily suspend seven projects during the quarter due to COVID-19. But with life science being deemed an essential business, we were able to restart relatively quickly. That wasn\u2019t so for many other developers and a large number of projects were put on hold or cancelled altogether. That caused general and subcontractor backlogs to shrink. And for a moment, in the middle of the year, most major contractors assumed the worst and laid off workers. Demand for materials also diminished and for a brief period of time, overall construction costs trended lower than pre-COVID levels. We know in California that costs dropped as much as 2% during that time. However, as news of the effectiveness of vaccines came to light towards the end of the year, the construction industry experienced a V-shaped recovery led by residential and advanced technology, with life science and healthcare contributing to the sudden increase as well. One of our major contractors had to pivot quickly and today is still spending 10 hours a week on hiring as backlogs grow. In addition to the shortage of labor, costs are being materially influenced by a shortage of subcontractor shop capacity. The makers of glazing, duct work and other prefabricated materials have more work than they can handle, so many are increasing pricing to control their backlog. On top of that, the demand for raw materials is putting pressure on steel, copper, lumber and plywood. Steel is up 20% from April 2020 to February of this year. Copper is up 37% and lumber and plywood are up 62% over the same period. Although these percentages are high, materials are only 30% to 35% of the total cost stack. So, we\u2019ve been advised to plan for 5% to 6% annual escalations in the aggregate over the next 12 months. Rest assured, Alexandria constantly stays in front of this data, factors it into our underwriting and employee strategies to mitigate its impact. As a major developer with a number of significant major contractor and subcontractor relationships, we are able to leverage preferred pricing and priority in the queue. We have a great reputation among our vendors as we treat them like partners, and that enables us to continue to deliver on time and on budget in any market condition. I\u2019ll conclude my commentary by talking about some private cap rates that you should factor into your NAV models. Our own partial interest sale of the 300,930 square-foot 213 East Grand building in South San Francisco was executed at a record 4% cap rate and translates to a value of $1,429 per square foot. This should be very impactful to our overall valuation as South San Francisco is one of our largest submarkets as we hold 3.3 million square feet in operation or under development. Despite the fact that the rent is approximately 20% to 25% below market on that asset, the lease goes for another 12 years. So, we believe the yield is very reflective of what investors are willing to pay today for first-in-class Alexandria owned and stabilized assets. We\u2019d also like to report that Blackstone sold 454,000 square-foot, 96% lease Science Technology Park at Johns Hopkins to Ventas for $272 million or $600 per square foot, which is a 4.8% cap rate. Although the asset has strong tenancy, the neighborhood is tough. So, this was a positive outcome for Blackstone and another testament to the high demand for life science assets today. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: Peter, thanks. Dean Shigenaga here. And good afternoon, everyone. I just want to kick off with a huge congratulations to our entire team for just a spectacular quarter of exceptional execution. The first quarter of 2021, when you compare it to the fourth quarter, reflects one of the strongest operating and financial results in the Company\u2019s history, with our unique and differentiated life science real estate platform really at the core of this very strong growth. Our highly experienced team, trusted partnership to the life science industry and high-quality campuses and key centers of innovation continues to generate significant growth and value. Now, I want to kick off with allocation and sources of capital. We continue to remain very-disciplined with the allocation of capital in the projects that have and will generate significant long-term cash flows and tremendous value for our company and shareholders. Now, let me take a moment to highlight again the exceptional execution by our team. During the first quarter, we strategically increased our current and future pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities with $1.9 billion in acquisitions. These value creation-related acquisitions also included in-place cash flows that contributed to a very strong NOI growth in the quarter. Importantly, though, through these acquisitions, we added a number of very high-quality current and future development and redevelopment projects to our pipeline. Another key driver of strong NOI growth in the first quarter was the delivery and completion of development and redevelopment projects, aggregating 376,000 rentable square feet that were 100% leased. And on average, these were delivered mid-quarter. As of March 31st, we had 4 million rentable square feet of some of the best laboratory space under construction that was highly leased negotiating at 76%. And this included 1 million rentable square feet of projects that were added in the first quarter. Now importantly, over the last four quarters, our team executed leases aggregating almost 1.8 million rentable square feet related to the development and redevelopment projects. And this included 789,000 rentable square feet of leases that we executed in the current quarter. Now, these are truly spectacular stats, highlighting that we are the trusted partner to the life science industry. Now, we are very pleased with our allocation of capital to these value-creation projects as these projects are on track to generate significant value, as highlighted by the partial interest sale we completed in the first quarter at a spectacular cap rate of 4%. We have a great pipeline of near-term and intermediate-term projects aggregating 9.2 million rentable square feet, and we\u2019re in a strong position to meet the demand from our broad and diverse network of life science and agtech relationships. We have also been very strategic and disciplined with sources of capital and have for many years been taking advantage of the continued exceptional growth in private market valuation for our properties. As Peter highlighted, we completed a 70% partial interest sale at $301 million in a Class A property located in South San Francisco that is leased long term to Merck. Now this transaction, as Peter highlighted, sold at a record cap rate of 4% at $1,429 per square foot and really generated a spectacular profit margin of 53%. Now, this transaction highlights continued tightening of cap rates and growth in price per square foot for our high-quality life science properties. Proceeds from real estate dispositions remain an important low-cost component of our sources of capital each year. And we have completed real estate dispositions aggregating $324 million to date and have several transactions moving along that will allow us to hit our real estate disposition forecast range from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion, and we expect to provide more details on real estate dispositions next quarter. Now additionally, we expect to generate capital for reinvestment from our venture investment program and more on this topic in a moment. Next, I wanted to really turn to real estate, which is at the core of our strong growth. We reported total revenues in the first quarter of $480 million or $1.9 billion annualized, up 9.1% over the first quarter of \u201820 and over double total revenues reported five years ago in the first quarter of 2016. Now, we continue to report exceptional real estate financial and operating results, resulting in solid growth in our outlook for 2021. We delivered the following outstanding results in the quarter. Very strong cash net operating income growth of 10.3%. And again, congratulations to our leasing team for truly awesome execution of leasing. We hit the second highest quarter of leases executed in the history of the company at 1.7 million rentable square feet, continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing the space at 36.2% and 17.4% on a cash basis. And we\u2019re in a great position today and updated our outlook for rental rate growth for 2021 by 100 basis points to a range from 30% to 33%, and from 17% to 20% on a cash basis, and again, record leasing on the development and redevelopment projects over the last four quarters at 1.8 million rentable square feet. That includes the 789,000 square feet that we executed on in the first quarter. Now, we\u2019re off to a great start, and we\u2019re on track for strong same-property NOI growth for 2021. First quarter same-property NOI growth was strong and up 4.4% and 6.1% on a cash basis. And the strength of our real estate vertical drove improvement in our outlook for same-property NOI growth for 2021. We increased our outlook by 50 basis points to a range from 1.5% to 3.5% and 30 basis points on a cash basis to a range from 4.3% to 6.3%. Our EBITDA margin was very strong at 69%, one of the best in the REIT industry. And our occupancy remains very strong at 94.5% and represents a key area that will drive growth in cash flows in 2021 and 2022. And please refer to page 25 of our supplemental package for details on the recently acquired vacancy aggregating 1.2 million rentable square feet. 26% of this 1.2 million rentable square feet -- a vacancy is leased with most of this 26% taking occupancy over the next two quarters. And we\u2019re forecasting solid occupancy growth in 2021 of 100 basis points, with half of this increase forecasted in the third quarter and the remaining growth in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re also forecasting stronger occupancy growth into 2022. Now, briefly on venture investments. Our venture investment portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well. And as of March 31st had unrealized gains of $729 million on an adjusted cost basis of $912 million. Now, our adjusted cost base has represented only 3.2% of gross assets as of March 31st. Realized gains on our venture investments included an FFO per share were $24.3 million, up only $2.7 million over the fourth quarter of \u201820. Now looking forward to the rest of 2021. Realized gains from our venture investments should be in the $25 million to $27 million range per quarter. Now, importantly, we also realized an additional gain of $22.9 million that related to an investment in a privately-held clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused in the oncology area that was acquired by a large equity cap biopharma company. Now, this significant gain related to 1 transaction and was excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. We have significant unrealized gains of $725 million in our venture investment holdings, and we hope to have additional opportunities to generate capital and reduce the portion of our future equity capital needs by approximately $100 million in 2021. Now, turning to our very strong and flexible balance sheet, which really supports our strategic growth initiatives. We\u2019re very proud of what our team has accomplished over recent years. Our overall corporate credit ratings from Moody\u2019s and S&P ranks within the top 10% of all equity REITs. Over the past nine quarters, our team has issued $6.2 billion of unsecured senior notes payable, representing 72% of our total outstanding debt at a weighted average effective rate of 3.26% and a term of almost 16 years. Now, the debt capital consisted of both, growth capital and refinancing capital that significantly extended our weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt to 13 years and locked in very attractive long-term fixed rate debt. The February 2021 bond offering was a key example. We took advantage of very attractive interest rate environment and opportunistically issued $1.75 billion in unsecured notes, with a portion of the proceeds used to refinance $650 million of notes that were due in 2024. Now, these new notes were issued at an amazingly low rate of 2% for 11-year notes, 3% for 30-year notes. Also, we just wanted to highlight other balance sheet statistics for the quarter and the year. We remain on track for continued improvement in net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 5.2 times by year-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio is very strong and has increased to 4.7 times for the first quarter annualized. And we continue to maintain significant liquidity of $4.3 billion. And as Joel had touched on earlier, no debt maturities until 2024 and only $184 million coming due in 2024. Touching on guidance here, as we wrap up, as a reminder, just want to refer you to pages 11 and 12 of our supplemental package for detailed and updated guidance assumptions for 2021. Our improved outlook for 2021 over the prior guidance captures the strength of our real estate performance, including an improvement in rental rate growth and growth in both same-property and overall net operating income. Now, EPS diluted was updated to a range from $1.58 to $1.68, and FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range from $7.68 to $7.78. And the midpoint of that range for FFO per share of $7.73 is up $0.03 over the prior guidance and represents projected growth of about 5.9% over our strong FFO per share results for 2020 of $7.30. With that, let me turn it back over to Joel. Thank you.\nJoel Marcus: So, operator, if we could go to question-and-answer, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Manny Korchman with Citi.\nManny Korchman: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe this is for Steve or -- maybe this one will go to Steve. As you speak to your tenants about the markets that they\u2019re looking at, it looks like you\u2019re going out of your sort of core cluster markets, spending close to buy but out of those core clusters. Is that tenant-driven or is that just where the opportunity for this Company now lies?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Well, this is Joel. So, maybe let me address that in a macro way. I don\u2019t think you could say we\u2019re going after our core cluster markets. The core cluster market you\u2019re referring to, maybe Fenway, is really, if you look at the Greater Boston market, Cambridge has been the hallmark, but there have been a set of inner suburbs, if you will, that are somewhat -- have somewhat adjacency to the Cambridge area that have been attractive. Seaport\u2019s been there for quite a while and many others have had life science activities. So, I think, it\u2019s part of just growth overall. And we\u2019re very selective about where we go and how we do it. And Fenway was a natural. I think I said last quarter, we\u2019ve been eyeing Fenway for more than a decade as it is kind of a connection from -- to Longwood, where we\u2019ve had activity and certainly one of the core markets, core cluster markets at Cambridge. But, I don\u2019t think -- I wouldn\u2019t characterize it out of the core market by any means. I don\u2019t know, Steve, if you want to comment on that.\nSteve Richardson: Yes. I would add to that. Manny, it\u2019s Steve here. It is an expansion, incremental expansion of the core clusters. So, it\u2019s not new markets or new clusters. I would absolutely characterize it as expansion of existing core clusters.\nManny Korchman: And Dean, I know you mentioned that you can give more detail on dispositions in the coming quarters. But, should we expect those to be similar to what you\u2019ve done this quarter with a large JV sale, or do you think you\u2019ll actually exit some assets outright?\nDean Shigenaga: Manny, it\u2019s Dean here. The bulk of the dispositions that are targeted for the remainder of \u201821 are focused on -- bulk of the dollars are focused on partial interest sales. So, these will be high-value, low-cap rate, extremely attractive cost of capital transactions. It\u2019s possible we have some amount over the next year or two of outright sales as well. But, stay tuned on that.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And I would say, let me add a footnote to what Dean said. I think, Manny, you saw us make a move to sale of the Stripe and Pinterest buildings, which we developed early on in -- starting in 2014 circa in San Francisco opportunistically and made a sale of those entire buildings. And there are some assets that we are eyeing for that. So, it could well be a combination.\nOperator: Our next question will come from James Feldman with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJames Feldman: I guess, my first question, can you just talk about market rent growth? I mean, I know the condition is very tight. You guys are talking about very strong fundamentals. But, what have you seen across the markets year-to-date?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think, I\u2019ll ask Steve to comment. But I think it's fair to say that across almost all the markets, maybe New York City would be the exception. We've seen, as I say, exceptional demand for Alexandria owned and operated first in class assets and I think that's really cut across all markets. But Steve, you could give some macro color?\nSteve Richardson: Yes, I do want to underline that it has been across all the markets, certainly, Research Triangle in Maryland, we've seen nice growth there as well as Seattle, San Diego, Cambridge, San Francisco. And I guess, Jamie, when you look at our re-leasing and renewal stats, this quarter, it's 17% plus cash and 36% GAAP. In the last four quarters, 2020 in entirety, was in that range as well. I think that really speaks for itself as you see rent growth overtime here on these Class A assets.\nJames Feldman: So can you quantify how much you think rents are up today over a year ago? I know you have lease spreads with the actual market rents? I guess I'm curious based on the rising construction costs and pricing power, just how it's holding up?\nSteve Richardson: I would broadly say that lease rates are exceeding the anticipated construction costs increases. So it's all positive.\nPeter Moglia: I can just give anecdotally our analysis showed that just quarter-over-quarter, so 4Q to 1Q, market rents were up over 3.5% just for the quarter. So you can annualize that you know double digits.\nJames Feldman: And then can you talk about the business plan at Watertown mall and why focus on that sub-market versus some of the other Boston sub-markets?\nJoel Marcus: So the answer is we won't talk about that specifically. But we've been in Watertown for maybe as much as 20 years. We've felt that was an attractive adjacent sub-market to the Cambridge market. Life Science has always enjoyed going there. We clearly made a big move with the Arsenal on the Charles and that campus and what we're doing to redevelop and develop that. The Watertown mall is kind of an adjacency. And what you're looking at is kind of a mega campus in Watertown. We're seeing some great R&D continuing to favor that market. I think if you look at that versus some of the sub-markets in and around the Greater Boston Market where transport is really, really difficult, I think Watertown is one which is, I think, easier to both ingress and egress and that's been a real attractive thing as well. But as far as this specific asset, I don't think we want to comment.\nJames Feldman: And then finally, you guys have commented on constrained supply in '21 and '22. I think you were talking mostly about new construction. Can you just talk about conversions and what you think will be competitive in '21, '22 and even into '23 as you look across the major markets?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I mean, Steve can comment on a macro way. We just haven't -- there's a lot of smoke but not a lot of fire and we have some anecdotal evidence of even some that have been attempted that have really kind of totally failed. And they're not an attractive alternative for first in class companies that are looking for high quality space. We just haven't seen this tsunami of conversions that people are talking about. But Steve, you could comment broadly.\nSteve Richardson: Look, you can put a flyer out. You can send out blast e-mails and say your office building is going to accommodate lab users. But until you go ahead and actually start making investments in the base building infrastructure and advancing that, tenants are not going to be attracted to that type of offering and that type of entity with a one-off building. Again, they're in kind of isolated locations. They're not always in the core life science clusters. So as Joel said, I think there's a lot of talk out there but we don't see a lot of action. Inevitably, there will be a handful of 50,000 to 100,000 square foot offerings but nothing that really competes with the million plus square foot mega campus that's fully amenitized with brand new or newly redeveloped Class A product that we're offering. We monitor every market very closely.\nPeter Moglia: I'd like to add, purpose-built, which is what we have trumps a conversion every day of the week. When conversions generally are going to require compromise to the tenant's plans, there are areas in the building where the structure is not going to work for heavy equipment, the plumbing or the shafts won't be available because there's another tenant in the way. I mean, it is just a very challenging thing. We've done it ourselves a number of times. We know the challenges we've been able to overcome them and provide great product. But at the end of the day, purpose built will always be much more attractive than an office conversion.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sheila McGrath with Evercore ISI.\nSheila McGrath: I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the One Investors Way transaction in the Route 128 submarket. Just what kind of yield that should be since you brought the tenant with you and just the plans for that expansion as well.\nJoel Marcus: So I think the -- Dean, correct me if I'm wrong, I think yields will likely come out in future subs. I'm not sure we want to quote anything at this point. But I think, Sheila, Moderna has turned out to be one of those monumental companies, and vaccines were really almost nonexistent or a sideshow in their business plan for the last decade. But it's pretty clear that we own the adjacent location where it is mission critical manufacturing for the vaccine. And as you can imagine, they're looking at lots of opportunities to expand that because the vaccine is not a one or two and done. This is likely to be like the flu, where you're going to have to get boosters on a fairly regular basis. So this is really part of their strategic plan to be able to supply both the United States and part of the world with much needed vaccines now and into the future. And it's going to be iterating, because the variants are going to cause changes in what the vaccine needs to do. And so we felt that as the go to landlord for Moderna, this was in both of our interests to make happen. So I hope that's helpful as just kind of a framework. But you can expect yields to come out, I guess, either next quarter or shortly thereafter.\nSheila McGrath: And I was wondering if you could comment on two markets. Research Triangle Park following Apple's announcement. Just remind us what your holdings are there and how proximate you will be to Apple's expansion, number one. And then number two, just you haven't touched on New York City in a while. Just wondering if you could update us on life science demand and that third building that you have.\nJoel Marcus: So let me maybe take those in reverse and maybe speak to New York City. So as everybody knows, many on this call either live or work in New York and have seen, over the last year, what's happened there, still a somewhat tough place to be. Security is still an issue. Unfortunately, crime rates and shootings have gone up, really skyrocketed in enormous fashion. So we're very focused on the security of our campus. Our campuses is almost full, although, we're creating some additional space in the existing two buildings and moving a number of tenants around to accommodate growth. And we're also filling up Long Island City, which is kind of a nice relief valve. We're in discussions with the city on the North Tower. We are going to break ground here over the past many months. But clearly, because of what's going on there and the change in the macro environment, we didn't go forward instantly. We had to rejigger kind of what we're thinking about but we're in discussions with the city to see how best we can move that forward. I think you have to remember, New York, growing a cluster is like having a baby for 25 years, and it's painful, right? And we're just finishing the first decade. And literally, New York, when we came and launched our first building there in 2010 and then into 2011 and beyond, literally no life science research was done there, world class academic work, world class clinical work, one incubator up on the Columbia campus. Pfizer had a headquarters there. But by enlarge, no research. Since then, we've made enormous strides. We've gotten venture capital off the ground there. A lot of companies have started. But we don't see big companies. They're reluctant and haven't really been successful in moving any big companies there. The recent tax efforts by the state certainly are aggressive to, I think, growth in New York, adding on to the tax burden in New York City, New York State, et cetera, and then a federal is kind of hurtful. So New York has a range of issues. It's great substrate, great NIH money, venture is formed. But it's going to take another decade or part of a decade and a half to really grow that into a real life secondary market like some of the others that you know much better. So it's a work in process. We see some company formation. There's certainly institutional demand and so forth, but it's different than the other markets. So maybe moving to Research Triangle, and I might have either Peter or Steve give any macro comments as well. But we made a move last summer. We felt that Research Triangle was an important part of the life science landscape, it has been for many years. We have both several mega campuses, both on the life science side and now the first one of its kind here in the US, maybe in the world, on the agri-food side, agri-food tech. And so we think it's a very, very good location. It's attracted a lot of brains from many places around the country, anchored by the three great universities, UNC, Duke and NC State. And it's been just a really, really good place to be. It used to be looked at as kind of a manufacturing or kind of a tertiary kind of location. I think today, it's moved up and become one of the hot and truly important places. And people like to live there, I think that's going to be important going into the future. Is it a good place to live? And if you compare walking around in the Triangle versus New York City, New York City is tough these days. You see what's going on in the subways. And hopefully, governance will get better, security will get better and improve and hopefully, COVID will recede. But walking around in the Triangle is like being in heaven. So I think that's why a lot of companies have been moving there and we've increased our footprint pretty dramatically. But Steve, you really started a lot of our efforts down there. So maybe a comment or two for you.\nSteve Richardson: Yes, the Apple footprint, I think, will be transformative for the park for sure. And we do have one of our campuses in the Kit Creek area with a number of buildings that are in close proximity there. So we think that will help continue to really invigorate the campus going forward, as Joel has been outlining, and in particular, really help these specific assets. So we're very enthusiastic about their presence there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Richard Anderson with SMBC.\nRichard Anderson: Joel, you mentioned your frustration with the corporate tax sort of narrative going on and impact on repatriation. Were you seeing any tangible evidence of kind of the onshoring of the supply chain and impacts positively to your tenants that could actually reverse course if this were to happen? I'm wondering if it's more of a storyline as opposed to something concretely underway at this point.\nJoel Marcus: Well, no, I think it's been dramatic and not just in the biopharma industry and the medical technology industry. There was pretty dramatic tax reform in 2017 where multinationals previously charged with full US corporate tax rates and they kept much of the cash overseas, it's called the GILTI tax. They kind of opened that up, lowered that dramatically. And you saw a lot of companies, including a lot of big pharma and companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, others, Microsoft, other big techs bringing back large amounts of capital to invest in this country. So we had a couple of years of really positive repatriation not only of capital but reinvestment in the United States, which was really positive. I think COVID then shone a very bright, or shined a very bright light on the medical supply chains where, as I said, 70% of medical supply chain, many of it intermediates to create pharmaceutical products, et cetera, even just normal plastic gloves and all the stuff that we call PPE, 70% of that was sourced overseas, and we were seeing dramatic movement of that back to the United States. It's not just pills and stuff like that, it was very broad. And I think to reverse that or even to put out the word that you're going to start to shift that, I think, is one of the worst things you could do in the middle of a -- or midway in the pandemic. I'm not sure what inning we're in. We'd have to ask Fauci or some of those folks based on what they see. But I think it's fair to say I was in a Zoom call with a company just getting off the ground here in the United States. And the first thing they did was set up operations and IP in Ireland, which has a 12.5% tax rate where we're going to be going to, I don't know whether it will be 28% or something like that. China is at 25% and most of the world is sub-28%. There's only a handful that are above that. So that's not a good place to be if you want to create jobs and want to really jolt this economy forward, given the damage that we've suffered over the past year from the pandemic. So I don't know. I have pretty strong feelings. And I think many people who are in corporate America believe that there are better ways to do that than become anti competitive. And I think the administration's comments about, well, they're going to try to arrange a kind of a global tax kind of arrangement where everybody is charging the same rate, it's done through what's called the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a global minimum tax. Well, okay, that's a total joke. There's no one that's going to sign on to that. So yes, bad news.\nRichard Anderson: So it sounds like it was having a tangible impact on your business, clearly, it was happening. But you were seeing\u2026\nJoel Marcus: Yes, it's way broader than biopharma, I mean\u2026\nRichard Anderson: Second question I have is absent from today's presentation was Jenna and which, no offense to her, kind of makes me feel like things are getting better because she wasn't giving her [up team]. But I do have a question for the team there and maybe she's around. The vaccine success is wonderful. You mentioned this is not -- there's more to come, treating it more like a flu. But I wonder if the shift will turn maybe more to therapies as opposed to vaccines in a sense that if we feel like we can be treated for it, and even if we -- if it is an annual event, we know there's a thorough flu out there to take care of it beyond remdesivir. I'm just wondering if you can comment on that at all.\nJoel Marcus: So if by popular opinion, we'll bring Jenna back next quarter maybe, but we decided not to do that just because vaccines are kind of at the forefront, the country is making, I think, good progress. We'll see how that goes. But you are seeing India has hit an all time high. And if you look at pictures of what's going on there, it literally breaks your heart. We've got some severe outbreaks throughout the United States. Michigan, which has been one of the toughest shutdown states, so go figure that out, is having some tough time. So we're still, I don't know, we may be in the fifth inning, something like that. I don't want to be Dr. Fauci here, but we got a long way to go here and it's going to be with us. This just doesn't go away. It comes back in various forms. But I think when it comes to your question on therapies, I think if people rely on therapies like flu therapies or other kinds of therapies for COVID, I think that's a huge mistake. And we'll, next quarter, address that. I'll ask Jenna to specifically address it. But what I think is the challenge is if you get COVID, there is a cohort of patients. Right now, people, if you ask Scott Gottlieb and others, right now, it's maybe 10%, 15%, don't know if that number is too low or too high, but my guess is it could be right about right and could be higher, who are experiencing the long haul symptoms. If you ever look at some of the articles on COVID, COVID attacks almost every system in the body. And it's something that you would not want to get and just get over because you don't know what the long haul results are to the brain, to the immune system, to all the systems of the body. So I don't think the therapy is the answer. I think it's immunization and hopefully, herd immunity, although, there's a cohort of people here in the United States who simply won't take the vaccine, which there maybe medical reasons, there maybe religious reasons. But I think it is hard to understand the assumption of the risk for one's self and others if you don't have those issues, not to take the vaccine. So long winded answer. I hope that's helpful.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: I wanted to touch on the repatriation of the drug supply chain real quick again. I know it's important, I guess, for the industry and the country. I mean, does that drive the demand in cluster markets at all? I mean, does it impact your business materially one way or another?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think it's incrementally. I was talking more macro because to bring back supply chains for intermediates for pharmaceutical products so we don't have to rely on India or China or Ireland or other places, that's critical. That's national security, it seems to me. And yes, there's been certainly impact to the demand, especially in the manufacturing, in the next gen manufacturing. I think people are not going to put cell therapy, gene therapy and a range of next gen manufacturing, which are so tied to R&D in the biopharma industry overseas unless tax rates absolutely force them to do that, which would be stupidest policy I ever heard. So yes, the impact has been clearly in a positive fashion and we hope that doesn't get reversed.\nMichael Carroll: And then just, I guess, last question for me. Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the mentioned in the earlier prepared remarks about the model to help combat homelessness in Seattle. I mean, how far along is this process? And I guess, what type of time line do you have in mind or when you'll be able to provide us more details on what that plan is and how it's going?\nJoel Marcus: So it's still in the early feasibility stage. I think understanding homelessness, much like drug addiction, is hard. If you imagine the homeless population, it's highly stratified. There are those that are down on their luck, have financial issues. There's a large cohort that have serious addiction issues. There's a large cohort that have serious mental illness, et cetera. So it's not just saying, okay, let's just find housing. That's a solution that many jurisdictions are pursuing but it doesn't help. It's like detoxing somebody who's addicted to opioids and then putting them back on the street, that doesn't work more than 28 days. So we're trying to adopt this or adapt, I should say, not adopt, the [115] model, the continuum of care, the complete care, data driven but with deep research, and so we're in the feasibility stage. So I'm not sure I can give you yet. Maybe over the next quarter or so, I'll be able to give you more details. But we think it's an imperative that we attack this problem, and I think we may have a model that will help a lot of people here. But it's no easy thing. It isn't like putting up a few simple apartments. It's way, way more complicated than that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dave Rogers with Baird.\nDavid Rodgers: On the leasing front, I wanted to ask a question about, you had two really good quarters of leasing and a number of quarters come together. Curious if you're seeing any slowdown, like there was some backlog maybe that had built up through COVID and that may get metering out a little bit more. Is that more a function of what you're offering in development? Just curious on kind of the pace of leasing into the second quarter? And then maybe the flip side, what's missing from the leasing pipeline, if anything, in terms of kind of your core tenant base?\nJoel Marcus: I'm not sure I fully understand the first part of the question.\nDavid Rodgers: I think earlier, you made the comment about demand and some of the slowdown that was related to just not being able to build, for a little while, and there was a little\u2026\nJoel Marcus: I don't think we said that. Are you -- who said that?\nDavid Rodgers: Just in terms of new -- anyway. I guess, the question was, it seemed in leasing going from kind of the first quarter into the second quarter. Any evidence of a slowdown or any evidence that there had been a backlog from COVID that might be dissipating at any point?\nJoel Marcus: No. I think our comments should address that pretty directly, Dave. No, we don't see any of that.\nDavid Rodgers: And then not essentially related to SPAC, but is there anything in your own guidance at Alexandria that would be dependent upon that getting done?\nJoel Marcus: No.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Daniel Ismail with Green Street Advisors.\nDaniel Ismail: Joel, I appreciate all the comments relating to ESG. There are a variety of taxes or fines on greenhouse gas emissions proposed or in discussions across your markets. It seems like lab buildings are generally lumped in with office buildings in these proposed or enacted regulations despite the difference in use and potential energy intensity. Is that a fair characterization? And then does this come up in tenant discussions about the potential for, say, higher taxes or fines on building greenhouse gas emissions?\nJoel Marcus: I think it has not, at the moment, doesn't seem to be a significant issue for tenants at this moment, although, they're looking for obviously very green and environmentally positive sustainable buildings, both inside and outside. And I think we've kind of been a leader here in the US and maybe even worldwide in the whole fit well or healthy environments inside. But Dean, do you want to comment because you're closest to that?\nDean Shigenaga: So Danny, I agree with what Joel highlighted. Our tenants haven't focused on your specific question but they have focused on really environmentally friendly, sustainable real estate solutions. If you look across their business, if you take just a sample of our top 20 tenants as an example and look at their ESG initiatives, sustainability is a high priority across their entire business, real estate being a very small component. They actually touch on real estate a little bit on a few of the top 20 tenants. And as Joel highlighted, carbon neutral, energy neutral buildings, et cetera, just beyond lead today is super important. Most of these biopharma companies today have set carbon neutrality goals that are well inside the broad 2050 type of target dates that some have put out there. And so I think overall, it's super important. I think for us, when we think about building green and sustainable buildings, it plays not only strategically important to our business but plays right into the strategies of our tenants as well. So I think it works well. And I think you pointed the obvious challenge that all companies are facing today is how do you read carbon neutrality today at a pace that needs to be faster than maybe possible at the moment, given technologies and solutions that are available. But if we don't put our best foot forward to be impactful here, we won't get anywhere close to some of the deadlines in different jurisdictions. But they're all different so it's hard to comment on broadly across the portfolio.\nDaniel Ismail: And then just last one for Peter, on the cap rate on the South San Francisco trade. How would you compare that cap rate across market cap rates, or how would you compare market cap rates across San Diego, south San Francisco and Cambridge? Are cap rates heading to parity in these markets or are there still decent spreads across these markets?\nSteve Richardson: Actually, I think your comment on heading to parity, that's actually -- when you started asking your question, I was like the geographic differences that used to be obvious are being blurred. Once you get down to 4% caps, I would not be surprised -- obviously, 4% cap is being achieved in Cambridge. I would not be surprised to see it go below 4% in Cambridge at some point soon. A high quality asset in San Diego was probably at 5%, low 5% cap two years ago, and I would expect that to be a low 4% cap today. So things are starting to -- or the difference, the geographic difference that cap rates had before are really starting to narrow. And it's probably obvious that there's so many people out there looking for exposure to Life Science that the geography doesn't matter as much as it does to get the exposure to Life Science.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: I'd just say thank you, everybody, and please stay safe. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "Peter, thanks. Dean Shigenaga here. And good afternoon, everyone. I just want to kick off with a huge congratulations to our entire team for just a spectacular quarter of exceptional execution. The first quarter of 2021, when you compare it to the fourth quarter, reflects one of the strongest operating and financial results in the Company\u2019s history, with our unique and differentiated life science real estate platform really at the core of this very strong growth. Our highly experienced team, trusted partnership to the life science industry and high-quality campuses and key centers of innovation continues to generate significant growth and value. Now, I want to kick off with allocation and sources of capital. We continue to remain very-disciplined with the allocation of capital in the projects that have and will generate significant long-term cash flows and tremendous value for our company and shareholders. Now, let me take a moment to highlight again the exceptional execution by our team. During the first quarter, we strategically increased our current and future pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities with $1.9 billion in acquisitions. These value creation-related acquisitions also included in-place cash flows that contributed to a very strong NOI growth in the quarter. Importantly, though, through these acquisitions, we added a number of very high-quality current and future development and redevelopment projects to our pipeline. Another key driver of strong NOI growth in the first quarter was the delivery and completion of development and redevelopment projects, aggregating 376,000 rentable square feet that were 100% leased. And on average, these were delivered mid-quarter. As of March 31st, we had 4 million rentable square feet of some of the best laboratory space under construction that was highly leased negotiating at 76%. And this included 1 million rentable square feet of projects that were added in the first quarter. Now importantly, over the last four quarters, our team executed leases aggregating almost 1.8 million rentable square feet related to the development and redevelopment projects. And this included 789,000 rentable square feet of leases that we executed in the current quarter. Now, these are truly spectacular stats, highlighting that we are the trusted partner to the life science industry. Now, we are very pleased with our allocation of capital to these value-creation projects as these projects are on track to generate significant value, as highlighted by the partial interest sale we completed in the first quarter at a spectacular cap rate of 4%. We have a great pipeline of near-term and intermediate-term projects aggregating 9.2 million rentable square feet, and we\u2019re in a strong position to meet the demand from our broad and diverse network of life science and agtech relationships. We have also been very strategic and disciplined with sources of capital and have for many years been taking advantage of the continued exceptional growth in private market valuation for our properties. As Peter highlighted, we completed a 70% partial interest sale at $301 million in a Class A property located in South San Francisco that is leased long term to Merck. Now this transaction, as Peter highlighted, sold at a record cap rate of 4% at $1,429 per square foot and really generated a spectacular profit margin of 53%. Now, this transaction highlights continued tightening of cap rates and growth in price per square foot for our high-quality life science properties. Proceeds from real estate dispositions remain an important low-cost component of our sources of capital each year. And we have completed real estate dispositions aggregating $324 million to date and have several transactions moving along that will allow us to hit our real estate disposition forecast range from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion, and we expect to provide more details on real estate dispositions next quarter. Now additionally, we expect to generate capital for reinvestment from our venture investment program and more on this topic in a moment. Next, I wanted to really turn to real estate, which is at the core of our strong growth. We reported total revenues in the first quarter of $480 million or $1.9 billion annualized, up 9.1% over the first quarter of \u201820 and over double total revenues reported five years ago in the first quarter of 2016. Now, we continue to report exceptional real estate financial and operating results, resulting in solid growth in our outlook for 2021. We delivered the following outstanding results in the quarter. Very strong cash net operating income growth of 10.3%. And again, congratulations to our leasing team for truly awesome execution of leasing. We hit the second highest quarter of leases executed in the history of the company at 1.7 million rentable square feet, continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing the space at 36.2% and 17.4% on a cash basis. And we\u2019re in a great position today and updated our outlook for rental rate growth for 2021 by 100 basis points to a range from 30% to 33%, and from 17% to 20% on a cash basis, and again, record leasing on the development and redevelopment projects over the last four quarters at 1.8 million rentable square feet. That includes the 789,000 square feet that we executed on in the first quarter. Now, we\u2019re off to a great start, and we\u2019re on track for strong same-property NOI growth for 2021. First quarter same-property NOI growth was strong and up 4.4% and 6.1% on a cash basis. And the strength of our real estate vertical drove improvement in our outlook for same-property NOI growth for 2021. We increased our outlook by 50 basis points to a range from 1.5% to 3.5% and 30 basis points on a cash basis to a range from 4.3% to 6.3%. Our EBITDA margin was very strong at 69%, one of the best in the REIT industry. And our occupancy remains very strong at 94.5% and represents a key area that will drive growth in cash flows in 2021 and 2022. And please refer to page 25 of our supplemental package for details on the recently acquired vacancy aggregating 1.2 million rentable square feet. 26% of this 1.2 million rentable square feet -- a vacancy is leased with most of this 26% taking occupancy over the next two quarters. And we\u2019re forecasting solid occupancy growth in 2021 of 100 basis points, with half of this increase forecasted in the third quarter and the remaining growth in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re also forecasting stronger occupancy growth into 2022. Now, briefly on venture investments. Our venture investment portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well. And as of March 31st had unrealized gains of $729 million on an adjusted cost basis of $912 million. Now, our adjusted cost base has represented only 3.2% of gross assets as of March 31st. Realized gains on our venture investments included an FFO per share were $24.3 million, up only $2.7 million over the fourth quarter of \u201820. Now looking forward to the rest of 2021. Realized gains from our venture investments should be in the $25 million to $27 million range per quarter. Now, importantly, we also realized an additional gain of $22.9 million that related to an investment in a privately-held clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused in the oncology area that was acquired by a large equity cap biopharma company. Now, this significant gain related to 1 transaction and was excluded from FFO per share as adjusted. We have significant unrealized gains of $725 million in our venture investment holdings, and we hope to have additional opportunities to generate capital and reduce the portion of our future equity capital needs by approximately $100 million in 2021. Now, turning to our very strong and flexible balance sheet, which really supports our strategic growth initiatives. We\u2019re very proud of what our team has accomplished over recent years. Our overall corporate credit ratings from Moody\u2019s and S&P ranks within the top 10% of all equity REITs. Over the past nine quarters, our team has issued $6.2 billion of unsecured senior notes payable, representing 72% of our total outstanding debt at a weighted average effective rate of 3.26% and a term of almost 16 years. Now, the debt capital consisted of both, growth capital and refinancing capital that significantly extended our weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt to 13 years and locked in very attractive long-term fixed rate debt. The February 2021 bond offering was a key example. We took advantage of very attractive interest rate environment and opportunistically issued $1.75 billion in unsecured notes, with a portion of the proceeds used to refinance $650 million of notes that were due in 2024. Now, these new notes were issued at an amazingly low rate of 2% for 11-year notes, 3% for 30-year notes. Also, we just wanted to highlight other balance sheet statistics for the quarter and the year. We remain on track for continued improvement in net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 5.2 times by year-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio is very strong and has increased to 4.7 times for the first quarter annualized. And we continue to maintain significant liquidity of $4.3 billion. And as Joel had touched on earlier, no debt maturities until 2024 and only $184 million coming due in 2024. Touching on guidance here, as we wrap up, as a reminder, just want to refer you to pages 11 and 12 of our supplemental package for detailed and updated guidance assumptions for 2021. Our improved outlook for 2021 over the prior guidance captures the strength of our real estate performance, including an improvement in rental rate growth and growth in both same-property and overall net operating income. Now, EPS diluted was updated to a range from $1.58 to $1.68, and FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range from $7.68 to $7.78. And the midpoint of that range for FFO per share of $7.73 is up $0.03 over the prior guidance and represents projected growth of about 5.9% over our strong FFO per share results for 2020 of $7.30. With that, let me turn it back over to Joel. Thank you. Manny, it\u2019s Dean here. The bulk of the dispositions that are targeted for the remainder of \u201821 are focused on -- bulk of the dollars are focused on partial interest sales. So, these will be high-value, low-cap rate, extremely attractive cost of capital transactions. It\u2019s possible we have some amount over the next year or two of outright sales as well. But, stay tuned on that. So Danny, I agree with what Joel highlighted. Our tenants haven't focused on your specific question but they have focused on really environmentally friendly, sustainable real estate solutions. If you look across their business, if you take just a sample of our top 20 tenants as an example and look at their ESG initiatives, sustainability is a high priority across their entire business, real estate being a very small component. They actually touch on real estate a little bit on a few of the top 20 tenants. And as Joel highlighted, carbon neutral, energy neutral buildings, et cetera, just beyond lead today is super important. Most of these biopharma companies today have set carbon neutrality goals that are well inside the broad 2050 type of target dates that some have put out there. And so I think overall, it's super important. I think for us, when we think about building green and sustainable buildings, it plays not only strategically important to our business but plays right into the strategies of our tenants as well. So I think it works well. And I think you pointed the obvious challenge that all companies are facing today is how do you read carbon neutrality today at a pace that needs to be faster than maybe possible at the moment, given technologies and solutions that are available. But if we don't put our best foot forward to be impactful here, we won't get anywhere close to some of the deadlines in different jurisdictions. But they're all different so it's hard to comment on broadly across the portfolio."

            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody to our first quarter call. And with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Steve Richardson and Peter Moglia. And we want to wish everybody a safe and a healthy go forward year. We want to welcome all to this first quarter call as well and recognize and thank the entire Alexandria family team for the operationally excellent and truly stellar first quarter earnings report by all metrics and measures. We collectively continue to operate at an outstandingly high level into this second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. And as I\u2019m often fond of quoting Jim Collins of \u201cGood to Great\u201d theme, commented on Alexandria\u2019s feature in our Annual Report. Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a great company: Superior results, and we believe the first quarter is emblematic of that; distinctive impact, and we believe that our social responsibility programs have truly made a difference; and lasting endurance. And with respect to lasting endurance, we sit here at literally several decades after we were founded in 1994. And I\u2019ll talk more about that in a moment. We\u2019re particularly proud of the six pillars of our highly impactful and longstanding social responsibility efforts, accelerating groundbreaking medical research to advance lifesaving treatments and cures; harnessing the entire agrifood ecosystem to combat hunger, improve nutrition, and support human health at its most fundamental level; thirdly, bolstering the resilience of our military, our veterans and their families; fourth, conquering the opioid epidemic and revolutionizing addiction treatment; the fifth pillar that we\u2019ve spent a tremendous amount of time in over the last year and for a good part of the last decade, educationally empowering underserved students to achieve long-term success, and reach their potential as important principled leaders in the community; and then, finally, building a model for comprehensive sustainable solution to address homelessness. Alexandria is also proud to be the focus cover story of the January-February 2021 NAREIT magazine, showcasing that we have pioneered a novel data-driven comprehensive care model to overcome the opioid epidemic launched in Dayton, Ohio. We\u2019re now focused on adopting a similar model but in different respects to the homeless problem, which has really become pretty out of control in many urban cities. And it is fraught with a lot of complex stratified issues and actually is more of an issue of healthcare than it is simply of one of housing. We\u2019ve been recognized as a leader and continuing, and we continue to enhance our leadership in the area of sustainability. And we\u2019re on pace to achieve our first net zero energy building in South San Francisco, one of our important sub markets, and only one of 70 of such buildings in the entire world. So, we\u2019re very proud of that achievement when we finally get the designation. I always try to think about a theme on each quarter, and they are so different given macro and micro circumstances. And I would say, the theme for the first quarter has to be exceptional core and internal growth, and really stellar value creation and external growth, both of which have driven our continued outstanding earnings results. And as the absolute go to landlord and life science real estate. Leasing demand for Alexandria\u2019s owned and operated first-in-class assets is at a historical high. And as I alluded to a moment ago, first quarter of 1994, 27 years ago, this quarter, we completed our Series A financing led by Jacobs Engineering for $19 million. And here, we sit 27 years later to the quarter, with a total market cap of $32.5 billion and among the top 10 of all REITs. I remember attending the first REAT conference, I think it was in New Orleans in 1994, and I didn\u2019t know a single soul. So, we\u2019ve come a long way. And we still are in our fourth consecutive quarter of COVID-19, something we -- none of us will ever forget. The stellar results by any measure or metric is we\u2019re very proud and we thank each and every one of our great team members. Dean will speak to the outstanding core and internal growth results, driven in part by strong rental rate growth, and particularly featured this quarter in the San Francisco Bay region among others, one of our highest leasing quarters ever. And Steve and Peter will also speak to our stellar value-creation growth in part driven by our collaborative Fenway blockbuster transaction, and we greatly appreciate and recognize the team that put that together, a very highly leased valuation creation pipeline which will provide continuing growth for Alexandria. And so, we\u2019re very proud of that. Also important to note, and I think Steve, Peter and Dean will also allude to this. Our partial interest sale this quarter, I think set a true benchmark valuation for Alexandria owned and operated first-in-class lab space in the South San Francisco submarket, led by both Steve and Peter. And Peter in particular, who we brought here in 1998, who had special and unique joint venture talent and a stellar network, and we\u2019ve been added under his guidance there for 20-years. So, we thank those two very much for that execution and the teams that supported them. We completed our first quarter with a very strong balance sheet, Dean will talk about that with no debt maturities until 2024. And as some of you are aware, we filed an S-1 with the SEC to raise $250 million for an Alexandria sponsored SPAC, importantly, because we believe there was a real need for this in our core agrifoodtech industry. And as we are in a quiet period, we won\u2019t be discussing this at all. Moving on to life science industry for a moment, the velocity and continuing demand for Alexandria lab space across our cluster markets is as strong as we\u2019ve ever experienced. The pace of FDA approvals during the first quarter remained very strong with FDA approving 14 new drugs, 36% of those were Alexandria client tenants. We also note strong bipartisan support, and a proposed whopping 20% increase for the budgets of NIH, CDC and HHS. We don\u2019t know about FDA at this moment, and hopefully, the administration will select, in the not too distant future, a true great leader there, and we\u2019re hoping for that. Public markets continued their strong pace with $4.5 billion raised in 29 IPOs this past quarter and 100 -- I\u2019m sorry, $12.6 billion raised in follow-on offerings, truly kind of a stellar capital markets quarter. Biopharma continues to invest heavily in its own R&D, likely north of $225 billion for all of 2021. Let me comment a moment about some proposed corporate tax changes that were announced by the current administration, which if enacted in the law would foolishly and directly hurt U.S. manufacturing, U.S. R&D and the repatriation of crucial supply chains that became evident in the pandemic that we were really woefully unprepared and relied on 70% of our supply chain efforts outside of the United States. I would say mission-critical sectors, including biopharma certainly will not be will not be helped. In essence, the threat to the American competitiveness is way bigger and way more important than the everyday life of Americans, and higher rates -- than higher rates and a sad commentary and poor public policy. It\u2019s interesting to note, the paradox of this pandemic moment, large corporations have oftentimes been politically villainized derided by the left and the right, yet the main and perhaps only reason COVID-19 scourge is easing is the vaccines that were developed by biopharma and some in connection with the government in a groundbreaking effort with the warp speed effort. And we\u2019re very, very thankful for that. I think to quote, Alex Gorsky, CEO of J&J, he made a pretty important quote recently and said, \u201cWe fundamentally believe that having a market-based, innovation-based biopharmaceutical industry, as well as a medical-technology environment is critical long term to produce the best overall outcomes for healthcare.\u201d And I think that absolutely reigns true. So, as I do each quarter, let me finish with a -- or I did last quarter and will each quarter, a quote, kind of a timely quote. I quoted Confucius last quarter. Let me quote this quarter, Steve Prefontaine, one of the world-class runners of his time. \u201cTo give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift.\u201d And with that, let me turn it over to Steve Richardson. So, operator, if we could go to question-and-answer, please? Yes. Well, this is Joel. So, maybe let me address that in a macro way. I don\u2019t think you could say we\u2019re going after our core cluster markets. The core cluster market you\u2019re referring to, maybe Fenway, is really, if you look at the Greater Boston market, Cambridge has been the hallmark, but there have been a set of inner suburbs, if you will, that are somewhat -- have somewhat adjacency to the Cambridge area that have been attractive. Seaport\u2019s been there for quite a while and many others have had life science activities. So, I think, it\u2019s part of just growth overall. And we\u2019re very selective about where we go and how we do it. And Fenway was a natural. I think I said last quarter, we\u2019ve been eyeing Fenway for more than a decade as it is kind of a connection from -- to Longwood, where we\u2019ve had activity and certainly one of the core markets, core cluster markets at Cambridge. But, I don\u2019t think -- I wouldn\u2019t characterize it out of the core market by any means. I don\u2019t know, Steve, if you want to comment on that. Yes. And I would say, let me add a footnote to what Dean said. I think, Manny, you saw us make a move to sale of the Stripe and Pinterest buildings, which we developed early on in -- starting in 2014 circa in San Francisco opportunistically and made a sale of those entire buildings. And there are some assets that we are eyeing for that. So, it could well be a combination. Yes. I think, I\u2019ll ask Steve to comment. But I think it's fair to say that across almost all the markets, maybe New York City would be the exception. We've seen, as I say, exceptional demand for Alexandria owned and operated first in class assets and I think that's really cut across all markets. But Steve, you could give some macro color? So the answer is we won't talk about that specifically. But we've been in Watertown for maybe as much as 20 years. We've felt that was an attractive adjacent sub-market to the Cambridge market. Life Science has always enjoyed going there. We clearly made a big move with the Arsenal on the Charles and that campus and what we're doing to redevelop and develop that. The Watertown mall is kind of an adjacency. And what you're looking at is kind of a mega campus in Watertown. We're seeing some great R&D continuing to favor that market. I think if you look at that versus some of the sub-markets in and around the Greater Boston Market where transport is really, really difficult, I think Watertown is one which is, I think, easier to both ingress and egress and that's been a real attractive thing as well. But as far as this specific asset, I don't think we want to comment. Yes. I mean, Steve can comment on a macro way. We just haven't -- there's a lot of smoke but not a lot of fire and we have some anecdotal evidence of even some that have been attempted that have really kind of totally failed. And they're not an attractive alternative for first in class companies that are looking for high quality space. We just haven't seen this tsunami of conversions that people are talking about. But Steve, you could comment broadly. So I think the -- Dean, correct me if I'm wrong, I think yields will likely come out in future subs. I'm not sure we want to quote anything at this point. But I think, Sheila, Moderna has turned out to be one of those monumental companies, and vaccines were really almost nonexistent or a sideshow in their business plan for the last decade. But it's pretty clear that we own the adjacent location where it is mission critical manufacturing for the vaccine. And as you can imagine, they're looking at lots of opportunities to expand that because the vaccine is not a one or two and done. This is likely to be like the flu, where you're going to have to get boosters on a fairly regular basis. So this is really part of their strategic plan to be able to supply both the United States and part of the world with much needed vaccines now and into the future. And it's going to be iterating, because the variants are going to cause changes in what the vaccine needs to do. And so we felt that as the go to landlord for Moderna, this was in both of our interests to make happen. So I hope that's helpful as just kind of a framework. But you can expect yields to come out, I guess, either next quarter or shortly thereafter. So let me maybe take those in reverse and maybe speak to New York City. So as everybody knows, many on this call either live or work in New York and have seen, over the last year, what's happened there, still a somewhat tough place to be. Security is still an issue. Unfortunately, crime rates and shootings have gone up, really skyrocketed in enormous fashion. So we're very focused on the security of our campus. Our campuses is almost full, although, we're creating some additional space in the existing two buildings and moving a number of tenants around to accommodate growth. And we're also filling up Long Island City, which is kind of a nice relief valve. We're in discussions with the city on the North Tower. We are going to break ground here over the past many months. But clearly, because of what's going on there and the change in the macro environment, we didn't go forward instantly. We had to rejigger kind of what we're thinking about but we're in discussions with the city to see how best we can move that forward. I think you have to remember, New York, growing a cluster is like having a baby for 25 years, and it's painful, right? And we're just finishing the first decade. And literally, New York, when we came and launched our first building there in 2010 and then into 2011 and beyond, literally no life science research was done there, world class academic work, world class clinical work, one incubator up on the Columbia campus. Pfizer had a headquarters there. But by enlarge, no research. Since then, we've made enormous strides. We've gotten venture capital off the ground there. A lot of companies have started. But we don't see big companies. They're reluctant and haven't really been successful in moving any big companies there. The recent tax efforts by the state certainly are aggressive to, I think, growth in New York, adding on to the tax burden in New York City, New York State, et cetera, and then a federal is kind of hurtful. So New York has a range of issues. It's great substrate, great NIH money, venture is formed. But it's going to take another decade or part of a decade and a half to really grow that into a real life secondary market like some of the others that you know much better. So it's a work in process. We see some company formation. There's certainly institutional demand and so forth, but it's different than the other markets. So maybe moving to Research Triangle, and I might have either Peter or Steve give any macro comments as well. But we made a move last summer. We felt that Research Triangle was an important part of the life science landscape, it has been for many years. We have both several mega campuses, both on the life science side and now the first one of its kind here in the US, maybe in the world, on the agri-food side, agri-food tech. And so we think it's a very, very good location. It's attracted a lot of brains from many places around the country, anchored by the three great universities, UNC, Duke and NC State. And it's been just a really, really good place to be. It used to be looked at as kind of a manufacturing or kind of a tertiary kind of location. I think today, it's moved up and become one of the hot and truly important places. And people like to live there, I think that's going to be important going into the future. Is it a good place to live? And if you compare walking around in the Triangle versus New York City, New York City is tough these days. You see what's going on in the subways. And hopefully, governance will get better, security will get better and improve and hopefully, COVID will recede. But walking around in the Triangle is like being in heaven. So I think that's why a lot of companies have been moving there and we've increased our footprint pretty dramatically. But Steve, you really started a lot of our efforts down there. So maybe a comment or two for you. Well, no, I think it's been dramatic and not just in the biopharma industry and the medical technology industry. There was pretty dramatic tax reform in 2017 where multinationals previously charged with full US corporate tax rates and they kept much of the cash overseas, it's called the GILTI tax. They kind of opened that up, lowered that dramatically. And you saw a lot of companies, including a lot of big pharma and companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, others, Microsoft, other big techs bringing back large amounts of capital to invest in this country. So we had a couple of years of really positive repatriation not only of capital but reinvestment in the United States, which was really positive. I think COVID then shone a very bright, or shined a very bright light on the medical supply chains where, as I said, 70% of medical supply chain, many of it intermediates to create pharmaceutical products, et cetera, even just normal plastic gloves and all the stuff that we call PPE, 70% of that was sourced overseas, and we were seeing dramatic movement of that back to the United States. It's not just pills and stuff like that, it was very broad. And I think to reverse that or even to put out the word that you're going to start to shift that, I think, is one of the worst things you could do in the middle of a -- or midway in the pandemic. I'm not sure what inning we're in. We'd have to ask Fauci or some of those folks based on what they see. But I think it's fair to say I was in a Zoom call with a company just getting off the ground here in the United States. And the first thing they did was set up operations and IP in Ireland, which has a 12.5% tax rate where we're going to be going to, I don't know whether it will be 28% or something like that. China is at 25% and most of the world is sub-28%. There's only a handful that are above that. So that's not a good place to be if you want to create jobs and want to really jolt this economy forward, given the damage that we've suffered over the past year from the pandemic. So I don't know. I have pretty strong feelings. And I think many people who are in corporate America believe that there are better ways to do that than become anti competitive. And I think the administration's comments about, well, they're going to try to arrange a kind of a global tax kind of arrangement where everybody is charging the same rate, it's done through what's called the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a global minimum tax. Well, okay, that's a total joke. There's no one that's going to sign on to that. So yes, bad news. Yes, it's way broader than biopharma, I mean\u2026 So if by popular opinion, we'll bring Jenna back next quarter maybe, but we decided not to do that just because vaccines are kind of at the forefront, the country is making, I think, good progress. We'll see how that goes. But you are seeing India has hit an all time high. And if you look at pictures of what's going on there, it literally breaks your heart. We've got some severe outbreaks throughout the United States. Michigan, which has been one of the toughest shutdown states, so go figure that out, is having some tough time. So we're still, I don't know, we may be in the fifth inning, something like that. I don't want to be Dr. Fauci here, but we got a long way to go here and it's going to be with us. This just doesn't go away. It comes back in various forms. But I think when it comes to your question on therapies, I think if people rely on therapies like flu therapies or other kinds of therapies for COVID, I think that's a huge mistake. And we'll, next quarter, address that. I'll ask Jenna to specifically address it. But what I think is the challenge is if you get COVID, there is a cohort of patients. Right now, people, if you ask Scott Gottlieb and others, right now, it's maybe 10%, 15%, don't know if that number is too low or too high, but my guess is it could be right about right and could be higher, who are experiencing the long haul symptoms. If you ever look at some of the articles on COVID, COVID attacks almost every system in the body. And it's something that you would not want to get and just get over because you don't know what the long haul results are to the brain, to the immune system, to all the systems of the body. So I don't think the therapy is the answer. I think it's immunization and hopefully, herd immunity, although, there's a cohort of people here in the United States who simply won't take the vaccine, which there maybe medical reasons, there maybe religious reasons. But I think it is hard to understand the assumption of the risk for one's self and others if you don't have those issues, not to take the vaccine. So long winded answer. I hope that's helpful. Well, I think it's incrementally. I was talking more macro because to bring back supply chains for intermediates for pharmaceutical products so we don't have to rely on India or China or Ireland or other places, that's critical. That's national security, it seems to me. And yes, there's been certainly impact to the demand, especially in the manufacturing, in the next gen manufacturing. I think people are not going to put cell therapy, gene therapy and a range of next gen manufacturing, which are so tied to R&D in the biopharma industry overseas unless tax rates absolutely force them to do that, which would be stupidest policy I ever heard. So yes, the impact has been clearly in a positive fashion and we hope that doesn't get reversed. So it's still in the early feasibility stage. I think understanding homelessness, much like drug addiction, is hard. If you imagine the homeless population, it's highly stratified. There are those that are down on their luck, have financial issues. There's a large cohort that have serious addiction issues. There's a large cohort that have serious mental illness, et cetera. So it's not just saying, okay, let's just find housing. That's a solution that many jurisdictions are pursuing but it doesn't help. It's like detoxing somebody who's addicted to opioids and then putting them back on the street, that doesn't work more than 28 days. So we're trying to adopt this or adapt, I should say, not adopt, the [115] model, the continuum of care, the complete care, data driven but with deep research, and so we're in the feasibility stage. So I'm not sure I can give you yet. Maybe over the next quarter or so, I'll be able to give you more details. But we think it's an imperative that we attack this problem, and I think we may have a model that will help a lot of people here. But it's no easy thing. It isn't like putting up a few simple apartments. It's way, way more complicated than that. I'm not sure I fully understand the first part of the question. I don't think we said that. Are you -- who said that? No. I think our comments should address that pretty directly, Dave. No, we don't see any of that. No. I think it has not, at the moment, doesn't seem to be a significant issue for tenants at this moment, although, they're looking for obviously very green and environmentally positive sustainable buildings, both inside and outside. And I think we've kind of been a leader here in the US and maybe even worldwide in the whole fit well or healthy environments inside. But Dean, do you want to comment because you're closest to that? I'd just say thank you, everybody, and please stay safe. We'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks, everybody."

            "content": "Thank you, Joel, and welcome everybody as well. As we presented during the last quarterly call, 2020 represented an exceptional year of high-quality growth for Alexandria, as we increased the asset base by 27% to nearly 50 million square feet. Now, the first quarter of 2021, a truly blowout quarter by all metrics, has clearly signaled the continuation of this exceptional growth trajectory and definitively affirms Alexandria\u2019s leadership role in the now core life science asset class, and it\u2019s highly valued status within the broad life science ecosystem. The Company\u2019s 27-year commitment to operational excellence at every level fuels the following outperformance highlights for Q1. Accounts receivable, we\u2019ve collected 99.4% of our April AR billings as of today. And again, Alexandria\u2019s labs are essential infrastructure and have been operational from day one of the pandemic. Some detail on leasing outperformance. During Q1, we leased approximately 1,677,000 square feet, which notably represents the second highest quarterly leasing activity during the past five years, an amazing statistic considering the broader turmoil in the office market. Peter will touch on this in more detail, but the current and near-term development pipeline continues to deliver value in a de-risked manner as we are at 76% leased and negotiating, even while adding 1 million square feet of new starts during this quarter. The core in particular is exceptionally strong. We continue to highlight and bring everyone\u2019s attention to the embedded growth and value within the core operating platform, comprised now of nearly 34 million square feet with cash increases this quarter of 17.4% and GAAP increases of 36.2%. On occupancy, also very, very solid with 94.5% which has grown in excess of 2 million square feet this quarter, compared to Q4 through our strategic acquisition activity. And we want to continue to bring to everyone\u2019s attention the near-term opportunity for increasing cash flows through the lease-up of 1.2 million square feet of existing inventory provided by these recent acquisitions. Overall, on market health, demand continues to be robust in our core clusters, and our mega campus offerings provide a significant competitive advantage to the Company. Importantly, subleases are in tight check as since the start of 2021, just two subleases have been brought to market in one of our clusters, and both of those subleases have already been put under LOI. Supply more broadly is constrained for 2021 across all of our markets. And in the two largest markets for 2022, we\u2019ve seen nearly 50% of the supply is pre-leased in Greater Boston, and in the San Francisco Bay Area, we\u2019re monitoring just two projects for potential vertical activity in 2022. And as we\u2019ve stated before, Alexandria\u2019s mega campus, high-quality Class A product offerings continue to outperform any inferior one-off Class B office conversions in isolated locations. The year 2020 was truly an amazing year for Alexandria at the vanguard and heart of the life science ecosystem. And now, the first quarter of 2021 has exceeded those accomplishments with stellar performance. And in conclusion, I\u2019d like to add to Joel, shout out to the entire Alexandria team for this quarter\u2019s achievements. With that, I\u2019ll hand it off to Peter. Yes. I would add to that. Manny, it\u2019s Steve here. It is an expansion, incremental expansion of the core clusters. So, it\u2019s not new markets or new clusters. I would absolutely characterize it as expansion of existing core clusters. Yes, I do want to underline that it has been across all the markets, certainly, Research Triangle in Maryland, we've seen nice growth there as well as Seattle, San Diego, Cambridge, San Francisco. And I guess, Jamie, when you look at our re-leasing and renewal stats, this quarter, it's 17% plus cash and 36% GAAP. In the last four quarters, 2020 in entirety, was in that range as well. I think that really speaks for itself as you see rent growth overtime here on these Class A assets. I would broadly say that lease rates are exceeding the anticipated construction costs increases. So it's all positive. Look, you can put a flyer out. You can send out blast e-mails and say your office building is going to accommodate lab users. But until you go ahead and actually start making investments in the base building infrastructure and advancing that, tenants are not going to be attracted to that type of offering and that type of entity with a one-off building. Again, they're in kind of isolated locations. They're not always in the core life science clusters. So as Joel said, I think there's a lot of talk out there but we don't see a lot of action. Inevitably, there will be a handful of 50,000 to 100,000 square foot offerings but nothing that really competes with the million plus square foot mega campus that's fully amenitized with brand new or newly redeveloped Class A product that we're offering. We monitor every market very closely. Yes, the Apple footprint, I think, will be transformative for the park for sure. And we do have one of our campuses in the Kit Creek area with a number of buildings that are in close proximity there. So we think that will help continue to really invigorate the campus going forward, as Joel has been outlining, and in particular, really help these specific assets. So we're very enthusiastic about their presence there. Actually, I think your comment on heading to parity, that's actually -- when you started asking your question, I was like the geographic differences that used to be obvious are being blurred. Once you get down to 4% caps, I would not be surprised -- obviously, 4% cap is being achieved in Cambridge. I would not be surprised to see it go below 4% in Cambridge at some point soon. A high quality asset in San Diego was probably at 5%, low 5% cap two years ago, and I would expect that to be a low 4% cap today. So things are starting to -- or the difference, the geographic difference that cap rates had before are really starting to narrow. And it's probably obvious that there's so many people out there looking for exposure to Life Science that the geography doesn't matter as much as it does to get the exposure to Life Science."

            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. I\u2019m going to update you all on our development pipeline, comment on construction cost escalations and discuss a couple of life science sales. We continue to work at a very productive pace, delivering 376,645 square feet during the quarter, including the full delivery of 9804 Medical Center Drive in Rockville, Maryland to a high-quality cell therapy company at an 8% cash yield, which was 80 basis points above our initial disclosure. The project\u2019s outperformance was the direct result of our best-in-class team who were able to drive down overall cost savings through a combination of adept schedule management, alternative construction techniques, and highly effective coordination with the tenants. In addition, we fully delivered the 100,086 square-foot, 1165 Eastlake Avenue East building in Seattle to Adaptive Biotechnologies, a cutting-edge public immune medicine company on the front lines of fighting COVID-19. This building is highly unique as it sits on the edge of Lake Union offering expansive views of the lake\u2019s clean end in downtown Seattle. Leasing activity on our pipeline continues to be robust with approximately 789,000 square feet leased during the quarter and another approximately 450,000 square feet in executed LOIs. Highlights include completing the lease-up of 3115 Merryfield Row, well in advance of its 2022 delivery date. Incremental progress at Alexandria Center for Life Long Island City, which is approaching being half leased and committed and a surge of activity in both, SD Tech and our newly acquired 201 Brookline asset in the Fenway area of Boston.  At SD Tech, we executed LOIs increasing its lease negotiating status by 37% as tenants affirm the attractiveness of our transformation of this historical midsized tech campus into a highly amenitized science and technology mega campus. As impressive as that is, the response by the market to our Fenway transaction and 201 Brookline has been even more remarkable. When we closed on that transaction in late January, the asset was 17% leased. As we sit today, we have letters of intent that when converted to leases, will bring that percentage up to 84%. This is a testament to the trust life science companies have in our best-in-class brand as these opportunities came to 201 Brookline in large part because of Alexandria. Overall, with the addition of five new projects and the full delivery of 9804 Medical Center Drive, we now have approximately 4 million square feet under construction that is 66% pre-leased and 76% committed when including signed LOIs. That is only 2% below the committed leasing percentage from last year\u2019s -- or from last quarter, and as Steve alluded to, despite the fact that we\u2019ve also added 1 million square feet of new projects. Given the recent news on anticipated inflation, we wanted to give you guys an update on construction cost escalations as it relates to our pipeline. Before we get into what is happening in the construction market, we want to note that the projects listed on page 42 that make up the 4 million square feet under construction, are largely subject to guaranteed maximum price contracts, which protect us from any escalations not already negotiated into the pricing. Under construction projects that are still in negotiations, those that -- well, the ones that are still in negotiations have been conservatively underwritten with a conservative escalation range applied in our underwriting. The 80 basis-point yield at 9804 Medical Center Drive that I spoke about earlier is a testament to our conservative underwriting and outstanding budget management. As we all know, coming into 2020, we all expected growth in the real estate sector to continue. And we were all taken by surprise when the global pandemic created disruption in our personal and professional lives. As reported in our 1Q call last year, Alexandria was required to temporarily suspend seven projects during the quarter due to COVID-19. But with life science being deemed an essential business, we were able to restart relatively quickly. That wasn\u2019t so for many other developers and a large number of projects were put on hold or cancelled altogether. That caused general and subcontractor backlogs to shrink. And for a moment, in the middle of the year, most major contractors assumed the worst and laid off workers. Demand for materials also diminished and for a brief period of time, overall construction costs trended lower than pre-COVID levels. We know in California that costs dropped as much as 2% during that time. However, as news of the effectiveness of vaccines came to light towards the end of the year, the construction industry experienced a V-shaped recovery led by residential and advanced technology, with life science and healthcare contributing to the sudden increase as well. One of our major contractors had to pivot quickly and today is still spending 10 hours a week on hiring as backlogs grow. In addition to the shortage of labor, costs are being materially influenced by a shortage of subcontractor shop capacity. The makers of glazing, duct work and other prefabricated materials have more work than they can handle, so many are increasing pricing to control their backlog. On top of that, the demand for raw materials is putting pressure on steel, copper, lumber and plywood. Steel is up 20% from April 2020 to February of this year. Copper is up 37% and lumber and plywood are up 62% over the same period. Although these percentages are high, materials are only 30% to 35% of the total cost stack. So, we\u2019ve been advised to plan for 5% to 6% annual escalations in the aggregate over the next 12 months. Rest assured, Alexandria constantly stays in front of this data, factors it into our underwriting and employee strategies to mitigate its impact. As a major developer with a number of significant major contractor and subcontractor relationships, we are able to leverage preferred pricing and priority in the queue. We have a great reputation among our vendors as we treat them like partners, and that enables us to continue to deliver on time and on budget in any market condition. I\u2019ll conclude my commentary by talking about some private cap rates that you should factor into your NAV models. Our own partial interest sale of the 300,930 square-foot 213 East Grand building in South San Francisco was executed at a record 4% cap rate and translates to a value of $1,429 per square foot. This should be very impactful to our overall valuation as South San Francisco is one of our largest submarkets as we hold 3.3 million square feet in operation or under development. Despite the fact that the rent is approximately 20% to 25% below market on that asset, the lease goes for another 12 years. So, we believe the yield is very reflective of what investors are willing to pay today for first-in-class Alexandria owned and stabilized assets. We\u2019d also like to report that Blackstone sold 454,000 square-foot, 96% lease Science Technology Park at Johns Hopkins to Ventas for $272 million or $600 per square foot, which is a 4.8% cap rate. Although the asset has strong tenancy, the neighborhood is tough. So, this was a positive outcome for Blackstone and another testament to the high demand for life science assets today. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Dean. I can just give anecdotally our analysis showed that just quarter-over-quarter, so 4Q to 1Q, market rents were up over 3.5% just for the quarter. So you can annualize that you know double digits. I'd like to add, purpose-built, which is what we have trumps a conversion every day of the week. When conversions generally are going to require compromise to the tenant's plans, there are areas in the building where the structure is not going to work for heavy equipment, the plumbing or the shafts won't be available because there's another tenant in the way. I mean, it is just a very challenging thing. We've done it ourselves a number of times. We know the challenges we've been able to overcome them and provide great product. But at the end of the day, purpose built will always be much more attractive than an office conversion."

I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody. With me today, are Hallie Kuhn, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. Want to thank you for joining Alexandria's fourth quarter and yearend 2022 earnings call and wishing you a safe and healthy new year. And thank you to our Alexandria family team members for their continued operational excellence across all facets of our unique business platform. A truly mission-driven, one-of-a-kind company. We have truly exceptional fourth quarter and 2022 yearend results and by any and all metrics, we're very proud, thankful, and humbled, while many public recording companies ever really struggled mightily during this past year. I'd like to take a moment to tick off what I consider to be some of the most notable news for Alexandria. Truly amazing that Alexandria has delivered approximately 8.5% FFO per share earnings growth while continuing to strengthen our fortress balance sheet, the strongest in our history and Dean will give you more details on that. Against the backdrop of a very deleterious macro-market in this 2022 year and really again, nothing short of operational excellence to the team. With our highly leased development pipeline and continued strong leasing and Peter will comment on that, Alexandria is well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth again in 2023. We have continued to create long-term shareholder value with a total shareholder return from IPO through the end of this -- end of the year, December 31, 2022 of 1673% compared to the MSCI read index of 684%, S&P 500 of 628% and NASDAQ 838%. So a wide margin upbeat. Alexandria continues to produce stable, increasing, long duration cash flows and an increasing dividend. We're very proud of our approximately 1,000 client tenant base, a one of a kind treasurer that continues to generate remarkable demand for our Alexandria lab space and Peter and Dean will highlight more on this, but again, two million square feet leased in fourth quarter, over eight million for the year and almost 18 million for the last two years with rental rate increases last year of about 22% on a cash basis. Pretty amazing stats and we're very proud of our own tenant base, which is generated by far and away the majority of that lease space. 4Q '22 and yearend 2022 was another strong quarter by all fundamental financial metrics and a few others and Dean will highlight some of this, almost 100% -- almost a 100% on collections from a very strong and durable tenant base and very proud of almost 95% occupancy and we put in I think very strong same-store performance both for the quarter and the year.  Innovation in medicine is but must continue to be a national imperative. One in four of us will develop a neurodegenerative disease. Nearly 40% of adult men and women will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes. One in five in the nation's population suffers from mental illness and we're continuing to see over a 100,000 deaths due to overdose last year, despite all of the efforts that certainly this company has made with our Dayton project, but just a literally a war out there, which does not seem to be in check and governments at the federal, state and local level need to double down with the vast amount of resources that have been appropriated over the last few years and really focus on this mental health issue. A comment about our successful and continuing value harvesting and recycling of our precious capital, Peter will detail that, but amazingly stellar 2022 with $2.2 billion successfully harvested and then reinvested in a highly disciplined, disciplined manner and Peter and Dean will also comment on the excellent and steady progress we've made year to date, just one month in to our 2023 business plan for value harvesting and capital recycling and we're very optimistic about that. And then before I pass it over to Hallie, want to particularly call out and thank our particularly call out and thank our finance team and all those who had a hand in the impressive balance sheet accomplishment set forth on Page XB of our supplement. I am very proud that we once again have the strongest balance sheet in the company's history. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Hallie for further comments.\nHallie Kuhn: Thank you, Joel and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of science and technology and capital markets. Today, I'm going to provide a recap of the life science industry coming out of 2022 and now into 2023 and how our highly unique approximately a 1,000 tenants remain resilient through the volatility of the current macroeconomic environment. As Joel mentioned, and as we often talk about, the 90% of 10,000 diseases remains an incredible opportunity and unmet need. And the fact is, many of these that do have treatments are far from solved. Take type 1 diabetes. While it was a death sentence before the discovery of insulin over 100 years ago, it still carries an immense burden. A person with type 1 diabetes makes on average 180 health-related decisions a day, some of which have life or death consequences.  Now looking back at 2022, the stats truly speak for themselves regarding the enduring strength of the life science industry, of which I'll highlight 3. First, despite widespread commentary that VC funding hit the pause button in 2022, life science venture deals totaled nearly $58 billion. Other than 2021's record year, it was the second highest amount of capital ever deployed. Of note, over 70% of VC dollars deployed went into an Alexandria cluster, and with VC funds across tech and life science raising nearly $160 billion in 2022, a record eclipsing 2021 is $150 billion, significant dry powder is on hand to deploy over a multiyear time horizon. Second, large pharma continues to be 1 of the best performing sectors in the market. In a year where total returns for market indices such as the NASDAQ and Dow ended the year down 10%, the top 20 biopharma ended the year up an average 12%, with 8 of the top 20 pharma ending the year with total returns over 20%. With historic levels of cash on hand, over $300 billion to deploy into R&D and M&A, biopharma has the firepower to continue to innovate and grow.  And last, the pipeline of early innovation to commercialization continues to deliver to patients, with 37 novel FDA small molecule and biologic approvals, three gene therapy approvals and a novel cell therapy approval, of which nearly half were developed by Alexandria tenants.  Moving to Alexandria's unrivaled life science tenant roster; we wanted to provide additional color on our business segments and some examples of Alexandria's tenants at the forefront of life science innovation. Starting with large pharma, $260 billion was reinvested into R&D in 2021, and analysts estimate that, including leverage, pharma has over $600 billion to deploy into M&A and partnerships. The next several years, indeed decade are going to be framed by large pharma's continued pursuit of innovation as product patents expire and new types of medicines such as mRNA and cell therapies transition from large preclinical and clinical pipelines to commercial stage. Alexandria tenant Pfizer is a great example, with preclinical and clinical -- sorry, with over 110 programs spanning early to late clinical developments, and an estimated 19 products launching in the next 18 months. The company also noted in their 4Q earnings this morning, they are targeting an additional $25 billion in revenue to come from M&A activity by 2030. Transitioning to public biotech, our tenant base includes the majority commercial stage companies, which brought in nearly $150 billion in revenue in 2021. Tenants such as Amgen and Vertex have large diversified pipelines, driving long-term growth. As a note, Vertex is also leading the next generation of type 1 diabetes treatment with a novel clinical stage cell therapy that addresses the root cause of diabetes.  For clinical-stage biotechnology companies, data is king. And those that have met and will meet clinical milestones in 2023, continue to see stock recovery and ability to access capital through follow-on financings. While the public markets are still recovering, life science follow-on financings reached nearly $17 billion in 2022, which is right on par with the average life science follow-on financings over the past decade. With respect to life science products, service and devices, this segment largely consists of commercial stage tenants. While not immune to higher interest rates and supply chain challenges, this is a big business segment that both drives and responds to the needs of researchers across academia, biotech and large pharma, which continue to grow and innovate. A notable development in the space is the rapid drop in the price of genome sequencing, driven by a healthy increase in competition. Costing $100 million to sequence a genome in 2001 and diving to $1,000 per genome in 2020, we are now looking at the $200 genome, enabling access to critical sequencing data that saves lives.  So where are we headed in 2023? In the face of persistent economic headwinds, all industries are forced to double down on the areas of greatest value. As part of the reset, there are companies that won't make it, and we'd argue that this, in the long run, is healthy as capital is deployed more efficiently. There will continue to be further separation of haves and have nots, but companies like those on Alexandria's tenant roster with differentiated technologies, a clear road map to key inflection points such as generating clinical data and tenured management teams will continue to raise capital.  As history has shown time and time again, some of the most successful companies are those created in the depths of a financial downturn. Ultimately, the life science industry is not built on technologies looking for a problem, but instead thousands among thousands of devastating problems, i.e. diseases that this incredibly innovative industry is poised to address over decades to come. To end on a note of hope from former FDA Commissioner, Scott Gotland. Our ingenuity drives our hopeful innovation, but it's our compassion for each other that inspires us to apply these advances to the purpose of reducing human suffering.  With that, I'll pass it off to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thank you, Hallie. 2022 was quite a volatile year in the macro markets, a reminder that all businesses are subject to cycles, some more than others. The pruning we see in the tech industry today is not a surprise to anyone who's been around since the turn of the century. However, much like a broken bone, it will come back stronger after it heals. Unlike tech, developing products and services to address disease is hard and takes a lot of time, much harder and more time consuming than creating the next app to book a reservation or share recipes. Because of that, there is more discipline in life science investment, a discipline Alexandria has mirrored in our real estate strategy, which is why through the dot-com bust to the financial crisis, to whatever you want to label today's conditions, our business remains sound, as you can see in our results this quarter and during those historic down cycles.  Despite the macro headlines, we remain optimistic and excited for our business as we are in the early innings of the Golden Age of Biology. We have only had the blueprint of the human genome for 20 years. And in that time, we've developed more new modalities to attack disease than in the previous 100. It's going to be hard, and it's going to take time, but the industry is going to have options for people with Alzheimer's. It's going to perfect technology to detect pancreatic cancer in time to save lives and much, much more. So let's all remember, it's hard, it takes time and patience, and then you will understand why life science research and development continues through the proverbial thick and thin of economic cycles, making our business resilient and essential.  With that said, I'll briefly touch on our development pipeline progress, update you on construction trends, discuss our leasing and update you on investor demand for life science real estate.  In 2022, our best-in-class development teams continue to deliver high-quality, purpose-built laboratory space to our tenants on time and on budget in a very challenging construction environment, which I'll touch on in a moment. During the fourth quarter, we delivered just shy of 500,000 square feet, with $28 million in annual NOI commencing during the quarter. For the year, we delivered 1.77 million square feet spread over 15 development and redevelopment projects, with annual NOI of $119.2 million commencing during the year. Initial stabilized yields for recent deliveries averaged 6.8% and 6.3% on a cash basis, reflecting the healthy contractual annual increases embedded into our leases.  As of year-end, projects under construction and near-term projects expected to commence construction over the next four quarters totaled 7.6 million square feet and are 72% leased. Approximately 77% of that leasing has come from our approximately 1,000 existing tenant relationships. New projects added this quarter include 1450 Owens, which is approximately 213,000 square feet and will be 100% funded by our joint venture partner; and 10075 Barnes Canyon Road in Sorrento Mesa, which will be 50% funded by our joint venture partner. Both projects are under active leasing negotiations.  Deliveries primarily commencing from the first quarter of '23 through the fourth quarter are expected to add $655 million in annual incremental NOI, reflecting a strong pipeline driven by consistent demand even in this volatile time.  Transitioning to leasing, the fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our unique one-of-a-kind company, with leasing volume of 2,322 square feet leased in the quarter, the fourth highest total in company history. The 8,405,587 square feet leased for the year is the second highest annual total in company history. And as you can see in the supplemental, the -- our guidance for strong mark-to-market growth remains unchanged from Investor Day with a range of 27% to 32% on a GAAP basis and 11% to 16% on cash. These results are certainly reflective of Hallie's commentary on the strength of VC funding and the stellar 2022 performance of large pharma. With $300 billion in cash on hand, we anticipate further investment in growth from this high-credit tenant sector in 2023. And the successful conversion of early innovation to commercialization reflected in the 37 FDA approvals in 2022 will incentivize continued investment in new and existing companies that have sound business models and underlying science, a cohort of companies Alexandria has a unique ability to identify.  The highest quality life science tenants always consider occupancy in the best assets as an imperative. Their facility and campus are not only used for research and development, but is a critical tool for them to recruit and retain the best scientific and management talent in the world, which is by far their greatest asset. Therefore, demand for Alexandria facilities and our unrivaled mega campuses remains healthy as the facilities are A+, and our operational excellence is highly sought after.  Moving to construction cost trends. At a high level, it appears the construction industry is on the cusp of slowing down. One of the leading economic indicators of the industry is the AIA Architectural Billings Index that leads nonresidential construction activity by nine to 12 months. Design work is at the front end of projects, so architects are the first consultants to slow down. Recent numbers show the 3% moving average heading towards no growth in billings, and commentary from the AIA was that fewer clients are expressing interest in starting new projects. For the first time since the postpandemic restart of construction projects, which was the genesis of significant cost inflation and supply chain problems, we're starting to see some signs of materials pricing flattening out and general contractors and subcontractors looking for work.  That said, there are still items such as aluminum, rebar, copper and glass of 16% to 21% over this time last year, and it's still very difficult to obtain electrical switchgear, emergency generators, building controls and smart air handling units because despite an improvement in availability of chips, there are more products using chips than ever before so demand for them is still ahead of supply. Laboratory buildings are heavy consumers of these hard-to-get items so to keep a laboratory construction project on time and on budget is a difficult task. Alexandria has the Intel and experience needed to make quick decisions and relationships with critical vendors to ensure we have access to the materials and labor needed to meet our schedule and budgets.  Despite the continued construction market pressures, as mentioned, we do believe the industry is on the cusp of slowing down, and we do expect cost escalations to reflect that in 2023, reducing from 9% to 10% -- from the range of 9% to 10% experienced in 2022 to 4% to 6% in 2023. However, the $2.3 trillion infrastructure spend over the next eight years will continue to put pressure on costs and labor so we will continue to conservatively underwrite and manage our value creation projects. As of the end of the year, 81% of our active development and redevelopment projects, aggregating 5.6 million square feet, are under GMP or other fixed contracts, which is consistent with the run rate we have maintained during these volatile times.  Anticipating year-end volatility in the real estate investment markets, we completed our 2022 value harvesting and asset recycling efforts in the third quarter with impeccable execution as we laid out at Investor Day. Overall, we completed $2.2 billion of value harvesting, with the improved properties achieving a weighted average cap rate of 4.4%, realizing a total gain of $1.2 billion and a value creation margin of 107%. This is a tremendous achievement considering the volatile interest rate environment in 2022 with many real estate investors on the sidelines. It speaks to the desirability of our assets, which are in the best markets with high-quality tenants and managed with operational excellence.  High-quality life science assets are scarce, and that is reflected in the pricing. We have started working on, and are making good progress on 2023 value harvesting and asset recycling, and we'll update you on that next quarter. But in the meantime, we'd like to report on three notable non-Alexandria sales that illustrate that there is still strong demand for life science real estate product. The first is the sale of 1828 El Camino Real and [indiscernible] in the Bay Area. Anchored by three non-credit life science tenants, the property is 98% leased, but is extremely low quality, with limited window line, no shipping and receiving, no backup power and venting through the windows to get adequate HVAC. Despite this, an investor paid $902 per square foot for this asset at a cap rate of 5.8%. The second trade was in the Route 128 submarket of Lexington, where a single non-credit tenant occupied 101,310 square foot manufacturing building at 20 McGuire Road sold in October for $878 per square foot and a 6.2% cap rate. The third comp, which closed last week, is an R&D campus known as the Gauge and Center Point in the Route 128 submarket of Waltham. It traded for $983 per square foot and a 5% cap rate. It was reported that some of that -- some vacancy existed at that property and that the stabilized return is likely to be in the high 5s.  As the Fed continues to pull levers to battle inflation, we expect we will see cap rates move up, but much less on a relative basis to other product types, and thus we remain well positioned to fund our value creation pipeline efficiently and at a relatively attractive pricing by harvesting our value creation among other sources.  With that, I'll pass it over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We'll jump right in here. Our team is very pleased to have the strongest balance sheet in the company's history as of December 31. And this really is a result of disciplined execution of liability management year-to-year over the past decade. Our key highlights include, we really have earned our corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry today. We ended the year with tremendous liquidity of $5.3 billion that provides us important flexibility in this macro environment. No debt maturities until 2025, a statement only a small handful of REITs can make today, and a weighted average remaining term of debt at 13.2 years. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 5.1 times on a quarter annualized basis, 5.2x on a trailing 12-month basis. The fixed charge coverage ratio was very strong at 5.0x, and 99.4% of outstanding debt is subject to fixed interest rates.  Our team had outstanding execution in 2022 on our strategic capital plan. Key highlights include $1.8 billion of 12-year and 30-year bonds, with a weighted average rate of 3.28%, the term of 22 years completed in February of 2022. Outstanding execution by our team, as Peter had highlighted, on outright dispositions, partial interest sales, aggregating $2.2 billion, with an amazing $1.2 billion in gains or consideration in excess of booked value, a 4.4% cap rate on cash NOI, all exceptional statistics and significant value creation tap for reinvestment.  We had disciplined issuance of common equity with proceeds aggregating $2.5 billion at an average price of $189 per share, including 105 million sold under forward equity sales agreements in December of 2022. On a blended basis for the year, we felt comfortable executing on the modest $105 million under the equity under forward equity sales agreements in December at roughly $150 per share.  Now briefly on the bond market, the beginning of 2023 has been positive for high-quality issuers like Alexandria. Overall pricing for 10-year bonds for Alexandria has significantly improved, and as of yesterday, was in the upper 4% range or just below 5%. For 2023, we will continue to focus on execution of real estate dispositions and partial interest sales or joint ventures for a significant component of our 2023 capital plan. Two transactions are under executed LOI to bring in a partner on a portion of each asset. These transactions will provide approximately $370 million of equity-type capital in 2023, and there are other transactions that we expect to complete this year.  Turning to operating and financial results, really, congratulations to our entire team for outstanding execution this year or in 2022 during a very challenging macro environment. We reported total revenues of $2.6 billion, up 22.5% over 2021, with FFO per share as adjusted of $8.42, up 8.5% over 2021, and outperforming our initial outlook for 2022 of $8.36 by $0.06, and ahead of consensus, both for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022.  Now diving into key highlights from our truly amazing operating and financial results for 2022. Strong rental rate growth, leasing volume and occupancy growth drove record same-property NOI growth in 2022 of 6.6% and 9.6% on a cash basis, exceeding our 10-year average same-property NOI growth prior to 2022 of 6% and 2.9% on a cash basis. The last four years of rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space have been the highest in the company's history, including rental rate growth of 31% in 2022. Over the last two years, cash rental rate growth has been the highest in the company's history, including 22.1% for the full year of 2022. Leasing volume in the fourth quarter was robust relative to the quarterly average volume in recent years in the range of 1.1 to 1.3 rentable square feet per quarter, highlighting the continued demand from our client tenants. Now the last two years have generated the two highest annual periods of rentable square feet leased, including 8.4 million rentable square feet in 2022. three out of the last four quarters represented the highest quarterly periods of rentable square feet leased, including two million square feet in the fourth quarter.  Now turning to occupancy, occupancy was up 80 basis points since the beginning of 2021 to 94.8% as of December 31. Now looking forward into 2023, we expect a slight decline in occupancy in the first half of the year, with recovery expected in the second half of the year. We had a similar dip in occupancy in 2022, specifically overall strong occupancy in the year, but we did have a 40-basis-point decline from the first quarter of '22 to the third quarter of '22. For 2023, we expect temporary vacancy beginning in the first quarter related to spaces that, on average, are expected to generate significant rental rate growth, greater than 60% on a cash basis. Now these spaces are forecasted for occupancy over the next five quarters. This includes a mix of small redevelopment space, i.e., the first time conversion to lab space, normal lease expirations and a few early tenant departures.  Importantly, consistent with our general quarter-to-quarter growth in FFO per share for many years, we expect quarter-to-quarter growth in FFO per share in 2023.  Now a few other key highlights. 90% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or large-cap publicly traded companies within our top 20 tenants, highlighting the high-quality list of client tenants that our team has curated over the years. 99.4% of collections of January rent through January 27, just highlighting the continued strength of rent collections. And we had a very strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%, highlighting execution of operational excellence by our team.  Cash flows from operating activities after dividends for 2023 is expected to be very strong at $375 million at the midpoint of our guidance, and will continue to support growth in our annual common stock dividends per share. Our FFO payout ratio was very solid at 58% for the fourth quarter. And at this pace, cash flows from operating activities after dividends, over the next three years, should generate over $1 billion and that's an amazing statistic and very efficient capital for reinvestment.  Now turning to a couple of important real estate highlights. Construction in progress, otherwise known as CIP is forecasted to peak in the first quarter, then declined slightly through 2023 as the dollar amount of deliveries are expected to exceed additions to CIP quarter-to-quarter, highlighting the significant volume of deliveries over the next couple of years. As Peter had highlighted, we have 7.6 million rentable square feet of projects that are 72% leased and projected to generate $655 million of incremental net operating income over the next three years. In the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $26.2 million on real estate, primarily related to a few assets we plan to sell in 2023. Each asset is small and represents noncore assets no longer strategic for Alexandria to own. And to put this into perspective, the book value of assets held for sale was approximately $120 million as of December 31. The key takeaway is that from time to time, we review our asset base and proceed with selective sales that continue to enhance the quality of the remaining asset base.  Briefly on venture investments. FFO per share as adjusted over the last 2 years has included an average of $103 million of realized gains each year from venture investments, or approximately $26 million per quarter. Now quarterly gains from venture investments in 2023 are expected to be up slightly in comparison to this recent quarterly run rate. As of December 31, 2022, we had gross unrealized gains of $506 million on a cost basis of $1.15 billion, highlighting significant value in our venture investment portfolio. Now investments in our venture portfolio have been very modest, at less than $70 million in aggregate over the last five years, including $20.5 million that we recognized in the fourth quarter.  Turning to guidance. We reaffirm guidance for 2023 that was initially provided in connection with our Annual Investor Day on November 30 with 1 minor update. We updated excess cash held from bond proceeds to $300 million, representing a $50 million increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance. Our 2023 guidance for EPS diluted is a range from $3.41 to $3.61, and FFO per share as adjusted diluted is a range from $8.86 to $9.06 with no change in the midpoint of $8.96. Now under the current common stock distribution agreement we have in place, otherwise known as our ATM program, we have approximately 142 remaining available. We expect to file a new program in the first quarter of '23. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our strong outlook for the full year of 2023.  With that, let me turn it back to Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you. Operator, you can open it up for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: I guess I wanted to just circle back to some comments, Dean, you made about some of the pending sales and joint venture interest. I'm just wondering if either you or Peter could provide a little bit more color on what the institutional market is sort of looking for? Maybe how pricing has changed over the past six months? And can you give us any sort of flavor on the timing of when some of these transactions make it over the finish line?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. This is Joel. I think we'll try to be general in that given that we have -- we're at the letter of intent stage on a number of transactions. But maybe, Peter, you could give kind of a topside view.\nPeterMoglia: Sure. Obviously, there's only a few product types out there that people are comfortable in investing in right now. And obviously, life science real estate is 1 of them. So we are -- I mean, been receiving calls on a fairly regular basis from some existing partners that are excited to see what we have going this year. As I mentioned during my comments, cap rates are expected to rise from the peak. But as I've also said in the past, we don't anticipate, on a relative basis, to be very high. And I'm not going to speculate right now on where they'll be. We'll start reporting once we have more data, but they will be sticky given the scarcity of opportunities for life science real estate.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then just a second question, Joel. I know acquisitions are not a huge part of the plan right now, it's mostly development. But maybe could you just comment on the 2 deals that you did announce in the quarter and kind of the strategic rationale for both of those projects, and how you think about pricing on those versus your development opportunities?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So each one of those was unique in and of itself. I don't want to get too granular, but I think the one in the Route 128 corridor really enables us to piece together three different projects into a more than 1-million-square-foot mega campus, and we have some great activity from our 1,000 tenants to help fill that. So we're very optimistic on that and feel like that was very strategic. It's also under lease back for a number of years, so it will be continuing to cash flow.  The other acquisition was a unique acquisition in downtown Austin. We felt that it was a superb location. It's also under a lease back for a period of time. So we'll continue to generate good revenue, and I won't comment on what our future business plan is for that, but we think there's a really great opportunity to do something unique in that spot, if that's helpful.\nOperator: The next question comes from Georgi Dinkov of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nGeorgi Dinkov: So I was wondering what are your thoughts on the sublet market in the sector? And have you seen an uptick with more companies subleasing space across the board and specifically in your markets? And could you please remind us what percentage, if any, of your portfolio is currently subleased?\nJoel Marcus: So, Peter, do you want to maybe comment generally on that?\nPeterMoglia: Yes. I've got some sublease statistics so I will -- for our larger markets. I will say that the amount of sublease space overall has come down in the -- over the last couple of quarters. One of the reasons for that is built out lab space is very attractive, especially for companies today that want to try to limit their out-of-pocket investment in the space. So Boston is at about 4.7% right now sublease. And again, anything of quality and that's built out is moving fairly quickly. San Francisco has been reduced to 2.3% and San Diego only has 2.1%. So these are all very normalized numbers for any cycle.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Great. And could you comment on your specific portfolio?\nPeter Moglia: It's less than that.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Okay. And just my second question on Sanofi. We noticed that the square footage day rent dropped by about 30,000 square feet quarter-over-quarter. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on that.\nJoel Marcus: SP1 I don't know, Dean, if you know that, what asset that was or you want to...\nDean Shigenaga: No, it's such a small number. I'm sorry, guys. We don't -- I don't have that at my fingertips.\nJoel Marcus: I don't either.\nJoel Marcus: It's 30,000 square feet on our 40 million square foot portfolio is artwork.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Griffin of Citigroup Global Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Griffin: Maybe going back to the Route 128 acquisition. Peter, you touched on some pretty favorable pricing it seemed like with transaction comps. I feel like that's probably 1 submarket that maybe there's been more worries around supply with. So maybe you can expand on sort of what you're seeing out there, has sentiment changed for that suburban market? I mean, obviously, when we think Boston, we think Cambridge being the highest quality market there, but maybe has a sentiment shifted in more of those suburban product?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, this is Joel. Let me make a topside comment, and then I'll turn it over to Peter. I think you have to -- if you're asking about general sentiment, Peter will comment if you're asking about our sentiment it's different because we generally have a certain targeted demand from our existing client base, and therefore, by making, say, the acquisition we did or doing things that we do to create an environment where companies want to go, it really is focused on our kind of game plan.  But if you're looking at a topside view, I don't know, Peter, you could share topside view on Waltham generally.\nPeter Moglia: Well, Waltham, the other surrounding areas, I think the sentiment is still positive. The group, that last comp, I talked about the campus that sold for a five cap, it was reported -- I think it was [indiscernible] that had the article that the group that sold it made $200 million on it. They only owned it for two years. So pretty good outcome. And obviously, if somebody is paying $200 million more than somewhat bought it for two years ago, maybe it was three years ago now, that -- they're a believer in the rent growth in the market. So the other reason that the comps are weighted towards the suburbs is very likely because there's just not a lot of available product to buy in Cambridge or the Seaport or Watertown. So the opportunities were just there. And I don't know if it says anything about the sentiment and probably just more about the availability.\nJoel Marcus: And keep in mind, there will always be demand among more R&D-light companies for Route 128 in Waltham than in the heart of Cambridge. That's just how it's been for decades now.\nMichael Griffin: Great. That's helpful. And then on the $1.4 billion of commitment costs from joint venture partners, I'm curious, are there any kind of restrictions around how that can be drawn down, how much these partners can fund? I think you've got some portion of that in your capital plan for this year. But anything you can expand on that would be helpful as well.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I'll ask Dean to do that, but obviously, each and every situation is different, but Dean, upside view?\nDean Shigenaga: Yes. I think the high-level concept on the $1.4 billion of commitments for funding from our JV partners, generally speaking, these are funding requirements related to our value creation pipeline, so construction funding commitments. And these commitments do extend out over multiple years out, two to three years depending on the joint venture. But given the recent increase in projects with joint ventures over the last, call it, four to six quarters, we just wanted to be sure that the investment community understood the significance of the commitments coming from our partners on just a handful of construction projects. So we'll continue that disclosure going forward.\nOperator: Next question comes from Josh Dennerlein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJosh Dennerlein: I saw in your top 20 tenants page in the sub. It looks like there's a footnote on 270 Bio saying the in-place cash rents are 20% to 25% below current market. Looks like that last quarter was 5 just 10% below current market. Just curious on what's driving that update?\nJoel Marcus: Dean, do you have any information on that?\nDean Shigenaga: Yes. So it's Dean here, guys. So what we did was we looked more carefully at the actual space. I believe the prior quarter was slightly lower or showing a modest mark-to-market opportunity and it was reflective of looking at that specific property overall, but we realized we had to dive into the details a little bit further because it didn't make sense as we were looking at it for the current quarter. And as we looked at the space specifically, so a portion of the building and the specific space that they're occupying, there's a bigger mark-to-market opportunity. So we wanted to be sure we updated that number in the current quarter. So nothing changed from a real mark-to-market, but previously, it was the overall building. And today, it's just specifically, or this quarter it's specific to that space that they occupy.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. And then just -- since I'm newer to the story, just kind of curious why the disclosure on that type company. It looks like it has a small market cap.\nDean Shigenaga: It's really due to that. Some -- occasionally, there's a tenant in the top 20 list of tenants that we did not curate ourselves or has a modest market cap, and we just want to provide some incremental color to some investors who don't need to research the details on their own.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Anderson of SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead.\nJoel Marcus: You may be on mute, Rich.\nRichard Anderson: I totally was, sorry about, Joel. So Peter, you talked about cap rates in your opening comments, and I think, Dean, you mentioned some partial interests that are far along and may be announced shortly. How would you characterize the quality spectrum of what you're looking at for partial interest? Are we talking very high-quality assets like the Binney Street transaction a while back or more middle of the road is a mechanism to minimize the cap rate, but also keep hold of your best assets and not relinquish too much of that opportunity going forward?\nPeterMoglia: I'll start, Rich. The profile of what going on is good quality. We don't have much of anything outside, I think, of high quality. I mean, certainly some workhorse assets that we still hold, we've sold a lot of those. So the partial interest sales just because of the profile of our portfolio are typically going to be higher quality assets, and that's what we're working on now.\nRichard Anderson: Are we sub-five, you're not talking about pricing just yet? Or can you give any...\nPeter Moglia: I mean I don't think it does any good really to talk about pricing because we're still negotiating with people. And so better strategy to keep that to ourselves at this point.\nRichard Anderson: Fair enough. And then second question for me is for Dean. You have an average debt exploration, I think, of 13 years, you said, I think your average lease term expires in 7 or 8 years. I'm wondering if that provides you any opportunity in the future in the interest of matching liabilities with assets, your way conservative in that comparison as it stands today. Do you ever see that, that gap shrinking whereas maybe the opportunity to raise shorter-term debt or lengthen lease term would make sense for the company? I'm just curious if that spread that you have in place now is something that could wiggle around a little bit in the future?\nDean Shigenaga: Rich, I guess the way to answer the question is I think we find significant value in the longer maturity profile given the size of our company and -- we have a meaningful maturity profile for a big company, right, or that matches a big company is maybe a better way of describing it. So the longer average debt term gives us a lot more flexibility to manage the overall maturity profile, right? Because if that was more like five years, with that much debt outstanding, it will be a lot to manage year-to-year on top of any growth capital. So I think strategically, the longer term of remaining maturity is a real positive for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead.\nTom Catherwood: Appreciated Hallie's comments at the outset about tenant health and funding and commentary around Pfizer M&A really jumped out. Maybe, Peter or Joel, during prior M&A cycles in the biopharma industry, what was the read-through for real estate usage? Did acquirers tend to consolidate the footprint of their portfolio companies or were there further expansions?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I can give you my thoughts, and Peter can share his. I think it's hard to compare past cycles because the level of technological development in biotech was so different. Today, it's much more sophisticated new modalities. So when you have M&A today, it used to be oftentimes you're buying a company for maybe a pipeline and you like to hold on to the people, but maybe space is less valuable going back maybe a decade or two. Today, that space is pretty critical, especially if it's located in a top-tier cluster market like Cambridge. Not only do you want the people for recruitment, retention and just working on the projects, but you've also got probably built into the space some pretty sophisticated new modality technologies, both at the lab side and in the R&D manufacturing, which is kind of integrated so closely. So I think it's harder to tell. I think, again, there's going to be a whole series of different types of uses of capital.  A lot of it will be partnering, which has historically been probably the favorite approach of pharma. There will be some acquisitions. You've got a Federal Trade Commission that's pretty hostile to any acquisition in any industry these days. So you'll probably see bolt-on acquisitions where people will want to keep that group and that technology in tow. But I don't think it's is easy to look at, say, big mega mergers in the past and think that, that has any relevance to today. And I think the key buy line for life science in 2023, in addition to what Hallie kind of framed out is what will be the velocity, the depth and the focus of this large cash hoard $300 billion. And if you leverage it, you could be as much as $500 billion to $600 billion. But Peter, you could comment just historically and what you've seen.\nPeter Moglia: It used to be if you were like a one-trick pony, it was an acquisition and then you shut it down. I mean, a good example is company called ICOS in the Seattle area was bought by -- they developed Cialis, they were bought by Lilly, and they completely shut down. But with the rise of platform technologies, a lot of the M&A, were super beneficial to the growth of our clusters. Companies realized that these teams that they were buying -- or these companies were much more valuable than just the pipeline, but the teams were extremely important. So there were a number of companies. I mean I remember when I was in Seattle, a company got bought by Gilead It was a -- it was called Corus Pharma. They were a 5000-square-foot tenant. And right after that, the Gilead approached us, and we ended up doing a huge over 100000-square-foot deal with them so that they could expand the capabilities of the team. So as Joel said, it ebbs and flows.  But I think if you look at the fact that, I think about 75 -- or in certain years, about 75% of products that have hit the market have started from external innovation that end up on -- in pharma's hands, it's pretty telling that, that is a long-lasting strategy to cone the biotech world, to buy the companies and to keep the teams in place because they generally have platforms and other products behind their initial ones. So I think the general trend in recent years has been to keep them in place and to expand. That would be my...\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Hallie, any final comments on that question?\nHallie Kuhn: Just to say that every acquisition is going to be very unique in terms of the types of products being acquired, the talent base that comes along with it, the market that it's in. And so we very much are acutely aware of kind of the one-off nature of every acquisition. And ultimately, for acquisitions where they may tuck it into the company, we see a net positive in the ecosystem. If it's a small company that does get folded in, those executives go on to create 1 more or multiple companies after that. So we've had some great examples in the past of a company gets acquired and then that CEO goes on to build a bigger and even larger company. So altogether, it's a net positive for the ecosystem, I would say no matter what the outcome is. And a great example in Seattle, as Peter mentioned, another great 1 is Celgene's acquisition of Juno and then the acquisition by Bristol-Myers, that's really one of their most critical advanced cell therapy outpost. So again, it's almost case by case, Rich.\nTom Catherwood: Great. I really appreciate the thoughts there. Maybe sticking with Pfizer, we did notice that in New York, 219 East 42nd Street moved from future developments to intermediate developments. If memory serves me, I think there was a 6-year sale leaseback on that asset. What are your current plans, if any, on that building in a potential project?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So that building, which we acquired had a leaseback to Pfizer. Remember, it's an office building for Pfizer, but it unique in New York, very few buildings have the bones to be converted to lab. They are moving to Hudson Yards, as you know, and their lease is up, I think, out about 2 years or so. But we do have some internally generated demand for that from our current client base, and so we're moving that along.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: I know demand for fully built-out lab product is pretty high. But have you noticed any difference in the level of demand you're tracking in your development pipeline where tenants do need to invest a significant amount of cash outlays to build out that space? I mean has that dropped off noticeably over the past 6 to 12 months given the disruption in the capital markets?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Peter, you could comment generally to upside.\nPeter Moglia: Yes. one of the reasons the sublease market has stayed in check even when there's been some disruptions to companies is the fact that -- and as we've talked about for now almost 2 years, the high cost of construction has just created a much more expensive proposition when you have to build out lab space. The news, though, is that there's just not a lot of sublease space to satisfy all the demand. So deals where the tenants have to invest space, such as our development and redevelopment deals do continue to go. But I mean, there -- if you're a Board and your company wants to expand and they can go into 25,000 to 35,000 square feet of existing space, even though it might be in a different building and even the different neighborhood, they're going to consider that today just given the costs. We're still doing fine in our leasing of our development and redevelopment portfolio. But there is a sentiment that if there's an existing available space just try to grab it.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Dean, do you know if you're like competitors on the development pipeline? I mean, is that where the drop-off in demand is coming from is that first-generation type space?\nDean Shigenaga: Well, I think that the reason that others aren't as successful just because they don't have our brand. I mean it's -- we've talked about it for years and years. And there's a lot to be said about the operational excellence we bring, the management of the facilities to the design of the facilities. I think -- to the extent that there's projects out there that are pausing even after they've gone vertical or remain vacant, it's a number of things. One is that the location isn't comparable to ours; two, they've underwritten very high rents because they need to, their basis isn't very good; and three, they don't have a reputation to manage these critical infrastructure building. So I would say that, that's really the reason behind a lot of the competitive buildings not...\nJoel Marcus: And major overruns on budgets, I can think of 1 project in Boston where a client went there because we didn't have exactly the space that they needed, and then they came back to us when the developer had a huge overrun on costs. So that goes on all the time.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then just last 1 for me. I was looking at your current tenant roster versus the prior quarter, and it looks like Maxar Technologies dropped off the list. I mean is that a fair read? Am I looking at that correctly? And can you give us a sense of what happens there?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. That is a project that we own where they're rotating out of that, and that will be a future development project -- redevelopment and development.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from David Rogers of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Rogers: Maybe this is for Dean. But I wanted to talk about the leasing spread. When you excluded the 2 leases in the quarter, obviously, very strong performance for the company overall. Curious about the guide for this year, which you gave in December, reaffirmed last night. But at the 11% to 16%, I think you had said that there was some incremental component of that that was non-life science maybe. But can you give us a sense of kind of that 11% to 16%. Is that more a function of kind of market rents may be slowing down? Or is that just a function of kind of more different leases that have been added to that pool?\nDean Shigenaga: Dave, its Dean here. Lab rents remain healthy as you can tell from leasing statistics in the fourth quarter. Hard to really look out well as you go out into the future, and lab rents are trending well, as we noted from our results. There is a slight mix at play in '23 with certain expirations coming up and certain leasing activity we expect to accomplish, call it, non-lab product. But that product is a small percentage of the portfolio. Rental rates overall, even when you blend it all together, will remain very strong.\nDave Rogers: That's fair. And then maybe to follow up, Peter, in your last question in terms of kind of market rent growth, it sounds like it's bifurcating even further, probably between kind of the higher-quality and lower-quality assets. What does that spread look like today maybe across the portfolio or maybe pick the top three clusters in terms of kind of where replacement rents might be going versus where maybe a more traditional kind of A- asset might be performing today at a market rent level?\nPeter Moglia: I can really only speak to our rents. I just don't have a lot of visibility to outside of the asking rents that we are hearing from competitive buildings. Our newer product and our -- in our older product, there's not much of a spread between it. Typically, you might see even a 10% to 15% premium for new buildings over older buildings. I think probably the availability of existing space makes the existing space more valuable today. But it also, I think, speaks to just the quality of our overall portfolio. We don't have a lot of B assets that you would -- that you could say that out in the suburbs, the single-story stuff that's not amenitized. Still, the rents, I can -- in the greater Boston, I mean, the rents out there for that type of product or are in the $60 to $70 range. Compare that to the $100 to $120 in Cambridge and maybe the $85 to $100 in Seaport. It's still fairly close, but you do the math and that will give you the premium.  I think overall, though, I would say that rents for lab space have not regressed at all and are still fairly strong, and the has not been a big movement in concessions like you might be seeing in the office market. I know I read a lot about the office market, and I know that rents for high-quality buildings have held there, but concessions have gotten really, really high. And that's not the case with us. Our rents have held well and concessions have remained constant.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dylan Burzinski at Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.\nDylan Burzinski: And I appreciate the color on some of the transactions that have happened lately. But just curious, when we look at cap rates for purpose-built lab product versus converted product, have you guys seen any cap rate differential between the 2?\nPeter Moglia: I don't have any specific examples other than maybe what I just talked about and the comp in is a really just terrible conversion. Burlingame is on the Peninsula. It is very close to South San Francisco. So to get a fully leased comp at an almost 6% cap rate, I think, probably illustrates that conversions aren't that appealing. I would expect good quality, purpose-built lab in Berlingame to be at least 100 to 150 basis points lower than that.\nJoel Marcus: And most conversions, not all, but almost all don't work.\nDylan Burzinski: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just looking at the supply picture, are there certain markets or submarkets where you're starting to see supply pick up and maybe become more of a risk here?\nPeter Moglia: From a supply standpoint?\nDylan Burzinski: Yes.\nPeter Moglia: The numbers are -- the numbers for availability are still kind of where they've been over the last few quarters. I mean, the biggest supply overhang in any of our markets is in South San Francisco, and it remains that way. That is -- that has not really changed. We -- there's a lot of talk about supply in Greater Boston. Majority of what's talked about hasn't broken ground, some assets have. A lot of them are in the Summerville area, which is not competitive to where our product is. So we're not too concerned about it. But yes, I think that the supply story is always 1 that we have to talk about. People are trying to get involved in the business. But the best locations are very difficult to get. And some people have tried to fan out in other areas such as Summerville with limited to no success, I think, at this point.\nDylan Burzinski: Okay. Thanks. That's it for me.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJamie Feldman: Thanks for taking my question. So I know you spoke a lot about how differentiated AllexInterest portfolio is and leasing demand is. But if you look at the market that it does kind of show in some of these markets, you're seeing flattish rents and concessions rising and net effective rents been declining month-over-month or maybe quarter-over-quarter. Are you seeing that at all in your portfolio? I mean, are you still pushing rents? And I know you said the concessions haven't grown a lot, but can you just provide some more color on how that really looks for your business versus maybe what we're seeing overall in the market?\nDean Shigenaga: Jamie, it's Dean here. Net effective rents have been positive over time for our business. So it's not declining, it's increasing.\nJamie Feldman: Can you say maybe by how much like quarter-over-quarter? Do that like a same-store basis, how much you're pushing net effective rents?\nDean Shigenaga: I don't have it right in front of me, Jamie, but I don't have the exact statistic, but we recall reviewing it over the last month and it was a very solid positive trend. I mean it's -- look, our rents, cash and GAAP rents are up. Those are significant increases period-over-period. Net effective is just trailing out a little bit, but still directionally very substantial, right? Because their base net effective is based off your GAAP rents, right? Very strong.\nPeter Moglia: Yes. I wouldn't doubt, Jamie, that other developers are offering concessions to try to bridge the gap between the quality and reputation that we have and what they offer. Our numbers are still stable at this point.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. That's great news. And then I saw -- I noticed you did the $105 million forward equity agreement in the fourth quarter. Typically, this time of the year, sometimes you'll do a much larger one. Can you just decide -- can you just discuss the decision to do equity at all this quarter? And just how you think about why you didn't do something bigger?\nDean Shigenaga: Jamie, it's Dean. As we looked at our wrapping up the year, there was an opportunity to raise a very modest amount, as you've mentioned, $105 million. And as we looked at our overall capital that we raised during the year, which I commented on, it blended in very attractively. While, it was done at $150, I think the overall blended common equity proceeds were about $189 per share. So just keeping things in perspective, there's a modest amount that we raised. And Jamie, going back to your other question, I just needed a second to pull it, but 1 second, I just lost the page.  But on rental rate growth, we were at -- so 31% GAAP, '22 cash for the year. Net effective for the year was something around 37%.\nJamie Feldman: I guess I was thinking more in terms of just in the market today. I mean, you have a nice baked-in mark-to-market that's going to show up in leasing spreads. But are you able to still, versus last month, keep pushing rents? It sounds like you think you are on a net effective basis, but I was just hoping to get color on that.\nDean Shigenaga: It sounds like you're asking what the first quarter is going to look like. Look, Jamie, in the fourth quarter and the year for 2022, we are very strong. So I don't have an outlook going into the first quarter for net effective, but again, 2022 is up 37% on a net effective basis.\nJoel Marcus: And directionally, just look at our guidance for GAAP and cash, too so...\nJamie Feldman: Okay. That's great. And I guess just going back to the equity raise. So it sounds like you kind of think about it on a 12-month view, like that kind of cleaned things up for '22 and then '23 kind of is a fresh start in your -- how you would raise equity?\nPeter Moglia: Well, maybe I think probably what's more important, Jamie, on the broad bucket of solving for equity-type capital, as I mentioned, we remain focused on dispositions and partial inter sales JV capital for a significant component of our capital plan for 2023. And we've got a couple of transactions that are fairly advanced right now executed LOI and moving through. So it's only January 31, and we feel like we're in a good spot moving on our capital plan there. And so we got to keep in mind that, that's an important component as well, Jamie, as it has been for many years now.\nOperator: The next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Just a quick question on capitalized interest. I think there was a comment made earlier on that CIP would peak in first quarter and then slowly start to decline as you have deliveries. But I believe the CIP guidance is meaningfully above last year. Can you just help us kind of reconcile the difference? Just higher cost of capital being used to capitalize the CIP? Or how do we think about that?\nPeter Moglia: Is your question just the growth year-over-year?\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes.\nPeter Moglia: The year-over-year growth is more just a function of the size of activities undergoing construction today. As you know from our disclosures we have 7.6 million either under construction or near-term starts on average, 72% leased. If you look at the fourth quarter capped interest, which is reflective of the average basis under construction, it was $79.5 million of cap interest for the quarter. it was $73 million in the third quarter, so I'll call it up about $6 million. It was $68 million in the prior quarter, so up about $5 million quarter-over-quarter. If you were just to continue to project out that $4 million or $5 million increase quarter-to-quarter, you can kind of project out what half of the year would look like. And just double that from that point forward, you're now at the bottom end of the range of our guidance. So directionally, it should make sense if you look at it from a run rate perspective.  Again, year-over-year, it's up significantly because the amount of construction activities were actually up year-over-year.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, everybody, and we look forward to talking to you on the first quarter call. Be safe, feel well.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thank you, Hallie. 2022 was quite a volatile year in the macro markets, a reminder that all businesses are subject to cycles, some more than others. The pruning we see in the tech industry today is not a surprise to anyone who's been around since the turn of the century. However, much like a broken bone, it will come back stronger after it heals. Unlike tech, developing products and services to address disease is hard and takes a lot of time, much harder and more time consuming than creating the next app to book a reservation or share recipes. Because of that, there is more discipline in life science investment, a discipline Alexandria has mirrored in our real estate strategy, which is why through the dot-com bust to the financial crisis, to whatever you want to label today's conditions, our business remains sound, as you can see in our results this quarter and during those historic down cycles.  Despite the macro headlines, we remain optimistic and excited for our business as we are in the early innings of the Golden Age of Biology. We have only had the blueprint of the human genome for 20 years. And in that time, we've developed more new modalities to attack disease than in the previous 100. It's going to be hard, and it's going to take time, but the industry is going to have options for people with Alzheimer's. It's going to perfect technology to detect pancreatic cancer in time to save lives and much, much more. So let's all remember, it's hard, it takes time and patience, and then you will understand why life science research and development continues through the proverbial thick and thin of economic cycles, making our business resilient and essential.  With that said, I'll briefly touch on our development pipeline progress, update you on construction trends, discuss our leasing and update you on investor demand for life science real estate.  In 2022, our best-in-class development teams continue to deliver high-quality, purpose-built laboratory space to our tenants on time and on budget in a very challenging construction environment, which I'll touch on in a moment. During the fourth quarter, we delivered just shy of 500,000 square feet, with $28 million in annual NOI commencing during the quarter. For the year, we delivered 1.77 million square feet spread over 15 development and redevelopment projects, with annual NOI of $119.2 million commencing during the year. Initial stabilized yields for recent deliveries averaged 6.8% and 6.3% on a cash basis, reflecting the healthy contractual annual increases embedded into our leases.  As of year-end, projects under construction and near-term projects expected to commence construction over the next four quarters totaled 7.6 million square feet and are 72% leased. Approximately 77% of that leasing has come from our approximately 1,000 existing tenant relationships. New projects added this quarter include 1450 Owens, which is approximately 213,000 square feet and will be 100% funded by our joint venture partner; and 10075 Barnes Canyon Road in Sorrento Mesa, which will be 50% funded by our joint venture partner. Both projects are under active leasing negotiations.  Deliveries primarily commencing from the first quarter of '23 through the fourth quarter are expected to add $655 million in annual incremental NOI, reflecting a strong pipeline driven by consistent demand even in this volatile time.  Transitioning to leasing, the fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our unique one-of-a-kind company, with leasing volume of 2,322 square feet leased in the quarter, the fourth highest total in company history. The 8,405,587 square feet leased for the year is the second highest annual total in company history. And as you can see in the supplemental, the -- our guidance for strong mark-to-market growth remains unchanged from Investor Day with a range of 27% to 32% on a GAAP basis and 11% to 16% on cash. These results are certainly reflective of Hallie's commentary on the strength of VC funding and the stellar 2022 performance of large pharma. With $300 billion in cash on hand, we anticipate further investment in growth from this high-credit tenant sector in 2023. And the successful conversion of early innovation to commercialization reflected in the 37 FDA approvals in 2022 will incentivize continued investment in new and existing companies that have sound business models and underlying science, a cohort of companies Alexandria has a unique ability to identify.  The highest quality life science tenants always consider occupancy in the best assets as an imperative. Their facility and campus are not only used for research and development, but is a critical tool for them to recruit and retain the best scientific and management talent in the world, which is by far their greatest asset. Therefore, demand for Alexandria facilities and our unrivaled mega campuses remains healthy as the facilities are A+, and our operational excellence is highly sought after.  Moving to construction cost trends. At a high level, it appears the construction industry is on the cusp of slowing down. One of the leading economic indicators of the industry is the AIA Architectural Billings Index that leads nonresidential construction activity by nine to 12 months. Design work is at the front end of projects, so architects are the first consultants to slow down. Recent numbers show the 3% moving average heading towards no growth in billings, and commentary from the AIA was that fewer clients are expressing interest in starting new projects. For the first time since the postpandemic restart of construction projects, which was the genesis of significant cost inflation and supply chain problems, we're starting to see some signs of materials pricing flattening out and general contractors and subcontractors looking for work.  That said, there are still items such as aluminum, rebar, copper and glass of 16% to 21% over this time last year, and it's still very difficult to obtain electrical switchgear, emergency generators, building controls and smart air handling units because despite an improvement in availability of chips, there are more products using chips than ever before so demand for them is still ahead of supply. Laboratory buildings are heavy consumers of these hard-to-get items so to keep a laboratory construction project on time and on budget is a difficult task. Alexandria has the Intel and experience needed to make quick decisions and relationships with critical vendors to ensure we have access to the materials and labor needed to meet our schedule and budgets.  Despite the continued construction market pressures, as mentioned, we do believe the industry is on the cusp of slowing down, and we do expect cost escalations to reflect that in 2023, reducing from 9% to 10% -- from the range of 9% to 10% experienced in 2022 to 4% to 6% in 2023. However, the $2.3 trillion infrastructure spend over the next eight years will continue to put pressure on costs and labor so we will continue to conservatively underwrite and manage our value creation projects. As of the end of the year, 81% of our active development and redevelopment projects, aggregating 5.6 million square feet, are under GMP or other fixed contracts, which is consistent with the run rate we have maintained during these volatile times.  Anticipating year-end volatility in the real estate investment markets, we completed our 2022 value harvesting and asset recycling efforts in the third quarter with impeccable execution as we laid out at Investor Day. Overall, we completed $2.2 billion of value harvesting, with the improved properties achieving a weighted average cap rate of 4.4%, realizing a total gain of $1.2 billion and a value creation margin of 107%. This is a tremendous achievement considering the volatile interest rate environment in 2022 with many real estate investors on the sidelines. It speaks to the desirability of our assets, which are in the best markets with high-quality tenants and managed with operational excellence.  High-quality life science assets are scarce, and that is reflected in the pricing. We have started working on, and are making good progress on 2023 value harvesting and asset recycling, and we'll update you on that next quarter. But in the meantime, we'd like to report on three notable non-Alexandria sales that illustrate that there is still strong demand for life science real estate product. The first is the sale of 1828 El Camino Real and [indiscernible] in the Bay Area. Anchored by three non-credit life science tenants, the property is 98% leased, but is extremely low quality, with limited window line, no shipping and receiving, no backup power and venting through the windows to get adequate HVAC. Despite this, an investor paid $902 per square foot for this asset at a cap rate of 5.8%. The second trade was in the Route 128 submarket of Lexington, where a single non-credit tenant occupied 101,310 square foot manufacturing building at 20 McGuire Road sold in October for $878 per square foot and a 6.2% cap rate. The third comp, which closed last week, is an R&D campus known as the Gauge and Center Point in the Route 128 submarket of Waltham. It traded for $983 per square foot and a 5% cap rate. It was reported that some of that -- some vacancy existed at that property and that the stabilized return is likely to be in the high 5s.  As the Fed continues to pull levers to battle inflation, we expect we will see cap rates move up, but much less on a relative basis to other product types, and thus we remain well positioned to fund our value creation pipeline efficiently and at a relatively attractive pricing by harvesting our value creation among other sources.  With that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Sure. Obviously, there's only a few product types out there that people are comfortable in investing in right now. And obviously, life science real estate is 1 of them. So we are -- I mean, been receiving calls on a fairly regular basis from some existing partners that are excited to see what we have going this year. As I mentioned during my comments, cap rates are expected to rise from the peak. But as I've also said in the past, we don't anticipate, on a relative basis, to be very high. And I'm not going to speculate right now on where they'll be. We'll start reporting once we have more data, but they will be sticky given the scarcity of opportunities for life science real estate. Yes. I've got some sublease statistics so I will -- for our larger markets. I will say that the amount of sublease space overall has come down in the -- over the last couple of quarters. One of the reasons for that is built out lab space is very attractive, especially for companies today that want to try to limit their out-of-pocket investment in the space. So Boston is at about 4.7% right now sublease. And again, anything of quality and that's built out is moving fairly quickly. San Francisco has been reduced to 2.3% and San Diego only has 2.1%. So these are all very normalized numbers for any cycle. It's less than that. Well, Waltham, the other surrounding areas, I think the sentiment is still positive. The group, that last comp, I talked about the campus that sold for a five cap, it was reported -- I think it was [indiscernible] that had the article that the group that sold it made $200 million on it. They only owned it for two years. So pretty good outcome. And obviously, if somebody is paying $200 million more than somewhat bought it for two years ago, maybe it was three years ago now, that -- they're a believer in the rent growth in the market. So the other reason that the comps are weighted towards the suburbs is very likely because there's just not a lot of available product to buy in Cambridge or the Seaport or Watertown. So the opportunities were just there. And I don't know if it says anything about the sentiment and probably just more about the availability. I'll start, Rich. The profile of what going on is good quality. We don't have much of anything outside, I think, of high quality. I mean, certainly some workhorse assets that we still hold, we've sold a lot of those. So the partial interest sales just because of the profile of our portfolio are typically going to be higher quality assets, and that's what we're working on now. I mean I don't think it does any good really to talk about pricing because we're still negotiating with people. And so better strategy to keep that to ourselves at this point. It used to be if you were like a one-trick pony, it was an acquisition and then you shut it down. I mean, a good example is company called ICOS in the Seattle area was bought by -- they developed Cialis, they were bought by Lilly, and they completely shut down. But with the rise of platform technologies, a lot of the M&A, were super beneficial to the growth of our clusters. Companies realized that these teams that they were buying -- or these companies were much more valuable than just the pipeline, but the teams were extremely important. So there were a number of companies. I mean I remember when I was in Seattle, a company got bought by Gilead It was a -- it was called Corus Pharma. They were a 5000-square-foot tenant. And right after that, the Gilead approached us, and we ended up doing a huge over 100000-square-foot deal with them so that they could expand the capabilities of the team. So as Joel said, it ebbs and flows.  But I think if you look at the fact that, I think about 75 -- or in certain years, about 75% of products that have hit the market have started from external innovation that end up on -- in pharma's hands, it's pretty telling that, that is a long-lasting strategy to cone the biotech world, to buy the companies and to keep the teams in place because they generally have platforms and other products behind their initial ones. So I think the general trend in recent years has been to keep them in place and to expand. That would be my... Yes. one of the reasons the sublease market has stayed in check even when there's been some disruptions to companies is the fact that -- and as we've talked about for now almost 2 years, the high cost of construction has just created a much more expensive proposition when you have to build out lab space. The news, though, is that there's just not a lot of sublease space to satisfy all the demand. So deals where the tenants have to invest space, such as our development and redevelopment deals do continue to go. But I mean, there -- if you're a Board and your company wants to expand and they can go into 25,000 to 35,000 square feet of existing space, even though it might be in a different building and even the different neighborhood, they're going to consider that today just given the costs. We're still doing fine in our leasing of our development and redevelopment portfolio. But there is a sentiment that if there's an existing available space just try to grab it. I can really only speak to our rents. I just don't have a lot of visibility to outside of the asking rents that we are hearing from competitive buildings. Our newer product and our -- in our older product, there's not much of a spread between it. Typically, you might see even a 10% to 15% premium for new buildings over older buildings. I think probably the availability of existing space makes the existing space more valuable today. But it also, I think, speaks to just the quality of our overall portfolio. We don't have a lot of B assets that you would -- that you could say that out in the suburbs, the single-story stuff that's not amenitized. Still, the rents, I can -- in the greater Boston, I mean, the rents out there for that type of product or are in the $60 to $70 range. Compare that to the $100 to $120 in Cambridge and maybe the $85 to $100 in Seaport. It's still fairly close, but you do the math and that will give you the premium.  I think overall, though, I would say that rents for lab space have not regressed at all and are still fairly strong, and the has not been a big movement in concessions like you might be seeing in the office market. I know I read a lot about the office market, and I know that rents for high-quality buildings have held there, but concessions have gotten really, really high. And that's not the case with us. Our rents have held well and concessions have remained constant. I don't have any specific examples other than maybe what I just talked about and the comp in is a really just terrible conversion. Burlingame is on the Peninsula. It is very close to South San Francisco. So to get a fully leased comp at an almost 6% cap rate, I think, probably illustrates that conversions aren't that appealing. I would expect good quality, purpose-built lab in Berlingame to be at least 100 to 150 basis points lower than that. From a supply standpoint? The numbers are -- the numbers for availability are still kind of where they've been over the last few quarters. I mean, the biggest supply overhang in any of our markets is in South San Francisco, and it remains that way. That is -- that has not really changed. We -- there's a lot of talk about supply in Greater Boston. Majority of what's talked about hasn't broken ground, some assets have. A lot of them are in the Summerville area, which is not competitive to where our product is. So we're not too concerned about it. But yes, I think that the supply story is always 1 that we have to talk about. People are trying to get involved in the business. But the best locations are very difficult to get. And some people have tried to fan out in other areas such as Summerville with limited to no success, I think, at this point. Yes. I wouldn't doubt, Jamie, that other developers are offering concessions to try to bridge the gap between the quality and reputation that we have and what they offer. Our numbers are still stable at this point. Well, maybe I think probably what's more important, Jamie, on the broad bucket of solving for equity-type capital, as I mentioned, we remain focused on dispositions and partial inter sales JV capital for a significant component of our capital plan for 2023. And we've got a couple of transactions that are fairly advanced right now executed LOI and moving through. So it's only January 31, and we feel like we're in a good spot moving on our capital plan there. And so we got to keep in mind that, that's an important component as well, Jamie, as it has been for many years now. Is your question just the growth year-over-year? The year-over-year growth is more just a function of the size of activities undergoing construction today. As you know from our disclosures we have 7.6 million either under construction or near-term starts on average, 72% leased. If you look at the fourth quarter capped interest, which is reflective of the average basis under construction, it was $79.5 million of cap interest for the quarter. it was $73 million in the third quarter, so I'll call it up about $6 million. It was $68 million in the prior quarter, so up about $5 million quarter-over-quarter. If you were just to continue to project out that $4 million or $5 million increase quarter-to-quarter, you can kind of project out what half of the year would look like. And just double that from that point forward, you're now at the bottom end of the range of our guidance. So directionally, it should make sense if you look at it from a run rate perspective.  Again, year-over-year, it's up significantly because the amount of construction activities were actually up year-over-year."

            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody. With me today, are Hallie Kuhn, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. Want to thank you for joining Alexandria's fourth quarter and yearend 2022 earnings call and wishing you a safe and healthy new year. And thank you to our Alexandria family team members for their continued operational excellence across all facets of our unique business platform. A truly mission-driven, one-of-a-kind company. We have truly exceptional fourth quarter and 2022 yearend results and by any and all metrics, we're very proud, thankful, and humbled, while many public recording companies ever really struggled mightily during this past year. I'd like to take a moment to tick off what I consider to be some of the most notable news for Alexandria. Truly amazing that Alexandria has delivered approximately 8.5% FFO per share earnings growth while continuing to strengthen our fortress balance sheet, the strongest in our history and Dean will give you more details on that. Against the backdrop of a very deleterious macro-market in this 2022 year and really again, nothing short of operational excellence to the team. With our highly leased development pipeline and continued strong leasing and Peter will comment on that, Alexandria is well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth again in 2023. We have continued to create long-term shareholder value with a total shareholder return from IPO through the end of this -- end of the year, December 31, 2022 of 1673% compared to the MSCI read index of 684%, S&P 500 of 628% and NASDAQ 838%. So a wide margin upbeat. Alexandria continues to produce stable, increasing, long duration cash flows and an increasing dividend. We're very proud of our approximately 1,000 client tenant base, a one of a kind treasurer that continues to generate remarkable demand for our Alexandria lab space and Peter and Dean will highlight more on this, but again, two million square feet leased in fourth quarter, over eight million for the year and almost 18 million for the last two years with rental rate increases last year of about 22% on a cash basis. Pretty amazing stats and we're very proud of our own tenant base, which is generated by far and away the majority of that lease space. 4Q '22 and yearend 2022 was another strong quarter by all fundamental financial metrics and a few others and Dean will highlight some of this, almost 100% -- almost a 100% on collections from a very strong and durable tenant base and very proud of almost 95% occupancy and we put in I think very strong same-store performance both for the quarter and the year.  Innovation in medicine is but must continue to be a national imperative. One in four of us will develop a neurodegenerative disease. Nearly 40% of adult men and women will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes. One in five in the nation's population suffers from mental illness and we're continuing to see over a 100,000 deaths due to overdose last year, despite all of the efforts that certainly this company has made with our Dayton project, but just a literally a war out there, which does not seem to be in check and governments at the federal, state and local level need to double down with the vast amount of resources that have been appropriated over the last few years and really focus on this mental health issue. A comment about our successful and continuing value harvesting and recycling of our precious capital, Peter will detail that, but amazingly stellar 2022 with $2.2 billion successfully harvested and then reinvested in a highly disciplined, disciplined manner and Peter and Dean will also comment on the excellent and steady progress we've made year to date, just one month in to our 2023 business plan for value harvesting and capital recycling and we're very optimistic about that. And then before I pass it over to Hallie, want to particularly call out and thank our particularly call out and thank our finance team and all those who had a hand in the impressive balance sheet accomplishment set forth on Page XB of our supplement. I am very proud that we once again have the strongest balance sheet in the company's history. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Hallie for further comments. Thank you. Operator, you can open it up for questions, please. Yes. This is Joel. I think we'll try to be general in that given that we have -- we're at the letter of intent stage on a number of transactions. But maybe, Peter, you could give kind of a topside view. Yes. So each one of those was unique in and of itself. I don't want to get too granular, but I think the one in the Route 128 corridor really enables us to piece together three different projects into a more than 1-million-square-foot mega campus, and we have some great activity from our 1,000 tenants to help fill that. So we're very optimistic on that and feel like that was very strategic. It's also under lease back for a number of years, so it will be continuing to cash flow.  The other acquisition was a unique acquisition in downtown Austin. We felt that it was a superb location. It's also under a lease back for a period of time. So we'll continue to generate good revenue, and I won't comment on what our future business plan is for that, but we think there's a really great opportunity to do something unique in that spot, if that's helpful. So, Peter, do you want to maybe comment generally on that? SP1 I don't know, Dean, if you know that, what asset that was or you want to... I don't either. It's 30,000 square feet on our 40 million square foot portfolio is artwork. Yes, this is Joel. Let me make a topside comment, and then I'll turn it over to Peter. I think you have to -- if you're asking about general sentiment, Peter will comment if you're asking about our sentiment it's different because we generally have a certain targeted demand from our existing client base, and therefore, by making, say, the acquisition we did or doing things that we do to create an environment where companies want to go, it really is focused on our kind of game plan.  But if you're looking at a topside view, I don't know, Peter, you could share topside view on Waltham generally. And keep in mind, there will always be demand among more R&D-light companies for Route 128 in Waltham than in the heart of Cambridge. That's just how it's been for decades now. Yes. I'll ask Dean to do that, but obviously, each and every situation is different, but Dean, upside view? Dean, do you have any information on that? You may be on mute, Rich. Yes. I can give you my thoughts, and Peter can share his. I think it's hard to compare past cycles because the level of technological development in biotech was so different. Today, it's much more sophisticated new modalities. So when you have M&A today, it used to be oftentimes you're buying a company for maybe a pipeline and you like to hold on to the people, but maybe space is less valuable going back maybe a decade or two. Today, that space is pretty critical, especially if it's located in a top-tier cluster market like Cambridge. Not only do you want the people for recruitment, retention and just working on the projects, but you've also got probably built into the space some pretty sophisticated new modality technologies, both at the lab side and in the R&D manufacturing, which is kind of integrated so closely. So I think it's harder to tell. I think, again, there's going to be a whole series of different types of uses of capital.  A lot of it will be partnering, which has historically been probably the favorite approach of pharma. There will be some acquisitions. You've got a Federal Trade Commission that's pretty hostile to any acquisition in any industry these days. So you'll probably see bolt-on acquisitions where people will want to keep that group and that technology in tow. But I don't think it's is easy to look at, say, big mega mergers in the past and think that, that has any relevance to today. And I think the key buy line for life science in 2023, in addition to what Hallie kind of framed out is what will be the velocity, the depth and the focus of this large cash hoard $300 billion. And if you leverage it, you could be as much as $500 billion to $600 billion. But Peter, you could comment just historically and what you've seen. Yes. Hallie, any final comments on that question? Yes. So that building, which we acquired had a leaseback to Pfizer. Remember, it's an office building for Pfizer, but it unique in New York, very few buildings have the bones to be converted to lab. They are moving to Hudson Yards, as you know, and their lease is up, I think, out about 2 years or so. But we do have some internally generated demand for that from our current client base, and so we're moving that along. Yes. Peter, you could comment generally to upside. And major overruns on budgets, I can think of 1 project in Boston where a client went there because we didn't have exactly the space that they needed, and then they came back to us when the developer had a huge overrun on costs. So that goes on all the time. Yes. That is a project that we own where they're rotating out of that, and that will be a future development project -- redevelopment and development. And most conversions, not all, but almost all don't work. And directionally, just look at our guidance for GAAP and cash, too so... Thank you, everybody, and we look forward to talking to you on the first quarter call. Be safe, feel well."

            "name": "Hallie Kuhn",
            "content": "Thank you, Joel and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of science and technology and capital markets. Today, I'm going to provide a recap of the life science industry coming out of 2022 and now into 2023 and how our highly unique approximately a 1,000 tenants remain resilient through the volatility of the current macroeconomic environment. As Joel mentioned, and as we often talk about, the 90% of 10,000 diseases remains an incredible opportunity and unmet need. And the fact is, many of these that do have treatments are far from solved. Take type 1 diabetes. While it was a death sentence before the discovery of insulin over 100 years ago, it still carries an immense burden. A person with type 1 diabetes makes on average 180 health-related decisions a day, some of which have life or death consequences.  Now looking back at 2022, the stats truly speak for themselves regarding the enduring strength of the life science industry, of which I'll highlight 3. First, despite widespread commentary that VC funding hit the pause button in 2022, life science venture deals totaled nearly $58 billion. Other than 2021's record year, it was the second highest amount of capital ever deployed. Of note, over 70% of VC dollars deployed went into an Alexandria cluster, and with VC funds across tech and life science raising nearly $160 billion in 2022, a record eclipsing 2021 is $150 billion, significant dry powder is on hand to deploy over a multiyear time horizon. Second, large pharma continues to be 1 of the best performing sectors in the market. In a year where total returns for market indices such as the NASDAQ and Dow ended the year down 10%, the top 20 biopharma ended the year up an average 12%, with 8 of the top 20 pharma ending the year with total returns over 20%. With historic levels of cash on hand, over $300 billion to deploy into R&D and M&A, biopharma has the firepower to continue to innovate and grow.  And last, the pipeline of early innovation to commercialization continues to deliver to patients, with 37 novel FDA small molecule and biologic approvals, three gene therapy approvals and a novel cell therapy approval, of which nearly half were developed by Alexandria tenants.  Moving to Alexandria's unrivaled life science tenant roster; we wanted to provide additional color on our business segments and some examples of Alexandria's tenants at the forefront of life science innovation. Starting with large pharma, $260 billion was reinvested into R&D in 2021, and analysts estimate that, including leverage, pharma has over $600 billion to deploy into M&A and partnerships. The next several years, indeed decade are going to be framed by large pharma's continued pursuit of innovation as product patents expire and new types of medicines such as mRNA and cell therapies transition from large preclinical and clinical pipelines to commercial stage. Alexandria tenant Pfizer is a great example, with preclinical and clinical -- sorry, with over 110 programs spanning early to late clinical developments, and an estimated 19 products launching in the next 18 months. The company also noted in their 4Q earnings this morning, they are targeting an additional $25 billion in revenue to come from M&A activity by 2030. Transitioning to public biotech, our tenant base includes the majority commercial stage companies, which brought in nearly $150 billion in revenue in 2021. Tenants such as Amgen and Vertex have large diversified pipelines, driving long-term growth. As a note, Vertex is also leading the next generation of type 1 diabetes treatment with a novel clinical stage cell therapy that addresses the root cause of diabetes.  For clinical-stage biotechnology companies, data is king. And those that have met and will meet clinical milestones in 2023, continue to see stock recovery and ability to access capital through follow-on financings. While the public markets are still recovering, life science follow-on financings reached nearly $17 billion in 2022, which is right on par with the average life science follow-on financings over the past decade. With respect to life science products, service and devices, this segment largely consists of commercial stage tenants. While not immune to higher interest rates and supply chain challenges, this is a big business segment that both drives and responds to the needs of researchers across academia, biotech and large pharma, which continue to grow and innovate. A notable development in the space is the rapid drop in the price of genome sequencing, driven by a healthy increase in competition. Costing $100 million to sequence a genome in 2001 and diving to $1,000 per genome in 2020, we are now looking at the $200 genome, enabling access to critical sequencing data that saves lives.  So where are we headed in 2023? In the face of persistent economic headwinds, all industries are forced to double down on the areas of greatest value. As part of the reset, there are companies that won't make it, and we'd argue that this, in the long run, is healthy as capital is deployed more efficiently. There will continue to be further separation of haves and have nots, but companies like those on Alexandria's tenant roster with differentiated technologies, a clear road map to key inflection points such as generating clinical data and tenured management teams will continue to raise capital.  As history has shown time and time again, some of the most successful companies are those created in the depths of a financial downturn. Ultimately, the life science industry is not built on technologies looking for a problem, but instead thousands among thousands of devastating problems, i.e. diseases that this incredibly innovative industry is poised to address over decades to come. To end on a note of hope from former FDA Commissioner, Scott Gotland. Our ingenuity drives our hopeful innovation, but it's our compassion for each other that inspires us to apply these advances to the purpose of reducing human suffering.  With that, I'll pass it off to Peter. Just to say that every acquisition is going to be very unique in terms of the types of products being acquired, the talent base that comes along with it, the market that it's in. And so we very much are acutely aware of kind of the one-off nature of every acquisition. And ultimately, for acquisitions where they may tuck it into the company, we see a net positive in the ecosystem. If it's a small company that does get folded in, those executives go on to create 1 more or multiple companies after that. So we've had some great examples in the past of a company gets acquired and then that CEO goes on to build a bigger and even larger company. So altogether, it's a net positive for the ecosystem, I would say no matter what the outcome is. And a great example in Seattle, as Peter mentioned, another great 1 is Celgene's acquisition of Juno and then the acquisition by Bristol-Myers, that's really one of their most critical advanced cell therapy outpost. So again, it's almost case by case, Rich."

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We'll jump right in here. Our team is very pleased to have the strongest balance sheet in the company's history as of December 31. And this really is a result of disciplined execution of liability management year-to-year over the past decade. Our key highlights include, we really have earned our corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry today. We ended the year with tremendous liquidity of $5.3 billion that provides us important flexibility in this macro environment. No debt maturities until 2025, a statement only a small handful of REITs can make today, and a weighted average remaining term of debt at 13.2 years. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 5.1 times on a quarter annualized basis, 5.2x on a trailing 12-month basis. The fixed charge coverage ratio was very strong at 5.0x, and 99.4% of outstanding debt is subject to fixed interest rates.  Our team had outstanding execution in 2022 on our strategic capital plan. Key highlights include $1.8 billion of 12-year and 30-year bonds, with a weighted average rate of 3.28%, the term of 22 years completed in February of 2022. Outstanding execution by our team, as Peter had highlighted, on outright dispositions, partial interest sales, aggregating $2.2 billion, with an amazing $1.2 billion in gains or consideration in excess of booked value, a 4.4% cap rate on cash NOI, all exceptional statistics and significant value creation tap for reinvestment.  We had disciplined issuance of common equity with proceeds aggregating $2.5 billion at an average price of $189 per share, including 105 million sold under forward equity sales agreements in December of 2022. On a blended basis for the year, we felt comfortable executing on the modest $105 million under the equity under forward equity sales agreements in December at roughly $150 per share.  Now briefly on the bond market, the beginning of 2023 has been positive for high-quality issuers like Alexandria. Overall pricing for 10-year bonds for Alexandria has significantly improved, and as of yesterday, was in the upper 4% range or just below 5%. For 2023, we will continue to focus on execution of real estate dispositions and partial interest sales or joint ventures for a significant component of our 2023 capital plan. Two transactions are under executed LOI to bring in a partner on a portion of each asset. These transactions will provide approximately $370 million of equity-type capital in 2023, and there are other transactions that we expect to complete this year.  Turning to operating and financial results, really, congratulations to our entire team for outstanding execution this year or in 2022 during a very challenging macro environment. We reported total revenues of $2.6 billion, up 22.5% over 2021, with FFO per share as adjusted of $8.42, up 8.5% over 2021, and outperforming our initial outlook for 2022 of $8.36 by $0.06, and ahead of consensus, both for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022.  Now diving into key highlights from our truly amazing operating and financial results for 2022. Strong rental rate growth, leasing volume and occupancy growth drove record same-property NOI growth in 2022 of 6.6% and 9.6% on a cash basis, exceeding our 10-year average same-property NOI growth prior to 2022 of 6% and 2.9% on a cash basis. The last four years of rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space have been the highest in the company's history, including rental rate growth of 31% in 2022. Over the last two years, cash rental rate growth has been the highest in the company's history, including 22.1% for the full year of 2022. Leasing volume in the fourth quarter was robust relative to the quarterly average volume in recent years in the range of 1.1 to 1.3 rentable square feet per quarter, highlighting the continued demand from our client tenants. Now the last two years have generated the two highest annual periods of rentable square feet leased, including 8.4 million rentable square feet in 2022. three out of the last four quarters represented the highest quarterly periods of rentable square feet leased, including two million square feet in the fourth quarter.  Now turning to occupancy, occupancy was up 80 basis points since the beginning of 2021 to 94.8% as of December 31. Now looking forward into 2023, we expect a slight decline in occupancy in the first half of the year, with recovery expected in the second half of the year. We had a similar dip in occupancy in 2022, specifically overall strong occupancy in the year, but we did have a 40-basis-point decline from the first quarter of '22 to the third quarter of '22. For 2023, we expect temporary vacancy beginning in the first quarter related to spaces that, on average, are expected to generate significant rental rate growth, greater than 60% on a cash basis. Now these spaces are forecasted for occupancy over the next five quarters. This includes a mix of small redevelopment space, i.e., the first time conversion to lab space, normal lease expirations and a few early tenant departures.  Importantly, consistent with our general quarter-to-quarter growth in FFO per share for many years, we expect quarter-to-quarter growth in FFO per share in 2023.  Now a few other key highlights. 90% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or large-cap publicly traded companies within our top 20 tenants, highlighting the high-quality list of client tenants that our team has curated over the years. 99.4% of collections of January rent through January 27, just highlighting the continued strength of rent collections. And we had a very strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%, highlighting execution of operational excellence by our team.  Cash flows from operating activities after dividends for 2023 is expected to be very strong at $375 million at the midpoint of our guidance, and will continue to support growth in our annual common stock dividends per share. Our FFO payout ratio was very solid at 58% for the fourth quarter. And at this pace, cash flows from operating activities after dividends, over the next three years, should generate over $1 billion and that's an amazing statistic and very efficient capital for reinvestment.  Now turning to a couple of important real estate highlights. Construction in progress, otherwise known as CIP is forecasted to peak in the first quarter, then declined slightly through 2023 as the dollar amount of deliveries are expected to exceed additions to CIP quarter-to-quarter, highlighting the significant volume of deliveries over the next couple of years. As Peter had highlighted, we have 7.6 million rentable square feet of projects that are 72% leased and projected to generate $655 million of incremental net operating income over the next three years. In the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $26.2 million on real estate, primarily related to a few assets we plan to sell in 2023. Each asset is small and represents noncore assets no longer strategic for Alexandria to own. And to put this into perspective, the book value of assets held for sale was approximately $120 million as of December 31. The key takeaway is that from time to time, we review our asset base and proceed with selective sales that continue to enhance the quality of the remaining asset base.  Briefly on venture investments. FFO per share as adjusted over the last 2 years has included an average of $103 million of realized gains each year from venture investments, or approximately $26 million per quarter. Now quarterly gains from venture investments in 2023 are expected to be up slightly in comparison to this recent quarterly run rate. As of December 31, 2022, we had gross unrealized gains of $506 million on a cost basis of $1.15 billion, highlighting significant value in our venture investment portfolio. Now investments in our venture portfolio have been very modest, at less than $70 million in aggregate over the last five years, including $20.5 million that we recognized in the fourth quarter.  Turning to guidance. We reaffirm guidance for 2023 that was initially provided in connection with our Annual Investor Day on November 30 with 1 minor update. We updated excess cash held from bond proceeds to $300 million, representing a $50 million increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance. Our 2023 guidance for EPS diluted is a range from $3.41 to $3.61, and FFO per share as adjusted diluted is a range from $8.86 to $9.06 with no change in the midpoint of $8.96. Now under the current common stock distribution agreement we have in place, otherwise known as our ATM program, we have approximately 142 remaining available. We expect to file a new program in the first quarter of '23. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our strong outlook for the full year of 2023.  With that, let me turn it back to Joel. No, it's such a small number. I'm sorry, guys. We don't -- I don't have that at my fingertips. Yes. I think the high-level concept on the $1.4 billion of commitments for funding from our JV partners, generally speaking, these are funding requirements related to our value creation pipeline, so construction funding commitments. And these commitments do extend out over multiple years out, two to three years depending on the joint venture. But given the recent increase in projects with joint ventures over the last, call it, four to six quarters, we just wanted to be sure that the investment community understood the significance of the commitments coming from our partners on just a handful of construction projects. So we'll continue that disclosure going forward. Yes. So it's Dean here, guys. So what we did was we looked more carefully at the actual space. I believe the prior quarter was slightly lower or showing a modest mark-to-market opportunity and it was reflective of looking at that specific property overall, but we realized we had to dive into the details a little bit further because it didn't make sense as we were looking at it for the current quarter. And as we looked at the space specifically, so a portion of the building and the specific space that they're occupying, there's a bigger mark-to-market opportunity. So we wanted to be sure we updated that number in the current quarter. So nothing changed from a real mark-to-market, but previously, it was the overall building. And today, it's just specifically, or this quarter it's specific to that space that they occupy. It's really due to that. Some -- occasionally, there's a tenant in the top 20 list of tenants that we did not curate ourselves or has a modest market cap, and we just want to provide some incremental color to some investors who don't need to research the details on their own. Rich, I guess the way to answer the question is I think we find significant value in the longer maturity profile given the size of our company and -- we have a meaningful maturity profile for a big company, right, or that matches a big company is maybe a better way of describing it. So the longer average debt term gives us a lot more flexibility to manage the overall maturity profile, right? Because if that was more like five years, with that much debt outstanding, it will be a lot to manage year-to-year on top of any growth capital. So I think strategically, the longer term of remaining maturity is a real positive for us. Well, I think that the reason that others aren't as successful just because they don't have our brand. I mean it's -- we've talked about it for years and years. And there's a lot to be said about the operational excellence we bring, the management of the facilities to the design of the facilities. I think -- to the extent that there's projects out there that are pausing even after they've gone vertical or remain vacant, it's a number of things. One is that the location isn't comparable to ours; two, they've underwritten very high rents because they need to, their basis isn't very good; and three, they don't have a reputation to manage these critical infrastructure building. So I would say that, that's really the reason behind a lot of the competitive buildings not... Dave, its Dean here. Lab rents remain healthy as you can tell from leasing statistics in the fourth quarter. Hard to really look out well as you go out into the future, and lab rents are trending well, as we noted from our results. There is a slight mix at play in '23 with certain expirations coming up and certain leasing activity we expect to accomplish, call it, non-lab product. But that product is a small percentage of the portfolio. Rental rates overall, even when you blend it all together, will remain very strong. Jamie, it's Dean here. Net effective rents have been positive over time for our business. So it's not declining, it's increasing. I don't have it right in front of me, Jamie, but I don't have the exact statistic, but we recall reviewing it over the last month and it was a very solid positive trend. I mean it's -- look, our rents, cash and GAAP rents are up. Those are significant increases period-over-period. Net effective is just trailing out a little bit, but still directionally very substantial, right? Because their base net effective is based off your GAAP rents, right? Very strong. Jamie, it's Dean. As we looked at our wrapping up the year, there was an opportunity to raise a very modest amount, as you've mentioned, $105 million. And as we looked at our overall capital that we raised during the year, which I commented on, it blended in very attractively. While, it was done at $150, I think the overall blended common equity proceeds were about $189 per share. So just keeping things in perspective, there's a modest amount that we raised. And Jamie, going back to your other question, I just needed a second to pull it, but 1 second, I just lost the page.  But on rental rate growth, we were at -- so 31% GAAP, '22 cash for the year. Net effective for the year was something around 37%. It sounds like you're asking what the first quarter is going to look like. Look, Jamie, in the fourth quarter and the year for 2022, we are very strong. So I don't have an outlook going into the first quarter for net effective, but again, 2022 is up 37% on a net effective basis."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaula Schwartz: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to the Alexandria\u2019s third quarter earnings call. With me today are Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga and Hallie Kuhn. First of all, thank you to our Alexandria family team for their continued exceptionalism in the phase of a challenging macro environment, mostly self-inflicted by a really deleterious set of government actions and policies, coupled with the Fed, which has been slow to act. I think I would characterize third quarter is really an exceptional quarter and when you look at earnings in this challenging macro environment delivering 9.2% and 8.3% FFO per share growth for the third quarter and then 2022 year-to-date is really exceptional especially again given the size and scope of the company with almost 75 million square feet in its total asset base. I\u2019d say the health and resilience of the broad and diverse life science sector, the niche, which we pioneered, remains strong and there is a continuing strong R&D investment, Hallie will speak to this. But in general, we\u2019ve seen life science R&D funding in 2021 approaching almost $500 billion. I think the number is actually about $480 billion, which is astounding and $1.8 trillion since 2017, and we expect totals in 2022 to be very strong continuation of that. I think it\u2019s also important to recognize that the strong life science sector employment trends remain positive, and the core strength of the life science industry and our key cluster markets remains resilient and continuing strong. And I think the overwriting macro observation would be the long-term healthcare needs of this country certainly aren\u2019t going away. Innovation in medicine is really a national imperative and just look at the mental health problem across this country as one simple example. And as I\u2019ve said many times before, there are about 10,000 known diseases to human kind and really that we\u2019ve only addressed as a society about 10% with addressable therapies and very few real cures. Biotech, I think, remains resilient. Clinical data, regulatory updates and M&A can be idiosyncratic events that really are unaffected by economic trends, and Hallie will talk about that. I think demand continues very solidly for our high-quality and well-located assets, which are really powered by asset level operational excellence, second to none. Alexandria has the greatest knowledge, and I think this is a pretty unique experience and expertise by orders of magnitude with respect to life science real estate niche, which we created and informed by our over 1,000 client tenants were 87%, an important number to remember, of our leasing comes from. We have a level of knowledge and understanding of the true life science real estate demand that just isn\u2019t out there if you hang a for lease sign and hire a broker. Alexandria continues to experience strong leasing spreads and rental rate increases. And I think we\u2019re very proud that we\u2019ve got 99.9% collections this quarter, truly stellar. Our industry-leading roster of the 1,000 tenants create drives and create stable long-term duration cash flows, and our high-quality and diverse industry mix is really unmatched. And I think one of the great stories of the day, I\u2019ll talk about in a moment, will be the balance sheet. But among industry-leading fundamental metrics for the third quarter, which are notable and Dean will talk about some of the details there, are a 10.6% same-store NOI growth increasing over the last few years and the significant strategic value creation harvesting of over $2 billion, which Peter will detail. And I think something we\u2019re very proud of having lived through the 2008, 2009, really financial crisis. And with this team steering the ship as an unrated REIT in those days, today we have matured and really have a fabulous fortress balance sheet. We\u2019ve worked very hard to put together over many years. I think it\u2019s important to note Alexandria out of 127 REITs as of June 30th has the second best debt maturity profile of all of them, and that\u2019s pretty amazing. Dean will highlight our liquidity of over $6 billion. And I think we were both, I think, strategically informed and I think executionally aware when we timely executed both equity and debt transactions in both January and February of 2022 earlier this year before the Ukraine invasion. And again, almost coming to the end of my comments, the strong and flexible balance sheet in addition to, I think, fabulous liquidity, our remaining debt term is over 13 years. Our average weighted average interest rate is about 3.5% and we\u2019ve got almost 96% of our debt, which is fixed rate and again no debt maturities into 2025. And I think as many of you know and we\u2019re working on, we are crafting a well-thought-through set of alternative plans for 2023, which we\u2019ll unveil at Investor Day. And as you look out at the world today and you just look at what happened at the PRC meeting this past week, where the President actually had his former person who turned over the reins of power to him kind of ushered out a little bit in front of the entire party Congress there. It creates the impression that we might not only have a ground war in Europe, but we might have a friction over Taiwan in a kinetic sense. And so that\u2019s something to think about. And so we\u2019re planning hard about all eventual outcomes that could be very significant black swan events to the United States of America. So with that, let me turn it over to Hallie.\nHallie Kuhn: Thanks, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. As Joel mentioned, today, I\u2019m going to provide an update on the life science fundamentals driving the long-term growth of the industry, tenant health and how Alexandria proactively work with the vanguard of this highly dynamic industry and a challenging macro environment to continue to grow our one-of-a-kind and truly world-class company. First and foremost, while we are in a cyclical downturn, innovative medicines take on average over 10 years to develop, meaning that the life science industry is not cyclical, but is largely event and product driven. And the life science industry is still in its early innings and poised for growth. As the recent expansion of complex modalities such as cell, gene and RNA-based therapies reflect, the pursuit for new and better medicines is truly the growth industry of this century, and there still remains immense challenges to solve. Every day in the U.S., an approximate 1,670 people will pass away from cancer, every four minutes today an individual will die from a stroke and every 37 seconds someone will pass away from heart disease. Not to mention, the 90% of known diseases that have no available treatment. While the macro market conditions are not to be taken lightly, the life science industry is on a steep, long-term growth trajectory. So where do the fundamentals stand to drive and sustain this long-term growth? I\u2019ll start by walking through the multiple sources of life science funding. Notably, through the third quarter of 2022, venture capital funds have raised an all-time high of $149 billion, eclipsing 2021\u2019s historic year with $144 billion raised. Given the average funds investment period is four to five years, the significant amount of dry powder will continue to translate into well-funded private biotech companies for years to come. Companies with the most innovative technologies and experienced founders and management teams continue to successfully raise capital, and we continue to see healthy demand across this segment. Moving on to the equity markets, while the IPO window largely remains closed, the market is responding positively to meaningful data readouts. As an example, two tenants in our San Francisco Bay Area region recently announced positive Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 clinical data, sending shares up 60% and 70% respectively. And just as a reminder, within the public biotech tenant category, the majority of our ARR comes from tenants with marketed products, including many large cap tenants with strong balance sheets such as Vertex and Moderna. Next, large pharma continues to outperform the broader markets with significant cash on hand to put towards internal growth and external M&A and partnerships, which is critical for biopharma as it looks to backfill their pipeline with innovative, new products. Biopharma R&D spend totaled $262 billion in 2021 with the top 20 biopharma putting on average over 20% of revenues back into R&D. Notably, at the end of the third quarter 17 out of the top 20 biopharma where Alexandria Tenants. A stat as of today has increased to 18 of the top 20 biopharma. While M&A has largely focused on bolt-on acquisitions, partnerships continue to be an important source of non-dilutive funding for private and small-to-mid bio cap companies. With respect to government funding, the NIH budget continues to increase year-over-year with broad by bipartisan support. The proposed 2023 budget is $49 billion, a 9% increase over 2022. This space total does not include an additional $12.1 billion proposed for pandemic preparedness and an additional $1.3 billion for program evaluation, which would bring the total NIH budget for 2023 to $62.5 billion. With respect to notable clinical and regulatory developments, this quarter saw critical late-stage clinical readouts and an accelerated approval for indications in schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s and ALS, all of which are devastating diseases with limited treatment options. Tenant BioNTech also published promising early clinical data, demonstrating their novel mRNA therapies can train the body\u2019s immune system to identify and kill cancer cells. A testament to the opportunity of mRNA technology beyond COVID vaccines. On the regulatory front, the FDA continues to approve new therapies at a sustained pace, including 28 new drug approvals from the FDA\u2019s drug division, CDER, this year. The FDA\u2019s Biologic Division, CBER, approved two gene therapies just this quarter, increasing the total U.S. gene therapy approvals from two to four, and there are an astounding 500 cell and gene therapies in clinical development. The fundamentals remain strong amidst the backdrop of a volatile and uncertain economic conditions. Switching to tenant health, as our 99.9%, 3Q collections and historic tenure occupancy of 96% at test, our asset base is in a great position. As you can see on Page 17 of our sup., our life science tenant roster is diverse spanning multinational pharma, life science product service and devices, public and private biotech and institutions, and benchmarking ARE to just one of these segments does not capture the strength and depth of our asset base. Critically, maintaining the health of our over a 1,000 industry-leading tenant roster is not a static process, but a highly proactive effort that incorporates our deep understanding of the life science fundamentals, intimate knowledge of our tenants\u2019 work, preexisting relationships, and a dedicated and passionate team focused on best-in-class operational excellence. Our job is to engineer outcomes. This work comes in many shapes and sizes, whether it\u2019s creatively utilizing our over 40 million square feet operating asset base to provide critical space to accompany ahead of a future delivery or swapping a good but perhaps stagnant tenant with a fast growing tenant and taking advantage of the nearly 30% mark-to-market rental increases across our asset base, all with the goal of continued optimization of leases to innovative high credit tenants. I\u2019ll leave you with a quote from David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, who we had the pleasure of hosting, for not one, but indeed two ribbon cuttings celebrating new Eli Lilly spaces at Alexandria properties just last week. In regards to the life science industry, he said, the games for winners are bigger than ever. Being nimble, fast and attuned to the outside world and having the right people, all these basics matter more than ever. Indeed, this is a sentiment that applies broadly beyond the life science industry and is one we hold deeply at Alexandria. With that, I will pass it off to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thank you, Hallie. I would like to start by thanking all the teams of the company for your never-ending dedication, high quality work product, and collaborative spirit that made Steve\u2019s transition to retirement seamless as we all expected it would be. Steve continues to be actively involved in certain projects and we consider him an invaluable resource to the executive management team. Since Steve is no longer on the calls, I\u2019ll cover leasing as well as updating you on other key topics of the day, such as the development pipeline, construction costs, and the harvesting of our value creation. As we sit here today, Alexandria has an equity market cap and credit rating in the top 10% among all publicly traded U.S. equity REITs. A North American asset base of 74.5 million square feet, 431 properties in operation, development, or redevelopment, and over a 1,000 innovative tenants to inform our investment and operating strategies. We should note that it has taken over 28 years to reach these milestones. One cannot create such a dominant position in an industry overnight, and it takes far more than great real estate to do it. Our vast network, operational excellence and technical know-how are just a few of the many reasons we are one of a kind company in a class by ourselves. The life science industry has grown significantly in recent years with the success of new modalities such as mRNA and cell therapy, and we have grown along with it by capturing the majority of investment opportunities that have come about from those inventions and others. With the onset of market volatility, we are seeing a normalization of demand, and although in the near term we don\u2019t anticipate seeing the same level of activity we saw in our record breaking year of 2021, we continue to see healthy demand manifesting into solid leasing numbers. With respect to the leasing of our value creation pipeline, which is expected to add approximately $645 million in incremental annual rental revenue from 4Q 2022 through the third quarter of 2025, we leased approximately 330,000 square feet in the third quarter. Although that total is approximately one third of the record-breaking 2021 quarterly average, it is 18% higher than the previous five-year average, indicating we have returned to a normal run rate of leasing. With that leasing, our 7.6 million square feet of projects under construction and pre-leased near-term projects reached 78% leased, up 4% over last quarter. During the quarter, we delivered approximately 330,000 square feet at a weighted average yield of 7.1%, which will add approximately $30 million in annualized NOI to our P&L. Transitioning to overall leasing. The third quarter results continue to demonstrate Alexandria\u2019s ability to outperform even in turbulent times due to our significant differentiation among all who seek to participate in life science real estate, which can be summarized with four unassailable attributes. Irreplaceable AAA locations adjacent or in close proximity to the country\u2019s best life science research institutions; operational excellence in the running of our tenants\u2019 mission-critical facilities; mega campuses providing highly valued optionality, scalability and amenities; and a curated roster of over 1,000 tenants, including the most impactful and creditworthy research companies and entities in the world, providing unmatched industry insight. Despite current macroeconomic conditions, demand for Alexandria\u2019s best-in-class facilities continues to be at pre-2021 normal run rate. Examples of this include, in the third quarter, leasing volume was 1,662,069 rentable square feet which is above our 10-year quarterly average of 1.3 million square feet and well above our pre-2021 five-year average of 1.1 million square feet. Year-to-date leasing volume of 6.4 million square feet is above our five-year average of 6 million square feet, and we still have the fourth quarter to add to these totals. In the third quarter, cash and GAAP increases continued to be very healthy, with 22.6% cash increase and a 27.1% GAAP increase. Our operating asset mark-to-mark continues to be healthy at approximately 30%. In our quarterly examination of construction costs, the theme that jumps out at us is that overall cost and supply chain issues are starting to ease, but contractors don\u2019t trust what may happen tomorrow. The disruption brought about by COVID in 2020 was exacerbated by the stimulus implemented to mitigate it, and as we all know, has led to inflation not seen since Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency. This inflation caused serious losses to the construction industry as contractors were legally bound to deliver projects within lump sum or gross maximum budgets that had become grossly underfunded with every passing month as the economy opened and pent-up demand for construction materials and labor through the system violently out of equilibrium. These losses have caused contractors to keep pricing high despite anticipated reductions in cost. Therefore, we need to remain cautious about projecting any easing of conditions until the construction market can be confident, another sue is not going to drop and that time has not come yet. It\u2019s easy to understand this mindset because evidence of an easing is only anecdotal at this point. Steel, copper, lumber and labor costs had shown signs of leveling off, but escalations from the third quarter of 2021 to the third quarter of 2022 totaled 12.3%, well above normal. And lumber just spiked again two weeks ago. That said, supply has started to catch up with demand. Inventories and materials are still low, but improving. Freight transportation is trending down contractor backlogs, though strong through 2023, are finding openings due to canceled projects and fewer new projects are starting. This opening up of capacity has slowly returned the ability for general contractors to get three bids from some subs. Grassroots to normalization, you could call it. But there are storm clouds on the horizon in the form of billions of dollars of work anticipated to build mega chip factories and the $1.2 trillion infrastructure investment and Jobs Act signed into law last November, which could roll back any easing of construction chain conditions. Overall, we do expect construction costs to begin reverting to the mean due to the easing of contractor backlogs and relatively better availability of materials, but Alexandria will continue to conservatively underwrite construction cost escalations in our pro formas. We have a deep and experienced team that works in lockstep with our underwriters to ensure we are accounting for the latest trends in our current and future projects. Interest rates continue to wreak havoc on investment markets, and we feel fortunate that our scarce product type continues to be in demand during such a turbulent time. Evidence of this can be seen on Page 5 of the supplemental, where we present the results of certain asset dispositions, which have raised $2.2 billion in capital to-date, including $1.26 billion in the third quarter. Included in those dispositions was the completion of the previously announced partial interest land sale at 1450 Owens and Mission Bay to a development JV partner for a land value of $324 per buildable foot. The sale of a portfolio of assets spanning the submarkets of South San Francisco and Greater Stanford for a 5.2% cash cap rate. A one-off asset along the I-15 corridor for a 5.3% cap rate, two assets on Carol Road and Sereno Mesa for a 4.6% cap rate, a partial interest sale of a campus in Sereno Mesa for a 4.6% cap rate and the partial interest sale of a high-quality asset in Merryfield Row and Torrey Pines for a 4.1% cap rate. The low five cap rates achieved in the San Francisco portfolio and the I-15 sale in San Diego are indicative of the age of the assets. Still attractive workhorse assets, they do not reflect the higher end profile of our core. The strong sub-five cap rates for the partial interest sale of the Summers Ridge campus and the Carol Road assets are more representative of our asset base. The Merryfield Row asset is purpose-built lab by Alexandria and like many of our other purpose-built assets is one of the best located and most attractive asset and its submarket. In this case, Torrey Pines. The 4.1% cap rate was influenced by the growth in rents in Torrey Pines since the lease was signed, but the lease is almost 12-years of term remaining before that upside can be realized. So it\u2019s quality and location really drove the value. I\u2019d also like to note that the scarcity value we talk about being a driver for keeping our cap rates lower relative to other product types can be seen in transactions by others. Just last month, Biogen completed a sale leaseback in Cambridge for $2,185 price per square foot value and the Carlyle Group sold a 77,000 square foot Blackstone Science Square building in Mid-Cambridge for a 4.1% cap rate at a price just short of $2,000 per square foot. As the Fed continues to pull levers to battle inflation, we expect we will see cap rates move up, but much less on a relative to other product types and thus, we remain well positioned to fund our value creation pipeline efficiently and at a relatively attractive pricing by harvesting our value creation among other sources. With that, I\u2019ll pass the call over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: Thanks, Peter. Dean here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team delivered on truly remarkable results for both the three and nine months ended September 30. Total revenues were up 20.5% and 24.8% for the three and nine months of 2022 in comparison to 2021. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the three and nine months was $2.13 and $6.28, up 9.2%, 8.3% over 2021 and importantly, beat consensus. The strong financial and operating results reflect the strength of our brand, our scale, high quality and well-located properties and operational excellence, serving the mission-critical needs of some of the most innovative entities in the world. Congratulations to our entire team for truly outstanding executions over many quarters. This really stands out within the REIT industry, especially during this very challenging macro environment. Our strong balance sheet and liquidity management highlights truly awesome execution by our team over many years. Our team is very pleased to have earned our corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry. We are also very pleased to have further improved the strength of our balance sheet in the third quarter with a significant increase in liquidity. We completed an amendment to our line of credit, increasing aggregate commitments to $4 billion, up $1 billion over the prior credit facility. A huge thank you to our important lending relationships for providing significant liquidity for our company. Our total liquidity as of September 30 is now very significant at $6.4 billion. We are one of the very few REITs with no debt maturities until 2025. 96% of our outstanding debt represents long-term fixed rate debt and the percentage of fixed rate debt is expected to be even higher by the end of the year. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA is on track to hit our 5.1 times target by year-end. Our total outstanding debt has a weighted average rate of 3.52% and a weighted average maturity of 13.2 years. The execution of our capital plan this year was exceptional given the macro environment. We did $1.8 billion of 12 and 30-year bonds with a weighted average rate of 3.28% in a term of 22 years, which was completed in February. Most of our common equity for 2022 was completed in the first quarter and entirely completed by June 30. And then we turn to continued execution of our strategic value harvesting through outright sales and partial interest sales of real estate. Through September 30, we\u2019ve completed $2.2 billion in sales, including $1 billion in the third quarter with gains or consideration in excess of book value of $1.2 billion, which is really significant value creation. Now, our focus on real estate dispositions for 2022 leaves us with an advantage at year-end with about $250 million of cash that will reduce our debt needs for 2023. As we look forward, we will remain disciplined and careful with our allocation of capital. Briefly on dividends, our Board has been consistent over the past decade with growth in common stock dividends year-to-year, supported by strong growth in cash flows and our low FFO payout ratio, which is generally in the range of 55% to 60%. Cash flows from operating activities after dividends are projected at the mid-point to be about $300 million for 2022, and to put this into perspective, over an approximate three-year period, this represents approximately $1 billion for reinvestment. Now ARE pioneered our favorable lease structure with contractual annual escalations approximately 3%, triple net leases that provide for the recovery of operating expenses and the recovery of major capital expenditures. Now, our team also curated a tenant roster of high-quality tenants, including 49% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade and large-cap publicly traded entities. Occupancy is up 30 basis points since the beginning of the year and is expected to continue to increase by year-end, highlighting the strength of our brand and trusted partnership with our tenants. EBITDA margins 69% really reflects the operational excellence and operating efficiency of our business, and this also represents an industry-leading statistic. Leasing was very solid in the third quarter at 1.7 million rentable square feet with rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing a space of 27.1% and 22.6% on a cash basis. TIs and leasing commissions on lease renewals and re-leasing the space for the nine months were down about 20% in comparison to the full year of 2021. And the third quarter included two long-term lease extensions of roughly 10 years with a 47% increase in net effective rent. Now, excluding these two long-term lease extensions with somewhat elevated TIs and leasing commissions in the third quarter, TIs and leasing commissions would have been relatively minor at approximately $25 per square foot. Same-property NOI growth has been very strong for the nine months ended September 30 at 7% and 8.9% on a cash basis. And to put this into perspective, our 10-year average same-property NOI growth was 3.6% and 6.6% on a cash basis. The outperformance in 2022 relative to this 10-year average was driven primarily by 110 basis point year-to-date growth in occupancy with about a 2 times benefit to net operating income. And then really outsized benefit from significant early lease renewals that commenced very early in 2022, providing for a full year benefit this year. Now, we continue to make excellent progress on leasing. Contractual lease expirations for 2023 represents only 6.6% of annual rental revenue down from 9% as of the second quarter. Now importantly, 2023 contractual lease expirations representing only 70% or 4.6% of our annual rental revenue remains in the category of too early to tell, meaning not already leased, not under negotiation or not targeted for redevelopment. Turning to venture investments. These investments have generated consistent gains averaging about $25.4 million, which is included in FFO as adjusted over the last eight quarters. This is very solid and very consistent. Now, it\u2019s important to highlight that on average over the last six years, only \u2013 about only 30% of the realized gains included in FFO were generated from our investments in publicly traded securities, 70% were generated from investments in privately held entities. Gross unrealized gains as of September 30 were $529 million, including $102 million and $427 million from publicly traded and privately held entities respectively. Lastly on guidance, we updated our guidance for 2022 and narrowed the range for EPS and FFO per share from a range of $0.06 or range of $0.02 per share. Our 2022 guidance for EPS diluted is a range of $5.70 to $5.72 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted is a range from $8.40 to $8.42 with no change in the mid-point of $8.41. As a reminder, we are about four weeks away from the issuance of our detailed guidance for 2023. And therefore, we are unable to comment on details for 2023. With that, let me turn it back to Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thanks, Dean. And if we could go to questions, please?\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Griffin from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nMichael Griffin: Peter, it seemed like you talked pretty favorably about the properties, the attractive cap rate, particularly at the [indiscernible] asset in San Diego. I\u2019m curious if these properties are so attractive, why did it make sense to dispose of these?\nPeter Moglia: Just we have a number of properties on the docket to do the same thing, too. We\u2019re recycling capital, putting it back into great projects we have in our value creation pipeline. So it was efficient capital to harvest and reinvest.\nJoel Marcus: Well, and I think one of the other things is we have some fabulously large opportunities up on the Mesa and Torrey Pines, two very large-scale development sites that we\u2019re working on. And so we have no shortage of Class A opportunities in the best submarket in San Diego.\nNick Joseph: This is Nick Joseph here with Michael. You touched on the macro concerns and Black Swan events and disruption in the construction market. So when you blend that all together, how do you think about the impact on development plans at least in the near-term?\nPeter Moglia: Joel, are you taking that?\nJoel Marcus: Could you repeat the question?\nNick Joseph: Yes. It\u2019s on development starts. And I think in your prepared remarks, you kind of laid out some of the macro concerns, you talked about China, you talked about potential for Black Swan events. And then later, you talked about disruption in the construction market and maybe not seeing pricing come back yet. And so I\u2019m wondering how that plays into your expectations on near-term development starts.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think we\u2019ll \u2013 if you\u2019ll hold your question to Investor Day, I think we\u2019ll be able to give you a very good view of that. And I think we have an interesting set of alternative plans given what may unfold in 2023, given how we think about Plan A, Plan B and Plan C that might unfold out in the general economy. But I think it\u2019s fair to say and Dean can comment where we have very strong leasing opportunities, we\u2019ll clearly look for ways to accelerate those opportunities and fund them carefully with the best sources of capital. But Dean, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment any further. I think we wait until Investor Day to give you a eyeballs view of that.\nDean Shigenaga: Yes, I think what I would just add to Joel\u2019s comments is that we sit in a pretty unique position. We have the benefit of some of the best located land parcels for life science use in these core cluster markets and really positioned from the standpoint of optionality is the best way of thinking about it. Meaning, we have the tenant roster that, as Joel mentioned, 87% of our leasing activity comes from. We have the land sites. So we really have the option to meet the demand. So we have that flexibility. And so I think that\u2019s the best way of thinking about our pipeline. It gives us options. We don\u2019t have to address it, but it gives us plenty of options.\nNick Joseph: Maybe just a follow up on that, just with the impairment charge in the quarter. Can you walk through that project and kind of the decision to walk away from it?\nDean Shigenaga: Sure. It\u2019s Dean here. So as you know, the disclosures we had about a little bit more than $38 million in impairment charges. It was primarily related to 1 project that which we no longer chose to proceed forward with. It was a development project, about 600,000 rentable square feet. The parcel was located in California. We did not own the land. We had pretty significant cost incurred, but it was really our investment to date, which was significantly related to the entitlement work for the site. And the reason for not moving forward with the project was very specific to the financial outlook for the project. There was no lease, re-lease negotiation related to the project to be clear. And beyond that, I guess, we\u2019re not in a position to comment much further on the project. But as you\u2019ve heard from us on this call and over the last several quarters, it\u2019s really important to keep in perspective that we did lease about 2.7 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment space just in the first three quarters of 2022. So it\u2019s very specific to the project.\nNick Joseph: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Thanks and hi everybody. Your 7 near-term development projects that you plan to start, are those yields locked up? Or is there any room for movement there if the environment changes here given what\u2019s happened to rates or where do those stand?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Dean, do you want to comment on that?\nDean Shigenaga: Yes. By and large, they\u2019re getting close to being locked up in the sense of \u2013 as you go through a lease negotiation and execute a lease, both sides of the relationship landlord and tenant will work through a fairly detailed budget. Once the lease is executed, the tenant moves forward their side to refine their cost estimates as they get into really the details. So big picture, we have a sense of the yields. The exact yields will be refined as the tenant finalizes the extreme details of their build-out. And then on the cost side, as you\u2019ve heard from us for many quarters now, we do build in contingencies to protect us from construction cost escalations. And as we usually do, we\u2019ll make disclosures of those yields as soon as we can. And generally, that time line is consistent with once the tenant finalizes the details of their project design. So it usually lags disclosures of lease-up. But I think the important thing to recognize is we had no changes in cost at completion for any of our projects on an unfavorable \u2013 from an unfavorable perspective nor on yields. We did have one project that had an increase in cost at completion, but it corresponded with a pretty significant increase in revenue as well. So we\u2019re generating for solid return on the incremental capital. So our team has done a tremendous job managing costs in a very unusual environment when you have to consider supply chain considerations and just continued escalations in construction costs.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. I mean should we think about just expected development yields to go higher given just incrementally higher funding costs? Or I guess, to Peter\u2019s point, maybe they don\u2019t go up quite as much as rates. Just trying to think about where that could go as we start to think about the next round of starts.\nDean Shigenaga: I think it\u2019s tough, Tony, to speculate about yields on a specific project because every project is very unique, the location, the nature of the build, the complexity of the build and specifically the back and forth negotiation with our relationship tenants. I would say, generally speaking, we\u2019ll do the best we can to push yields in the right direction upwards by managing our construction costs carefully looking for opportunities to become more efficient, but that\u2019s not a simple task as we all know, you can\u2019t just cut cost. You have to do that very carefully. And hopefully, the rental rate environment continues to support upward movement in that direction, which would translate hopefully into ongoing upward direction in returns or yields. But Tony, just I don\u2019t want to speculate specifically. Every deal is very unique, and we\u2019ll take those decisions incrementally when they do come up.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I mean, Tony, the one thing to think about what Dean just discussed about yields, how that bears on our decision-making is useful to think about our decision not to go forward with that specific project. So that clearly is \u2013 weighs on our decision to go or not to go in every single case.\nAnthony Paolone: Got it. If I could just ask 1 just clarifying question on the accounting. The \u2013 your gains and losses that are realized on the investment book that go through FFO, is that based on the most recent mark against what you realized your original cost?\nDean Shigenaga: Generally, it\u2019s the original cost, Tony, unless for some reason, over the years, we\u2019ve taken a write-down, which is a realized loss, i.e., in impairment. But traditionally, it\u2019s against the \u2013 more often than not, it\u2019s against our original cost basis, Tony. And I would also just point out that the key drivers between or around realized gains in our venture portfolio is really driven by liquidity events. So they\u2019re natural events. Occasionally on the public side, which is only about 30% of our gains historically over the last six years, I mean, we ultimately sell a handful of public securities and that\u2019s what ultimately drives some of the gains on the public side. But it\u2019s a small piece of the overall mix on average.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was just wondering, Peter, if you could talk a little bit more about the demand trends that you\u2019re seeing, maybe by the type of tenant, by broad industry and maybe by your key clusters. You are seeing better demand on the West Coast, up in Boston, New York. Any color on regional demand would be helpful.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So this is Joel. Hey Steve and welcome back. I think we\u2019d like not to answer that question at a granular level. I think it\u2019s pretty proprietary and as we said, 87% of our leases this quarter, for example, came from our tenant base. And I think it would not be useful for us to go into granular detail on that. But I can tell you and Peter can comment broadly demand is solid in all of our markets at the moment.\nPeter Moglia: Yes. I\u2019d agree with that and as it consistent with my comments, I would say it\u2019s a normalized rate that corresponds to the last few years if you take out 2021, which was an outlier. But it\u2019s broad. And it\u2019s still, we\u2019ve talking about it for a while how all of our clusters have been doing well that continues to be the case.\nJoel Marcus: Yes, and I would add a gloss on that, Steve. Think about what both Hallie and I said this is not a \u2013 these are episodic \u2013 this is an episodic industry, so to speak, not really driven macroeconomically. And so demand often is generated by clinical data readouts, regulatory readouts and updates and sometimes M&A where somebody buys a company and then wants to expand. We\u2019ve seen that. We\u2019ve seen it on the other hand where they may buy a company and roll it up, but oftentimes companies are bought for their talent unless you\u2019ve got a kind of just a product opportunity. So I think that\u2019s how you have to think about it.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. And then second question, maybe just on the dispose, Peter, I know you provided a fair amount of detail on the cap rates. I\u2019m just curious, the depth of the buyer pool and maybe how it\u2019s changed? And do you have a sense for kind of where unlevered IRR expectations are for buyers of the various products that you transacted on in the last quarter?\nPeter Moglia: We\u2019ve had a consistent buyer pool and all of our activities over the last few years. We generally try to keep it limited. We don\u2019t want to disperse too much information to a broad audience. And those players have continued to show up for our deals and it has resulted in the cap rates. So, on an unlevered IRR basis, yes, I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s higher than it was. I know in the peak times people were underwriting to a 5 or less. I can\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re doing today, but obviously it\u2019s gone up. But with our product type, the rental growth, you can pay a 4 something cap rate. And with the annual increases in our leases and with market rent growth, you can exceed 6%, 7% pretty easily on an unlevered basis these days.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. That\u2019s it for me.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Good afternoon. One of the things that sort of emerged from periods of dislocation, like seen in the REITs in the past as well as in biotech is increased M&A activity and its aftermath. We certainly saw some of that in the REIT space post-pandemic. I\u2019m wondering, if you have a similar expectation in biotech. I know there\u2019s been some sort of fringe type of activity, but is there an opportunity to see more in the way of M&A as a sort of indicator of emerging health from that space? And if so, do you see it as a benefit to you in terms of future leasing and so on?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, so maybe I\u2019ll comment generally and ask Hallie to also comment. I think Rich I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see any blockbuster M&A deals big company to big company or even big company to moderate size companies that impact what is perceived to be some competitive situation in a therapeutic class. The FTC I think under this administration has been fairly hostile to almost every kind in every industry get together because they claim it\u2019s always not competitive or it diminishes competition, somehow increased prices. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve seen this play out a little bit with Illumina and GRAIL, and GRAIL was spun out of Illumina, so none of that makes particular sense. But I think it\u2019s fair to say we will see and I think Hallie mentioned this and continue to see, we just saw recently Lilly just bought a bolt-on acquisition of a hearing loss company. I think you\u2019re going to continue to see a range of bolt-on acquisitions for product opportunities. And I think sometimes it\u2019s going to be a positive, sometimes it may not be. But overall, historically, if we look back at our 25 years of public company, it\u2019s been generally pretty positive for us. But Hallie, any other thoughts you have?\nHallie Kuhn: Yes, I agree with everything you mentioned, Joel. And maybe just to say that depending on the company and the outcome, it\u2019s positive for the ecosystem whether or not there\u2019s a real estate outcome. Thinking about some of the bolt-on acquisitions where it really is product driven, we see those executives go off to start new companies. We have deep existing relationships with them. They often go on to establish and grow their next large biotech. So in the long run, these events are positive for the ecosystem. There are a number of examples where M&A over the years has led to really sizable footprints. BMS in San Diego is a great example of that over time with their acquisition of Signal about two decades ago, and then Celgene. And then as you saw in the first quarter this year, we announced their 420,000 square foot in development with us in San Diego. So over time, the acquisitions definitely can lead to additional space needs, but it\u2019s very dependent on the type of acquisition. And again, the overall net positive for the ecosystem is really great as investors go to put their returns to work in terms of new companies and founders go off to start new endeavors as well.\nRich Anderson: Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave it with that. Thanks very much.\nJoel Marcus: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: The next call comes from, excuse me, next question comes from Georgi Dinkov from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Thank you for taking my questions. I guess, you mentioned that\u2026\nJoel Marcus: It\u2019s hard to hear you. So could you maybe speak closer to the mic?\nGeorgi Dinkov: Yes. Can you hear me now?\nJoel Marcus: Oh, perfect.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Okay. Sorry about that. Yes. So you just mentioned that supply is catching up with demand. So my question is, which markets have the most supplier risk? And how do you think about competition from office conversion?\nJoel Marcus: Well, that\u2019s a complicated question. I\u2019m not sure we have the time or ability on this call to go in market-by-market, not sure we want to do it. But I mean, I think if you look at New York as a great example. We\u2019ve pioneered the first commercial life science center and campus in New York City. There\u2019s millions and millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of square feet, and there are a number of projects that are being worked on there. The demand has been fairly modest. It\u2019s early stage. And it\u2019s pretty clear that literally almost most buildings in New York can\u2019t be converted from office to laboratory and probably wouldn\u2019t want to be given the market. So, I think you have to look at that on a submarket-by-submarket basis. I don\u2019t even think you could look at it as an overall market-by-market basis. And we know from Boston, there have been a handful of conversions. We know, in particular, a recent case downtown, where somebody kind of jury-rigged an office building, brought in some smaller tenants, and we know the smaller tenants have experience both for the developer who\u2019s never done it before and the tenant massive cost overruns on that conversion. So \u2013 but as I say, just look at, again, 87% of our leases come from our existing tenants, we feel very good about our ability to continue to generate steady demand in these markets. And we\u2019ve been through the cycles. We are through the cycle in 2000, 2001, the big tech up bus bubble, if you will, and 2008 and 2009 with a big financial crisis. So, we\u2019re fully prepared and I think our portfolio or asset base really is in great shape.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Okay. And given the rising recession concerns, how should we think about tenant credit risk or large cap, mid-cap or small cap biotech? And do you see any risk to occupancy in a downturn?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So, we\u2019ve been very protected. I don\u2019t know, Hallie, do you want to comment on that? Because you\u2019ve had a number of conversations about the health of the \u2013 and the diversity of our tenant base and the credit quality.\nHallie Kuhn: Yes, absolutely. So, I direct you to look at Page 17 of our supplemental, which has a breakdown by ARR of our business types across the life science industry. And as we\u2019d like to stress on other calls, small and mid-cap is a very small percentage of our overall tenant base. And what we\u2019ve done as well in the past two quarters has broken down our public biotech segment by marketed products versus preclinical and clinical products. And as you can see, the majority are marketed. And these are, as mentioned on the call, there\u2019s companies like Vertex, Moderna folks with incredibly large balance sheets and cash to deploy. It\u2019s important to know that our team and our diligence process is truly unique. We have a number of folks, including myself, with PhD backgrounds across the biotechnology space that significantly underwrite these companies, understand what their risk profile is, what their opportunity and growth profile are and then monitor them extensively as they progress. So all things put together, we have a really strong set of companies across all of our different business types, which collectively reflect the strength of our asset base.\nPeter Moglia: Yes. And this is Peter. You should harken back to Hallie\u2019s comments in the beginning, where she talked about the fact that it takes, on average, about 10 years to get something to the clinic. So demand for life science real estate is much more inelastic and can\u2019t necessarily be varied due to current macroeconomic conditions. The companies need to continue to press on to get their revenue-producing project to market. We look \u2013 we did a look back to the great financial crisis a little while ago and noticed that the change in occupancy from the start to the end was negligible. I think it was maybe a 40 basis point swing at the trough. So our business is extremely resilient and it needs to be \u2013 or just because of the industry\u2019s profile, it will continue to be, nothing\u2019s changed from that aspect.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all for me.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dave Rogers from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Rogers: Hi good afternoon everybody. Dean, I wanted to start with you. I realize that you guys are going to wait maybe until Investor Day to talk about funding for projects you haven\u2019t started yet. I was just wondering maybe if, Dean, you could give us a little sense of kind of your plan with cash flow, cash on hand and the recent sales to fund the stuff that you\u2019ve already started that you still have to complete going forward.\nDean Shigenaga: Hey Dave, it\u2019s Dean here. So, I guess as you acknowledge, we\u2019re going to get into the details of our plan for 2023 in about four weeks at Investor Day. Maybe some high-level thoughts on the capital plan that you\u2019re looking at on our active projects with a handful of projects that we\u2019ve committed in the near term that are leased. So, we have about 7.6 million square feet. It\u2019s 78% leased and this pipeline can generate $645 million of incremental net operating income, which is just spectacular. If you look at the most recent starts or the stuff that\u2019s pending to start near term, just call it some projects could take up to three years to finish. NOI will commence quarter-to-quarter, as you would expect, even starting next quarter on this pipeline. I highlighted earlier that if you look out over about a three-year period at our current run rate for cash flows from operating activities after dividends over three years, you\u2019ve got $1 billion to reinvest. Equity capital \u2013 equity type capital for our pipeline includes this \u2013 we probably are sitting on about $6.8 billion of equity type capital and it\u2019s this $1 billion of cash flows that I just mentioned, we had about 1.5 billion of outstanding forward equity contracts. And then obviously, our CIT [ph] related to just the $645 million of incremental NOI is all that stuff\u2019s broad equity type capital. Some of it\u2019s incurred, some of it\u2019s future cash flows. But if you look at that, some number approaching almost $7 billion that are typical leverage profile, assuming a five one year end target for net debt to adjusted EBITDA. This pipeline will generate probably 3.3 billion or something in that range of debt funding. That\u2019s roughly one third debt, two-thirds equity on a leverage neutral basis. So as the EBITDA starts to come online, you can fund quite a bit from a debt perspective as well. And so those are the numbers I would keep in mind broadly. We obviously continue to focus on real estate dispositions, given the strength of the private market values and the scarcity of our assets as Peter has been highlighting for a number of quarters. Obviously, over the next three years, each of the years or every year is very different. And therefore, the funding needs for each year will vary. Basically, there\u2019s different timing from commencement of NOI and construction spend in each of the years, but it\u2019s really important to point out that there is a path forward if we had to navigate a period without access to the capital markets. So call it, if the capital markets were shut for three years. And I think from a risk management perspective or team analyzes this every quarter. And we do find comfort in the results, obviously, this is clearly not an operating scenario we would expect for three years. And I call it, one bookend scenario that you must evaluate from a risk management perspective. So I don\u2019t want to get into specifics for 2023, but hopefully those broad strokes help you understand that. We\u2019re reasonably well positioned in a \u2013 to address a, what could become even more challenging environment. We look forward to presenting the details of our outlook for 2023 at our Investor Day in late November.\nDave Rogers: We really appreciate that, Dean, that was helpful. And just one follow up from me, maybe to Joel or to Peter. Clearly, you\u2019re getting the rent that you need on the development. So that\u2019s continuing to grow and keep pace remotely with it sounds like inflation. What are you seeing on just market rent growth? You gave the mark-to-market earlier, but and obviously your spreads continue to kind of grab those \u2013 that mark-to-market. But I\u2019m curious on what you\u2019re seeing in market rents, maybe even a band. You don\u2019t have to go market-by-market, but what you\u2019re seeing kind of across the country?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, so Peter, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment. I think, we\u2019re still seeing rent growth in almost not necessarily all of our markets, but in almost all of our markets. It certainly won\u2019t keep pace with the hockey puck growth that you\u2019ve seen over the last year or two, the kind of COVID years. But I think it remains, I mean, just look at the numbers we posted this quarter and last quarter was an indication of kind of where things are and how they look like they\u2019re kind of settling out on a normal run rate. But Peter, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment macro.\nPeter Moglia: Yes, I mean, supply continues to be tight. So as new opportunities come about we are \u2013 we have continued to increase rents. We\u2019ve \u2013 and what we typically, even in our new developments as we lease them up, that they do tick up a percent or two over time. So I guess macro wise, without trying to predict what the actual percentages are, they are still increasing at this point in time and we don\u2019t see any evidence that that\u2019s going to slow down.\nJoel Marcus: Yes, and I think, again, you have to look at that question really almost has to be asked submarket-by-submarket, not market-by-market, Dave.\nDave Rogers: Well, I appreciate the color.\nJoel Marcus: What goes on in Cambridge is going to be far different than what goes on in Somerville, for example.\nDave Rogers: No, that makes sense. We\u2019ll look forward to getting into more details probably at the Investor Day. So Joel and Peter, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nTom Catherwood: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Peter, hey, looping back on the supply question. During prior quarters, you\u2019ve mentioned that obviously you track all the planned or proposed development that\u2019s out there in your markets and redevelopments obviously. But you\u2019ve also commented that you didn\u2019t think all of those were going to make it to market or get started. Given, the recent movement and rates and kind of lack of capital availability, have you seen any pull back in those starts? Or do you feel even more convinced that you\u2019re not going to see all those come to market in the near to medium term?\nPeter Moglia: Yes, and we have been receiving some anecdotes of projects that were on the radar that are not going to happen. Even a couple that started construction that paused, I mean, I talked about cost escalations in my prepared remarks, and they continue to wreak havoc and go into a lot of percentages because I didn\u2019t want to talk for 20 minutes. But just year-over-year from Q2 2021, I\u2019m sorry, Q3 2021 to Q3 2022, they were about 13.5%. So it has just become very expensive and I think that\u2019s giving a lot of sobering up a lot of people that were ready to jump in and try to get involved. So we don\u2019t expect there to be a huge supply problem in any of our markets. From what we see under construction it looks to be a fairly normal rate in a normal environment at this point. And as long as that continues everyone\u2019s being rational. We should continue to see good rent growth, not 2021 rent growth, but not the hockey stick that we experienced that Joel referenced. But good, and usually over time, we\u2019ve exceeded inflation. And I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re going to do that now with the inflation numbers, but as soon as inflation normalizes, I would imagine that we would continue to exceed it.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. But again, you have to take that supply issue submarket-by-submarket again, what supply might be in Cambridge versus what it might be in Somerville. It\u2019s talking about like night and day out a handful of years. So you have to think about, you can\u2019t generalize even do a market about supply, but it\u2019s pretty clear in addition to I think the important points Peter raised about either capital pausing or operators pausing. I think it\u2019s pretty clear cities are having and other jurisdictions, it\u2019s just tougher to get things approved, they\u2019re requiring more concessions. Residential is becoming a big \u2013 a big issue. We know in some jurisdictions if you don\u2019t have a resi as part of your project you\u2019re in a long line. If you have it, you may go to the head of the line. So a lot of dynamics now on a national basis that are I think changing and that will be a good check on supply.\nTom Catherwood: Got it. Thanks Joel. Thanks Peter.\nJoel Marcus: Yes.\nTom Catherwood: And then last one, appreciate the detail and the stuff this quarter on 325 Binney, obviously a lot of color in there. Have there been any changes recently with tenants increasing their sustainability requirements for their facilities and it kind of, what is the cost differential of going LEED Platinum and LEED Zero Energy like 325 Binney versus a more traditional lab design?\nDean Shigenaga: It\u2019s Dean here.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Go ahead.\nDean Shigenaga: Yes, maybe 325 is a good example and I think the, the way to think about this is you do have some advantages when you do sustainability initiatives from the start. It\u2019s a lot more efficient. You can, I think that project incurred something around that 6% to 7% range of cost to really end up being able to describe it as becoming the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge. As you guys know, it\u2019s probably the most important and unique feature is taking advantage of geothermal energy for heating and cooling of the building, which along with other attributes of the design, allows us to eliminate almost all the fossil fuel consumption for the building. It\u2019s an important attribute for Moderna, the CEO emailed their team as soon as the lease was signed, literally as soon it was assigned and said, let\u2019s get moving and make this one of the coolest, most sustainable green buildings in Cambridge and so they were passionate about it. Most of our large pharma and big bio tenants have already publicly announced sustainability initiatives. So they do find it important. Like LEED was in the early days. LEED had a cost element to it that we all had to get our head around, and we did early on. We had the first core and shell LEED Certified Building and so we were a pioneer there and continuing to be a leader in sustainability here in lab buildings.\nPeter Moglia: Yes. I also think you have to pay attention to the time we\u2019re in. So I think tenants are given today\u2019s inflationary spiral and kind of what\u2019s going on broadly. I think tenants are maybe somewhat, it depends on the size, the nature and so forth. Bigger tenants are more attuned to this, but I think a little less attuned to sustainability today and more focused on the recruitment, retention and return of their workforce. And then also recognizing that if you just read any number of articles on China\u2019s major ramp up of coal-fired plants and coal use and certainly in India too, it\u2019s pretty clear by scientists almost no matter what we do here in the United States, until that part of the equation is solved for the Planet Earth these, these measures aren\u2019t going to make a difference in global warming.\nTom Catherwood: Got it. Thanks everyone.\nPeter Moglia: Yes. Leap on that.\nDean Shigenaga: Thanks Tom.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Yes, thanks. Joel, can you provide an update on the New York cluster? I know there\u2019s a proposed 1.6 billion life science hub that could be built over the next decade. I mean, it sounds like there\u2019s a lot of buildings to build out the science infrastructure here? And should we think about these investments as a way to further build out this cluster and kind of the important step to make this more of a mature cluster over the next decade or so?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Well, I would refer you to and a good question to our September 12th press release where we talked about a range of issues in New York. New York is a very complicated market. It still remains a small company market. I\u2019ll come back to that initiative in a moment. Probably 250,000 square foot of lease \u2013 actual leasing last year. So that\u2019s a very small market. We started that market. There were literally only two commercial companies in New York doing research when we started, today the number approaches 75, 80 or more, but it\u2019s a slow growth. It\u2019s gestation period is 25 years or more. We\u2019re 12 years into it. So the market is not going to be grown by any supply. It\u2019s going to be grown by capital helping create companies. That\u2019s the only way that market is going to grow. You\u2019re not going to have big farmers like they\u2019re doing, like we signed these two leases a quarter or two ago with Lilly in Boston and BMS, Bristol Myers and San Diego. You\u2019ll never see that in New York because of the just the nature of the topography and geography there. You\u2019ve got very high tax burden and you\u2019ve got some safety issues going on now that hopefully maybe the Governor and others will wake up to. But it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of market it is. It\u2019s a small company market, it\u2019s a great place, but it\u2019s different than every other market. It\u2019s unique compared to all the other clusters. With respect to the State and City effort in Kips Bay there, it\u2019s a pretty broad and deep effort. Much of it is institutional and governmentally driven. There is a, a thought of building or a plan to build a tower in that area, but probably to get, go through the land use approvals will take two plus years and then go through an RFP process and then the development process it\u2019s maybe a decade away. But I think what\u2019s really needed is company creation there to really continue to foster the demand. And that\u2019s kind of, I mean, we know that market because we literally help create that market so that that\u2019s the state of play there.\nMichael Carroll: Nice. And does that investment, I guess improves the longer term outlook for that cluster and maybe increase the likelihood of you doing Phase 3? I mean, I don\u2019t know the timeline\u2019s probably too early to say, but does that make you more encouraged that things are coming around there?\nJoel Marcus: Well, those are I mean, I think it\u2019s good anytime you can continue to build infrastructure for institutions and governmental bodies that are doing research or developing. Part of that is health care delivery services which we\u2019re not involved with. So those are all good things. That\u2019s the East Side Medical Corridor really at its best. We\u2019re anchored between Bellevue and NYU and that\u2019s why we chose that site when we responded to the RFP by Mayor Bloomberg. But I think it\u2019s fair to say what really is needed is capital and company formation because that will be the lifeblood that will really grow that market over time. And what we\u2019ve helped grow it over the last 12 years. That\u2019s what it\u2019s been.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then just last one for me. With regards to your investment book, I know the capital markets are a little bit dislocated right now. Is ARE finding better opportunities to deploy capital in that investment book? And when you typically look at new investments, are they more strategic? Or are you taking more opportunistic views just given where maybe some opportunities may lie \u2013 give and it might be difficult for some of those companies to attract the capital right now?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think as Hallie said, there\u2019s been an all-time high venture fund capital raise this year, and that is kind of invested sprinkled out over a three, four, five maybe even longer time period. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that great companies with great technology, high unmet medical needs, protected IP, good IP, just really smart people at the scientific helm and the business helm will generally always attract capital. I mean, we invested in Alnylam back in 2003 when it was a startup company because we felt that RNAi had great promise, but it took 15 to 20 years to prove, but it was a great investment. That company has gone on to do great things and has a huge footprint in Cambridge. And then in 2013, which again was before the bull market started to happen, we took an early investment in Moderna and everybody knows the story there. So sometimes down markets as things are, valuations are better, and they give you interesting opportunities that really are focused on totally, I would say, groundbreaking technologies that may create tremendous opportunities for shots on goal on so many of the diseases that we\u2019re all suffering from. So \u2013 that\u2019s how we look at it. So yes, good time to invest.\nMichael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you.\nJoel Marcus: Yep, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey guys. I appreciate all the color today. I just had a question on the guidance. What gets you to the high and low end of same-store cash guidance? And then also same for the capitalized interest guide.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Dean?\nDean Shigenaga: So if you look at our guidance today, same property, call it the midpoint is 7% GAAP, 7.8% cash. And I think my commentary earlier highlighted we\u2019re at 7% for nine months on GAAP. So we\u2019re right on the midpoint today. And then we\u2019re at 8.9%, we\u2019re on the upper end on a cash basis. So we\u2019re at a good perspective for nine months. And I kind of highlighted the outlier drivers occupancy growth driving a 2x benefit to NOI. So we had 100 year-to-date for nine months, 110 basis point occupancy growth with a double impact, at least to NOI and then early lease renewals early, early in 2022, which was also driving the strength. So that\u2019s the backdrop. We\u2019ve got a good run rate for the nine months, which will carry us into a comfortable spot with our outlook for the full year.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Thanks Dean, what about the capitalized interest, the upper and lower ranges?\nDean Shigenaga: Look, I think the way to think about cap interest and interest expense; we don\u2019t change those numbers very often. The run rate that you\u2019ve seen for capped interest this year is probably reflective of the volume of construction activities in our business, which continue an upward trend at the moment, meaning capped interest probably on a quarterly basis, doesn\u2019t peak out until probably Q1 of 2023. So you\u2019re still on an upward trajectory as our \u2013 and that\u2019s just a pure function of what you would call construction in progress or the basis that\u2019s under construction, which drives the amount of capped interest. The interest rate drives it a little bit, but so much of our costs are fixed. There\u2019s very little variable cost for interest expense. So it\u2019s really just a function of spend quarter-to-quarter adding to CIP at a pace that\u2019s outpacing the deliveries which, as I mentioned earlier, will start to peak out here in the next quarter or two.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Thanks.\nOperator: And for our last question, we have a follow-up from Michael Griffin from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Griffin: Hey, thanks for stay on. I\u2019m just curious obviously; we saw the news about GE moving out 5 Necco, what are the prospects potentially to backfill this space? And would you attempt to sublease it could it be a potential conversion opportunity? And are there worries that there might be more of this coming down the pipe for your traditional office users, I think it\u2019s about 8% of the portfolio, but any commentary there would be great.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll ask Dean to comment, but one thing to keep in mind, there\u2019s an existing lease with a credit tenant but Dean?\nDean Shigenaga: Yes. I think that\u2019s the key concept. And I guess the other thing to keep in mind, Michael, there\u2019s always \u2013 it\u2019s interesting in the articles that you on any company. And most companies will choose not to comment specifically about articles in the press. As Joel mentioned, we do have a lease with a credit behind it. It\u2019s somewhere around 80,000 square feet in the Seaport market. But beyond that, we don\u2019t really have much to comment on.\nMichael Griffin: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: Well, we\u2019ll make it quick. Thank you and stay safe everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thank you, Hallie. I would like to start by thanking all the teams of the company for your never-ending dedication, high quality work product, and collaborative spirit that made Steve\u2019s transition to retirement seamless as we all expected it would be. Steve continues to be actively involved in certain projects and we consider him an invaluable resource to the executive management team. Since Steve is no longer on the calls, I\u2019ll cover leasing as well as updating you on other key topics of the day, such as the development pipeline, construction costs, and the harvesting of our value creation. As we sit here today, Alexandria has an equity market cap and credit rating in the top 10% among all publicly traded U.S. equity REITs. A North American asset base of 74.5 million square feet, 431 properties in operation, development, or redevelopment, and over a 1,000 innovative tenants to inform our investment and operating strategies. We should note that it has taken over 28 years to reach these milestones. One cannot create such a dominant position in an industry overnight, and it takes far more than great real estate to do it. Our vast network, operational excellence and technical know-how are just a few of the many reasons we are one of a kind company in a class by ourselves. The life science industry has grown significantly in recent years with the success of new modalities such as mRNA and cell therapy, and we have grown along with it by capturing the majority of investment opportunities that have come about from those inventions and others. With the onset of market volatility, we are seeing a normalization of demand, and although in the near term we don\u2019t anticipate seeing the same level of activity we saw in our record breaking year of 2021, we continue to see healthy demand manifesting into solid leasing numbers. With respect to the leasing of our value creation pipeline, which is expected to add approximately $645 million in incremental annual rental revenue from 4Q 2022 through the third quarter of 2025, we leased approximately 330,000 square feet in the third quarter. Although that total is approximately one third of the record-breaking 2021 quarterly average, it is 18% higher than the previous five-year average, indicating we have returned to a normal run rate of leasing. With that leasing, our 7.6 million square feet of projects under construction and pre-leased near-term projects reached 78% leased, up 4% over last quarter. During the quarter, we delivered approximately 330,000 square feet at a weighted average yield of 7.1%, which will add approximately $30 million in annualized NOI to our P&L. Transitioning to overall leasing. The third quarter results continue to demonstrate Alexandria\u2019s ability to outperform even in turbulent times due to our significant differentiation among all who seek to participate in life science real estate, which can be summarized with four unassailable attributes. Irreplaceable AAA locations adjacent or in close proximity to the country\u2019s best life science research institutions; operational excellence in the running of our tenants\u2019 mission-critical facilities; mega campuses providing highly valued optionality, scalability and amenities; and a curated roster of over 1,000 tenants, including the most impactful and creditworthy research companies and entities in the world, providing unmatched industry insight. Despite current macroeconomic conditions, demand for Alexandria\u2019s best-in-class facilities continues to be at pre-2021 normal run rate. Examples of this include, in the third quarter, leasing volume was 1,662,069 rentable square feet which is above our 10-year quarterly average of 1.3 million square feet and well above our pre-2021 five-year average of 1.1 million square feet. Year-to-date leasing volume of 6.4 million square feet is above our five-year average of 6 million square feet, and we still have the fourth quarter to add to these totals. In the third quarter, cash and GAAP increases continued to be very healthy, with 22.6% cash increase and a 27.1% GAAP increase. Our operating asset mark-to-mark continues to be healthy at approximately 30%. In our quarterly examination of construction costs, the theme that jumps out at us is that overall cost and supply chain issues are starting to ease, but contractors don\u2019t trust what may happen tomorrow. The disruption brought about by COVID in 2020 was exacerbated by the stimulus implemented to mitigate it, and as we all know, has led to inflation not seen since Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency. This inflation caused serious losses to the construction industry as contractors were legally bound to deliver projects within lump sum or gross maximum budgets that had become grossly underfunded with every passing month as the economy opened and pent-up demand for construction materials and labor through the system violently out of equilibrium. These losses have caused contractors to keep pricing high despite anticipated reductions in cost. Therefore, we need to remain cautious about projecting any easing of conditions until the construction market can be confident, another sue is not going to drop and that time has not come yet. It\u2019s easy to understand this mindset because evidence of an easing is only anecdotal at this point. Steel, copper, lumber and labor costs had shown signs of leveling off, but escalations from the third quarter of 2021 to the third quarter of 2022 totaled 12.3%, well above normal. And lumber just spiked again two weeks ago. That said, supply has started to catch up with demand. Inventories and materials are still low, but improving. Freight transportation is trending down contractor backlogs, though strong through 2023, are finding openings due to canceled projects and fewer new projects are starting. This opening up of capacity has slowly returned the ability for general contractors to get three bids from some subs. Grassroots to normalization, you could call it. But there are storm clouds on the horizon in the form of billions of dollars of work anticipated to build mega chip factories and the $1.2 trillion infrastructure investment and Jobs Act signed into law last November, which could roll back any easing of construction chain conditions. Overall, we do expect construction costs to begin reverting to the mean due to the easing of contractor backlogs and relatively better availability of materials, but Alexandria will continue to conservatively underwrite construction cost escalations in our pro formas. We have a deep and experienced team that works in lockstep with our underwriters to ensure we are accounting for the latest trends in our current and future projects. Interest rates continue to wreak havoc on investment markets, and we feel fortunate that our scarce product type continues to be in demand during such a turbulent time. Evidence of this can be seen on Page 5 of the supplemental, where we present the results of certain asset dispositions, which have raised $2.2 billion in capital to-date, including $1.26 billion in the third quarter. Included in those dispositions was the completion of the previously announced partial interest land sale at 1450 Owens and Mission Bay to a development JV partner for a land value of $324 per buildable foot. The sale of a portfolio of assets spanning the submarkets of South San Francisco and Greater Stanford for a 5.2% cash cap rate. A one-off asset along the I-15 corridor for a 5.3% cap rate, two assets on Carol Road and Sereno Mesa for a 4.6% cap rate, a partial interest sale of a campus in Sereno Mesa for a 4.6% cap rate and the partial interest sale of a high-quality asset in Merryfield Row and Torrey Pines for a 4.1% cap rate. The low five cap rates achieved in the San Francisco portfolio and the I-15 sale in San Diego are indicative of the age of the assets. Still attractive workhorse assets, they do not reflect the higher end profile of our core. The strong sub-five cap rates for the partial interest sale of the Summers Ridge campus and the Carol Road assets are more representative of our asset base. The Merryfield Row asset is purpose-built lab by Alexandria and like many of our other purpose-built assets is one of the best located and most attractive asset and its submarket. In this case, Torrey Pines. The 4.1% cap rate was influenced by the growth in rents in Torrey Pines since the lease was signed, but the lease is almost 12-years of term remaining before that upside can be realized. So it\u2019s quality and location really drove the value. I\u2019d also like to note that the scarcity value we talk about being a driver for keeping our cap rates lower relative to other product types can be seen in transactions by others. Just last month, Biogen completed a sale leaseback in Cambridge for $2,185 price per square foot value and the Carlyle Group sold a 77,000 square foot Blackstone Science Square building in Mid-Cambridge for a 4.1% cap rate at a price just short of $2,000 per square foot. As the Fed continues to pull levers to battle inflation, we expect we will see cap rates move up, but much less on a relative to other product types and thus, we remain well positioned to fund our value creation pipeline efficiently and at a relatively attractive pricing by harvesting our value creation among other sources. With that, I\u2019ll pass the call over to Dean. Just we have a number of properties on the docket to do the same thing, too. We\u2019re recycling capital, putting it back into great projects we have in our value creation pipeline. So it was efficient capital to harvest and reinvest. Joel, are you taking that? Yes. I\u2019d agree with that and as it consistent with my comments, I would say it\u2019s a normalized rate that corresponds to the last few years if you take out 2021, which was an outlier. But it\u2019s broad. And it\u2019s still, we\u2019ve talking about it for a while how all of our clusters have been doing well that continues to be the case. We\u2019ve had a consistent buyer pool and all of our activities over the last few years. We generally try to keep it limited. We don\u2019t want to disperse too much information to a broad audience. And those players have continued to show up for our deals and it has resulted in the cap rates. So, on an unlevered IRR basis, yes, I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s higher than it was. I know in the peak times people were underwriting to a 5 or less. I can\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re doing today, but obviously it\u2019s gone up. But with our product type, the rental growth, you can pay a 4 something cap rate. And with the annual increases in our leases and with market rent growth, you can exceed 6%, 7% pretty easily on an unlevered basis these days. Yes. And this is Peter. You should harken back to Hallie\u2019s comments in the beginning, where she talked about the fact that it takes, on average, about 10 years to get something to the clinic. So demand for life science real estate is much more inelastic and can\u2019t necessarily be varied due to current macroeconomic conditions. The companies need to continue to press on to get their revenue-producing project to market. We look \u2013 we did a look back to the great financial crisis a little while ago and noticed that the change in occupancy from the start to the end was negligible. I think it was maybe a 40 basis point swing at the trough. So our business is extremely resilient and it needs to be \u2013 or just because of the industry\u2019s profile, it will continue to be, nothing\u2019s changed from that aspect. Yes, I mean, supply continues to be tight. So as new opportunities come about we are \u2013 we have continued to increase rents. We\u2019ve \u2013 and what we typically, even in our new developments as we lease them up, that they do tick up a percent or two over time. So I guess macro wise, without trying to predict what the actual percentages are, they are still increasing at this point in time and we don\u2019t see any evidence that that\u2019s going to slow down. Yes, and we have been receiving some anecdotes of projects that were on the radar that are not going to happen. Even a couple that started construction that paused, I mean, I talked about cost escalations in my prepared remarks, and they continue to wreak havoc and go into a lot of percentages because I didn\u2019t want to talk for 20 minutes. But just year-over-year from Q2 2021, I\u2019m sorry, Q3 2021 to Q3 2022, they were about 13.5%. So it has just become very expensive and I think that\u2019s giving a lot of sobering up a lot of people that were ready to jump in and try to get involved. So we don\u2019t expect there to be a huge supply problem in any of our markets. From what we see under construction it looks to be a fairly normal rate in a normal environment at this point. And as long as that continues everyone\u2019s being rational. We should continue to see good rent growth, not 2021 rent growth, but not the hockey stick that we experienced that Joel referenced. But good, and usually over time, we\u2019ve exceeded inflation. And I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re going to do that now with the inflation numbers, but as soon as inflation normalizes, I would imagine that we would continue to exceed it. Yes. I also think you have to pay attention to the time we\u2019re in. So I think tenants are given today\u2019s inflationary spiral and kind of what\u2019s going on broadly. I think tenants are maybe somewhat, it depends on the size, the nature and so forth. Bigger tenants are more attuned to this, but I think a little less attuned to sustainability today and more focused on the recruitment, retention and return of their workforce. And then also recognizing that if you just read any number of articles on China\u2019s major ramp up of coal-fired plants and coal use and certainly in India too, it\u2019s pretty clear by scientists almost no matter what we do here in the United States, until that part of the equation is solved for the Planet Earth these, these measures aren\u2019t going to make a difference in global warming. Yes. Leap on that."

            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome everybody to the Alexandria\u2019s third quarter earnings call. With me today are Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga and Hallie Kuhn. First of all, thank you to our Alexandria family team for their continued exceptionalism in the phase of a challenging macro environment, mostly self-inflicted by a really deleterious set of government actions and policies, coupled with the Fed, which has been slow to act. I think I would characterize third quarter is really an exceptional quarter and when you look at earnings in this challenging macro environment delivering 9.2% and 8.3% FFO per share growth for the third quarter and then 2022 year-to-date is really exceptional especially again given the size and scope of the company with almost 75 million square feet in its total asset base. I\u2019d say the health and resilience of the broad and diverse life science sector, the niche, which we pioneered, remains strong and there is a continuing strong R&D investment, Hallie will speak to this. But in general, we\u2019ve seen life science R&D funding in 2021 approaching almost $500 billion. I think the number is actually about $480 billion, which is astounding and $1.8 trillion since 2017, and we expect totals in 2022 to be very strong continuation of that. I think it\u2019s also important to recognize that the strong life science sector employment trends remain positive, and the core strength of the life science industry and our key cluster markets remains resilient and continuing strong. And I think the overwriting macro observation would be the long-term healthcare needs of this country certainly aren\u2019t going away. Innovation in medicine is really a national imperative and just look at the mental health problem across this country as one simple example. And as I\u2019ve said many times before, there are about 10,000 known diseases to human kind and really that we\u2019ve only addressed as a society about 10% with addressable therapies and very few real cures. Biotech, I think, remains resilient. Clinical data, regulatory updates and M&A can be idiosyncratic events that really are unaffected by economic trends, and Hallie will talk about that. I think demand continues very solidly for our high-quality and well-located assets, which are really powered by asset level operational excellence, second to none. Alexandria has the greatest knowledge, and I think this is a pretty unique experience and expertise by orders of magnitude with respect to life science real estate niche, which we created and informed by our over 1,000 client tenants were 87%, an important number to remember, of our leasing comes from. We have a level of knowledge and understanding of the true life science real estate demand that just isn\u2019t out there if you hang a for lease sign and hire a broker. Alexandria continues to experience strong leasing spreads and rental rate increases. And I think we\u2019re very proud that we\u2019ve got 99.9% collections this quarter, truly stellar. Our industry-leading roster of the 1,000 tenants create drives and create stable long-term duration cash flows, and our high-quality and diverse industry mix is really unmatched. And I think one of the great stories of the day, I\u2019ll talk about in a moment, will be the balance sheet. But among industry-leading fundamental metrics for the third quarter, which are notable and Dean will talk about some of the details there, are a 10.6% same-store NOI growth increasing over the last few years and the significant strategic value creation harvesting of over $2 billion, which Peter will detail. And I think something we\u2019re very proud of having lived through the 2008, 2009, really financial crisis. And with this team steering the ship as an unrated REIT in those days, today we have matured and really have a fabulous fortress balance sheet. We\u2019ve worked very hard to put together over many years. I think it\u2019s important to note Alexandria out of 127 REITs as of June 30th has the second best debt maturity profile of all of them, and that\u2019s pretty amazing. Dean will highlight our liquidity of over $6 billion. And I think we were both, I think, strategically informed and I think executionally aware when we timely executed both equity and debt transactions in both January and February of 2022 earlier this year before the Ukraine invasion. And again, almost coming to the end of my comments, the strong and flexible balance sheet in addition to, I think, fabulous liquidity, our remaining debt term is over 13 years. Our average weighted average interest rate is about 3.5% and we\u2019ve got almost 96% of our debt, which is fixed rate and again no debt maturities into 2025. And I think as many of you know and we\u2019re working on, we are crafting a well-thought-through set of alternative plans for 2023, which we\u2019ll unveil at Investor Day. And as you look out at the world today and you just look at what happened at the PRC meeting this past week, where the President actually had his former person who turned over the reins of power to him kind of ushered out a little bit in front of the entire party Congress there. It creates the impression that we might not only have a ground war in Europe, but we might have a friction over Taiwan in a kinetic sense. And so that\u2019s something to think about. And so we\u2019re planning hard about all eventual outcomes that could be very significant black swan events to the United States of America. So with that, let me turn it over to Hallie. Thanks, Dean. And if we could go to questions, please? Well, and I think one of the other things is we have some fabulously large opportunities up on the Mesa and Torrey Pines, two very large-scale development sites that we\u2019re working on. And so we have no shortage of Class A opportunities in the best submarket in San Diego. Could you repeat the question? Yes. I think we\u2019ll \u2013 if you\u2019ll hold your question to Investor Day, I think we\u2019ll be able to give you a very good view of that. And I think we have an interesting set of alternative plans given what may unfold in 2023, given how we think about Plan A, Plan B and Plan C that might unfold out in the general economy. But I think it\u2019s fair to say and Dean can comment where we have very strong leasing opportunities, we\u2019ll clearly look for ways to accelerate those opportunities and fund them carefully with the best sources of capital. But Dean, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment any further. I think we wait until Investor Day to give you a eyeballs view of that. Yes. So Dean, do you want to comment on that? Yes. I mean, Tony, the one thing to think about what Dean just discussed about yields, how that bears on our decision-making is useful to think about our decision not to go forward with that specific project. So that clearly is \u2013 weighs on our decision to go or not to go in every single case. Yes. So this is Joel. Hey Steve and welcome back. I think we\u2019d like not to answer that question at a granular level. I think it\u2019s pretty proprietary and as we said, 87% of our leases this quarter, for example, came from our tenant base. And I think it would not be useful for us to go into granular detail on that. But I can tell you and Peter can comment broadly demand is solid in all of our markets at the moment. Yes, and I would add a gloss on that, Steve. Think about what both Hallie and I said this is not a \u2013 these are episodic \u2013 this is an episodic industry, so to speak, not really driven macroeconomically. And so demand often is generated by clinical data readouts, regulatory readouts and updates and sometimes M&A where somebody buys a company and then wants to expand. We\u2019ve seen that. We\u2019ve seen it on the other hand where they may buy a company and roll it up, but oftentimes companies are bought for their talent unless you\u2019ve got a kind of just a product opportunity. So I think that\u2019s how you have to think about it. Yes. Thanks, Steve. Yes, so maybe I\u2019ll comment generally and ask Hallie to also comment. I think Rich I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see any blockbuster M&A deals big company to big company or even big company to moderate size companies that impact what is perceived to be some competitive situation in a therapeutic class. The FTC I think under this administration has been fairly hostile to almost every kind in every industry get together because they claim it\u2019s always not competitive or it diminishes competition, somehow increased prices. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve seen this play out a little bit with Illumina and GRAIL, and GRAIL was spun out of Illumina, so none of that makes particular sense. But I think it\u2019s fair to say we will see and I think Hallie mentioned this and continue to see, we just saw recently Lilly just bought a bolt-on acquisition of a hearing loss company. I think you\u2019re going to continue to see a range of bolt-on acquisitions for product opportunities. And I think sometimes it\u2019s going to be a positive, sometimes it may not be. But overall, historically, if we look back at our 25 years of public company, it\u2019s been generally pretty positive for us. But Hallie, any other thoughts you have? Thanks, Rich. It\u2019s hard to hear you. So could you maybe speak closer to the mic? Oh, perfect. Well, that\u2019s a complicated question. I\u2019m not sure we have the time or ability on this call to go in market-by-market, not sure we want to do it. But I mean, I think if you look at New York as a great example. We\u2019ve pioneered the first commercial life science center and campus in New York City. There\u2019s millions and millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of square feet, and there are a number of projects that are being worked on there. The demand has been fairly modest. It\u2019s early stage. And it\u2019s pretty clear that literally almost most buildings in New York can\u2019t be converted from office to laboratory and probably wouldn\u2019t want to be given the market. So, I think you have to look at that on a submarket-by-submarket basis. I don\u2019t even think you could look at it as an overall market-by-market basis. And we know from Boston, there have been a handful of conversions. We know, in particular, a recent case downtown, where somebody kind of jury-rigged an office building, brought in some smaller tenants, and we know the smaller tenants have experience both for the developer who\u2019s never done it before and the tenant massive cost overruns on that conversion. So \u2013 but as I say, just look at, again, 87% of our leases come from our existing tenants, we feel very good about our ability to continue to generate steady demand in these markets. And we\u2019ve been through the cycles. We are through the cycle in 2000, 2001, the big tech up bus bubble, if you will, and 2008 and 2009 with a big financial crisis. So, we\u2019re fully prepared and I think our portfolio or asset base really is in great shape. Yes. So, we\u2019ve been very protected. I don\u2019t know, Hallie, do you want to comment on that? Because you\u2019ve had a number of conversations about the health of the \u2013 and the diversity of our tenant base and the credit quality. Yes. Thank you. Yes, so Peter, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment. I think, we\u2019re still seeing rent growth in almost not necessarily all of our markets, but in almost all of our markets. It certainly won\u2019t keep pace with the hockey puck growth that you\u2019ve seen over the last year or two, the kind of COVID years. But I think it remains, I mean, just look at the numbers we posted this quarter and last quarter was an indication of kind of where things are and how they look like they\u2019re kind of settling out on a normal run rate. But Peter, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment macro. Yes, and I think, again, you have to look at that question really almost has to be asked submarket-by-submarket, not market-by-market, Dave. What goes on in Cambridge is going to be far different than what goes on in Somerville, for example. Yes. But again, you have to take that supply issue submarket-by-submarket again, what supply might be in Cambridge versus what it might be in Somerville. It\u2019s talking about like night and day out a handful of years. So you have to think about, you can\u2019t generalize even do a market about supply, but it\u2019s pretty clear in addition to I think the important points Peter raised about either capital pausing or operators pausing. I think it\u2019s pretty clear cities are having and other jurisdictions, it\u2019s just tougher to get things approved, they\u2019re requiring more concessions. Residential is becoming a big \u2013 a big issue. We know in some jurisdictions if you don\u2019t have a resi as part of your project you\u2019re in a long line. If you have it, you may go to the head of the line. So a lot of dynamics now on a national basis that are I think changing and that will be a good check on supply. Yes. Yes. Go ahead. Yes. Well, I would refer you to and a good question to our September 12th press release where we talked about a range of issues in New York. New York is a very complicated market. It still remains a small company market. I\u2019ll come back to that initiative in a moment. Probably 250,000 square foot of lease \u2013 actual leasing last year. So that\u2019s a very small market. We started that market. There were literally only two commercial companies in New York doing research when we started, today the number approaches 75, 80 or more, but it\u2019s a slow growth. It\u2019s gestation period is 25 years or more. We\u2019re 12 years into it. So the market is not going to be grown by any supply. It\u2019s going to be grown by capital helping create companies. That\u2019s the only way that market is going to grow. You\u2019re not going to have big farmers like they\u2019re doing, like we signed these two leases a quarter or two ago with Lilly in Boston and BMS, Bristol Myers and San Diego. You\u2019ll never see that in New York because of the just the nature of the topography and geography there. You\u2019ve got very high tax burden and you\u2019ve got some safety issues going on now that hopefully maybe the Governor and others will wake up to. But it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of market it is. It\u2019s a small company market, it\u2019s a great place, but it\u2019s different than every other market. It\u2019s unique compared to all the other clusters. With respect to the State and City effort in Kips Bay there, it\u2019s a pretty broad and deep effort. Much of it is institutional and governmentally driven. There is a, a thought of building or a plan to build a tower in that area, but probably to get, go through the land use approvals will take two plus years and then go through an RFP process and then the development process it\u2019s maybe a decade away. But I think what\u2019s really needed is company creation there to really continue to foster the demand. And that\u2019s kind of, I mean, we know that market because we literally help create that market so that that\u2019s the state of play there. Well, those are I mean, I think it\u2019s good anytime you can continue to build infrastructure for institutions and governmental bodies that are doing research or developing. Part of that is health care delivery services which we\u2019re not involved with. So those are all good things. That\u2019s the East Side Medical Corridor really at its best. We\u2019re anchored between Bellevue and NYU and that\u2019s why we chose that site when we responded to the RFP by Mayor Bloomberg. But I think it\u2019s fair to say what really is needed is capital and company formation because that will be the lifeblood that will really grow that market over time. And what we\u2019ve helped grow it over the last 12 years. That\u2019s what it\u2019s been. Well, I think as Hallie said, there\u2019s been an all-time high venture fund capital raise this year, and that is kind of invested sprinkled out over a three, four, five maybe even longer time period. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that great companies with great technology, high unmet medical needs, protected IP, good IP, just really smart people at the scientific helm and the business helm will generally always attract capital. I mean, we invested in Alnylam back in 2003 when it was a startup company because we felt that RNAi had great promise, but it took 15 to 20 years to prove, but it was a great investment. That company has gone on to do great things and has a huge footprint in Cambridge. And then in 2013, which again was before the bull market started to happen, we took an early investment in Moderna and everybody knows the story there. So sometimes down markets as things are, valuations are better, and they give you interesting opportunities that really are focused on totally, I would say, groundbreaking technologies that may create tremendous opportunities for shots on goal on so many of the diseases that we\u2019re all suffering from. So \u2013 that\u2019s how we look at it. So yes, good time to invest. Yep, thank you. Yes. So Dean? Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll ask Dean to comment, but one thing to keep in mind, there\u2019s an existing lease with a credit tenant but Dean? Well, we\u2019ll make it quick. Thank you and stay safe everybody."

            "name": "Hallie Kuhn",
            "content": "Thanks, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. As Joel mentioned, today, I\u2019m going to provide an update on the life science fundamentals driving the long-term growth of the industry, tenant health and how Alexandria proactively work with the vanguard of this highly dynamic industry and a challenging macro environment to continue to grow our one-of-a-kind and truly world-class company. First and foremost, while we are in a cyclical downturn, innovative medicines take on average over 10 years to develop, meaning that the life science industry is not cyclical, but is largely event and product driven. And the life science industry is still in its early innings and poised for growth. As the recent expansion of complex modalities such as cell, gene and RNA-based therapies reflect, the pursuit for new and better medicines is truly the growth industry of this century, and there still remains immense challenges to solve. Every day in the U.S., an approximate 1,670 people will pass away from cancer, every four minutes today an individual will die from a stroke and every 37 seconds someone will pass away from heart disease. Not to mention, the 90% of known diseases that have no available treatment. While the macro market conditions are not to be taken lightly, the life science industry is on a steep, long-term growth trajectory. So where do the fundamentals stand to drive and sustain this long-term growth? I\u2019ll start by walking through the multiple sources of life science funding. Notably, through the third quarter of 2022, venture capital funds have raised an all-time high of $149 billion, eclipsing 2021\u2019s historic year with $144 billion raised. Given the average funds investment period is four to five years, the significant amount of dry powder will continue to translate into well-funded private biotech companies for years to come. Companies with the most innovative technologies and experienced founders and management teams continue to successfully raise capital, and we continue to see healthy demand across this segment. Moving on to the equity markets, while the IPO window largely remains closed, the market is responding positively to meaningful data readouts. As an example, two tenants in our San Francisco Bay Area region recently announced positive Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 clinical data, sending shares up 60% and 70% respectively. And just as a reminder, within the public biotech tenant category, the majority of our ARR comes from tenants with marketed products, including many large cap tenants with strong balance sheets such as Vertex and Moderna. Next, large pharma continues to outperform the broader markets with significant cash on hand to put towards internal growth and external M&A and partnerships, which is critical for biopharma as it looks to backfill their pipeline with innovative, new products. Biopharma R&D spend totaled $262 billion in 2021 with the top 20 biopharma putting on average over 20% of revenues back into R&D. Notably, at the end of the third quarter 17 out of the top 20 biopharma where Alexandria Tenants. A stat as of today has increased to 18 of the top 20 biopharma. While M&A has largely focused on bolt-on acquisitions, partnerships continue to be an important source of non-dilutive funding for private and small-to-mid bio cap companies. With respect to government funding, the NIH budget continues to increase year-over-year with broad by bipartisan support. The proposed 2023 budget is $49 billion, a 9% increase over 2022. This space total does not include an additional $12.1 billion proposed for pandemic preparedness and an additional $1.3 billion for program evaluation, which would bring the total NIH budget for 2023 to $62.5 billion. With respect to notable clinical and regulatory developments, this quarter saw critical late-stage clinical readouts and an accelerated approval for indications in schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s and ALS, all of which are devastating diseases with limited treatment options. Tenant BioNTech also published promising early clinical data, demonstrating their novel mRNA therapies can train the body\u2019s immune system to identify and kill cancer cells. A testament to the opportunity of mRNA technology beyond COVID vaccines. On the regulatory front, the FDA continues to approve new therapies at a sustained pace, including 28 new drug approvals from the FDA\u2019s drug division, CDER, this year. The FDA\u2019s Biologic Division, CBER, approved two gene therapies just this quarter, increasing the total U.S. gene therapy approvals from two to four, and there are an astounding 500 cell and gene therapies in clinical development. The fundamentals remain strong amidst the backdrop of a volatile and uncertain economic conditions. Switching to tenant health, as our 99.9%, 3Q collections and historic tenure occupancy of 96% at test, our asset base is in a great position. As you can see on Page 17 of our sup., our life science tenant roster is diverse spanning multinational pharma, life science product service and devices, public and private biotech and institutions, and benchmarking ARE to just one of these segments does not capture the strength and depth of our asset base. Critically, maintaining the health of our over a 1,000 industry-leading tenant roster is not a static process, but a highly proactive effort that incorporates our deep understanding of the life science fundamentals, intimate knowledge of our tenants\u2019 work, preexisting relationships, and a dedicated and passionate team focused on best-in-class operational excellence. Our job is to engineer outcomes. This work comes in many shapes and sizes, whether it\u2019s creatively utilizing our over 40 million square feet operating asset base to provide critical space to accompany ahead of a future delivery or swapping a good but perhaps stagnant tenant with a fast growing tenant and taking advantage of the nearly 30% mark-to-market rental increases across our asset base, all with the goal of continued optimization of leases to innovative high credit tenants. I\u2019ll leave you with a quote from David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, who we had the pleasure of hosting, for not one, but indeed two ribbon cuttings celebrating new Eli Lilly spaces at Alexandria properties just last week. In regards to the life science industry, he said, the games for winners are bigger than ever. Being nimble, fast and attuned to the outside world and having the right people, all these basics matter more than ever. Indeed, this is a sentiment that applies broadly beyond the life science industry and is one we hold deeply at Alexandria. With that, I will pass it off to Peter. Yes, I agree with everything you mentioned, Joel. And maybe just to say that depending on the company and the outcome, it\u2019s positive for the ecosystem whether or not there\u2019s a real estate outcome. Thinking about some of the bolt-on acquisitions where it really is product driven, we see those executives go off to start new companies. We have deep existing relationships with them. They often go on to establish and grow their next large biotech. So in the long run, these events are positive for the ecosystem. There are a number of examples where M&A over the years has led to really sizable footprints. BMS in San Diego is a great example of that over time with their acquisition of Signal about two decades ago, and then Celgene. And then as you saw in the first quarter this year, we announced their 420,000 square foot in development with us in San Diego. So over time, the acquisitions definitely can lead to additional space needs, but it\u2019s very dependent on the type of acquisition. And again, the overall net positive for the ecosystem is really great as investors go to put their returns to work in terms of new companies and founders go off to start new endeavors as well. Yes, absolutely. So, I direct you to look at Page 17 of our supplemental, which has a breakdown by ARR of our business types across the life science industry. And as we\u2019d like to stress on other calls, small and mid-cap is a very small percentage of our overall tenant base. And what we\u2019ve done as well in the past two quarters has broken down our public biotech segment by marketed products versus preclinical and clinical products. And as you can see, the majority are marketed. And these are, as mentioned on the call, there\u2019s companies like Vertex, Moderna folks with incredibly large balance sheets and cash to deploy. It\u2019s important to know that our team and our diligence process is truly unique. We have a number of folks, including myself, with PhD backgrounds across the biotechnology space that significantly underwrite these companies, understand what their risk profile is, what their opportunity and growth profile are and then monitor them extensively as they progress. So all things put together, we have a really strong set of companies across all of our different business types, which collectively reflect the strength of our asset base."

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Dean here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team delivered on truly remarkable results for both the three and nine months ended September 30. Total revenues were up 20.5% and 24.8% for the three and nine months of 2022 in comparison to 2021. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the three and nine months was $2.13 and $6.28, up 9.2%, 8.3% over 2021 and importantly, beat consensus. The strong financial and operating results reflect the strength of our brand, our scale, high quality and well-located properties and operational excellence, serving the mission-critical needs of some of the most innovative entities in the world. Congratulations to our entire team for truly outstanding executions over many quarters. This really stands out within the REIT industry, especially during this very challenging macro environment. Our strong balance sheet and liquidity management highlights truly awesome execution by our team over many years. Our team is very pleased to have earned our corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry. We are also very pleased to have further improved the strength of our balance sheet in the third quarter with a significant increase in liquidity. We completed an amendment to our line of credit, increasing aggregate commitments to $4 billion, up $1 billion over the prior credit facility. A huge thank you to our important lending relationships for providing significant liquidity for our company. Our total liquidity as of September 30 is now very significant at $6.4 billion. We are one of the very few REITs with no debt maturities until 2025. 96% of our outstanding debt represents long-term fixed rate debt and the percentage of fixed rate debt is expected to be even higher by the end of the year. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA is on track to hit our 5.1 times target by year-end. Our total outstanding debt has a weighted average rate of 3.52% and a weighted average maturity of 13.2 years. The execution of our capital plan this year was exceptional given the macro environment. We did $1.8 billion of 12 and 30-year bonds with a weighted average rate of 3.28% in a term of 22 years, which was completed in February. Most of our common equity for 2022 was completed in the first quarter and entirely completed by June 30. And then we turn to continued execution of our strategic value harvesting through outright sales and partial interest sales of real estate. Through September 30, we\u2019ve completed $2.2 billion in sales, including $1 billion in the third quarter with gains or consideration in excess of book value of $1.2 billion, which is really significant value creation. Now, our focus on real estate dispositions for 2022 leaves us with an advantage at year-end with about $250 million of cash that will reduce our debt needs for 2023. As we look forward, we will remain disciplined and careful with our allocation of capital. Briefly on dividends, our Board has been consistent over the past decade with growth in common stock dividends year-to-year, supported by strong growth in cash flows and our low FFO payout ratio, which is generally in the range of 55% to 60%. Cash flows from operating activities after dividends are projected at the mid-point to be about $300 million for 2022, and to put this into perspective, over an approximate three-year period, this represents approximately $1 billion for reinvestment. Now ARE pioneered our favorable lease structure with contractual annual escalations approximately 3%, triple net leases that provide for the recovery of operating expenses and the recovery of major capital expenditures. Now, our team also curated a tenant roster of high-quality tenants, including 49% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade and large-cap publicly traded entities. Occupancy is up 30 basis points since the beginning of the year and is expected to continue to increase by year-end, highlighting the strength of our brand and trusted partnership with our tenants. EBITDA margins 69% really reflects the operational excellence and operating efficiency of our business, and this also represents an industry-leading statistic. Leasing was very solid in the third quarter at 1.7 million rentable square feet with rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing a space of 27.1% and 22.6% on a cash basis. TIs and leasing commissions on lease renewals and re-leasing the space for the nine months were down about 20% in comparison to the full year of 2021. And the third quarter included two long-term lease extensions of roughly 10 years with a 47% increase in net effective rent. Now, excluding these two long-term lease extensions with somewhat elevated TIs and leasing commissions in the third quarter, TIs and leasing commissions would have been relatively minor at approximately $25 per square foot. Same-property NOI growth has been very strong for the nine months ended September 30 at 7% and 8.9% on a cash basis. And to put this into perspective, our 10-year average same-property NOI growth was 3.6% and 6.6% on a cash basis. The outperformance in 2022 relative to this 10-year average was driven primarily by 110 basis point year-to-date growth in occupancy with about a 2 times benefit to net operating income. And then really outsized benefit from significant early lease renewals that commenced very early in 2022, providing for a full year benefit this year. Now, we continue to make excellent progress on leasing. Contractual lease expirations for 2023 represents only 6.6% of annual rental revenue down from 9% as of the second quarter. Now importantly, 2023 contractual lease expirations representing only 70% or 4.6% of our annual rental revenue remains in the category of too early to tell, meaning not already leased, not under negotiation or not targeted for redevelopment. Turning to venture investments. These investments have generated consistent gains averaging about $25.4 million, which is included in FFO as adjusted over the last eight quarters. This is very solid and very consistent. Now, it\u2019s important to highlight that on average over the last six years, only \u2013 about only 30% of the realized gains included in FFO were generated from our investments in publicly traded securities, 70% were generated from investments in privately held entities. Gross unrealized gains as of September 30 were $529 million, including $102 million and $427 million from publicly traded and privately held entities respectively. Lastly on guidance, we updated our guidance for 2022 and narrowed the range for EPS and FFO per share from a range of $0.06 or range of $0.02 per share. Our 2022 guidance for EPS diluted is a range of $5.70 to $5.72 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted is a range from $8.40 to $8.42 with no change in the mid-point of $8.41. As a reminder, we are about four weeks away from the issuance of our detailed guidance for 2023. And therefore, we are unable to comment on details for 2023. With that, let me turn it back to Joel. Yes, I think what I would just add to Joel\u2019s comments is that we sit in a pretty unique position. We have the benefit of some of the best located land parcels for life science use in these core cluster markets and really positioned from the standpoint of optionality is the best way of thinking about it. Meaning, we have the tenant roster that, as Joel mentioned, 87% of our leasing activity comes from. We have the land sites. So we really have the option to meet the demand. So we have that flexibility. And so I think that\u2019s the best way of thinking about our pipeline. It gives us options. We don\u2019t have to address it, but it gives us plenty of options. Sure. It\u2019s Dean here. So as you know, the disclosures we had about a little bit more than $38 million in impairment charges. It was primarily related to 1 project that which we no longer chose to proceed forward with. It was a development project, about 600,000 rentable square feet. The parcel was located in California. We did not own the land. We had pretty significant cost incurred, but it was really our investment to date, which was significantly related to the entitlement work for the site. And the reason for not moving forward with the project was very specific to the financial outlook for the project. There was no lease, re-lease negotiation related to the project to be clear. And beyond that, I guess, we\u2019re not in a position to comment much further on the project. But as you\u2019ve heard from us on this call and over the last several quarters, it\u2019s really important to keep in perspective that we did lease about 2.7 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment space just in the first three quarters of 2022. So it\u2019s very specific to the project. Yes. By and large, they\u2019re getting close to being locked up in the sense of \u2013 as you go through a lease negotiation and execute a lease, both sides of the relationship landlord and tenant will work through a fairly detailed budget. Once the lease is executed, the tenant moves forward their side to refine their cost estimates as they get into really the details. So big picture, we have a sense of the yields. The exact yields will be refined as the tenant finalizes the extreme details of their build-out. And then on the cost side, as you\u2019ve heard from us for many quarters now, we do build in contingencies to protect us from construction cost escalations. And as we usually do, we\u2019ll make disclosures of those yields as soon as we can. And generally, that time line is consistent with once the tenant finalizes the details of their project design. So it usually lags disclosures of lease-up. But I think the important thing to recognize is we had no changes in cost at completion for any of our projects on an unfavorable \u2013 from an unfavorable perspective nor on yields. We did have one project that had an increase in cost at completion, but it corresponded with a pretty significant increase in revenue as well. So we\u2019re generating for solid return on the incremental capital. So our team has done a tremendous job managing costs in a very unusual environment when you have to consider supply chain considerations and just continued escalations in construction costs. I think it\u2019s tough, Tony, to speculate about yields on a specific project because every project is very unique, the location, the nature of the build, the complexity of the build and specifically the back and forth negotiation with our relationship tenants. I would say, generally speaking, we\u2019ll do the best we can to push yields in the right direction upwards by managing our construction costs carefully looking for opportunities to become more efficient, but that\u2019s not a simple task as we all know, you can\u2019t just cut cost. You have to do that very carefully. And hopefully, the rental rate environment continues to support upward movement in that direction, which would translate hopefully into ongoing upward direction in returns or yields. But Tony, just I don\u2019t want to speculate specifically. Every deal is very unique, and we\u2019ll take those decisions incrementally when they do come up. Generally, it\u2019s the original cost, Tony, unless for some reason, over the years, we\u2019ve taken a write-down, which is a realized loss, i.e., in impairment. But traditionally, it\u2019s against the \u2013 more often than not, it\u2019s against our original cost basis, Tony. And I would also just point out that the key drivers between or around realized gains in our venture portfolio is really driven by liquidity events. So they\u2019re natural events. Occasionally on the public side, which is only about 30% of our gains historically over the last six years, I mean, we ultimately sell a handful of public securities and that\u2019s what ultimately drives some of the gains on the public side. But it\u2019s a small piece of the overall mix on average. Hey Dave, it\u2019s Dean here. So, I guess as you acknowledge, we\u2019re going to get into the details of our plan for 2023 in about four weeks at Investor Day. Maybe some high-level thoughts on the capital plan that you\u2019re looking at on our active projects with a handful of projects that we\u2019ve committed in the near term that are leased. So, we have about 7.6 million square feet. It\u2019s 78% leased and this pipeline can generate $645 million of incremental net operating income, which is just spectacular. If you look at the most recent starts or the stuff that\u2019s pending to start near term, just call it some projects could take up to three years to finish. NOI will commence quarter-to-quarter, as you would expect, even starting next quarter on this pipeline. I highlighted earlier that if you look out over about a three-year period at our current run rate for cash flows from operating activities after dividends over three years, you\u2019ve got $1 billion to reinvest. Equity capital \u2013 equity type capital for our pipeline includes this \u2013 we probably are sitting on about $6.8 billion of equity type capital and it\u2019s this $1 billion of cash flows that I just mentioned, we had about 1.5 billion of outstanding forward equity contracts. And then obviously, our CIT [ph] related to just the $645 million of incremental NOI is all that stuff\u2019s broad equity type capital. Some of it\u2019s incurred, some of it\u2019s future cash flows. But if you look at that, some number approaching almost $7 billion that are typical leverage profile, assuming a five one year end target for net debt to adjusted EBITDA. This pipeline will generate probably 3.3 billion or something in that range of debt funding. That\u2019s roughly one third debt, two-thirds equity on a leverage neutral basis. So as the EBITDA starts to come online, you can fund quite a bit from a debt perspective as well. And so those are the numbers I would keep in mind broadly. We obviously continue to focus on real estate dispositions, given the strength of the private market values and the scarcity of our assets as Peter has been highlighting for a number of quarters. Obviously, over the next three years, each of the years or every year is very different. And therefore, the funding needs for each year will vary. Basically, there\u2019s different timing from commencement of NOI and construction spend in each of the years, but it\u2019s really important to point out that there is a path forward if we had to navigate a period without access to the capital markets. So call it, if the capital markets were shut for three years. And I think from a risk management perspective or team analyzes this every quarter. And we do find comfort in the results, obviously, this is clearly not an operating scenario we would expect for three years. And I call it, one bookend scenario that you must evaluate from a risk management perspective. So I don\u2019t want to get into specifics for 2023, but hopefully those broad strokes help you understand that. We\u2019re reasonably well positioned in a \u2013 to address a, what could become even more challenging environment. We look forward to presenting the details of our outlook for 2023 at our Investor Day in late November. It\u2019s Dean here. Yes, maybe 325 is a good example and I think the, the way to think about this is you do have some advantages when you do sustainability initiatives from the start. It\u2019s a lot more efficient. You can, I think that project incurred something around that 6% to 7% range of cost to really end up being able to describe it as becoming the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge. As you guys know, it\u2019s probably the most important and unique feature is taking advantage of geothermal energy for heating and cooling of the building, which along with other attributes of the design, allows us to eliminate almost all the fossil fuel consumption for the building. It\u2019s an important attribute for Moderna, the CEO emailed their team as soon as the lease was signed, literally as soon it was assigned and said, let\u2019s get moving and make this one of the coolest, most sustainable green buildings in Cambridge and so they were passionate about it. Most of our large pharma and big bio tenants have already publicly announced sustainability initiatives. So they do find it important. Like LEED was in the early days. LEED had a cost element to it that we all had to get our head around, and we did early on. We had the first core and shell LEED Certified Building and so we were a pioneer there and continuing to be a leader in sustainability here in lab buildings. Thanks Tom. So if you look at our guidance today, same property, call it the midpoint is 7% GAAP, 7.8% cash. And I think my commentary earlier highlighted we\u2019re at 7% for nine months on GAAP. So we\u2019re right on the midpoint today. And then we\u2019re at 8.9%, we\u2019re on the upper end on a cash basis. So we\u2019re at a good perspective for nine months. And I kind of highlighted the outlier drivers occupancy growth driving a 2x benefit to NOI. So we had 100 year-to-date for nine months, 110 basis point occupancy growth with a double impact, at least to NOI and then early lease renewals early, early in 2022, which was also driving the strength. So that\u2019s the backdrop. We\u2019ve got a good run rate for the nine months, which will carry us into a comfortable spot with our outlook for the full year. Look, I think the way to think about cap interest and interest expense; we don\u2019t change those numbers very often. The run rate that you\u2019ve seen for capped interest this year is probably reflective of the volume of construction activities in our business, which continue an upward trend at the moment, meaning capped interest probably on a quarterly basis, doesn\u2019t peak out until probably Q1 of 2023. So you\u2019re still on an upward trajectory as our \u2013 and that\u2019s just a pure function of what you would call construction in progress or the basis that\u2019s under construction, which drives the amount of capped interest. The interest rate drives it a little bit, but so much of our costs are fixed. There\u2019s very little variable cost for interest expense. So it\u2019s really just a function of spend quarter-to-quarter adding to CIP at a pace that\u2019s outpacing the deliveries which, as I mentioned earlier, will start to peak out here in the next quarter or two. Yes. I think that\u2019s the key concept. And I guess the other thing to keep in mind, Michael, there\u2019s always \u2013 it\u2019s interesting in the articles that you on any company. And most companies will choose not to comment specifically about articles in the press. As Joel mentioned, we do have a lease with a credit behind it. It\u2019s somewhere around 80,000 square feet in the Seaport market. But beyond that, we don\u2019t really have much to comment on."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaula Schwartz: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody. Thank you for joining Alexandria's second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Hallie Kuhn; Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. In a very challenging macroeconomic environment, for sure, we are very blessed and thankful to have a truly one-of-a-kind public company, which has a uniquely visionary mission to create and grow life science ecosystems and clusters that ignite and accelerate leading innovators to advance human health by curing disease, saving lives and vastly improving nutrition, our mission for sure. We at Alexandria have worked tirelessly to earn the trust and have carefully and meticulously constructed our client tenant base within our best-in-class asset base. In 1994, we uniquely set out to be the trusted lab space real estate partner for life science companies. Today, 28 years later, we have earned the trust of over 1,000 diversified high-quality companies who have chosen our brand and rely on us to deliver on our reputation. Daily, they entrust us with their most precious assets, their talent, thousands of hard-working science, technology and business professionals reliant on our lab space and on the life science ecosystems we cultivate to attract and retain the best talent to advance their science. We provide them with a truly inspirational and healthy place to work. Daily, they entrust us with billions and billions of dollars of research and development platforms to be safe, secure and operational. Daily, they entrust us to be aligned with their mission to partner together at the highest level of operational excellence to improve human health. In this market, our results really stand out in the macroeconomic environment we're all experiencing, a slowing economy, the weaken consumer, higher interest rates and ranging structural inflation. Huge congratulations to our Alexandria family on a great 2Q '22 report. As Dean will talk about in a while, we've updated guidance for the second quarter to $8.41, FFO per share, representing an almost 8.5% growth for this year and combined with a 3% plus dividend. We think that's an excellent combination of 11.5% in this macroeconomic environment. We've experienced very powerful continuing rental rate increases and leasing activity. It's important to remember, 87% of our existing -- of our leasing comes from our existing tenants. We have uniquely crafted our own demand driver in our more than 1,000 tenants and 92% of the first half of 2022 leasing comes from this tenant base. 2.3 million square feet were signed in the second quarter, a third all-time high. with cash all-time high of 34% rental rate increase, highest ever, and a 45% GAAP rental rate, truly epic and historic. And then keep in mind, 50% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or big-cap companies -- public companies, and 80% of our tenants are not private or development-stage biotech companies. Peter will discuss in detail our outstanding progress in capital recycling to the tune of about $0.5 billion in the second quarter as we harvest great value, which we have created over the last decade. He will also talk about strong external growth engine, which we fine-tuned in the new economic environment. Dean will discuss our fortress balance sheet and strong liquidity. More important now than ever with turbulent capital markets and fortunately, with our great team, we have no debt maturities until 2025. So no FFO dilution due to refinancings. Steve will discuss very strong internal growth and make sure to look at Page 33 of the supplement. And also Dean will mention the burn-off of free rent providing strong visibility for future growth. Our margin continued to be strong at 70%, and we're very proud of our tenant collections at 99.9%. So no real credit issues whatsoever. Hallie will speak to our awesome and non-replicable tenant base of over 1,000 tenants and the continuing health of the broader life science industry. The life science industry is not synonymous with simply early-stage biotech. Alexandria and its best-in-class tenant base is very well positioned and prepared for this shifting environment. With our best-in-class assets, decades-long relationship, we in fact, beat the so-called competitive product and much future theorized product, which will never be built. Last but not least, I want to make a couple of comments about Steve Richardson, our retiring Co-CEO. I want to express on behalf of all the extended family here at Alexandria a profound thank you for the last 22 years, the best ever. Your humble service leadership has set the bar for all of us. Queen Elizabeth recently talked about leadership at her birthday celebration in which -- and you exemplify these words precisely, finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration to work together. And if I may just finally make a quote from the famous movie Band of Brothers. Of course, it could be all genders, of course, and the Requiem For a Soldier, we're all one great Band of Brothers. And one day, you'll see we can live together when all the world is free, have you lived to see all you gave to me, you in fact have, you're shining dream of hope and love. We're all one great Band of Brothers. And with that, I want to turn it over to Hallie Kuhn.\nHallie Kuhn: Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science & Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to start by covering the bedrock of Alexandria's business. Specifically, as Joel mentioned, Alexandria's world-class and leading stable of over 1,000 tenants. As part of this review, I will cover the health of the life science industry and then pivot to a number of recent FDA approval that reflect the industry's collective drive to develop life-saving therapies. The life science industry is large, diverse and complex. Alexandria's tenant base reflects the diversity with over 1,000 tenants that span multinational pharma, public and private biotechnology companies, life science products such as enabling research tools and manufacturers of complex medicines and top-tier investment-grade companies and institutions. So let's break this down segment by segment, starting with multinational pharma. Alexandria is proud to call 17 of the top 20 biopharma companies our tenants, including BMS, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, Takeda, Merck and Pfizer, just to name a few. Looking at large cap focused indices such as the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceutical Index, you'll see that these companies continue to outperform broader indices, including the Dow, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Biopharma deployed over $200 billion into R&D in 2021 and the top 20 biopharma have an estimated $300 billion cash on hand to put towards M&A and partnerships as they look to bolster their pipelines with innovative new medicines. Next, public biotech companies. With small and mid-cap companies have gotten outsized focus over the past several months as indices such as the XBI have tumbled, this segment contains many of the most innovated and well-funded large-cap companies in the industry with names such as Alexandria tenants Alnylam and Vertex. Indeed, the majority of our ARR across public biotechnology companies is from those with marketed or approved products. Across pre-commercial companies, we have a deeply technical and experienced science and technology team that employs a rigorous underwriting and monitoring process to select the fastest-growing and most promising companies. Our over decade-long relationship with Moderna is a great example. Just three years ago, Moderna was in this pre-commercial category and is now a leading global commercial stage biotech. On to private biotechnology. While funding has slowed across all industries compared to 2021 due to macro market conditions, venture funds continue to raise historic levels of capital and deploy it at a sustained pace. $30 billion was deployed into private biotechnology companies in the first half of 2022 compared to a record-breaking $39 billion in the first half of 2021, and still up over 50% compared to the first half of 2019 and 2020. Indeed, companies like incoming New York and Bay Area tenant, Icon Therapeutics, with a stellar management team and highly differentiated platform recently raised over $0.5 billion. This is not to say that investment thesis haven't shifted. With downward pressure on valuations and are refocusing towards the most innovative companies with experienced management teams, but market resets are ultimately healthy for a sector in the long run as companies are forced to double down in their core strength and talent is diverted to the most promising applications. Now for life science products, services and devices. This diverse set of companies enables breakthrough research from the bench to bedside. It is the companies like Illumina developing cheaper, faster and more efficient research tools to understand the genetic underpinnings of disease. If company is identifying diseases at the earliest stages when treatments can be more effective, and it's the contract manufacturers producing complex medicines for next-gen therapies. As the picks and shovels, so to speak, of the industry, these companies' business models are not the same as those developing novel medicines with a quicker path to market and revenue. So while there is no simple index or measure that is a perfect proxy for the strength of our top-tier tenant base, from the beginning of the year through the second quarter, the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceutical Index, which captures many of our top 20 tenants, outperformed the Dow by 11 points, the NASDAQ by 25 points and the XBI by 29 points. Moreover, the life science industry is less cyclical than other industries as products are developed over a longer period with novel medicines taking an average 10 years from early development to commercialization. Developing new medicines is not easy and market dynamics aside, companies will experience challenges and even failures along the way. But with 1,000 tenants and over 87% of leasing stemming from preexisting relationships, our unique model and deeply experienced team positions us to proactively manage potential risks and bumps in the road. To end, I'd like to take a step back and acknowledge the mission-critical nature of the life science industry to our society. Each approval from the FDA marks the potential for a healthier, longer life for each of us listening on the call today and our loved ones. New therapies improve and extend quality of life, prevent costly hospitalizations and ultimately, reduce long-term health care costs. We are proud and humbled that as novel therapies approved by the FDA in 2022, half by Alexandria tenants, a stat that holds true for the past decade. Approvals from tenants this quarter include an RNA-based treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, a small molecule treating obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a first-in-class immunotherapy targeting metastatic melanoma. To paraphrase Roger Perlmutter, former CSO of Merck and the CEO of the previously mentioned Eikon Therapeutics, novel medicines can change the world and most have yet to be discovered. And with that, I'll pass it over to Steve.\nStephen Richardson: Thank you, Hallie. The second quarter of 2022 was an absolute blowout quarter in nearly every regard, the demand and really the intensity of the strong commitment to Alexandria's brand of highly differentiated mega campuses and operational excellence continue to provide for superior financial outperformance. I'd like to give a big shout out to the entirety of the Alexandria team as following the results are amongst the best in nearly every category. As Joel noted, Alexandria is truly a one of a kind company and hence definitively proven its ability to deliver excellent results throughout a wide array of macroeconomic condition. As we've discussed and Hallie referred to as well a number of times over many years, the companies in the life science industry have a long-term horizon for their pursuit and commercial life-saving and life changing novel medicines and therapies. Research and discovery in the laboratory, multi-stage clinical trials, commercial rollouts can and do take a decade or more. Alexandria's unique capabilities and team have successfully identified the most promising life science companies and ultimately attracted the world's leading investment-grade pharmaceutical and big biotech companies to it's mega-campuses in AAA locations adjacent to the country's leading research institutions. The second quarter exemplifies this powerful combination of trusted relationships with high-quality companies and their long-term horizons and some consider the following. 87% of the leasing activity overall was from Alexandria's existing relationship and absolutely essential and unique to Alexandria-only enabling success during turbulent macroeconomic quarters. And during Q2, 88% of the leasing activity in the development and redevelopment pipeline was from Alexandria's existing relationships. Consider how powerful that statement is for successfully growing the company's high-quality on-balance opportunities not only for a few quarters, but for many years. The stability and trusted nature with Alexandria has become a bedrock in value consideration for our tenants. And as the company has grown to more than 1,000 tenants this past year, this presents an exceptionally powerful competitive advantage for the company's future growth and a substantial barrier for others to be dabbling in a highly sophisticated and technical nature of mission critical life science real estate. Beyond the ground reality for Alexandria this quarter is a vigorous and highly productive effort from across the entire company. The leasing activity of approximately 2.3 million square feet is in the third-highest quarterly leasing volume in company history. Record rate increases with renewal leasing spreads of 45% GAAP, 44% cash represent the second highest and the highest rental rate growth in the company's history, respectively. The portfolio mark-to-market remains strong at approximately 7-point percent and as we noted in the last two quarterly calls this is significantly greater than the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of 2020 and in line with the end of 2021's 30.4%. Accounts receivable for the entire Q2 was a 100% including a 100% from our publicly traded biotech tenants and that continues as we've achieved 99.9% so far during July. Early renewals for this quarter were similar to Q1 at a rate of 50% of leasing, a strong validation again of the health of Alexandria's tenants and their long-term planning horizon that we noted at the start of my comments. We have exceptional health of our value creation pipeline with a total of more than 900,000 square feet of leasing which contributes to a highly de-risk nature of the pipeline as 78% of the 7.8 million square feet which is projected to generate $665 million of incremental revenue is leased or negotiating, and Peter will provide additional detail and color during his comments as well. Let's move on to supply and demand. Demand was consistent with the past two years with no significant drop in our quarters. We do see the demand in the market highly [technical difficulty] life science projects and end market, the actual each HVAC capacity, actual electric capacity, actual operational experience an operator might have [technical difficulty]. We continue to monitor supply at a very similar level, including the actual asset because differences between purpose built Class A facilities and Class B purpose-built we also look at the [technical difficulty] and if you look at capital sources they will actually the decision till we go forward [technical difficulty] the basis for this new [technical difficulty]. So let's build up the specific reality in the field and supply. Current vacancy rates continue to be very tight with [technical difficulty] in our core clusters, [technical difficulty] less than 1% [technical difficulty] which is generally consistent with market conditions during the past several quarters. There is not significant sub leases in the market which is in contrast [technical difficulty] and if they are of high quality, they are moved very quickly. As we look at 2022 the unleased new supply is adding very incrementally 1% to 2% of our key market, [technical difficulty] earlier comment on healthy demand. So we would expect to supply would be substantially leased by year-end. If we look ahead to '23, again we drill down on each and every project at our core markets and determine which projects are actually vertical and well underway. The unleased 2023 deliveries will be [technical difficulty] 3% to 5% availability to the total market size. And again, we expect these deliveries will be further reduced during the next six quarters. Beyond that, 2024 and beyond, we do closely monitor hand waving and flyers in the market that indicate creative tech space or life science space alternatives and as of today, we do not see any large disruptive set of Class A lab projects well underway in our core markets that are preparing to go vertical on a purely speculative basis. Ultimately, Alexandria has significant differentiation in the market and as I mentioned at the outset of my comments, this group new projects is only becoming more intensive and accelerating as companies need a trusted and eminently capable operator for the mission-critical operations. So we actually see the difference between Alexandria's Class A facilities as part of our fully-amenitized mega campuses and one-off buildings and commodity locations becoming more highly valued. So in conclusion, the first quarter of 2022 was a very strong quarter, and now the historic strength of the second quarter continues to definitively highlight Alexandria's positioned for the near term and the long-term. Life science companies intrinsically have a long-term horizon and their mission critical laboratory facilities are essential for their success. Alexandria has a combination of a tenant roster that has both a long-term horizon in high-quality investment-grade credit portends a very bright future for the company. And as this is my last earnings call with the announcement of my retirement, I want to say, it has been the honor of my life to work shoulder to shoulder with the entire Alexandria family at this one of a kind company. I have the highest regard and deep affection for this incredible team. Our unique culture of respect for one another, high expectations for one another and a passion for the company's mission is a rare blend that has enabled us to thrive and work as a trusted partner with one of the country's most strategic and choice industries. I also want to thank the broader investment community for your deep engagement and support for the company over these many years we worked with one another. And finally, it has been an exceptional privilege in particular to work so closely during the past 22-plus years with the team, an extraordinarily insightful and eminently capable leader, Peter, who is the ultimate Co-CEO, providing the heart and soul of the company and perfectly complementing my shortcomings with his formidable talents, and Joel, an inspirational leader, a genuine line of the industry and a once-in-a-generation Founder and American business. I have been truly blessed. And with that, I will hand it off with energy and enthusiasm to my brother Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thank you, Steve. I'd like to start by thanking you for teaching me so much about teamwork, managing people, operational excellence, the necessity of taking a deep breath every now and again, expanding my vocabulary and being a sounding board and confidante throughout our partnership. I started this Co-CEO relationship with alacrity. The use of that word is an example of your influence, and I was not disappointed. I will greatly miss our regular chats, but I'm glad you will be around when a good talk is needed. With that said, I'm going to update the audience on the progress being made on our value creation pipeline and related construction costs and supply chain trends then conclude with remarks on the dispositions completed this quarter. As Hallie referenced in her overview, our 1,000 plus tenant base is of the highest quality as it includes 17 of the 20 biopharma companies, the most innovative and well-funded large cap public biotech companies in the world and a stable full of the most promising and fastest growing private companies in the industry, which have been rigorously underwritten by a deeply technical and experienced team. This highly curated tenant base provides opportunities that have been consistently fueling our external growth for over a decade. And if you connect the dots, it's no coincidence that 87% of our leasing activity comes from it. The best companies are those that grow and we have grown along with them. The past quarter, we completed over 915,000 square feet of leasing in our development and redevelopment pipeline which aggregates to an excess of 2.3 million square feet for only half a year at a time when people are worried about the product type we invented, because others pretending to be equals are struggling with their tenant base. Our results in the wake of others struggling should tell you something. Life science real estate is not for everyone, success takes years of experience in designing and building the right product in the right location, deep relationships with the highest quality life science companies and company creators, operational excellence and most important during times like these, a very deep understanding of the industry. We delivered 375,394 square feet in the second quarter spread amongst six projects including the full deliveries of the 8 and 10 Davis, part of our Alexandria Center for Advanced Technologies in the Research Triangle, and 5505 Morehouse Drive in Sorrento Mesa. The weighted average yield of these delivered projects was a healthy 7.8% and they will contribute over $20.6 million in net operating income moving forward. The remainder of the pipeline that is either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next six quarters has decreased by approximately 200,000 square feet from last quarter, but is still projected to add more than $665 million in annual rental revenue over the same number of quarters reflecting higher revenue per square foot developed. As of quarter end, 78% of this remarkable pipeline was either leased or under negotiation, meaning we have an executed LOI with 95% of the activity year-to-date coming from existing relationships, reinforcing the quality of our tenant base given that this category of leasing is typically driven by consolidation necessitated by growth. It also highlights the extraordinary loyalty of our tenants and the trust we have earned through many years of high-quality service. I'm also pleased to report that despite continued volatility in construction costs and supply chain disruptions, our pro forma yields are neutral to slightly improving relative to last quarter and there have been no adjustments to our delivery timing. That is a good transition to our construction costs and supply chain update. The bad news first. There are still upward pressures on construction and material prices stemming from high energy costs and now labor costs are becoming a bigger issue than in the past. As the U.S. exports more natural gas to Europe, it becomes more expensive here, and one direct impact has been an increasing glazing costs of 20% to 40%. In addition to a 35% increase in aluminum over the past 12 months, glazing is impacted by the cost of natural gas as it's heavily used in its production. As mentioned last quarter, elevated diesel prices have a significant impact on construction costs as earthwork machinery runs on it and our contractors have been seeing fuel surcharges in the billings from these subs. Crude oil was up 71% from February '21 through February '22, and although pricing is slightly improved since then, it's not providing any significant relief. Other costs that continue to be overly elevated over the past quarter include construction machinery, which is doubled, Gypsum, which is up over 1500%, one of our contractors blames this on elevated housing construction, which uses about 50% of the supply, semiconductors are up 276% due to heavy demand by the automotive industry and switchgear and other industrial and electrical equipment is up 73% due partially to demand and partially to elevated cost of components that go into that equipment. Labor which accounts for approximately 60% to 70% of construction costs has been relatively stable over the past couple of years due to pre-arranged wage increases negotiated into labor agreements, but many of those are now up for renewal and negotiations are reported to be intense. Due to career changes for many in the industry after layoffs caused by COVID-19 work stoppages, there is a smaller pool of labor, and combined with the higher cost of living wages are expected to be much higher in the future. Supply chain issues remain despite improvements in transportation, mainly due to the war in Ukraine and a ripple effect from shortages in components. One of our surveyed contractors closely track supply chain related impacts to their jobs nationally and found that from September of 2020 through February 23 of this year, supply chain impacts averaged 5.89 per day. From the beginning of the war on February 24 through June 8 of this year, there have been 38.12 impacts per day. As a result, extraordinary lead times remain for equipment used in our product type, including generators, building controls, transformers, switchgear, electrical panels, air handlers and chillers, all of which have lead times that are double what they normally are, many exceeding a year. Much of the delay is due to a ripple effect of missing components, a generator can be 90% complete, but can take an additional six months to finish because of the missing component or two from a vendor with a huge backlog. The good news is that despite the shortage in skilled labor productivity is improving. Contractors are starting to see cancellations or projects being put on hold, lightening their backlogs, which will eventually reduce demand and ease, both pricing and supply chain problems. This can be seen in expected escalations from one of our major GCs who projects them to be 6% to 8% this year with a bias towards the longer end but a reduction to 4% to 5% in 2023. We continue to closely manage these conditions and approximately 80% of our cost for development and redevelopment projects under construction are subject to a guaranteed maximum or other contracts that enable us to mitigate the risk of inflation. We have contingencies behind those contracts to account for scope creep and unknowns, the other 20% is from projects that are currently pending guaranteed maximum contracts that are in process, and those projects include larger cost contingency allowances in their performance. Moving to our asset sales. Interest rates are certainly influencing real estate pricing broadly and we've been told by our investment brokers that they are seeing a 25-basis-point widening and other hot product types such as industrial. So we may see it with lab office assets as well. It is certainly reasonable expect that may happen, but we do believe that the scarcity of well-located Class A lab office assets will help mitigate that. You can certainly find industrial product almost anywhere, but for sale Class A lab product is still very hard to find. So despite the increasing interest rate environment, there continues to be strong demand for life science assets demonstrated by our partial interest sales in Cambridge and Mission Bay and our outright sale of 12 assets in the Route 128 and 495 suburbs of Boston. The partial interest sale of 300 Third Street in Cambridge closed at the end of the quarter and was sold to an existing partner relationship for a 4.3% cash cap rate at a price per square foot of $1,802, a $113 million gain over book value. As of as the sale date, we have achieved an 11.6% unlevered IRR on this asset. The partial interest sale at 1450 Owens in Mission Bay was also purchased by an existing relationship and as a development asset that included reimbursement for infrastructure and pre-development costs. Parsing those reimbursements out, yields a land value of $324 per buildable square foot indicative of the high-value of our land bank. Lastly, our 12 assets suburban portfolio sale in Greater Boston sold at a strong cash cap rate of 5.1% and the sales price per square foot of $542. Although these assets served our tenant base well for a number of years, we believe we can create more value long-term with the capital from this sale by reinvesting it into our development and redevelopment pipeline focused on the creation and expansion of our mega campus platform. The great progress made on the construction and leasing of our high-quality value creation pipeline paired with our ability to realize strong exit cap rates during the quarter, once again demonstrates our ability to create significant long-term enduring value for our shareholders. Thanks for listening. And with that I'm going to go ahead and pass it over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: All right, thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team is very pleased for their 7th year of recognition as winner of the Large Cap NAREIT Communication and Reporting Excellence Award, 6-time Gold Winner plus one Silver Award, which is truly awesome. So congratulations team. At the end of June, our team published our Annual ESG report highlighting key areas of our leadership in ESG and our focus on making a positive and lasting impact on the world. Key topics included in our ESG report include among many others, first, managing and mitigating climate-related risks, including continued development of our science-based targets to reduce emissions. Two, highlights of the design of what is expected to become the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge and to future all electric buildings in our San Francisco Bay Area market. And then three, our eight unique and important social responsibility pillars. Now turning to the quarter and the first half of the year. Our first quarter and first half results were very strong and significantly beat consensus. We also raised our strong outlook since our initial guidance for 2022 by $0.05 including $0.03 with the second quarter results here. Our projected growth in FFO per share is very strong at 8% over 2021. Total revenues for the first quarter and the first half of the year were strong and up 26.3% and 27.2% respectively over the same periods for 2021. FFO per share for the second quarter was strong at $2.10, up 8.8% over the second quarter of '21. Now huge thanks to our entire team for truly exceptional execution in 2022. We have generated one of the most consistent and strong operating and financial results quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year within the REIT industry. Now, as you've heard from us today over 1,000 plus tenants and other life science industry relationships is really driving strong demand for ARE's brand. ARE is the go to brand and the trusted partner to the life science industry, we have the best team, the highest quality facilities, the best locations and tremendous scale for space optionality to address demand. Our EBITDA margin was 70% and is one of the best in the REIT industry. This strong EBITDA margin also highlights the efficient execution of operational excellence by our team. We had strong occupancy at 94.6%, up 60 basis points since 12/31/2021 and our occupancy guidance range for 2022 from 95.2% to 95.8% highlights continued strength in occupancy growth. Record leasing volume and rental rate growth for the second quarter of 45.4% and 33.9% on a cash basis and really strong rental rate growth outlook for the entire year at 32.5% and 20.5% on a cash basis, highlighting the strength, again of our brand and execution. We have very high collections of July rent at 99.9%, as of July 22, which was about three weeks into July and consistently low AR at $7.1 million as of June 30. These are pretty amazing statistics for one of the largest REITs in the industry and not surprising given the high credit and diverse tenant roster our team has curated over the years. Our strong same-property NOI growth for the second quarter was 7.5%, 10.2% on a cash basis. This strong performance highlights the strength of our brand and trusted partnerships that continue to drive strong demand for lease renewals and re-leasing of space and expansion of space with ARE. Now, same-property occupancy was very exceptional for an asset base with consistently high occupancy, but it was up 140 basis points in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021. Now turning to our strong and flexible balance sheet. We have one of the top overall credit ratings in the REIT industry ranking in the top 10%. We've got no debt maturities until 2025. Over 98% of our outstanding debt is subject to fixed interest rates, we have $5.5 billion of liquidity. The weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt was 13.6 years and one of the highest in the REIT industry. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is on track to hit 5.1 times by year-end, really highlighting our focus on continuous improvement in our balance sheet and credit profile. Forecasted cash at the end of the year of about $250 million is expected to reduce our incremental debt capital needs for 2023, and this is really important in this higher interest rate environment. And then we really have achieved really strategic execution in 2022 on our capital plan with only slightly above 10% of our overall growth sources of capital remaining for the rest of 2022. Now at the midpoint of guidance for this year on dispositions, we have $740 million remaining and we have the potential to exceed the midpoint of that guidance. Our updated capital plan reflects a significant reduction in uses of capital for the second half of the year aggregating about $635 million across both acquisitions and construction spend as we prioritize our allocation of capital. On acquisitions, and it's important to recognize that activity has been and was expected to decline as a result of having a very attractive pipeline of land for future development in each of our key sub-markets, combined with the considerations for the overall challenging macroenvironment and capital markets. Now briefly on our dividend policy. Our Board has been very consistent with our policy and really has focused on sharing our high quality growth in cash flows from operating activities with shareholders, while also retaining a significant portion for reinvestment into our highly lease pipeline of development and redevelopment projects. We are on track to reinvest about $2 billion of cash flows from operating activities after dividends over a 10-year period ending on December 31, 2022. Now this includes about $300 million in cash flows from operating activities after dividends at the midpoint of guidance for 2022. Turning to our Venture Investments. This program and component of our business is really and consistently generating realized gains. Realized gains for the second quarter were $28.6 million and $51.8 million for the first half of the year and we are on track with projected realized gains for 2022 that should be consistent with the $105 million in realized gains in 2021 or almost $26 million per quarter. Now, the mix of realized gains is varied period to period. However, on average over the last 5.5 years gains from our investments in publicly traded securities represented only 30% of our total annual realized gains and historical gains over the years, where most often triggered by traditional liquidity events including M&A activity and IPOs. From a balance sheet perspective, we've got strong gross unrealized gains of about $565.5 million relative to our cost basis of $1.1 billion. Now, our team has delivered very strong operating and financial results in the first half of 2022 and our improved outlook for the year remains very strong with EPS diluted ranging from $2.14 to $2.20 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted from a range of $8.38 to $8.44. FFO per share is up $0.05 from our initial guidance provided at Investor Day on December 1 of '21, including the $0.03 increase with second quarter earnings here, and we expect strong FFO per share growth of 8.4% now for 2022 over 2021. Now, we refined our capital plan for the back half of the year, including the following items. We're really just focused on real estate sales for the rest of the year. We have no equity required for the remainder of the year and we significantly reduced our forecasted uses of capital by $635 million really on the back half of this year, which is a reduction of forecasted acquisitions and construction spending. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our outlook for the full year of 2022. With that, I'll turn it back to Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you very much. And I want to apologize, Steve was on cell phone and his line cut in and cut out, we'll work with the transcript providers and make sure the blanks are filled in. With that, we'd like to go to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Thanks. And first best wishes to Steve and thanks for all the help over the years. So I appreciate that. My first question is, as it relates to just the demand you guys continue to see in the portfolio, do you think the $3 billion in development spending and effectively roughly about the same amount of deliveries is sustainable and how we should think about what things look like going forward or is the second half of the year drop in spending likely to persist into next year and kind of indicate just slowing the pipeline?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Dean, do you want to take that?\nDean Shigenaga: Yes. Tony, it's Dean here. When we did look over the last couple of months here at our capital plan on around construction spend, we did announced a significant reduction in spend here for the back half of this year. But as you would expect, we look very carefully at spend for 2023. There were significant reductions there, but I don't want to get into the details of the capital plan specifically for next year, we'll get into that at Investor Day. What we are focused on though Tony as you can tell from our disclosures, the $665 million in incremental annual rental revenue as well call our priority focus, that's a fairly significant pipeline, both in revenue, but also 7.8 million square feet most of that, as you guys know is leased or negotiating at roughly 78%. So I'd call it we've refocused where we're paying attention to on allocating capital this pipeline is super important to us. So there is dollars that we will incur as we look into '23 related to that, but we're being mindful and disciplined and scaling back where we can.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, got it. And then just in terms of in the portfolio, can you maybe take us inside some of the spaces and give us a sense as to how tenants are utilizing their space and whether or not just their own funding environment being more challenging is slowing up their hiring or growth plans, or just anything you see on that side?\nJoel Marcus: So when you ask about how they're using their space, do you mean, I'm not quite sure what you're asking. The laboratories are operating full time, we've said, as you know, many times, you can't do lab work from home. Most of the life science tenants have a flexible work from home schedule. So they are, yes white color folks are in several days a week and kind of move that around. I think that's kind of the norm. But there have been, I was at one of our mega campuses, not too long ago and the parking lot was jam, so people are back in a pretty important way. But I think the office part of the component still is kind of a hybrid work schedule, if that's what you're asking.\nAnthony Paolone: I'm trying to think through if capital was last point to fall and they have growth plans, do they slow up the need to take down as much space as maybe they would have otherwise right now?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Tony, you have to go back to what Hallie said, the industry is not a cyclical industry, the industry is event-driven and if one is working on a particular blockbuster drug or whatever, they're going to allocate capital obviously as prudently and as disciplined fashion as possible, but they're going to have to move forward, because that's where the value of the pipeline is part of the key value. So I think it's different than other sectors, whether you're in a law firm or a financial sector where you can move a whole bunch of things around, because of just macroeconomics. But this is a very different industry. So I don't think you can kind of compare the two. Now tech tenants are well known, obviously, those guys clearly have slowed the pace of hiring, some of them have done some layoff work and so forth and so we see that, we've got what 8% or so, less than 10% of our portfolio is tech related. So that is, I think, well-characterized out there.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. That's all I had. Thanks.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoel Marcus: You may be on mute.\nJamie Feldman: Thank you. To start off, just congratulations also to Steve. It's been a pleasure to work with you all these years and we wish you the best going forward. I guess, we appreciate all the color, the additional disclosure on tenant segmentation, but can you talk maybe let's fast forward six months, nine months here and we look back and I'm sure there's going to be some distressed or something of some sort in your portfolio, like what do you think that actually looks like in terms of what the cycle does actually bring?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think it's pretty clear if you go back to the '08, '09 timeframe that there will be tenants and oftentimes they tend to be small publicly-held companies, either preclinical or into the clinic, who have a certain amount of cash that are trying to kind of manage their resources to get to value inflection milestone so they can either finance further or potentially reach a milestone that they could partner or sell either the company or the product to a bigger company. And so, I mean that goes on all the time, and I'm sure we'll see that evolve from time to time. I mean, the great example that I like to use as a company that had that problem back in '08, '09, they moved out of a big -- actually, they had the entire building of 500 Forbes, they moved out on one day, the next day, Genentech-Roche took that entire space and I think that's what you see we've described, I think last time, Steve described on the last call a tenant in San Diego, or maybe we've done that on some of the analyst calls, that wanted to leave, I forgot 20,000 square feet or so. We brought in another tenant who wanted that space and the mark-to-market on the new lease was 50%. So we expect to be able to manage those kinds of issues. But I think we're going to be much better well set than almost anybody else because of the discipline we've used in leasing space in the first place. Now if we buy an asset where we have an existing tenant, and that actually happened at 500 Forbes, then we have to just manage that in a way that is as best we can, because we haven't underwritten a tenant in a sense of choosing them, bring them in or not, obviously, as part of the acquisition. But so far, if you look at collections, receivables and just the general situation across the portfolio, we don't have any credit issues at the moment.\nDean Shigenaga: Yes, and Joel and Jamie, if I could add, it's Dean here, just to put things into perspective, just from one simple statistic. If you look at occupancy from the end of '08 to the end of 2009, occupancy only declined 70 basis points, if you brought in that time period, just a tad and you look at the end of '07 to the end of 2009, occupancy actually grew by 30 basis points. And I think the one fundamental difference between that period and today that the life science industry in particular, the biotech industry has really gone through this period where I think you can almost call it the Golden Age of the biotech industry today with tremendous innovation going on relative to 2008. So it's a much more exciting and vibrant environment for the biotech sector.\nJamie Feldman: Great, thank you for that. And then I guess just thinking about the cap rates on the asset sales in the quarter. How are those or how are they not representative of the broader portfolio? We've heard from brokers that maybe life science could still be trading in the threes, I'm just curious if that's just no longer a fact or maybe the Binney asset in particular that you sold is not a great comp to talk about kind of the best of the best in the portfolio?\nJoel Marcus: Yes well, I'll let Peter take that, but let me just say if you remember the Binney corridor and I think you've heard that Jamie. It took us about a decade to assemble in title and build over 2 million square feet there. 300 Third was an asset we purchased before all that it was actually an older building that had been built for Palm. And a converted asset so it doesn't really represent what we developed along that corridor, but that corridor is I think representative of a big kind of mega Class A campus. So I think keep that in mind as you think it's not an one-off one, 100 Binney isn't just one-off Class A building. It actually represents all 2 plus million square feet there. But Peter you can give some details for sure.\nPeter Moglia : Yes sure Jamie fair question, you saw the 3.5 print last quarter and this is 4.3 the buildings are next to each other locationally. I would assess the difference Joel touched on it may be starting from where I was in my comments I think they were a number of factors it would include interest rate creep since that trade certainly rates have gone up since the sale of 100 Binney so that I'm sure factored into it. The age of building - 300 Third was built in 2000. And as Joel mentioned, it was a build-to-suit for Palm, 100 Binney was built in 2017. So 100 Binney is very new state-of-the-art HMH where 300 was not purpose-built for lab. I've talked and - during other quarters, commenting on non-purpose-built buildings, and this one has similar challenges to others that we've seen in the market, namely because of their low ceilings there or the low floor-to-floors, there's 8.5 foot ceilings. We typically have 10-foot ceilings in our space. So when you shrink the ceiling down like that, it's just not as nice of an environment. And it has some other weird things. There's, the parking lots on the second floor of the building, and that just creates some operational inefficiencies when you're dealing with chemical storage and things. So you have that and then I'd say, maybe one other item is that it's subject to a ground lease versus 100 Binney, which was a fee simple asset and there's certainly a little bit of discount for that. So I think all of those things kind of aggregated to a 4.3 but I would also say in this environment of 4.3 is still pretty good really good if you factor and also that 300 Binney is subjective a long-term lease and the buyer is not going to be able to market-to-market for quite a long time. So they certainly saw great value in the future appreciation.\nJoel Marcus: And a great tenant in Alnylam.\nPeter Moglia : Yes.\nJoel Marcus: Yes.\nJamie Feldman: Okay great, thank you.\nJoel Marcus: Thanks Jamie.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Griffin of Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Griffin: Thanks appreciate you having me on the call this quarter and Steve, congrats on a well-deserved retirement. Just wanted to touch on the suburban portfolio dispositions, can you maybe give some color as to why it made sense to sell these assets? And could you see potential sales from other similar properties in the future?\nJoel Marcus: So I'll let Peter comment again on some of the specifics, but I would say - and welcome to the call. We aggregated those assets actually 60 West View, if I'm not mistaken, was the first asset we ever bought in the Massachusetts cluster. And we aggregated those assets, many of which kind of early on in our attempt to try to build a presence in the Greater Boston region. In those days, we didn't have enough money to buy anything in Cambridge. And we over -- as I say, well over a decade, we aggregated a nice group of suburban assets, well maintained, well operated, actually pretty good credit throughout the - those assets. But it comes a time when you see values there to harvest and to reinvest and also our move to the - really the mega campus strategy in the greater Boston region with our really big mega campuses. That's where we wanted to focus our capital, and we have obviously a whole host of needs. So it was a pretty easy decision and the timing was, I think, pretty darn good. But Peter, you could comment. I don't know if there's anything specific.\nPeter Moglia: Yes, I'd just say that I think the time was right. Those - there were 12 buildings in that portfolio. They were really good workforce buildings but relative to the rest of the assets that we have in our market that were on the lower spectrum of quality and given the appetite for life science real estate I think we were able to get the pricing by selling in today that was very attractive and as Joel mentioned and I said on the comments, great opportunity to reinvest that into our value creation pipeline. So I don't think there's really - I think it's just really that simple, just really opportunistic time to sell assets and get maybe more for on than you would in another era.\nJoel Marcus: Yes and I would say, we don't also have a set of suburban assets like that really in - how they kind of originated and stuff really in any other market. So you can't really say oh, do you have other suburban portfolios. Like in the Bay Area, a portfolio, we would probably exit would be the East Bay, but we exited those before. So we don't have those kind of assets by and large.\nMichael Griffin: Great. I appreciate the color on that. And then just maybe stepping back a bit, obviously given the continued demand for life science, are you noticing more entrants coming into your markets, particularly on the conversion side of traditional office to life science product?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think as Peter said, the reality is data centers have been hot. Obviously, resi has been hot. Industrial logistics has been hot, and life science has been hot. But life science is a very - it's a much, much smaller overall asset base countrywide. And so, the scarcity is an important part of things. And as Peter said, I think a number of important high-quality investors have sought to look at these scarcity assets. But obviously, sometimes people make a decision. They don't like the asset they have. So they're looking at somebody else and saying, Gee, could we try to convert and do that and sure in markets there are those kind of people. But by and large, I mean, we heard pretty big core stories on some conversions in the Boston region by people who have no idea what they're doing and tenants who are desperate to get out. So that's a story that will unfold pretty sadly for those folks.\nMichael Griffin: Got you, that's it from me, thanks for the time.\nJoel Marcus: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC Nikko. Please go ahead.\nRichard Anderson: Thanks and Steve, good luck honor and privilege to work with you. I'll look for you on Celebrity Row at Warrior Games going forward next season. So on the topic of conversion activities, it's interesting. A lot of your office peers have made that the bulk of their development or redevelopment business. Peter to your comments about development costs going up and all that? And again, despite what you just said, Joel about some of the horror stories, do we expect the conversion business to start to whittle down or is it whittling down even though you don't consider it a competitive force for you guys? Is that something that could be an outtake from all of this disruption?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, so Steve and Peter, you guys want to comment?\nPeter Moglia: Steve, do you want to go first?\nStephen Richardson: Yes, sure. Maybe I'll jump in here, Rich, and thank you for the kind words there. Yes, we're already seeing - that's why I tried to break it down in terms of the properties themselves. So you look at these conversions. And then you look at the operators who are new to this with a one-off building. And then ultimately, the capital partners, and we have seen now projects that have been put on pause that those will ultimately be put on ice. And we just don't see capital that enthusiastic about committing significant dollars to these types of conversions given the overall macro environment, the complete lack of any tenant base mixed with a lack of operational experience. So I think more to come and more to unfold, but that's certainly the sentiment that we're seeing out in the market now and Peter can add to that too.\nPeter Moglia: Yes I would say we do quite a number of meetings about strategy and market updates on a weekly basis. We're covering we never going to long before we covering what could be coming up what have we heard with all the different regions and I had - by and large we don't hear a lot about potential conversions outside of you might see announced in the press. Most of it is potentially new development, but as Steve mentioned in his comments. We only see limited amount of that in 2022 and 2023 more has been announced, we'll see if it gets built. But I don't see or we don't see a lot of conversions outside of going back to the suburbs in Boston. We certainly know one of our - one of the office suites that has a lot of holdings out there I have talked about doing conversions and I'm sure are underway with a few, but we're not seeing - proliferate throughout our urban core very much at least at this point.\nRichard Anderson: Okay, great. I'll yield the floor. Good long in the call here. Thanks very much team.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSheila McGrath: Guys good afternoon, congrats Steve and all the best. Just a quick question on the dynamics of rental rates for new construction. Assuming as Peter outlined construction cost continue to go up and you want to maintain development yields just curious if the new rents on new development to justify construction are like above prevailing market in various submarkets?\nJoel Marcus: Yes so Peter do you want to talk about Blackstone's kind of market high they just are indicative.\nPeter Moglia: Yes I mean, I think what Joel is referring to as I think they were at $137 a foot. And that's, by and large, one of the things that sets the market our new developments. And so, you get a rate like that and then a renewal comes up of another Class A property in the neighborhood and the landlord will ask for the same rent. So I would say that the new development kind of helps set the market and then the existing assets follow. So it's a good thing.\nSheila McGrath: Okay great. And then on 1450 Owens, I thought that was an interesting structure. I guess, sort of to minimize construction spend. Just wondering if that something you would replicate on some of the pipeline going forward?\nJoel Marcus: We've actually done it before. But Steve, you could talk about that.\nStephen Richardson: Yes I think Sheila, that was a really great situation for both ourselves and the joint venture partner. We had the very left of sold, titled to go. So we have combination of a very attractive intrinsic land value plus preconstruction work that we done. And as we looked at partnering on that project just into the additional capital contribution to build to build will equaling the intrinsic value and the preconstruction work we had in there. So you're right. It's a very mutually rewarding way to move forward with that project.\nSheila McGrath: Okay great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Yes, thanks I just wanted to touch back on suburban Boston sales I guess Peter you indicated that portfolio was at the lower quality spectrum. So could you comment how the 5.1 cap rate would compare to the rest of the portfolio. I mean is there an easy way to understand the cap rate difference between let's say newer buildings and the rest of the properties?\nJoel Marcus: Yes the assets and the locations are even comparable but Peter you could answer.\nPeter Moglia: Well I think what you're trying to get to Michael is I would say that if we had a - so these were more of one-off buildings. But if we were to sell something in the suburbs that was more campus like - I mean San Diego ago and itself is kind of suburban market. So you look at something like Campus Point right where you have this amenitized campus it's in a suburban spread out environment, but it's Class A and amenitized I mean that's going to have, that's going to be a low 4 cap rate. If we had something in the suburbs of Boston, that was a similar type of development I would expect to similar type of cap rate. But these were lower quality these weren't really campuses they were one-off buildings of significant age and of credit tenancy in there was about a quarter when you looked over the spectrum of the tenant base. So it just as I termed it before kind of workforce they'll be leased over time as tenants need 30,000/50,000 square feet which is about the average size of those buildings. But they're never going to have huge rent growths because they are just not that appealing to have somebody clamoring over it.\nMichael Carroll: Okay great. And then just really quick and we ensure in time. I know about 80% I guess of your process development projects are protected in terms of I guess development cost increases. Can you kind of talk about the near term starts and how that's protected and if there is an risk to those budgets going higher or yields potentially going lower?\nJoel Marcus: Yes so, look you can't do a - you get a gross maximum price contract until you actually have something to price. So whenever we start a project we obviously do a pro forma and then within that pro forma I believe that we have a very conservative approach with allowances for cost that should be adequate and then contingencies on top of that. And then we get the entitlements. We get permits and then we're ready to go out and supplying out the project and it just take - you don't but it all out at once you buy out different trades at different times. So it's a process but we do it expeditiously and anything that we have that starts out. Again we have these underwriting contingencies that are in our pro forma so we have a really good idea what the yield would be and more often than not that initial yield can be done. We can do better because as we start to buy things out we can start removing some of those allowances and contingencies and end up by the time it gets put in to the supplemental you know highly confident in that yield. It may not be completely bought out by then but it's very close and if it hasn't been bought out it still contains good contingency to cover any unknowns or unexpected cost increases.\nMichael Carroll: Okay great thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dave Rodgers of Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Rodgers: Hi Steve, thanks for the help over the years congratulations and good luck as well. Peter, just on the investment sales side, maybe you've touched on a lot of different ways about this question. But when you talk to your JV partners that have been the consistent buyers of a lot of your better quality assets? Are they specifically asking for or indicating that they'd be interested in a different type of asset or a different price point at this point in time, just with respect to where debt costs are and their ability to kind of finance that spread?\nPeter Moglia : So the nice thing that we have in our - in the base of our great partner pool, and it really truly is a great group of partners that we've established significant relationships with is that when we do these JVs. They're done on an unlevered basis. So they're not necessarily beholden to what the rates are for secured debt at the time. Now many of them may indeed finance their portfolios outside of asset specific financing, but it is at a very low level. In fact, some of our partners though have so much cash to put out that they don't lever really at all. So it's been one of the things that I think has helped us achieve the cap rates that we've achieved and sell things at an expeditious manner because there is a hunger for those types of assets, and they're not those purchases aren't contingent upon financing. So we hear stories about deals falling out because the lender at the last minute decides not to fund. That fortunately for us, we haven't had to deal with that. And if we did an outright sale, and we've had bidders that have put financing contingencies in their offers, but we've had enough bidders that were willing to not have that contingency that we just so far knock on wood. Everything that we've put out there we've performed on and haven't had any disruption because of debt market volatility.\nDave Rodgers: That's helpful thanks. And then maybe just one unrelated question with regard to the Texas investments you detailed, I think, a little bit more this quarter versus last. And I think last quarter, Joel, you had made the comment that you'd want to wait. I guess just more curious in terms of your thoughts, if you can comment further? Are you bringing existing tenants? Are there tenants in that market that want to be in those locations? What's driving that decision and what's your kind of vision for the investment there?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, so that's a good question. So when it comes to Houston, one of our campus acquisitions was, in fact, made because of a specific tenant. And that tenant will grow there and will be an anchor a larger project. When it comes to Austin, we have a cohort of important lab tenants, both credit and noncredit who want to be in that market. It is a new market. It is one that is not an existing cluster probably will take a decade to start to gel and then probably another 15 years beyond that to get to that 25-year mark. But I think what intrigued us about Texas and Austin in general is - and I've made this statement before, if you look at what Steve Jobs said about the 21st century, it was the century the intersection of biology and technology. And so I think Texas is ripe for that intersection, and that's where this industry is really moving in an industrial fashion. So this is really kind of the first toe in the water with that thesis.\nDave Rodgers: Great, thank you.\nJoel Marcus: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead.\nTom Catherwood: Thank you and Steve, thank you for everything and best of luck just one question from me. Hallie and Joel really appreciated the commentary on your different tenant segments at the onset. One thing that's always struck us though is the early insights that the company gets through the Alexandria investment platform and incubators like launch labs. On that early stage side of the business, are you getting any leading indicators suggesting a shift that could drive future changes in trends? And is that changing your investment strategy at all?\nJoel Marcus: So thank you for that question. Not really I mean I think the - I mean technology, and you saw the - if you looked at the cover of the press release and sub, we've highlighted Eikon Therapeutics based on Nobel Prize-winning technology and headed by Roger Perlmutter, who was CSO at Amgen. He was also Chief Scientific Officer at and Head of Research at Merck. And this is a great example of a using to some extent AI in the development of new innovative therapeutics. So clearly that intersection that I just talked about that Steve Jobs described is, we're certainly seeing way more of that today than we did before, but I think our early stage efforts are really aimed at focusing on the next Alnylam's or the next Moderna's, two companies that we became associated with Alnylam in 2003 that started in 3,500 square feet in our Science Hotel and Cambridge and Moderna that started early on in Tech Square a couple of years after it had been founded by the flagship team, and our hope is to find those kinds of companies that have just totally disruptive technologies and lots of product opportunities and shots on goal, because those are the things that are going to move the dial and move the needle when it comes to human health, and by the way, both are huge, huge tenants of ours in many respect. So it all kind of works out, but that's kind of where our focus is, I don't know Hallie if you want to comment.\nHallie Kuhn: Yes, thanks, Joel. This is Holly, and I think you covered it well and to kind of parrot some of Joel's comments from earlier earnings calls, we're really in the early innings so to speak of these next-gen type therapies, is that when we think about gene therapies, cell therapies, mRNA therapies, we've seen a handful approved. But when you look at the stable of clinical and preclinical technologies, it's really mind-blowing how exponential it is and just repertoire of types of different therapies and types of different clients that companies are working on. So I would say we're early days and seen kind of what's the next generation of these therapies is going to look like.\nTom Catherwood: Appreciate the color. Thanks everyone.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Georgi Dinkov of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Hi, thank you. First, congratulations on the strong quarter. And Steve, good luck to you. I guess, just a couple of quick questions for me, can you please remind us how you assess credit risk in both the property and the investment portfolio.\nJoel Marcus: I'm sorry. How you?\nGeorgi Dinkov: How you assess credit risk in both the property and the investment portfolio.\nJoel Marcus: Well that's, we could write a treatise on that, when it comes to the investment portfolio, if you're looking at early-stage, we're looking at the things Hallie and I just described, great management teams, strong financial capability to attack some really big problems that have major unmet medical needs. I think when it comes to the tenants. We have a much different kind of focus, focus on stability, credit, opportunity. So they're kind of different in that sense, but both are rigorous and we've had a pretty highly disciplined and highly skilled team in place for a long, long time, which is why I think we've been able to do a really good job at those underwritings.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. And just I guess my second question, you mentioned core office utilization is lower, and we see it in core office tenants giving back space. I'm just curious, have you seen any life science companies giving back like fewer core office?\nJoel Marcus: I don't think so. But I'd asked. Peter or Steve, have you seen that, I don't think so.\nPeter Moglia: Well, the laboratory, the office that is associated with our laboratories houses the scientists that are working in the labs and they need that space to do their work, they can't, it's not good lab practices to be in the lab writing things up. So it's typically not possible to just give back lab space -- sorry, office space because they need it, if they're working in the lab.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Okay, great. Thank you.\nStephen Richardson: They are fully integrated.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Okay guys, thank you so much. That is all from me.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Daniel Ismail of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Ismail: Great. Thank you. Steve, I'd like to echo the comments on that. Thanking you for your help over the years and best wishes in retirement. Joel, just a quick question on the comments you made about the Texas expansion. We haven't seen the migration of life science tenant to the Sunbelt like we've seen in the traditional office sectors. Do you think this is a trend that will likely pick up for starts or do you think this is more of a one-off and that the growth of the cluster market will take the time that you stated earlier?\nJoel Marcus: Well, okay. Well, first of all, I think, by the way, we didn't have a slightly okay quarter, we had a really great quarter. So I would ask you to think about your comments on your review piece. Secondly, it's our intent like it was in New York, we started in New York, there was one incubator in New York alone, there was no other commercial companies really operating. There were a handful of companies, and we've either built or helped move or really helped create that market and so our intent is to do the same in Texas. We're not waiting for tenants just to haphazardly move there somehow, but we have a pretty strategic plan to work with tenants who want to move there. Remember, a lot of cities these days, and you could pick out the names have governance problems, homeless problems, crime problems, high taxes, poor governance. So there are a whole lot of folks very interested. We've seen that in financial services and now Citadel just announcing a big move from Chicago to Miami. So you're going to see with the 1,000 tenants I can tell you we have a whole lot of folks that want to move.\nDaniel Ismail: That makes sense. I appreciate it. And is cost of living a concern for the tenants or the cost of by science rents in these life sciences customers.\nJoel Marcus: So it's -- very compared to other business, a very small percentage of their overall cost structure.\nDaniel Ismail: Thanks. And then Peter, just the last question for you, in bidding terms in the last three months, I'm curious as you're out there acquiring assets or looking to sell assets, have those changed at, has become less competitive or more competitive or what have you seen in terms of bidding terms?\nPeter Moglia: As far as acquiring things I think there has been fewer buyers in the last couple of months as we've been kind of winding up our program, but pricing is for great quality land that hasn't really been moving down at all. And then in the dispositions, we tend to go to -- we kind of select who we'd like to have purchase our assets or JV with us. So it's hard to say, but I would say the interest in those folks that we typically approach with our opportunities has not waned and they are still very eager to get more exposure.\nJoel Marcus: Yes I mean, it's based on a pure scarcity of really high quality, well-located laboratory assets. I mean that's the equation Peters laid out.\nDaniel Ismail: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks a lot.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: Okay. Thank you everybody. And we'll look forward to our third quarter call. Be safe. Take care. God bless.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Hallie Kuhn",
            "content": "Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science & Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to start by covering the bedrock of Alexandria's business. Specifically, as Joel mentioned, Alexandria's world-class and leading stable of over 1,000 tenants. As part of this review, I will cover the health of the life science industry and then pivot to a number of recent FDA approval that reflect the industry's collective drive to develop life-saving therapies. The life science industry is large, diverse and complex. Alexandria's tenant base reflects the diversity with over 1,000 tenants that span multinational pharma, public and private biotechnology companies, life science products such as enabling research tools and manufacturers of complex medicines and top-tier investment-grade companies and institutions. So let's break this down segment by segment, starting with multinational pharma. Alexandria is proud to call 17 of the top 20 biopharma companies our tenants, including BMS, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, Takeda, Merck and Pfizer, just to name a few. Looking at large cap focused indices such as the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceutical Index, you'll see that these companies continue to outperform broader indices, including the Dow, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Biopharma deployed over $200 billion into R&D in 2021 and the top 20 biopharma have an estimated $300 billion cash on hand to put towards M&A and partnerships as they look to bolster their pipelines with innovative new medicines. Next, public biotech companies. With small and mid-cap companies have gotten outsized focus over the past several months as indices such as the XBI have tumbled, this segment contains many of the most innovated and well-funded large-cap companies in the industry with names such as Alexandria tenants Alnylam and Vertex. Indeed, the majority of our ARR across public biotechnology companies is from those with marketed or approved products. Across pre-commercial companies, we have a deeply technical and experienced science and technology team that employs a rigorous underwriting and monitoring process to select the fastest-growing and most promising companies. Our over decade-long relationship with Moderna is a great example. Just three years ago, Moderna was in this pre-commercial category and is now a leading global commercial stage biotech. On to private biotechnology. While funding has slowed across all industries compared to 2021 due to macro market conditions, venture funds continue to raise historic levels of capital and deploy it at a sustained pace. $30 billion was deployed into private biotechnology companies in the first half of 2022 compared to a record-breaking $39 billion in the first half of 2021, and still up over 50% compared to the first half of 2019 and 2020. Indeed, companies like incoming New York and Bay Area tenant, Icon Therapeutics, with a stellar management team and highly differentiated platform recently raised over $0.5 billion. This is not to say that investment thesis haven't shifted. With downward pressure on valuations and are refocusing towards the most innovative companies with experienced management teams, but market resets are ultimately healthy for a sector in the long run as companies are forced to double down in their core strength and talent is diverted to the most promising applications. Now for life science products, services and devices. This diverse set of companies enables breakthrough research from the bench to bedside. It is the companies like Illumina developing cheaper, faster and more efficient research tools to understand the genetic underpinnings of disease. If company is identifying diseases at the earliest stages when treatments can be more effective, and it's the contract manufacturers producing complex medicines for next-gen therapies. As the picks and shovels, so to speak, of the industry, these companies' business models are not the same as those developing novel medicines with a quicker path to market and revenue. So while there is no simple index or measure that is a perfect proxy for the strength of our top-tier tenant base, from the beginning of the year through the second quarter, the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceutical Index, which captures many of our top 20 tenants, outperformed the Dow by 11 points, the NASDAQ by 25 points and the XBI by 29 points. Moreover, the life science industry is less cyclical than other industries as products are developed over a longer period with novel medicines taking an average 10 years from early development to commercialization. Developing new medicines is not easy and market dynamics aside, companies will experience challenges and even failures along the way. But with 1,000 tenants and over 87% of leasing stemming from preexisting relationships, our unique model and deeply experienced team positions us to proactively manage potential risks and bumps in the road. To end, I'd like to take a step back and acknowledge the mission-critical nature of the life science industry to our society. Each approval from the FDA marks the potential for a healthier, longer life for each of us listening on the call today and our loved ones. New therapies improve and extend quality of life, prevent costly hospitalizations and ultimately, reduce long-term health care costs. We are proud and humbled that as novel therapies approved by the FDA in 2022, half by Alexandria tenants, a stat that holds true for the past decade. Approvals from tenants this quarter include an RNA-based treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, a small molecule treating obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a first-in-class immunotherapy targeting metastatic melanoma. To paraphrase Roger Perlmutter, former CSO of Merck and the CEO of the previously mentioned Eikon Therapeutics, novel medicines can change the world and most have yet to be discovered. And with that, I'll pass it over to Steve. Yes, thanks, Joel. This is Holly, and I think you covered it well and to kind of parrot some of Joel's comments from earlier earnings calls, we're really in the early innings so to speak of these next-gen type therapies, is that when we think about gene therapies, cell therapies, mRNA therapies, we've seen a handful approved. But when you look at the stable of clinical and preclinical technologies, it's really mind-blowing how exponential it is and just repertoire of types of different therapies and types of different clients that companies are working on. So I would say we're early days and seen kind of what's the next generation of these therapies is going to look like."

            "content": "Thank you, Hallie. The second quarter of 2022 was an absolute blowout quarter in nearly every regard, the demand and really the intensity of the strong commitment to Alexandria's brand of highly differentiated mega campuses and operational excellence continue to provide for superior financial outperformance. I'd like to give a big shout out to the entirety of the Alexandria team as following the results are amongst the best in nearly every category. As Joel noted, Alexandria is truly a one of a kind company and hence definitively proven its ability to deliver excellent results throughout a wide array of macroeconomic condition. As we've discussed and Hallie referred to as well a number of times over many years, the companies in the life science industry have a long-term horizon for their pursuit and commercial life-saving and life changing novel medicines and therapies. Research and discovery in the laboratory, multi-stage clinical trials, commercial rollouts can and do take a decade or more. Alexandria's unique capabilities and team have successfully identified the most promising life science companies and ultimately attracted the world's leading investment-grade pharmaceutical and big biotech companies to it's mega-campuses in AAA locations adjacent to the country's leading research institutions. The second quarter exemplifies this powerful combination of trusted relationships with high-quality companies and their long-term horizons and some consider the following. 87% of the leasing activity overall was from Alexandria's existing relationship and absolutely essential and unique to Alexandria-only enabling success during turbulent macroeconomic quarters. And during Q2, 88% of the leasing activity in the development and redevelopment pipeline was from Alexandria's existing relationships. Consider how powerful that statement is for successfully growing the company's high-quality on-balance opportunities not only for a few quarters, but for many years. The stability and trusted nature with Alexandria has become a bedrock in value consideration for our tenants. And as the company has grown to more than 1,000 tenants this past year, this presents an exceptionally powerful competitive advantage for the company's future growth and a substantial barrier for others to be dabbling in a highly sophisticated and technical nature of mission critical life science real estate. Beyond the ground reality for Alexandria this quarter is a vigorous and highly productive effort from across the entire company. The leasing activity of approximately 2.3 million square feet is in the third-highest quarterly leasing volume in company history. Record rate increases with renewal leasing spreads of 45% GAAP, 44% cash represent the second highest and the highest rental rate growth in the company's history, respectively. The portfolio mark-to-market remains strong at approximately 7-point percent and as we noted in the last two quarterly calls this is significantly greater than the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of 2020 and in line with the end of 2021's 30.4%. Accounts receivable for the entire Q2 was a 100% including a 100% from our publicly traded biotech tenants and that continues as we've achieved 99.9% so far during July. Early renewals for this quarter were similar to Q1 at a rate of 50% of leasing, a strong validation again of the health of Alexandria's tenants and their long-term planning horizon that we noted at the start of my comments. We have exceptional health of our value creation pipeline with a total of more than 900,000 square feet of leasing which contributes to a highly de-risk nature of the pipeline as 78% of the 7.8 million square feet which is projected to generate $665 million of incremental revenue is leased or negotiating, and Peter will provide additional detail and color during his comments as well. Let's move on to supply and demand. Demand was consistent with the past two years with no significant drop in our quarters. We do see the demand in the market highly [technical difficulty] life science projects and end market, the actual each HVAC capacity, actual electric capacity, actual operational experience an operator might have [technical difficulty]. We continue to monitor supply at a very similar level, including the actual asset because differences between purpose built Class A facilities and Class B purpose-built we also look at the [technical difficulty] and if you look at capital sources they will actually the decision till we go forward [technical difficulty] the basis for this new [technical difficulty]. So let's build up the specific reality in the field and supply. Current vacancy rates continue to be very tight with [technical difficulty] in our core clusters, [technical difficulty] less than 1% [technical difficulty] which is generally consistent with market conditions during the past several quarters. There is not significant sub leases in the market which is in contrast [technical difficulty] and if they are of high quality, they are moved very quickly. As we look at 2022 the unleased new supply is adding very incrementally 1% to 2% of our key market, [technical difficulty] earlier comment on healthy demand. So we would expect to supply would be substantially leased by year-end. If we look ahead to '23, again we drill down on each and every project at our core markets and determine which projects are actually vertical and well underway. The unleased 2023 deliveries will be [technical difficulty] 3% to 5% availability to the total market size. And again, we expect these deliveries will be further reduced during the next six quarters. Beyond that, 2024 and beyond, we do closely monitor hand waving and flyers in the market that indicate creative tech space or life science space alternatives and as of today, we do not see any large disruptive set of Class A lab projects well underway in our core markets that are preparing to go vertical on a purely speculative basis. Ultimately, Alexandria has significant differentiation in the market and as I mentioned at the outset of my comments, this group new projects is only becoming more intensive and accelerating as companies need a trusted and eminently capable operator for the mission-critical operations. So we actually see the difference between Alexandria's Class A facilities as part of our fully-amenitized mega campuses and one-off buildings and commodity locations becoming more highly valued. So in conclusion, the first quarter of 2022 was a very strong quarter, and now the historic strength of the second quarter continues to definitively highlight Alexandria's positioned for the near term and the long-term. Life science companies intrinsically have a long-term horizon and their mission critical laboratory facilities are essential for their success. Alexandria has a combination of a tenant roster that has both a long-term horizon in high-quality investment-grade credit portends a very bright future for the company. And as this is my last earnings call with the announcement of my retirement, I want to say, it has been the honor of my life to work shoulder to shoulder with the entire Alexandria family at this one of a kind company. I have the highest regard and deep affection for this incredible team. Our unique culture of respect for one another, high expectations for one another and a passion for the company's mission is a rare blend that has enabled us to thrive and work as a trusted partner with one of the country's most strategic and choice industries. I also want to thank the broader investment community for your deep engagement and support for the company over these many years we worked with one another. And finally, it has been an exceptional privilege in particular to work so closely during the past 22-plus years with the team, an extraordinarily insightful and eminently capable leader, Peter, who is the ultimate Co-CEO, providing the heart and soul of the company and perfectly complementing my shortcomings with his formidable talents, and Joel, an inspirational leader, a genuine line of the industry and a once-in-a-generation Founder and American business. I have been truly blessed. And with that, I will hand it off with energy and enthusiasm to my brother Peter. Yes, sure. Maybe I'll jump in here, Rich, and thank you for the kind words there. Yes, we're already seeing - that's why I tried to break it down in terms of the properties themselves. So you look at these conversions. And then you look at the operators who are new to this with a one-off building. And then ultimately, the capital partners, and we have seen now projects that have been put on pause that those will ultimately be put on ice. And we just don't see capital that enthusiastic about committing significant dollars to these types of conversions given the overall macro environment, the complete lack of any tenant base mixed with a lack of operational experience. So I think more to come and more to unfold, but that's certainly the sentiment that we're seeing out in the market now and Peter can add to that too. Yes I think Sheila, that was a really great situation for both ourselves and the joint venture partner. We had the very left of sold, titled to go. So we have combination of a very attractive intrinsic land value plus preconstruction work that we done. And as we looked at partnering on that project just into the additional capital contribution to build to build will equaling the intrinsic value and the preconstruction work we had in there. So you're right. It's a very mutually rewarding way to move forward with that project. They are fully integrated."

            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody. Thank you for joining Alexandria's second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Hallie Kuhn; Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga. In a very challenging macroeconomic environment, for sure, we are very blessed and thankful to have a truly one-of-a-kind public company, which has a uniquely visionary mission to create and grow life science ecosystems and clusters that ignite and accelerate leading innovators to advance human health by curing disease, saving lives and vastly improving nutrition, our mission for sure. We at Alexandria have worked tirelessly to earn the trust and have carefully and meticulously constructed our client tenant base within our best-in-class asset base. In 1994, we uniquely set out to be the trusted lab space real estate partner for life science companies. Today, 28 years later, we have earned the trust of over 1,000 diversified high-quality companies who have chosen our brand and rely on us to deliver on our reputation. Daily, they entrust us with their most precious assets, their talent, thousands of hard-working science, technology and business professionals reliant on our lab space and on the life science ecosystems we cultivate to attract and retain the best talent to advance their science. We provide them with a truly inspirational and healthy place to work. Daily, they entrust us with billions and billions of dollars of research and development platforms to be safe, secure and operational. Daily, they entrust us to be aligned with their mission to partner together at the highest level of operational excellence to improve human health. In this market, our results really stand out in the macroeconomic environment we're all experiencing, a slowing economy, the weaken consumer, higher interest rates and ranging structural inflation. Huge congratulations to our Alexandria family on a great 2Q '22 report. As Dean will talk about in a while, we've updated guidance for the second quarter to $8.41, FFO per share, representing an almost 8.5% growth for this year and combined with a 3% plus dividend. We think that's an excellent combination of 11.5% in this macroeconomic environment. We've experienced very powerful continuing rental rate increases and leasing activity. It's important to remember, 87% of our existing -- of our leasing comes from our existing tenants. We have uniquely crafted our own demand driver in our more than 1,000 tenants and 92% of the first half of 2022 leasing comes from this tenant base. 2.3 million square feet were signed in the second quarter, a third all-time high. with cash all-time high of 34% rental rate increase, highest ever, and a 45% GAAP rental rate, truly epic and historic. And then keep in mind, 50% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or big-cap companies -- public companies, and 80% of our tenants are not private or development-stage biotech companies. Peter will discuss in detail our outstanding progress in capital recycling to the tune of about $0.5 billion in the second quarter as we harvest great value, which we have created over the last decade. He will also talk about strong external growth engine, which we fine-tuned in the new economic environment. Dean will discuss our fortress balance sheet and strong liquidity. More important now than ever with turbulent capital markets and fortunately, with our great team, we have no debt maturities until 2025. So no FFO dilution due to refinancings. Steve will discuss very strong internal growth and make sure to look at Page 33 of the supplement. And also Dean will mention the burn-off of free rent providing strong visibility for future growth. Our margin continued to be strong at 70%, and we're very proud of our tenant collections at 99.9%. So no real credit issues whatsoever. Hallie will speak to our awesome and non-replicable tenant base of over 1,000 tenants and the continuing health of the broader life science industry. The life science industry is not synonymous with simply early-stage biotech. Alexandria and its best-in-class tenant base is very well positioned and prepared for this shifting environment. With our best-in-class assets, decades-long relationship, we in fact, beat the so-called competitive product and much future theorized product, which will never be built. Last but not least, I want to make a couple of comments about Steve Richardson, our retiring Co-CEO. I want to express on behalf of all the extended family here at Alexandria a profound thank you for the last 22 years, the best ever. Your humble service leadership has set the bar for all of us. Queen Elizabeth recently talked about leadership at her birthday celebration in which -- and you exemplify these words precisely, finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration to work together. And if I may just finally make a quote from the famous movie Band of Brothers. Of course, it could be all genders, of course, and the Requiem For a Soldier, we're all one great Band of Brothers. And one day, you'll see we can live together when all the world is free, have you lived to see all you gave to me, you in fact have, you're shining dream of hope and love. We're all one great Band of Brothers. And with that, I want to turn it over to Hallie Kuhn. Thank you very much. And I want to apologize, Steve was on cell phone and his line cut in and cut out, we'll work with the transcript providers and make sure the blanks are filled in. With that, we'd like to go to questions. Yes. So Dean, do you want to take that? So when you ask about how they're using their space, do you mean, I'm not quite sure what you're asking. The laboratories are operating full time, we've said, as you know, many times, you can't do lab work from home. Most of the life science tenants have a flexible work from home schedule. So they are, yes white color folks are in several days a week and kind of move that around. I think that's kind of the norm. But there have been, I was at one of our mega campuses, not too long ago and the parking lot was jam, so people are back in a pretty important way. But I think the office part of the component still is kind of a hybrid work schedule, if that's what you're asking. Yes. Tony, you have to go back to what Hallie said, the industry is not a cyclical industry, the industry is event-driven and if one is working on a particular blockbuster drug or whatever, they're going to allocate capital obviously as prudently and as disciplined fashion as possible, but they're going to have to move forward, because that's where the value of the pipeline is part of the key value. So I think it's different than other sectors, whether you're in a law firm or a financial sector where you can move a whole bunch of things around, because of just macroeconomics. But this is a very different industry. So I don't think you can kind of compare the two. Now tech tenants are well known, obviously, those guys clearly have slowed the pace of hiring, some of them have done some layoff work and so forth and so we see that, we've got what 8% or so, less than 10% of our portfolio is tech related. So that is, I think, well-characterized out there. Yes. Thank you. You may be on mute. Well, I think it's pretty clear if you go back to the '08, '09 timeframe that there will be tenants and oftentimes they tend to be small publicly-held companies, either preclinical or into the clinic, who have a certain amount of cash that are trying to kind of manage their resources to get to value inflection milestone so they can either finance further or potentially reach a milestone that they could partner or sell either the company or the product to a bigger company. And so, I mean that goes on all the time, and I'm sure we'll see that evolve from time to time. I mean, the great example that I like to use as a company that had that problem back in '08, '09, they moved out of a big -- actually, they had the entire building of 500 Forbes, they moved out on one day, the next day, Genentech-Roche took that entire space and I think that's what you see we've described, I think last time, Steve described on the last call a tenant in San Diego, or maybe we've done that on some of the analyst calls, that wanted to leave, I forgot 20,000 square feet or so. We brought in another tenant who wanted that space and the mark-to-market on the new lease was 50%. So we expect to be able to manage those kinds of issues. But I think we're going to be much better well set than almost anybody else because of the discipline we've used in leasing space in the first place. Now if we buy an asset where we have an existing tenant, and that actually happened at 500 Forbes, then we have to just manage that in a way that is as best we can, because we haven't underwritten a tenant in a sense of choosing them, bring them in or not, obviously, as part of the acquisition. But so far, if you look at collections, receivables and just the general situation across the portfolio, we don't have any credit issues at the moment. Yes well, I'll let Peter take that, but let me just say if you remember the Binney corridor and I think you've heard that Jamie. It took us about a decade to assemble in title and build over 2 million square feet there. 300 Third was an asset we purchased before all that it was actually an older building that had been built for Palm. And a converted asset so it doesn't really represent what we developed along that corridor, but that corridor is I think representative of a big kind of mega Class A campus. So I think keep that in mind as you think it's not an one-off one, 100 Binney isn't just one-off Class A building. It actually represents all 2 plus million square feet there. But Peter you can give some details for sure. And a great tenant in Alnylam. Yes. Thanks Jamie. So I'll let Peter comment again on some of the specifics, but I would say - and welcome to the call. We aggregated those assets actually 60 West View, if I'm not mistaken, was the first asset we ever bought in the Massachusetts cluster. And we aggregated those assets, many of which kind of early on in our attempt to try to build a presence in the Greater Boston region. In those days, we didn't have enough money to buy anything in Cambridge. And we over -- as I say, well over a decade, we aggregated a nice group of suburban assets, well maintained, well operated, actually pretty good credit throughout the - those assets. But it comes a time when you see values there to harvest and to reinvest and also our move to the - really the mega campus strategy in the greater Boston region with our really big mega campuses. That's where we wanted to focus our capital, and we have obviously a whole host of needs. So it was a pretty easy decision and the timing was, I think, pretty darn good. But Peter, you could comment. I don't know if there's anything specific. Yes and I would say, we don't also have a set of suburban assets like that really in - how they kind of originated and stuff really in any other market. So you can't really say oh, do you have other suburban portfolios. Like in the Bay Area, a portfolio, we would probably exit would be the East Bay, but we exited those before. So we don't have those kind of assets by and large. Well, I think as Peter said, the reality is data centers have been hot. Obviously, resi has been hot. Industrial logistics has been hot, and life science has been hot. But life science is a very - it's a much, much smaller overall asset base countrywide. And so, the scarcity is an important part of things. And as Peter said, I think a number of important high-quality investors have sought to look at these scarcity assets. But obviously, sometimes people make a decision. They don't like the asset they have. So they're looking at somebody else and saying, Gee, could we try to convert and do that and sure in markets there are those kind of people. But by and large, I mean, we heard pretty big core stories on some conversions in the Boston region by people who have no idea what they're doing and tenants who are desperate to get out. So that's a story that will unfold pretty sadly for those folks. Yes. Yes, so Steve and Peter, you guys want to comment? Yes so Peter do you want to talk about Blackstone's kind of market high they just are indicative. We've actually done it before. But Steve, you could talk about that. Yes the assets and the locations are even comparable but Peter you could answer. Yes so, look you can't do a - you get a gross maximum price contract until you actually have something to price. So whenever we start a project we obviously do a pro forma and then within that pro forma I believe that we have a very conservative approach with allowances for cost that should be adequate and then contingencies on top of that. And then we get the entitlements. We get permits and then we're ready to go out and supplying out the project and it just take - you don't but it all out at once you buy out different trades at different times. So it's a process but we do it expeditiously and anything that we have that starts out. Again we have these underwriting contingencies that are in our pro forma so we have a really good idea what the yield would be and more often than not that initial yield can be done. We can do better because as we start to buy things out we can start removing some of those allowances and contingencies and end up by the time it gets put in to the supplemental you know highly confident in that yield. It may not be completely bought out by then but it's very close and if it hasn't been bought out it still contains good contingency to cover any unknowns or unexpected cost increases. Yes, so that's a good question. So when it comes to Houston, one of our campus acquisitions was, in fact, made because of a specific tenant. And that tenant will grow there and will be an anchor a larger project. When it comes to Austin, we have a cohort of important lab tenants, both credit and noncredit who want to be in that market. It is a new market. It is one that is not an existing cluster probably will take a decade to start to gel and then probably another 15 years beyond that to get to that 25-year mark. But I think what intrigued us about Texas and Austin in general is - and I've made this statement before, if you look at what Steve Jobs said about the 21st century, it was the century the intersection of biology and technology. And so I think Texas is ripe for that intersection, and that's where this industry is really moving in an industrial fashion. So this is really kind of the first toe in the water with that thesis. Yes, thank you. So thank you for that question. Not really I mean I think the - I mean technology, and you saw the - if you looked at the cover of the press release and sub, we've highlighted Eikon Therapeutics based on Nobel Prize-winning technology and headed by Roger Perlmutter, who was CSO at Amgen. He was also Chief Scientific Officer at and Head of Research at Merck. And this is a great example of a using to some extent AI in the development of new innovative therapeutics. So clearly that intersection that I just talked about that Steve Jobs described is, we're certainly seeing way more of that today than we did before, but I think our early stage efforts are really aimed at focusing on the next Alnylam's or the next Moderna's, two companies that we became associated with Alnylam in 2003 that started in 3,500 square feet in our Science Hotel and Cambridge and Moderna that started early on in Tech Square a couple of years after it had been founded by the flagship team, and our hope is to find those kinds of companies that have just totally disruptive technologies and lots of product opportunities and shots on goal, because those are the things that are going to move the dial and move the needle when it comes to human health, and by the way, both are huge, huge tenants of ours in many respect. So it all kind of works out, but that's kind of where our focus is, I don't know Hallie if you want to comment. Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry. How you? Well that's, we could write a treatise on that, when it comes to the investment portfolio, if you're looking at early-stage, we're looking at the things Hallie and I just described, great management teams, strong financial capability to attack some really big problems that have major unmet medical needs. I think when it comes to the tenants. We have a much different kind of focus, focus on stability, credit, opportunity. So they're kind of different in that sense, but both are rigorous and we've had a pretty highly disciplined and highly skilled team in place for a long, long time, which is why I think we've been able to do a really good job at those underwritings. I don't think so. But I'd asked. Peter or Steve, have you seen that, I don't think so. Thank you. Well, okay. Well, first of all, I think, by the way, we didn't have a slightly okay quarter, we had a really great quarter. So I would ask you to think about your comments on your review piece. Secondly, it's our intent like it was in New York, we started in New York, there was one incubator in New York alone, there was no other commercial companies really operating. There were a handful of companies, and we've either built or helped move or really helped create that market and so our intent is to do the same in Texas. We're not waiting for tenants just to haphazardly move there somehow, but we have a pretty strategic plan to work with tenants who want to move there. Remember, a lot of cities these days, and you could pick out the names have governance problems, homeless problems, crime problems, high taxes, poor governance. So there are a whole lot of folks very interested. We've seen that in financial services and now Citadel just announcing a big move from Chicago to Miami. So you're going to see with the 1,000 tenants I can tell you we have a whole lot of folks that want to move. So it's -- very compared to other business, a very small percentage of their overall cost structure. Yes I mean, it's based on a pure scarcity of really high quality, well-located laboratory assets. I mean that's the equation Peters laid out. Yes. Thank you. Okay. Thank you everybody. And we'll look forward to our third quarter call. Be safe. Take care. God bless."

            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. I'd like to start by thanking you for teaching me so much about teamwork, managing people, operational excellence, the necessity of taking a deep breath every now and again, expanding my vocabulary and being a sounding board and confidante throughout our partnership. I started this Co-CEO relationship with alacrity. The use of that word is an example of your influence, and I was not disappointed. I will greatly miss our regular chats, but I'm glad you will be around when a good talk is needed. With that said, I'm going to update the audience on the progress being made on our value creation pipeline and related construction costs and supply chain trends then conclude with remarks on the dispositions completed this quarter. As Hallie referenced in her overview, our 1,000 plus tenant base is of the highest quality as it includes 17 of the 20 biopharma companies, the most innovative and well-funded large cap public biotech companies in the world and a stable full of the most promising and fastest growing private companies in the industry, which have been rigorously underwritten by a deeply technical and experienced team. This highly curated tenant base provides opportunities that have been consistently fueling our external growth for over a decade. And if you connect the dots, it's no coincidence that 87% of our leasing activity comes from it. The best companies are those that grow and we have grown along with them. The past quarter, we completed over 915,000 square feet of leasing in our development and redevelopment pipeline which aggregates to an excess of 2.3 million square feet for only half a year at a time when people are worried about the product type we invented, because others pretending to be equals are struggling with their tenant base. Our results in the wake of others struggling should tell you something. Life science real estate is not for everyone, success takes years of experience in designing and building the right product in the right location, deep relationships with the highest quality life science companies and company creators, operational excellence and most important during times like these, a very deep understanding of the industry. We delivered 375,394 square feet in the second quarter spread amongst six projects including the full deliveries of the 8 and 10 Davis, part of our Alexandria Center for Advanced Technologies in the Research Triangle, and 5505 Morehouse Drive in Sorrento Mesa. The weighted average yield of these delivered projects was a healthy 7.8% and they will contribute over $20.6 million in net operating income moving forward. The remainder of the pipeline that is either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next six quarters has decreased by approximately 200,000 square feet from last quarter, but is still projected to add more than $665 million in annual rental revenue over the same number of quarters reflecting higher revenue per square foot developed. As of quarter end, 78% of this remarkable pipeline was either leased or under negotiation, meaning we have an executed LOI with 95% of the activity year-to-date coming from existing relationships, reinforcing the quality of our tenant base given that this category of leasing is typically driven by consolidation necessitated by growth. It also highlights the extraordinary loyalty of our tenants and the trust we have earned through many years of high-quality service. I'm also pleased to report that despite continued volatility in construction costs and supply chain disruptions, our pro forma yields are neutral to slightly improving relative to last quarter and there have been no adjustments to our delivery timing. That is a good transition to our construction costs and supply chain update. The bad news first. There are still upward pressures on construction and material prices stemming from high energy costs and now labor costs are becoming a bigger issue than in the past. As the U.S. exports more natural gas to Europe, it becomes more expensive here, and one direct impact has been an increasing glazing costs of 20% to 40%. In addition to a 35% increase in aluminum over the past 12 months, glazing is impacted by the cost of natural gas as it's heavily used in its production. As mentioned last quarter, elevated diesel prices have a significant impact on construction costs as earthwork machinery runs on it and our contractors have been seeing fuel surcharges in the billings from these subs. Crude oil was up 71% from February '21 through February '22, and although pricing is slightly improved since then, it's not providing any significant relief. Other costs that continue to be overly elevated over the past quarter include construction machinery, which is doubled, Gypsum, which is up over 1500%, one of our contractors blames this on elevated housing construction, which uses about 50% of the supply, semiconductors are up 276% due to heavy demand by the automotive industry and switchgear and other industrial and electrical equipment is up 73% due partially to demand and partially to elevated cost of components that go into that equipment. Labor which accounts for approximately 60% to 70% of construction costs has been relatively stable over the past couple of years due to pre-arranged wage increases negotiated into labor agreements, but many of those are now up for renewal and negotiations are reported to be intense. Due to career changes for many in the industry after layoffs caused by COVID-19 work stoppages, there is a smaller pool of labor, and combined with the higher cost of living wages are expected to be much higher in the future. Supply chain issues remain despite improvements in transportation, mainly due to the war in Ukraine and a ripple effect from shortages in components. One of our surveyed contractors closely track supply chain related impacts to their jobs nationally and found that from September of 2020 through February 23 of this year, supply chain impacts averaged 5.89 per day. From the beginning of the war on February 24 through June 8 of this year, there have been 38.12 impacts per day. As a result, extraordinary lead times remain for equipment used in our product type, including generators, building controls, transformers, switchgear, electrical panels, air handlers and chillers, all of which have lead times that are double what they normally are, many exceeding a year. Much of the delay is due to a ripple effect of missing components, a generator can be 90% complete, but can take an additional six months to finish because of the missing component or two from a vendor with a huge backlog. The good news is that despite the shortage in skilled labor productivity is improving. Contractors are starting to see cancellations or projects being put on hold, lightening their backlogs, which will eventually reduce demand and ease, both pricing and supply chain problems. This can be seen in expected escalations from one of our major GCs who projects them to be 6% to 8% this year with a bias towards the longer end but a reduction to 4% to 5% in 2023. We continue to closely manage these conditions and approximately 80% of our cost for development and redevelopment projects under construction are subject to a guaranteed maximum or other contracts that enable us to mitigate the risk of inflation. We have contingencies behind those contracts to account for scope creep and unknowns, the other 20% is from projects that are currently pending guaranteed maximum contracts that are in process, and those projects include larger cost contingency allowances in their performance. Moving to our asset sales. Interest rates are certainly influencing real estate pricing broadly and we've been told by our investment brokers that they are seeing a 25-basis-point widening and other hot product types such as industrial. So we may see it with lab office assets as well. It is certainly reasonable expect that may happen, but we do believe that the scarcity of well-located Class A lab office assets will help mitigate that. You can certainly find industrial product almost anywhere, but for sale Class A lab product is still very hard to find. So despite the increasing interest rate environment, there continues to be strong demand for life science assets demonstrated by our partial interest sales in Cambridge and Mission Bay and our outright sale of 12 assets in the Route 128 and 495 suburbs of Boston. The partial interest sale of 300 Third Street in Cambridge closed at the end of the quarter and was sold to an existing partner relationship for a 4.3% cash cap rate at a price per square foot of $1,802, a $113 million gain over book value. As of as the sale date, we have achieved an 11.6% unlevered IRR on this asset. The partial interest sale at 1450 Owens in Mission Bay was also purchased by an existing relationship and as a development asset that included reimbursement for infrastructure and pre-development costs. Parsing those reimbursements out, yields a land value of $324 per buildable square foot indicative of the high-value of our land bank. Lastly, our 12 assets suburban portfolio sale in Greater Boston sold at a strong cash cap rate of 5.1% and the sales price per square foot of $542. Although these assets served our tenant base well for a number of years, we believe we can create more value long-term with the capital from this sale by reinvesting it into our development and redevelopment pipeline focused on the creation and expansion of our mega campus platform. The great progress made on the construction and leasing of our high-quality value creation pipeline paired with our ability to realize strong exit cap rates during the quarter, once again demonstrates our ability to create significant long-term enduring value for our shareholders. Thanks for listening. And with that I'm going to go ahead and pass it over to Dean. Yes sure Jamie fair question, you saw the 3.5 print last quarter and this is 4.3 the buildings are next to each other locationally. I would assess the difference Joel touched on it may be starting from where I was in my comments I think they were a number of factors it would include interest rate creep since that trade certainly rates have gone up since the sale of 100 Binney so that I'm sure factored into it. The age of building - 300 Third was built in 2000. And as Joel mentioned, it was a build-to-suit for Palm, 100 Binney was built in 2017. So 100 Binney is very new state-of-the-art HMH where 300 was not purpose-built for lab. I've talked and - during other quarters, commenting on non-purpose-built buildings, and this one has similar challenges to others that we've seen in the market, namely because of their low ceilings there or the low floor-to-floors, there's 8.5 foot ceilings. We typically have 10-foot ceilings in our space. So when you shrink the ceiling down like that, it's just not as nice of an environment. And it has some other weird things. There's, the parking lots on the second floor of the building, and that just creates some operational inefficiencies when you're dealing with chemical storage and things. So you have that and then I'd say, maybe one other item is that it's subject to a ground lease versus 100 Binney, which was a fee simple asset and there's certainly a little bit of discount for that. So I think all of those things kind of aggregated to a 4.3 but I would also say in this environment of 4.3 is still pretty good really good if you factor and also that 300 Binney is subjective a long-term lease and the buyer is not going to be able to market-to-market for quite a long time. So they certainly saw great value in the future appreciation. Yes. Yes, I'd just say that I think the time was right. Those - there were 12 buildings in that portfolio. They were really good workforce buildings but relative to the rest of the assets that we have in our market that were on the lower spectrum of quality and given the appetite for life science real estate I think we were able to get the pricing by selling in today that was very attractive and as Joel mentioned and I said on the comments, great opportunity to reinvest that into our value creation pipeline. So I don't think there's really - I think it's just really that simple, just really opportunistic time to sell assets and get maybe more for on than you would in another era. Steve, do you want to go first? Yes I would say we do quite a number of meetings about strategy and market updates on a weekly basis. We're covering we never going to long before we covering what could be coming up what have we heard with all the different regions and I had - by and large we don't hear a lot about potential conversions outside of you might see announced in the press. Most of it is potentially new development, but as Steve mentioned in his comments. We only see limited amount of that in 2022 and 2023 more has been announced, we'll see if it gets built. But I don't see or we don't see a lot of conversions outside of going back to the suburbs in Boston. We certainly know one of our - one of the office suites that has a lot of holdings out there I have talked about doing conversions and I'm sure are underway with a few, but we're not seeing - proliferate throughout our urban core very much at least at this point. Yes I mean, I think what Joel is referring to as I think they were at $137 a foot. And that's, by and large, one of the things that sets the market our new developments. And so, you get a rate like that and then a renewal comes up of another Class A property in the neighborhood and the landlord will ask for the same rent. So I would say that the new development kind of helps set the market and then the existing assets follow. So it's a good thing. Well I think what you're trying to get to Michael is I would say that if we had a - so these were more of one-off buildings. But if we were to sell something in the suburbs that was more campus like - I mean San Diego ago and itself is kind of suburban market. So you look at something like Campus Point right where you have this amenitized campus it's in a suburban spread out environment, but it's Class A and amenitized I mean that's going to have, that's going to be a low 4 cap rate. If we had something in the suburbs of Boston, that was a similar type of development I would expect to similar type of cap rate. But these were lower quality these weren't really campuses they were one-off buildings of significant age and of credit tenancy in there was about a quarter when you looked over the spectrum of the tenant base. So it just as I termed it before kind of workforce they'll be leased over time as tenants need 30,000/50,000 square feet which is about the average size of those buildings. But they're never going to have huge rent growths because they are just not that appealing to have somebody clamoring over it. So the nice thing that we have in our - in the base of our great partner pool, and it really truly is a great group of partners that we've established significant relationships with is that when we do these JVs. They're done on an unlevered basis. So they're not necessarily beholden to what the rates are for secured debt at the time. Now many of them may indeed finance their portfolios outside of asset specific financing, but it is at a very low level. In fact, some of our partners though have so much cash to put out that they don't lever really at all. So it's been one of the things that I think has helped us achieve the cap rates that we've achieved and sell things at an expeditious manner because there is a hunger for those types of assets, and they're not those purchases aren't contingent upon financing. So we hear stories about deals falling out because the lender at the last minute decides not to fund. That fortunately for us, we haven't had to deal with that. And if we did an outright sale, and we've had bidders that have put financing contingencies in their offers, but we've had enough bidders that were willing to not have that contingency that we just so far knock on wood. Everything that we've put out there we've performed on and haven't had any disruption because of debt market volatility. Well, the laboratory, the office that is associated with our laboratories houses the scientists that are working in the labs and they need that space to do their work, they can't, it's not good lab practices to be in the lab writing things up. So it's typically not possible to just give back lab space -- sorry, office space because they need it, if they're working in the lab. As far as acquiring things I think there has been fewer buyers in the last couple of months as we've been kind of winding up our program, but pricing is for great quality land that hasn't really been moving down at all. And then in the dispositions, we tend to go to -- we kind of select who we'd like to have purchase our assets or JV with us. So it's hard to say, but I would say the interest in those folks that we typically approach with our opportunities has not waned and they are still very eager to get more exposure."

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "All right, thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team is very pleased for their 7th year of recognition as winner of the Large Cap NAREIT Communication and Reporting Excellence Award, 6-time Gold Winner plus one Silver Award, which is truly awesome. So congratulations team. At the end of June, our team published our Annual ESG report highlighting key areas of our leadership in ESG and our focus on making a positive and lasting impact on the world. Key topics included in our ESG report include among many others, first, managing and mitigating climate-related risks, including continued development of our science-based targets to reduce emissions. Two, highlights of the design of what is expected to become the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge and to future all electric buildings in our San Francisco Bay Area market. And then three, our eight unique and important social responsibility pillars. Now turning to the quarter and the first half of the year. Our first quarter and first half results were very strong and significantly beat consensus. We also raised our strong outlook since our initial guidance for 2022 by $0.05 including $0.03 with the second quarter results here. Our projected growth in FFO per share is very strong at 8% over 2021. Total revenues for the first quarter and the first half of the year were strong and up 26.3% and 27.2% respectively over the same periods for 2021. FFO per share for the second quarter was strong at $2.10, up 8.8% over the second quarter of '21. Now huge thanks to our entire team for truly exceptional execution in 2022. We have generated one of the most consistent and strong operating and financial results quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year within the REIT industry. Now, as you've heard from us today over 1,000 plus tenants and other life science industry relationships is really driving strong demand for ARE's brand. ARE is the go to brand and the trusted partner to the life science industry, we have the best team, the highest quality facilities, the best locations and tremendous scale for space optionality to address demand. Our EBITDA margin was 70% and is one of the best in the REIT industry. This strong EBITDA margin also highlights the efficient execution of operational excellence by our team. We had strong occupancy at 94.6%, up 60 basis points since 12/31/2021 and our occupancy guidance range for 2022 from 95.2% to 95.8% highlights continued strength in occupancy growth. Record leasing volume and rental rate growth for the second quarter of 45.4% and 33.9% on a cash basis and really strong rental rate growth outlook for the entire year at 32.5% and 20.5% on a cash basis, highlighting the strength, again of our brand and execution. We have very high collections of July rent at 99.9%, as of July 22, which was about three weeks into July and consistently low AR at $7.1 million as of June 30. These are pretty amazing statistics for one of the largest REITs in the industry and not surprising given the high credit and diverse tenant roster our team has curated over the years. Our strong same-property NOI growth for the second quarter was 7.5%, 10.2% on a cash basis. This strong performance highlights the strength of our brand and trusted partnerships that continue to drive strong demand for lease renewals and re-leasing of space and expansion of space with ARE. Now, same-property occupancy was very exceptional for an asset base with consistently high occupancy, but it was up 140 basis points in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021. Now turning to our strong and flexible balance sheet. We have one of the top overall credit ratings in the REIT industry ranking in the top 10%. We've got no debt maturities until 2025. Over 98% of our outstanding debt is subject to fixed interest rates, we have $5.5 billion of liquidity. The weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt was 13.6 years and one of the highest in the REIT industry. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is on track to hit 5.1 times by year-end, really highlighting our focus on continuous improvement in our balance sheet and credit profile. Forecasted cash at the end of the year of about $250 million is expected to reduce our incremental debt capital needs for 2023, and this is really important in this higher interest rate environment. And then we really have achieved really strategic execution in 2022 on our capital plan with only slightly above 10% of our overall growth sources of capital remaining for the rest of 2022. Now at the midpoint of guidance for this year on dispositions, we have $740 million remaining and we have the potential to exceed the midpoint of that guidance. Our updated capital plan reflects a significant reduction in uses of capital for the second half of the year aggregating about $635 million across both acquisitions and construction spend as we prioritize our allocation of capital. On acquisitions, and it's important to recognize that activity has been and was expected to decline as a result of having a very attractive pipeline of land for future development in each of our key sub-markets, combined with the considerations for the overall challenging macroenvironment and capital markets. Now briefly on our dividend policy. Our Board has been very consistent with our policy and really has focused on sharing our high quality growth in cash flows from operating activities with shareholders, while also retaining a significant portion for reinvestment into our highly lease pipeline of development and redevelopment projects. We are on track to reinvest about $2 billion of cash flows from operating activities after dividends over a 10-year period ending on December 31, 2022. Now this includes about $300 million in cash flows from operating activities after dividends at the midpoint of guidance for 2022. Turning to our Venture Investments. This program and component of our business is really and consistently generating realized gains. Realized gains for the second quarter were $28.6 million and $51.8 million for the first half of the year and we are on track with projected realized gains for 2022 that should be consistent with the $105 million in realized gains in 2021 or almost $26 million per quarter. Now, the mix of realized gains is varied period to period. However, on average over the last 5.5 years gains from our investments in publicly traded securities represented only 30% of our total annual realized gains and historical gains over the years, where most often triggered by traditional liquidity events including M&A activity and IPOs. From a balance sheet perspective, we've got strong gross unrealized gains of about $565.5 million relative to our cost basis of $1.1 billion. Now, our team has delivered very strong operating and financial results in the first half of 2022 and our improved outlook for the year remains very strong with EPS diluted ranging from $2.14 to $2.20 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted from a range of $8.38 to $8.44. FFO per share is up $0.05 from our initial guidance provided at Investor Day on December 1 of '21, including the $0.03 increase with second quarter earnings here, and we expect strong FFO per share growth of 8.4% now for 2022 over 2021. Now, we refined our capital plan for the back half of the year, including the following items. We're really just focused on real estate sales for the rest of the year. We have no equity required for the remainder of the year and we significantly reduced our forecasted uses of capital by $635 million really on the back half of this year, which is a reduction of forecasted acquisitions and construction spending. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our outlook for the full year of 2022. With that, I'll turn it back to Joel. Yes. Tony, it's Dean here. When we did look over the last couple of months here at our capital plan on around construction spend, we did announced a significant reduction in spend here for the back half of this year. But as you would expect, we look very carefully at spend for 2023. There were significant reductions there, but I don't want to get into the details of the capital plan specifically for next year, we'll get into that at Investor Day. What we are focused on though Tony as you can tell from our disclosures, the $665 million in incremental annual rental revenue as well call our priority focus, that's a fairly significant pipeline, both in revenue, but also 7.8 million square feet most of that, as you guys know is leased or negotiating at roughly 78%. So I'd call it we've refocused where we're paying attention to on allocating capital this pipeline is super important to us. So there is dollars that we will incur as we look into '23 related to that, but we're being mindful and disciplined and scaling back where we can. Yes, and Joel and Jamie, if I could add, it's Dean here, just to put things into perspective, just from one simple statistic. If you look at occupancy from the end of '08 to the end of 2009, occupancy only declined 70 basis points, if you brought in that time period, just a tad and you look at the end of '07 to the end of 2009, occupancy actually grew by 30 basis points. And I think the one fundamental difference between that period and today that the life science industry in particular, the biotech industry has really gone through this period where I think you can almost call it the Golden Age of the biotech industry today with tremendous innovation going on relative to 2008. So it's a much more exciting and vibrant environment for the biotech sector."

And now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus : Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to today's call, April 26, 2022, previewing or highlighting our first quarter. And I want to also let everybody know with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Peter Moglia and Stephen Richardson. I want to make a shout-out happy birthday to someone very special listening here today. I want to welcome and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call, and want to wish everyone got blessings and just watching the war in Ukraine gives us pause to appreciate everything we have. The good to great author, Jim Collins has spoken about Alexandria. We have achieved 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And I want to congratulate the entire Alexandria family team on a first quarter earnings performance really by all metrics exemplifying Alexandria exceptionalism at its finest. Our -- in fact, as Jim Collins said, our superior performance.  I want to thank the entire family team as well for what they do each and every day for this mission-driven company, profoundly committed to driving forward our distinctive impact approach to address some of society's most pressing challenges through our long-standing bedrock social responsibility pillars.  As Jim said, our distinctive impact, and we have worked in these pillars, accelerating ground breaking research, medical research, harnessing the agro food ecosystem to combat hunger, empowering underserved students to achieve long-term success, bolstering the resilience of our military, conquering the opioid epidemic, building a model for comprehensive and sustainable solutions to address homelessness, one of our newest programs, addressing the mental health crisis with a focus on helping children cope with suicide loss, another new focus, and supporting museums to preserve our history and honor our greatest heros, also a new focused pillar. I want to also share that next month, May 2022, we'll celebrate our 25th anniversary of Alexandria's initial public offering since our IPO in 1997, we've maintained the highest standards of excellence and continue to drive long-term value for our stockholders, significantly outperforming major indices and companies. With the total shareholder return through the end of the year from '97 of 2,532%, which has beat the NASDAQ average for that time of 1,291%, we'd beat Warren Buffett at Berkshire during that time at 953%, the MSCI REIT index, all REIT index at 939%, the S&P 500 for that time frame, 790%, the Russell 721% and the FTSE NAREIT Office Index at 552%. As Jim Collins said, Alexandria is lasting endurance. I want to move to the first quarter, characterized by Alexandria's preserving its very strong core, while stimulating strong and continuing future growth. Alexandria continues to have pricing power in each of our core markets. As Dean will talk about, our very strong NOI growth in the first quarter and out of a sense of conservatism, we raised our midpoint of our guidance $0.02 given the macro environment. But on the other hand, we have very strong conviction for the coming 3 quarters of 2022 and the delivery of strong NOI growth, both internally and especially from our stellar external value creation pipeline. Steve will highlight our second highest leasing quarter in the company's history, and Alexandria continues to experience the strengths across each and every one of our markets here in our overall portfolio. Dean will highlight our very strong same-store performance and increased guidance as we continue to see positive occupancy gains and strong rental rate growth. With our extreme attention to each and every detail of our unique and special life science real estate business, we're seeing modest increases in our development yields as well as we're highly focused on tightly managing all aspects of our business with a tough macro environment and with rising recession risks. Today reminds me of 1979 with government policies failing the American people.  Alexandria has been very focused on tenant quality, and 50% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or publicly-traded large cap tenants. I think it's pretty amazing that Alexandria's tenants have made an astounding -- have made astounding progress in developing groundbreaking medicines. 48% of FDA novel therapy approvals have been granted to Alexandria tenants since 2017, almost half of all approvals.  The life science industry has seen the explosion of biotech over the last -- over the past decade from 2013 to 2021, with fund flows up generally 5x historical averages, advancing broadly innovative pipelines for large unmet medical needs. And every one of us knows either a family member, a friend who suffers from some form of disease still not treatable effectively with today's medicines.  The move in inflation starting in the first quarter of '21. Now we're 5 quarters into it, coupled with the myriad of problematic U.S. policies and macro threats have ended that boom. And over the last 5 quarters, what has emerged are the haves and have not. They have not or a range of small and mid-cap biotech companies with programs that are preclinical as well as many are in the clinic have seen their values drop and the open markets of the last 9 years, by and large, are closed. The haves are large biotech as well as biotechs that have reached commercial stage together with big pharma and are as flush with cash as ever being estimated to be over $500 billion of available immediate cash. Alexandria's tenant selection has been a cornerstone of our unique business model, and has enabled us to select and grow with the best and highest quality and most innovative tenants, one of the absolute bedrocks of our -- really our business model.  And with that, let me turn it over to Steve for some details on the quarter on the growth side.\nStephen Richardson : Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everybody. Steve Richardson here. As we bring Q1 2022 to a close, I'd like to highlight 2 critical factors driving the continued momentum and success of Alexandria. One is the demand for Alexandria's unique and highly differentiated facilities. Operational excellence services and mega campus offerings continues at a very COVID and post-COVID level, with leasing during Q1 totaling 2.5 million square feet. And within that total, 1.4 million square feet in our development and redevelopment pipeline. This activity is the second highest quarterly leasing volume in company history in each of these 2 categories following historically high leasing during 2021 and particularly Q4 2021.  And two, importantly, the exceptional quality and long-term nature of Alexandria's leasing results overall and especially this quarter, is truly noteworthy in 1 to double underline. We signed a long-term lease for a ground-up Class A laboratory office flagship facility comprising 427,000 rentable square feet with Bristol-Myers Squibb a company with a market cap of $164 billion as they chose Alexandria to design, build and operate their mission-critical innovative research hub at our Campus Point Mega campus.  Let me just say that this type of outcome is the result of Alexandria's historic pioneering efforts in establishing the life science asset class, we started working with BMS during 1998 some 24 years ago and began building trust and confidence at every level of the organization. Bristol-Myers Squibb is now our top tenant and present in 5 of Alexandria's core clusters, a truly unique partnership and a distinct and compelling competitive advantage. The entirety of Alexandria's brand value and BMS's decision to select Alexandria was crystallized with this inspiring achievement. First, a deep and meaningful trusted and mutually respectful historical relationship with further cemented. Second, the unique ability to scale a facility featuring design and infrastructure was realized; and third, a marquee destination at campus point with a highly curated and first-class suite of amenities to meet BMS's imperative and to retain and recruit the absolute best talent sets a new mega campus gold standard.  We also signed this quarter another Class A plus laboratory office facility comprising 334,000 rentable square feet at our Seaport campus with Eli Lilly, a company with a market cap of $280 billion, for their state-of-the-art Institute for genetic medicine. Eli Lilly is a similarly exceptional story. Our teams first worked with Lilly during 2000, and embarked upon a journey together to create world-class laboratory office facilities in 5 of our core clusters as well as the Lilly's team pursues its cutting-edge research. The foundational work during these past 22 years provided a bedrock of trust, and enabled our teams to envision the profoundly positive impact upon Lilly's ability to compete for the best and brightest scientific and entrepreneurial talent in the greater Boston cluster, with a premier high-visibility waterfront site offering expansion optionality, adjacency to transit and unparalleled amenities in an iconic design certain to be a landmark for generations. These are showcase examples of Alexandria's formidable and irreplaceable position deeply embedded within the life science ecosystem. The strength of our internal growth engine is unassailable. We have now more than 1,000, tenants providing us with unmatched insight into not only their current and future space needs, but more importantly, the ability to stay ahead of the curve to deliver sophisticated operational expertise for these mission-critical facilities and curate the precise amenity mix to drive the holistic recruiting and retention of talent platform essential to these innovative company's success. These leasing accomplishments are a testament to the entirety of the Alexandria team's passion, commitment and unwavering work ethic towards our shared mission. And the continued demand for our facilities is also borne out by the following stellar results, growth within the core provides critical and immediate value to the company with impressive renewal and re-leasing spreads of 23.2% cash and 39.8% GAAP when excluding the block of short-term swing space for BMS as we begin construction on their flagship facility noted earlier. The portfolio mark-to-market remains strong at approximately 30%, and as we noted on the last quarterly call, this is significantly greater than the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of Q4 2020. Accounts receivable for and again, huge kudos to our best-in-class operations team. Early renewals for this quarter were 51%, somewhat below our historic rate, but a clear sign that our tenant base continues to actively seek to lock down their valuable laboratory office facilities. Healthy demand is also evidenced by the exceptional health of Alexandria's value creation pipeline.  As mentioned earlier, the 1.4 million square feet in the pipeline is the second highest total in the company's history and further contributed to the highly derisked nature of the pipeline as 77% of this 8 million square feet, which is projected to generate $665 million of incremental revenue, is leased or negotiating. Peter will provide additional detail and color on the pipeline during his comments as well. Moving on to supply and demand. Demand overall, as we highlighted during Investor Day back in December and on the Q4 '21 earnings call and now on this call, for Alexandria's mega campus continues. And our irreplaceable set of relationships and central role in the life science ecosystem positions us very well to engage and secure the very best innovative companies in the country. Market supply. We continue to monitor market supply in a granular level, including the actual assets, the operators and the capital sources behind potential projects. When we look at 2022, important to note that the vacancy rates are very low in each of our 3 largest clusters and the overall new supply is either leased or adding very incrementally, say, 1% or so in our key markets.  In 2023, projects that are actually -- and I want to emphasize actually under construction are much more modest, say 25% of what various broker reports might indicate as those reports include planned or proposed projects. The 2023 deliveries are again either leased or contributing just 3% to 4% of availability to the total market size, which will likely be further reduced during the coming quarters. And in 2024 and beyond, in these 3 markets, there are no projects actually under construction with delivery dates in this time frame. Yes, there are a number of planned or proposed projects or dirt being moved around, but we'll have to see if the operators, and more importantly, the capital partners behind these projects actually commit significant capital to the projects on a purely speculative basis to their often time inexperienced development operators. And let me finish the supply summary with a reminder of the significant difference and highly valued difference by quality life science tenants between Alexandria's Class A plus facilities as part of our fully amenitized mega campuses and one-off buildings in commodity locations. So in conclusion, the first quarter of 2022 was a very strong quarter and positions the company very well to drive immediate and long-term value through our core operating base as well as our substantially lease negotiating 8 million square foot REIT-leading development, redevelopment pipeline. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter.\nPeter Moglia : Thank you, Steve. I'm going to update you all on the value creation pipeline, discuss the continuation of construction costs and supply chain macro issues and comment on the 100 Binney disposition. Leveraging our unique market industry insights and the proven expertise of our best-in-class team, our value creation pipeline is tactically broadening our core clusters to meet the needs of our world-class tenant roster. Reflecting the continuing strong demand referenced in Steve's comments, and our ability to capture it due to our trusted brand, AAA locations, inspiring aesthetics, operational excellence, curated amenities and capability to elevate the tenant experience, our value creation pipeline of projects that are either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters has increased to 8 million square feet that is projected to add more than $665 million in annual rental revenue, primarily commencing from the second quarter of this year through the first quarter of '25, a $55 million increase over what was discussed last quarter. As of quarter end, 77% of this remarkable pipeline was either leased or under negotiation, which means we have an executed LOI. With an astounding 94% of the activity coming from existing relationships, highlighting the incredible loyalty to our stellar brand. Our tenant base is an award for talent and recognize that space at an Alexandria's campus is mission-critical in that fight. Without question, our ability to offer our tenant-based scalability and comprehensive amenity offerings through our mega campuses is a truly unique differentiator and why Alexandria is the clear choice to provide mission-critical facilities to the life science industry's most innovative and successful companies. During the first quarter, we delivered 566,655 square feet from 10 projects located in 8 different submarkets, reflecting the diversity of our pipeline made possible by strong demand across all regions. The deliveries provide strong GAAP yields at approximately 6.7%, translating to approximately $36.1 million of annual NOI. Alexandria's tremendous execution on our value creation pipeline represents a key component of our compelling growth engine, and an example of this is the extraordinary job our highly seasoned development teams are doing in managing cost escalations and supply chain disruptions that continue to proliferate throughout the construction industry. Approximately a year ago, in our first quarter call for 2021, we included commentary on construction cost trends because construction cost inflation was anticipated to be outsized due to double demand for materials and labor caused by the simultaneous restart of paused and new projects, combined with shortages in materials and labor due to closing of mills and fabrication shops, weather events and the loss of workers who migrated to different careers. It was all expected to be transitory, and even last quarter, we noted expectations for things to start normalizing in 2023. However, war, COVID in China and transportation issues have become the latest antagonist in the story and reversed any thoughts to the near-term stabilization. The war in Ukraine's biggest impact on construction costs is an astronomical increase in fuel costs. Sustainability experts will tell you that the embedded carbon of constructing a building is equal to the carbons used to operate the building for 30 years, much of it coming from fuel earned by the trucks delivering materials to the site and the machinery that produces the earthwork on the build.  In addition to fuel, the war has reduced the supply of critical semiconductor materials such as palladium and nickel, exacerbating the chip shortage, which affects such things as building control systems and emergency generators, the latter of which can now take up to a year to deliver. Other raw materials that come from the area are used to make certain metals like aluminum and contributing to their inflation. Transportation issues proliferate throughout the economy and construction is no exception. If you spend any time on a construction job site, you will marvel at the amount of coordination that needs to take place as trucks come in and out of the job delivering materials or hauling things away. In addition to the cost of fuel, inflationary pressures coming from an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 trucker shortage emanating from outdated compensation models and the allure of last-mile delivery companies reducing the pool of candidates. In addition to trucking, we're keeping our eye on labor negotiations for over 22,000 dock workers on the West Coast. The deadline to reach an agreement is July 30. And if they strike, it could place pressure on alternative ports and further delay delivery of materials. Specific material problems today include steel, copper and aluminum, roofing materials, elevators, HVAC equipment, switch gear, transformers and emergency generators. Materials and equipment are both expensive and tough to get. Many of these items take twice as long to get than in normal times and continue to go up in price by double digits. Rest assured, we are tightly managing these conditions.  As mentioned last quarter, the biggest asset we have to leverage is our decades of experience in developing purpose-built laboratory buildings, enabling us to mitigate delays. Currently, approximately 82% of our costs, or development and redevelopment projects, aggregating to 5.4 million square feet are subject to guaranteed maximum or other contracts that enable us to mitigate the risk of inflation. We have contingencies behind those contracts to account for scope creep and unknowns. The other 18% is from projects that are currently pending guaranteed maximum contracts that are in process, and those disclosures include larger contingency allowances. The voracious demand for high-quality life science assets in key cluster markets led to a highly competitive bid for our 100 Binney asset. Our excellent execution led to our third asset sold with a valuation exceeding $1 billion, and the fourth to achieve a sub-4% cap rate. We sold a 70% interest in the 432,932 square foot lab office building anchored with long-term credit tenants for a purchase price based on a total valuation of  through which we received proceeds exceeding $700 million. The cash cap rate was a record for our capital recycling program at 3.5% and enabled us to harvest a profit of approximately $410 million. The price per square foot of $2,356 exceeds the record price we set last quarter in the sale of 50 Binney to 60 Binney in by 3.7%, which is meaningful considering the uncertain interest rate environment we were and continue to be in during the quarter and the disruption caused by Russia's and Beijing of the Ukraine that happened on February 24. With that, I'll pass it over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported very strong operating and financial results for the first quarter of 2022, highlighting that we are off to a great start and on track for 8% plus growth in FFO per share. Now this is impressive considering the consistency of bottom-line growth year after year and following the historic year in 2021 of operating and financial performance and significant achievement of historic milestones. We reported first quarter 2022 revenues of $576.9 million or $2.3 billion annualized, up 24.4% over the first quarter of '21, and NOI was up 22.7% over the first quarter of '21, highlighting very strong growth and outstanding execution by our team. Bottom line, we beat consensus this quarter and raised our outlook for FFO per share growth to 8%. More on this in a moment. Alexandria has tremendous scale in key innovation cluster submarkets across the country that allows us to provide optionality for innovative life science entities looking for high-quality laboratory space from a trusted partner. We have a very high quality and diverse tenant roster consisting of over 1,000 tenants that provides Alexandria a unique and strong position to address current and expansion space requirements. We continue to reap the benefits from these attributes as shown in our continued strong operating and financial results. We generated a REIT industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin of 71%, highlighting highly efficient execution by our team. Occupancy was up 70 basis points to 94.7% since December 31, and our team is on track to achieve our exceptional growth in occupancy by the end of 2022 of 150 basis points in comparison to 12/31/21. Now the key takeaway from our leasing activity in the first quarter beyond achieving the second highest leasing volume in the company's history, is that the strong rental rate growth in the first quarter of 39.8% and 23.2% was higher than the annual rental rate growth reported for the full year of 2021 and 2020. We are also on track to hit our very strong rental rate growth projections for 2022 ranging from 30% to 35% and 18% to 23% on a cash basis. Same-property NOI growth continues to benefit from strong demand from our tenants as they look to renew and expand with Alexandria.  We reported same-property NOI growth of 7.6% and 7.3% on a cash basis. The primary driver of this exceptional performance was strong rental rate growth on renewals and re-leasing of space in recent quarters, a larger impact this quarter from a number of leases, and same-property NOI in the first quarter also benefited from 110 basis points in growth in occupancy. And for the full year of 2022, we expect a total of 150-basis-point increase in same-property occupancy. During the first quarter, $36 million of annual net operating income commenced on average on February 14 related to the 567,000 rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that were completed and placed into service, including a couple of projects that were completed earlier than projected. We completed acquisitions in the first quarter, aggregating 7.3 million square feet of development and redevelopment opportunities. Acquisitions in the first quarter also included some operating rentable square feet that added $75 million in annual net operating income that commenced on average on January 23. Now looking forward, our team has uniquely positioned Alexandria with excellent visibility of growth within the REIT industry with $665 million of incremental annual rental revenue to commence from the second quarter through the first quarter of '25. Now this represents significant year-over-year growth in net operating income for 2022, 2023 and 2024, from deliveries of development and redevelopment projects for the next 12 quarters. This represents 8 million rentable square feet that is 77% leased under advanced lease negotiation or subject to an executed LOI.  We are pleased to have a super strong and flexible balance sheet, with credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry. As of March 31, we had $5.7 billion of liquidity, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be 5.1x by the end of the year, representing a slight improvement from 5.2x as of the beginning of 2022. And our fixed charge coverage ratio is expected to be very solid at greater than or equal to 5.1x. And we remain disciplined with our strategy for long-term funding our business, with a focus on maximizing bottom line growth, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet and reinvesting capital from real estate dispositions and partial interest sales and intend to minimize the issuance of common stock. A typical operating property at stabilization of NOI for Alexandria would generally require long-term funding with 35% to 40% debt and 60% to 65% equity capital.  Now the 60% to 65% amount of equity capital is much higher than Alexandra's average common equity issuances over the past 5 years, which has ranged roughly between 40% and 45% of our capital plan. The key reason for a lower amount of common stock issuances is due to the significant amount of value we monetize through real estate sales and partial interest sales for reinvestment into our business. Importantly, common stock issuances for 2022 is projected to be lower than the 5-year average of 45% of our capital plan due to the continued execution of real estate sales, both 100% outright sales and partial interest sales. Now as Peter Moglia highlighted, 100 Binney Street achieved a record $1 billion valuation based upon the partial interest sale of 70% of the property. We generated almost 140% profit on this development project that we built a handful of years ago, truly spectacular value creation and opportunity to reinvest capital back into our business.  We also have another advanced negotiation for a sale of approximately $350 million range, plus up to an additional $1.5 billion plus in real estate sales and partial interest sales targeted for the remainder of the year. We are very pleased with our very proactive and opportunistic bond offering consisting of $1.8 billion in 30-year and 12-year unsecured notes, with a weighted average rate of 3.28% in a term of 22 years. Now to put this into perspective, if we had to issue 10-year and 30-year unsecured notes today, the rate would be in the low 4% and mid-4% range, respectively. Importantly, we remain on track for continued improvement in our balance sheet and credit profile. Now realized gains included in FFO from venture investments were $23.1 million in the first quarter, and over the last 4 quarters were $104.4 million or $26.1 million per quarter. Unrealized losses this quarter were $264.4 million, reflecting a decline in fair value of venture investments. Importantly, unrealized gains in our venture investments were $533 million as of March 31. Our team continues with their journey and leadership in ESG. Our next annual ESG report will be released in a couple of months in June. Key ESG leadership highlights since year-end include Alexandria's ranked the number 5 . 685 Gateway located in our South San Francisco submarket, which is on track to achieve zero energy certification, was awarded and recognized for excellence in wood building design by Woodworks. Alexandria earned the first ever fit well life science certification at 300 Technology Square located at the Alexandria Technology Square mega campus in our Cambridge submarket.  We received lead platinum certification at 9080 Campus Point Drive, which is home to GredLabs, a dynamic proprietary platform purpose-built to accelerate the growth of promising life science companies. And our team is executing on the construction of what has been designed to be the most sustainable laboratory building located at 325 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Now strong operating and financial results for the first quarter supports our improved outlook for 2022, with EPS diluted ranging from $1.08 to $1.18 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted from a range from $8.33 to $8.43 up 8% plus over 2021 at the midpoint of guidance. Now we increased GAAP same-property NOI growth by 40 basis points to a range of 5.9% to 7.9%. Straight-line rent is up $4 million to a range from $154 million to $164 million, and we increased the upper range of guidance by $500 million for real estate sales and partial interest sales to a range from $1.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our outlook for the full year of 2022.  Thank you, and I'll turn it back to Joel.\nJoel Marcus : So with that, operator, if we could open it up to questions.\nOperator:  And our first question will come from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America.\nJamie Feldman: So I guess just a big picture here. There's been a lot of concern on the biotech funding outlook in light of capital markets volatility. It's sort the CRO stocks at the life science stocks. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on how this might be impacting demand, the funding backdrop, any signs of weakness in areas? And then also, just thinking about leasing timing, are you seeing any delay in lease decision-making? Just how should we be thinking about reading the tea lease here?\nJoel Marcus : Yes, Jamie, thanks for the question. I think what I said in the prepared remarks is I think how you should frame the cornerstone and kind of bedrock demand situation; I think you've got haves and have not. So the have nots, as I said, our company's public companies by and large because most private companies are generally well financed and the venture firms have raised mountains of capital. So they've got pretty long runways. But I think people who've gone public and some of who went public too soon, are caught in a bit of a squeeze with cash burn, either if they're preclinical or somewhat into the clinic at various stages and maybe don't have early readouts of data. And so, for those, I think you can expect they will not be on track to expand. And in fact, some will contract and reduce their workforce and maybe their space. We've seen some of that in different markets. But I think it's fair to say that the haves are those companies that are the big cap companies, big pharma, plus the companies that have reached commercial stage are really very flush with cash, and we see no real change in growth trajectories of those companies plus many in the private side who've raised massive amounts of cash. So I think you're going to find that operators who have leased to, and I can think of 1 group in Boston who lease to a variety, thank goodness, not us, of course, lease in new construction, lease to a variety of companies that are in the clinical stage, they're seeing -- I can think of this 1 building, I won't say who the operator is, so I don't -- it's not in Cambridge, it's out in the burbs. But they're going to see many of their tenants either sublease or try to give space back. So I think it's a tale of 2 worlds and luckily, we're, I think, extremely well positioned in that. Hello, operator?\nOperator: Next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore.\nSheila McGrath: I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on the partial sale where in-place rents might have compared to market and the weighted average lease term in that building? And was the pricing set before the shift in interest rates or just on the timing there?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. So Peter, do you want to handle that?\nPeter Moglia : Yes, sure. No, the pricing was set during the heat of everything, the war, interest rate volatility. So it is reflective of today's market conditions. The -- I don't know what the -- I don't have the  memorized, but just looking at the top 2 leases, it was very likely close to 10 years, probably maybe 9. So definitely a long time before you realize any upside. And there is upside there probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about 27%, 28%. The rents were overall below market. But again, I think the price is reflective of the fact that someone is going to have to live with that return for a while. The credit there was really good. So there's nothing to worry about. But it was a very fair price considering the amount of demand is looking for high-quality projects, and that was probably the most high-quality project anyone could have found this year.\nJoel Marcus : Yes. I mean, perfect tremendous location in the heart of Cambridge, brand-new construction more or less. And as Peter said, pretty good lease duration with very strong credit. So a real iconic, I think, investment.\nSheila McGrath: Okay. That's great. And then just curious, inflation everybody, is talking about it. Wondering like when you look at new projects, would you consider most of your leases are with 3% escalators. Would you consider having a minimum with tied to inflation or that's just not the market?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. So I'll come in and then maybe ask Steve and Peter to comment. So over the history of Alexandria, we've kept kind of 2 approaches. One has been annual rental escalations, generally 3%, sometimes a little less, sometimes it's more, but average about 3%. And during different time periods, we have gone to a minimum, maximum of minimum 3 and max 6 based on CPI. We are involved in a number of negotiations where those -- both of those are being discussed, and you will likely see some of those over time. But I don't know, Peter or Steve, if you guys have any other color on that.\nStephen Richardson : Yes. Joel, just to echo that, it's Steve, Sheila. That's exactly what we're doing. And we're being very targeted and thoughtful with the particular segments of the portfolio that we might do that for. So we think it's going to be very fair and reasonable. And so far, it's been understood and well received. So just at the beginning of the process here.\nOperator: The next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi.\nManny Korchman: Peter, maybe 1 for you. Just as you think about which assets you want to keep, you guys have used the term iconic when referring to 100 Binney, how do you think about keeping iconic assets versus selling iconic assets? And especially in a market like that, that is so supply constrained, part of me wants to say why not keep the longer-term upside there, and part of it is you're getting a 3.5% cap rate. So how do you weigh all that?\nPeter Moglia : Yes. I mean as you said on the latter part of your comments, I mean being able to take advantage of market conditions where you can get a sub-4 cap rate and then plug that back into your next iconic asset at a 6 plus, it's just -- it's hard not to do that. And remember, we are keeping a pretty material part of each of these assets that we're selling. We are also accrue fees. And so there's some operating leverage that we can achieve there. So it is -- you look at the market, you see what you can monetize at the best price. And you only make that decision, though, if you have opportunities to reinvest that in something that's special. And if you look at our development pipeline today, we think it is full of the next wave of iconic assets. So we don't want to get too in love with things that are legacy. We appreciate them. We, again, don't sell them in whole, but there are other frontiers for us to conquer, and such as the Fenway where we believe there's going to be an incredible rent growth and appreciation as well. So we need to get the cash to make those accretive investments, and we pick carefully, but strategically.\nManny Korchman: And then maybe on that deal specifically, how much was about managing tenant risk, if at all, with selling BSM and then having new projects with BSM coming in at the same time. I'm sorry, the tenant risk with BMS? Was a bit about managing your Bristol-Myers exposure? Or did that not --\nJoel Marcus : Not at all. Not at all.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC.\nRich Anderson: So on the topic of dispositions, as much as $2.6 billion potentially this year. Last year, you had a whole lot of activity at the end of the year. year before, I think you did about $1 billion. So you're clearly identifying with some opportunities to raise capital in that format. But with rising interest rates and all that talk, do you think 2022 will be more of a ratable sort of level of dispositions across the year? Or do you think it could still be lumped towards the back half of the year, maybe in the sense of urgency to get some things done before just rates perhaps do play a role on cap rates?\nJoel Marcus : Dean, you want to --\nDean Shigenaga: Rich, maybe it's helpful to look back to last year, just to give some context to the late year transactions. And you might recall our commentary over the last few quarters. The reason why we had a number of transactions really weighted into December last year had everything to do with specific leases that were significant to the transactions being extended and it was super important to complete that before we went out and got deep in the marketing of the underlying asset for sale. And so a number of those transactions had that aspect, which delayed the transaction for execution until later in the year, but it was an important component to the valuation as well. So as you can imagine, important to get done. This year, we don't have that same issue across the transactions we're looking at today. So I think you'll see it be a little bit more spread out through the year than you did last year by far. We don't have those same challenges this year, Rich.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Great. And, Joel, you mentioned your haves and have nots comment. But one name that jumped out to me when speaking internally with my -- our biotech team was a name like Novartis, which is kind of registers as 1 larger cap name in your top 10 that is seeing some significant layoffs. I'm curious if you guys have any comment about their situation specifically as it relates to demand? And any examples of larger cap names that despite your comments might also be considering some significant levels of employee reduction.\nJoel Marcus : Well, I mean, Novartis is one of the strongest, certainly, pharma companies in the world and certainly one of the strongest companies in the world. All companies of large size, as you know, from your long history in this industry go through rationalizations of different groups. I mean, Glaxo is an example, sold their oncology group at 1 point, which was a core, seemed to me to be kind of an odd thing to do. And then later on, essentially kind of restarted it. Different people are shuffling around different lines of businesses whether they be high-value ethical pharmaceuticals or more commodity-type products. So I think I would view that as having nothing to do with the the industry itself, the state of the industry at this point, but rather a rationalization of that company's own operations. And whenever you get a new CEO or a change, a number of these companies kind of shift focus. And so that's something else that you're seeing from time to time. But I wouldn't read anything into that in particular.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And then real quick, Peter, I think, as you said -- or maybe it was even Joel that said development yields are modestly -- development yields are modestly up for you. I assume that's not a comment generally about the industry. So do you have a sense, based on all the things you talked about, about delays about how far down development yields have come for your competition, not so much you?\nPeter Moglia : Joel, do you want me to take that?\nJoel Marcus : Yes, please.\nPeter Moglia : Yes, Rich, the -- I think we -- just getting back to my comments, our team has done an incredible job in helping to mitigate cost escalations. And locking things in early. And so because of that and because of the rent growth that we've experienced in all of our markets, we've been able to marginally increase our yields, as Joel mentioned. I -- what other people are doing, I'm not sure. They don't -- certainly don't have the scale advantage that we have, the relationships that we have, probably not even close to the personnel we have. So I'd imagine that they wouldn't be able to do the same thing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Rodgers of Baird.\nDave Rodgers: Just again, with your comments about maybe recession as well as the have not. Maybe this question is for Peter. Is there anywhere on the life science investment sales spectrum that's being impacted by those types of comments or by interest rates and spreads? And I guess I'm just trying to get a better understanding if there's other competitive assets where maybe we're just not seeing enough of a spread between what's trading, and any examples you might have off the top of your head?\nPeter Moglia : I can tell you, I mean I was looking at our comp database yesterday, just seeing what changed from quarter-to-quarter. There's -- a lot of things are still trading with the quality of tenancies completely all over the place, and things are getting for cap rates or more just a certain portfolio that BioMed sold in San Diego with a lot of cats and dogs was a sub-5 cap rate. So there is a lot of demand for exposure to life science assets. And so, unfortunately, for a number of investors, tenant quality probably hasn't been the focus. But we -- rest assured anyone who is looking at our portfolio, we -- our tenants are highly vetted and that doesn't become a question. It's more about the location and lease expiration. Tenant quality is usually soon to be great because it is.\nDave Rodgers: And then maybe just 1 follow-up question. I don't hope this is for Dean or maybe Steve, but it looks like Apple and Alphabet joined the top tenant list. I don't know if that was a function of acquisitions or perhaps sales or just new leases there, but they had some shorter duration. So I was curious if those were added and if those were kind of intermediate term redevelopment opportunities or just kind of good stand-alone investments?\nJoel Marcus : Yes, this is Joel. Yes. The answer is yes and yes.\nOperator: Next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: Just real quick back on to the have nots. I think Joel, you were mentioning that there might be some have nots to have to give back space in the suburban markets of Boston. I mean how much of that could come back to the market? Is it big enough to alter any of these markets where you could see vacancy rates kind of uptick? Or is it just more of a one-off type thing?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. I don't think it's -- we haven't seen any sign that it's a material impact, and we'll monitor that quarter-to-quarter. So I think, right now, it's pretty building and location specific and, obviously, tenant specific. But we haven't seen anything that I would say material as an overall trend at this time.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then related to the have nots. I mean, I think in your prepared remarks, you said is basically companies that went public too quickly. What about the small to mid-cap private companies that you kind of indicated? Did they raise enough equity or capital, so they're really not an issue? Or is it more a muddle than that? It's kind of depending on the company that we're talking about?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. So certainly, not all companies I would put in, they went to -- went public too early. I would probably put those on preclinical. So if you've not even entered the clinic, and you're going public, probably that's too early. I mean it's obviously case-specific, depends on what the technology is, what the opportunity is, what your shareholder base is from the private side and so forth. But by and large, there's a host of those that were preclinical that just went too early, maybe grew too fast and realized they still got the clinical ahead of them. And then those that went public in the clinic, I think that's generally been a good game plan, but then didn't realize that after 9 years, I mean, I've been saying that for a while, a 9-year bull market in the sector just doesn't continue unabated. So it tends to rationalize itself. And as I said, 5x the capital volume was being raised and kind of went into the industry, which is a lot. On the private side, as I say, many -- I mean, again, it's very case specific, but many of the companies who have blue-chip founder groups or investor groups who've raised large pools of money have good runway. So generally, a lot of those are not going to suffer maybe some of the challenges that may face a host of the public companies in the have-not sector, if you will.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Great. And then just last 1 for me. Steve, you kind of highlighted in your prepared remarks that there's no projects under construction that will be delivered in 2024 at least as of now. I mean, when would a developer actually need a break ground or go vertical to achieve the 2024 delivery date? Do they have another, what, 6-plus months or so? Is that kind of fair to say?\nStephen Richardson : Michael, it's Steve. Yes, I think it's within that window. And the key is whether someone is going to actually start doing that and going vertical to deliver in that time frame. And what we've really done is drill down to the capital behind these operators. Obviously, the operators are going to be positive and bullish. But we just haven't seen that from the capital sources actually committing capital as of today.\nOperator: Next question comes from Daniel Ismail of Green Street Advisors.\nDaniel Ismail: Great. Maybe going back to 100 Binney Street and the cap rate compression in Cambridge. I'm curious if you're seeing a similar level of price appreciation across markets, or are any markets accelerating? Or maybe moving slower than that clip you guys you're seeing in Cambridge?\nJoel Marcus : Well, yes, I'll ask maybe Peter and Steve. I would say, on your end, I think you guys need to revisit our NAV. I think you guys are off. But in any case, I think it's -- when you look at Binney, Binney is in the heart of the Kendall Square and Cambridge epicenter. So the cap rate there is not real surprising for relatively new construction, high credit quality and just an iconic location and building. And I think you can see across most of our markets, cap rates have held, I think, very strong and continue to be very positive in our favor. But I'd ask Steve and Peter to comment more detailed. Yes.\nPeter Moglia : Yes. This is Peter. All the markets where there -- I guess, said another way, none of the markets we're in would have a cap rate that would have anything greater than a  handle on it, which is, as you know, remarkably different from a couple of years ago when people were thinking certain markets had 6% or 7%. Some of those markets now are in the 4s or 5s. So I would generally just say, as Joel mentioned, Cambridge is a special place. There are going to be a few submarkets where you probably go below 4% to the mid-3s like we just did. But who knows? I mean there's certainly a lot of money chasing these assets and the competition for high-quality assets, when the investors are thinking, \"Hey, there's great rent growth here. I'll pay the price for it today,\" who knows? We could certainly see breaking through 4% in other markets. But in general, cap rates for lab are like industrial, like logistics, storage or apartments. I mean it's just a hot industry. There's a lot of money out there to be invested and they want to bet on winners and winners are expenses.\nDaniel Ismail: Maybe the last point, I'm curious across those property sectors you mentioned, we've been noticing cap rates go either at or below borrowing costs. And I'm curious if that's a similar dynamic you're noticing across life science as well. I assume 100 Binney is -- I believe it's unencumbered, but I would assume that the debt would be closer to that cash cap rate or if not a smidge below?\nPeter Moglia : Well, you bring up a good a good point that actually we don't really talk about too much. But I mean, yes, our large partial interest sales are done with partners that are not buying with leverage. So they're putting this money to work and not looking to lever it up. They're accepting these returns. -- frankly, we don't go into the secured market and buy anything on a levered basis. So kind of hard for me to comment, but I would imagine just seeing where rates are today, that negative leverage is probably the only leverage available if you want to buy a really high-quality asset.\nDaniel Ismail: Great. And then maybe just last 1 for me. On the Mercer Mega Block, can you remind us if the plan was always to bring in a partner? And if so, why not retain the entirety of that development for ARE?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. Peter, you could comment.\nPeter Moglia : Sure. We have a strategic partner in a couple of nearby assets that made a lot of sense for them to participate with us. I can't really go into the details. They'll become apparent later on. But this is a partner that is -- we're in multiple markets with. They have a lot of trust in us. They're a great source of capital that's very attractive compared to common, and they were highly interested in getting involved, and we're keeping the majority share there, but it's also a good opportunity for us to finance something upfront rather than after the fact to keep the capital flowing to other projects as well.\nJoel Marcus : I would also say we've seen great activity with credit tenants in that -- for that location.\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America.\nJamie Feldman: I appreciate your color on the construction pipeline, breaking out '23, '24 and beyond. Would you say that your appetite for speculative has changed at all in the last 6 months or so or even the last 3 months, just given it seems to be a growing pipeline and maybe more questions on the demand side?\nJoel Marcus : Well, I think, Jamie, somebody mentioned, I don't know, or if not, we haven't really done speculative development since before the '08-'09 crisis when we were forced under contract in New York. We're building 2 towers. We stop one after Lehman collapsed, we built the East Tower. And then luckily, we secured Eli Lilly is our anchor tenant there. But we haven't generally built specs since then. And when we tend to put up, if we go vertical, we generally always have either a signed lease, signed LOI, or we have, as a case of one project I can think of a series of companies who have told us they need growth at this point, and we've decided to go forward and working through the mechanics of documenting that. But we wouldn't just put up steel on the hope that they will come, not because of the current market, but we just haven't done that as a matter of policy in the company for literally more than a decade.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. That's helpful. And then if you think about your investment activity in the quarter, the projects you bought or even some of the more covered land plays, is it safe to assume there's also tenant interest in those projects, or the stuff you've been buying really is kind of a future land bank without the tenant in mind?\nJoel Marcus : Generally, we like to -- I can think of a number of situations in San Diego or other markets where absolutely specifically or the Bay Area, the Peninsula, where we have specific tenant interest. Remember, Peter, Steve and Dean have all mentioned, we've got now more than 1,000 innovative tenants. So the amount of information and the amount of requirements really come to us in a way that there's nobody else that could marshal that kind of a resource. And that gives us the confidence to make some moves where we know that we will be successful. There have been a recent -- we're not going to confirm or deny anything, but a recent San Francisco Peninsula report on something on a project we're doing there, and that we have signed an LOI. I mean that's a good example. And again, I won't confirm or deny, but that's an example of if that was true, where it makes sense to do what we did. And that's kind of how we operate.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And then I was going to ask a follow-up to my original question on this call, which was, you started talking about the haves and have nots. Is there a way to handicap the -- like the percentage of the portfolio NOI that even is what you would consider more at risk type tenants?\nJoel Marcus : When you say more at risk, what do you mean?\nJamie Feldman: Well, you had talked about tenants that either -- maybe they're running -- they may run out of capital to fund their pipeline. Just not as well capitalized and so may end up needing some sort of recapitalization or running out of capital.\nJoel Marcus : No, we diligence tenants before we sign leases or even letters of intent, and we monitor them oftentimes usually quarterly, but sometimes monthly. And if you look at -- on Page 17 of the supplement, we give you a breakdown of our tenants. Half of our tenants are investment grade or large cap. We've got about 7% of the portfolio, which is private. We feel very good about the majority of -- the vast majority of those companies because they generally well-funded, and they've got a pathway for additional funding. We've got -- in our public biotech, the vast majority of those, again, are well funded with cash runways that go out, oftentimes beyond leases. And if not, certainly multiple years or are waiting for readouts oftentimes for Phase III. So we feel pretty good about where we are. And if there's anybody that runs into a problem, we kind of know about it. I mean, a good example might be Nektar, which had a is in our Mission Bay portfolio. We have watched them for quite a while. We're very close to them. They're going to, I think, sublease their office space, which is with Kilroy. They've got  space with us. That project is partnered, but we already have demand for backfilling that space should they decide to give it up, but they said they're going to keep a big chunk of their lab space, so I wouldn't expect them to give the majority of that up. So we've already -- I mean that might be an example of something you're referring to. We're already well ahead of the curve there and could backfill that space probably at much higher rates.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And then on that lease, so 2030, I believe?\nJoel Marcus : Yes, I don't have it in front of me, but it's a long-term lease. And the truth of the matter is, in some cases, and I would never say that with specifics to Nektar. But sometimes, you might hope a company would decide to give up a lease because you could backfill it at a much higher rate. So some of that you'll see happen, I'm sure in -- I mean mission-based still, the vacancy rate there is literally 0 at this point for built-out lab space. And so the demand is significant. There's a high credit quality in that submarket that has a huge pent-up demand for space. I'll tell you that.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone: So I just want to make sure I understand what the -- again, this have, have not discussion. And then looking at your mark -- your mark-to-market of the overall portfolio. I think it was pretty flat from what you mentioned last quarter, I think 31% and now about 30%. So are market rents still going up? Or have market rents kind of just holding steady at this point? And what is the outlook for the rest of the year?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. So, Steve, you could comment on that.\nStephen Richardson : Yes. Tony, it's Steve here. Yes, I don't know that drilling down on one specific quarter really tells a trend there. You are right. It's generally flat, but it's flat from an exceptional perspective. I mean, maintaining a 30% mark-to-market, I think, is extremely healthy. Look, again, as I said before, we are still in very low single-digit vacancies in these core markets, particularly for Alexandria's portfolio as you see with our occupancy. We continue to see healthy demand. So our expectation is we will continue to see pricing power in the market.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Great. And then just last 1 for me. You closed on your Texas investment in the foray there. Can you tell us where you went?\nA \u2013Joel Marcus : Yes. So let me comment maybe on your first question first and then your second question. So I think if you \u2013 if somebody owns assets, I think the assets, and we\u2019ve seen this in other cycles that are going to be the most at risk will be buildings in non-cluster environments, one-off buildings in suburbs and so forth that are not really high-quality buildings or in the best of locations. And so I think those are the ones that may end up \u2013 they\u2019re getting probably the poorest quality tenants and the ones that may have a struggle there. And luckily, we don\u2019t have much of that at all in our entire portfolio. With respect to Texas, we\u2019re still under a series of transactions. So I\u2019m unable legally to comment on that, but I do hope that, at the next call, I said that last call, but we\u2019re still in pending transaction. But hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to give you color on the next call, Tony.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus : Simply to say thank you, everybody, be safe and God bless.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported very strong operating and financial results for the first quarter of 2022, highlighting that we are off to a great start and on track for 8% plus growth in FFO per share. Now this is impressive considering the consistency of bottom-line growth year after year and following the historic year in 2021 of operating and financial performance and significant achievement of historic milestones. We reported first quarter 2022 revenues of $576.9 million or $2.3 billion annualized, up 24.4% over the first quarter of '21, and NOI was up 22.7% over the first quarter of '21, highlighting very strong growth and outstanding execution by our team. Bottom line, we beat consensus this quarter and raised our outlook for FFO per share growth to 8%. More on this in a moment. Alexandria has tremendous scale in key innovation cluster submarkets across the country that allows us to provide optionality for innovative life science entities looking for high-quality laboratory space from a trusted partner. We have a very high quality and diverse tenant roster consisting of over 1,000 tenants that provides Alexandria a unique and strong position to address current and expansion space requirements. We continue to reap the benefits from these attributes as shown in our continued strong operating and financial results. We generated a REIT industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin of 71%, highlighting highly efficient execution by our team. Occupancy was up 70 basis points to 94.7% since December 31, and our team is on track to achieve our exceptional growth in occupancy by the end of 2022 of 150 basis points in comparison to 12/31/21. Now the key takeaway from our leasing activity in the first quarter beyond achieving the second highest leasing volume in the company's history, is that the strong rental rate growth in the first quarter of 39.8% and 23.2% was higher than the annual rental rate growth reported for the full year of 2021 and 2020. We are also on track to hit our very strong rental rate growth projections for 2022 ranging from 30% to 35% and 18% to 23% on a cash basis. Same-property NOI growth continues to benefit from strong demand from our tenants as they look to renew and expand with Alexandria.  We reported same-property NOI growth of 7.6% and 7.3% on a cash basis. The primary driver of this exceptional performance was strong rental rate growth on renewals and re-leasing of space in recent quarters, a larger impact this quarter from a number of leases, and same-property NOI in the first quarter also benefited from 110 basis points in growth in occupancy. And for the full year of 2022, we expect a total of 150-basis-point increase in same-property occupancy. During the first quarter, $36 million of annual net operating income commenced on average on February 14 related to the 567,000 rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that were completed and placed into service, including a couple of projects that were completed earlier than projected. We completed acquisitions in the first quarter, aggregating 7.3 million square feet of development and redevelopment opportunities. Acquisitions in the first quarter also included some operating rentable square feet that added $75 million in annual net operating income that commenced on average on January 23. Now looking forward, our team has uniquely positioned Alexandria with excellent visibility of growth within the REIT industry with $665 million of incremental annual rental revenue to commence from the second quarter through the first quarter of '25. Now this represents significant year-over-year growth in net operating income for 2022, 2023 and 2024, from deliveries of development and redevelopment projects for the next 12 quarters. This represents 8 million rentable square feet that is 77% leased under advanced lease negotiation or subject to an executed LOI.  We are pleased to have a super strong and flexible balance sheet, with credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry. As of March 31, we had $5.7 billion of liquidity, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be 5.1x by the end of the year, representing a slight improvement from 5.2x as of the beginning of 2022. And our fixed charge coverage ratio is expected to be very solid at greater than or equal to 5.1x. And we remain disciplined with our strategy for long-term funding our business, with a focus on maximizing bottom line growth, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet and reinvesting capital from real estate dispositions and partial interest sales and intend to minimize the issuance of common stock. A typical operating property at stabilization of NOI for Alexandria would generally require long-term funding with 35% to 40% debt and 60% to 65% equity capital.  Now the 60% to 65% amount of equity capital is much higher than Alexandra's average common equity issuances over the past 5 years, which has ranged roughly between 40% and 45% of our capital plan. The key reason for a lower amount of common stock issuances is due to the significant amount of value we monetize through real estate sales and partial interest sales for reinvestment into our business. Importantly, common stock issuances for 2022 is projected to be lower than the 5-year average of 45% of our capital plan due to the continued execution of real estate sales, both 100% outright sales and partial interest sales. Now as Peter Moglia highlighted, 100 Binney Street achieved a record $1 billion valuation based upon the partial interest sale of 70% of the property. We generated almost 140% profit on this development project that we built a handful of years ago, truly spectacular value creation and opportunity to reinvest capital back into our business.  We also have another advanced negotiation for a sale of approximately $350 million range, plus up to an additional $1.5 billion plus in real estate sales and partial interest sales targeted for the remainder of the year. We are very pleased with our very proactive and opportunistic bond offering consisting of $1.8 billion in 30-year and 12-year unsecured notes, with a weighted average rate of 3.28% in a term of 22 years. Now to put this into perspective, if we had to issue 10-year and 30-year unsecured notes today, the rate would be in the low 4% and mid-4% range, respectively. Importantly, we remain on track for continued improvement in our balance sheet and credit profile. Now realized gains included in FFO from venture investments were $23.1 million in the first quarter, and over the last 4 quarters were $104.4 million or $26.1 million per quarter. Unrealized losses this quarter were $264.4 million, reflecting a decline in fair value of venture investments. Importantly, unrealized gains in our venture investments were $533 million as of March 31. Our team continues with their journey and leadership in ESG. Our next annual ESG report will be released in a couple of months in June. Key ESG leadership highlights since year-end include Alexandria's ranked the number 5 . 685 Gateway located in our South San Francisco submarket, which is on track to achieve zero energy certification, was awarded and recognized for excellence in wood building design by Woodworks. Alexandria earned the first ever fit well life science certification at 300 Technology Square located at the Alexandria Technology Square mega campus in our Cambridge submarket.  We received lead platinum certification at 9080 Campus Point Drive, which is home to GredLabs, a dynamic proprietary platform purpose-built to accelerate the growth of promising life science companies. And our team is executing on the construction of what has been designed to be the most sustainable laboratory building located at 325 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Now strong operating and financial results for the first quarter supports our improved outlook for 2022, with EPS diluted ranging from $1.08 to $1.18 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted from a range from $8.33 to $8.43 up 8% plus over 2021 at the midpoint of guidance. Now we increased GAAP same-property NOI growth by 40 basis points to a range of 5.9% to 7.9%. Straight-line rent is up $4 million to a range from $154 million to $164 million, and we increased the upper range of guidance by $500 million for real estate sales and partial interest sales to a range from $1.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our outlook for the full year of 2022.  Thank you, and I'll turn it back to Joel. Rich, maybe it's helpful to look back to last year, just to give some context to the late year transactions. And you might recall our commentary over the last few quarters. The reason why we had a number of transactions really weighted into December last year had everything to do with specific leases that were significant to the transactions being extended and it was super important to complete that before we went out and got deep in the marketing of the underlying asset for sale. And so a number of those transactions had that aspect, which delayed the transaction for execution until later in the year, but it was an important component to the valuation as well. So as you can imagine, important to get done. This year, we don't have that same issue across the transactions we're looking at today. So I think you'll see it be a little bit more spread out through the year than you did last year by far. We don't have those same challenges this year, Rich."

            "name": "Stephen Richardson",
            "content": "Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everybody. Steve Richardson here. As we bring Q1 2022 to a close, I'd like to highlight 2 critical factors driving the continued momentum and success of Alexandria. One is the demand for Alexandria's unique and highly differentiated facilities. Operational excellence services and mega campus offerings continues at a very COVID and post-COVID level, with leasing during Q1 totaling 2.5 million square feet. And within that total, 1.4 million square feet in our development and redevelopment pipeline. This activity is the second highest quarterly leasing volume in company history in each of these 2 categories following historically high leasing during 2021 and particularly Q4 2021.  And two, importantly, the exceptional quality and long-term nature of Alexandria's leasing results overall and especially this quarter, is truly noteworthy in 1 to double underline. We signed a long-term lease for a ground-up Class A laboratory office flagship facility comprising 427,000 rentable square feet with Bristol-Myers Squibb a company with a market cap of $164 billion as they chose Alexandria to design, build and operate their mission-critical innovative research hub at our Campus Point Mega campus.  Let me just say that this type of outcome is the result of Alexandria's historic pioneering efforts in establishing the life science asset class, we started working with BMS during 1998 some 24 years ago and began building trust and confidence at every level of the organization. Bristol-Myers Squibb is now our top tenant and present in 5 of Alexandria's core clusters, a truly unique partnership and a distinct and compelling competitive advantage. The entirety of Alexandria's brand value and BMS's decision to select Alexandria was crystallized with this inspiring achievement. First, a deep and meaningful trusted and mutually respectful historical relationship with further cemented. Second, the unique ability to scale a facility featuring design and infrastructure was realized; and third, a marquee destination at campus point with a highly curated and first-class suite of amenities to meet BMS's imperative and to retain and recruit the absolute best talent sets a new mega campus gold standard.  We also signed this quarter another Class A plus laboratory office facility comprising 334,000 rentable square feet at our Seaport campus with Eli Lilly, a company with a market cap of $280 billion, for their state-of-the-art Institute for genetic medicine. Eli Lilly is a similarly exceptional story. Our teams first worked with Lilly during 2000, and embarked upon a journey together to create world-class laboratory office facilities in 5 of our core clusters as well as the Lilly's team pursues its cutting-edge research. The foundational work during these past 22 years provided a bedrock of trust, and enabled our teams to envision the profoundly positive impact upon Lilly's ability to compete for the best and brightest scientific and entrepreneurial talent in the greater Boston cluster, with a premier high-visibility waterfront site offering expansion optionality, adjacency to transit and unparalleled amenities in an iconic design certain to be a landmark for generations. These are showcase examples of Alexandria's formidable and irreplaceable position deeply embedded within the life science ecosystem. The strength of our internal growth engine is unassailable. We have now more than 1,000, tenants providing us with unmatched insight into not only their current and future space needs, but more importantly, the ability to stay ahead of the curve to deliver sophisticated operational expertise for these mission-critical facilities and curate the precise amenity mix to drive the holistic recruiting and retention of talent platform essential to these innovative company's success. These leasing accomplishments are a testament to the entirety of the Alexandria team's passion, commitment and unwavering work ethic towards our shared mission. And the continued demand for our facilities is also borne out by the following stellar results, growth within the core provides critical and immediate value to the company with impressive renewal and re-leasing spreads of 23.2% cash and 39.8% GAAP when excluding the block of short-term swing space for BMS as we begin construction on their flagship facility noted earlier. The portfolio mark-to-market remains strong at approximately 30%, and as we noted on the last quarterly call, this is significantly greater than the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of Q4 2020. Accounts receivable for and again, huge kudos to our best-in-class operations team. Early renewals for this quarter were 51%, somewhat below our historic rate, but a clear sign that our tenant base continues to actively seek to lock down their valuable laboratory office facilities. Healthy demand is also evidenced by the exceptional health of Alexandria's value creation pipeline.  As mentioned earlier, the 1.4 million square feet in the pipeline is the second highest total in the company's history and further contributed to the highly derisked nature of the pipeline as 77% of this 8 million square feet, which is projected to generate $665 million of incremental revenue, is leased or negotiating. Peter will provide additional detail and color on the pipeline during his comments as well. Moving on to supply and demand. Demand overall, as we highlighted during Investor Day back in December and on the Q4 '21 earnings call and now on this call, for Alexandria's mega campus continues. And our irreplaceable set of relationships and central role in the life science ecosystem positions us very well to engage and secure the very best innovative companies in the country. Market supply. We continue to monitor market supply in a granular level, including the actual assets, the operators and the capital sources behind potential projects. When we look at 2022, important to note that the vacancy rates are very low in each of our 3 largest clusters and the overall new supply is either leased or adding very incrementally, say, 1% or so in our key markets.  In 2023, projects that are actually -- and I want to emphasize actually under construction are much more modest, say 25% of what various broker reports might indicate as those reports include planned or proposed projects. The 2023 deliveries are again either leased or contributing just 3% to 4% of availability to the total market size, which will likely be further reduced during the coming quarters. And in 2024 and beyond, in these 3 markets, there are no projects actually under construction with delivery dates in this time frame. Yes, there are a number of planned or proposed projects or dirt being moved around, but we'll have to see if the operators, and more importantly, the capital partners behind these projects actually commit significant capital to the projects on a purely speculative basis to their often time inexperienced development operators. And let me finish the supply summary with a reminder of the significant difference and highly valued difference by quality life science tenants between Alexandria's Class A plus facilities as part of our fully amenitized mega campuses and one-off buildings in commodity locations. So in conclusion, the first quarter of 2022 was a very strong quarter and positions the company very well to drive immediate and long-term value through our core operating base as well as our substantially lease negotiating 8 million square foot REIT-leading development, redevelopment pipeline. With that, I'll hand it off to Peter. Yes. Joel, just to echo that, it's Steve, Sheila. That's exactly what we're doing. And we're being very targeted and thoughtful with the particular segments of the portfolio that we might do that for. So we think it's going to be very fair and reasonable. And so far, it's been understood and well received. So just at the beginning of the process here. Michael, it's Steve. Yes, I think it's within that window. And the key is whether someone is going to actually start doing that and going vertical to deliver in that time frame. And what we've really done is drill down to the capital behind these operators. Obviously, the operators are going to be positive and bullish. But we just haven't seen that from the capital sources actually committing capital as of today. Yes. Tony, it's Steve here. Yes, I don't know that drilling down on one specific quarter really tells a trend there. You are right. It's generally flat, but it's flat from an exceptional perspective. I mean, maintaining a 30% mark-to-market, I think, is extremely healthy. Look, again, as I said before, we are still in very low single-digit vacancies in these core markets, particularly for Alexandria's portfolio as you see with our occupancy. We continue to see healthy demand. So our expectation is we will continue to see pricing power in the market."

            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to today's call, April 26, 2022, previewing or highlighting our first quarter. And I want to also let everybody know with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Peter Moglia and Stephen Richardson. I want to make a shout-out happy birthday to someone very special listening here today. I want to welcome and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call, and want to wish everyone got blessings and just watching the war in Ukraine gives us pause to appreciate everything we have. The good to great author, Jim Collins has spoken about Alexandria. We have achieved 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And I want to congratulate the entire Alexandria family team on a first quarter earnings performance really by all metrics exemplifying Alexandria exceptionalism at its finest. Our -- in fact, as Jim Collins said, our superior performance.  I want to thank the entire family team as well for what they do each and every day for this mission-driven company, profoundly committed to driving forward our distinctive impact approach to address some of society's most pressing challenges through our long-standing bedrock social responsibility pillars.  As Jim said, our distinctive impact, and we have worked in these pillars, accelerating ground breaking research, medical research, harnessing the agro food ecosystem to combat hunger, empowering underserved students to achieve long-term success, bolstering the resilience of our military, conquering the opioid epidemic, building a model for comprehensive and sustainable solutions to address homelessness, one of our newest programs, addressing the mental health crisis with a focus on helping children cope with suicide loss, another new focus, and supporting museums to preserve our history and honor our greatest heros, also a new focused pillar. I want to also share that next month, May 2022, we'll celebrate our 25th anniversary of Alexandria's initial public offering since our IPO in 1997, we've maintained the highest standards of excellence and continue to drive long-term value for our stockholders, significantly outperforming major indices and companies. With the total shareholder return through the end of the year from '97 of 2,532%, which has beat the NASDAQ average for that time of 1,291%, we'd beat Warren Buffett at Berkshire during that time at 953%, the MSCI REIT index, all REIT index at 939%, the S&P 500 for that time frame, 790%, the Russell 721% and the FTSE NAREIT Office Index at 552%. As Jim Collins said, Alexandria is lasting endurance. I want to move to the first quarter, characterized by Alexandria's preserving its very strong core, while stimulating strong and continuing future growth. Alexandria continues to have pricing power in each of our core markets. As Dean will talk about, our very strong NOI growth in the first quarter and out of a sense of conservatism, we raised our midpoint of our guidance $0.02 given the macro environment. But on the other hand, we have very strong conviction for the coming 3 quarters of 2022 and the delivery of strong NOI growth, both internally and especially from our stellar external value creation pipeline. Steve will highlight our second highest leasing quarter in the company's history, and Alexandria continues to experience the strengths across each and every one of our markets here in our overall portfolio. Dean will highlight our very strong same-store performance and increased guidance as we continue to see positive occupancy gains and strong rental rate growth. With our extreme attention to each and every detail of our unique and special life science real estate business, we're seeing modest increases in our development yields as well as we're highly focused on tightly managing all aspects of our business with a tough macro environment and with rising recession risks. Today reminds me of 1979 with government policies failing the American people.  Alexandria has been very focused on tenant quality, and 50% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or publicly-traded large cap tenants. I think it's pretty amazing that Alexandria's tenants have made an astounding -- have made astounding progress in developing groundbreaking medicines. 48% of FDA novel therapy approvals have been granted to Alexandria tenants since 2017, almost half of all approvals.  The life science industry has seen the explosion of biotech over the last -- over the past decade from 2013 to 2021, with fund flows up generally 5x historical averages, advancing broadly innovative pipelines for large unmet medical needs. And every one of us knows either a family member, a friend who suffers from some form of disease still not treatable effectively with today's medicines.  The move in inflation starting in the first quarter of '21. Now we're 5 quarters into it, coupled with the myriad of problematic U.S. policies and macro threats have ended that boom. And over the last 5 quarters, what has emerged are the haves and have not. They have not or a range of small and mid-cap biotech companies with programs that are preclinical as well as many are in the clinic have seen their values drop and the open markets of the last 9 years, by and large, are closed. The haves are large biotech as well as biotechs that have reached commercial stage together with big pharma and are as flush with cash as ever being estimated to be over $500 billion of available immediate cash. Alexandria's tenant selection has been a cornerstone of our unique business model, and has enabled us to select and grow with the best and highest quality and most innovative tenants, one of the absolute bedrocks of our -- really our business model.  And with that, let me turn it over to Steve for some details on the quarter on the growth side. So with that, operator, if we could open it up to questions. Yes, Jamie, thanks for the question. I think what I said in the prepared remarks is I think how you should frame the cornerstone and kind of bedrock demand situation; I think you've got haves and have not. So the have nots, as I said, our company's public companies by and large because most private companies are generally well financed and the venture firms have raised mountains of capital. So they've got pretty long runways. But I think people who've gone public and some of who went public too soon, are caught in a bit of a squeeze with cash burn, either if they're preclinical or somewhat into the clinic at various stages and maybe don't have early readouts of data. And so, for those, I think you can expect they will not be on track to expand. And in fact, some will contract and reduce their workforce and maybe their space. We've seen some of that in different markets. But I think it's fair to say that the haves are those companies that are the big cap companies, big pharma, plus the companies that have reached commercial stage are really very flush with cash, and we see no real change in growth trajectories of those companies plus many in the private side who've raised massive amounts of cash. So I think you're going to find that operators who have leased to, and I can think of 1 group in Boston who lease to a variety, thank goodness, not us, of course, lease in new construction, lease to a variety of companies that are in the clinical stage, they're seeing -- I can think of this 1 building, I won't say who the operator is, so I don't -- it's not in Cambridge, it's out in the burbs. But they're going to see many of their tenants either sublease or try to give space back. So I think it's a tale of 2 worlds and luckily, we're, I think, extremely well positioned in that. Hello, operator? Yes. So Peter, do you want to handle that? Yes. I mean, perfect tremendous location in the heart of Cambridge, brand-new construction more or less. And as Peter said, pretty good lease duration with very strong credit. So a real iconic, I think, investment. Yes. So I'll come in and then maybe ask Steve and Peter to comment. So over the history of Alexandria, we've kept kind of 2 approaches. One has been annual rental escalations, generally 3%, sometimes a little less, sometimes it's more, but average about 3%. And during different time periods, we have gone to a minimum, maximum of minimum 3 and max 6 based on CPI. We are involved in a number of negotiations where those -- both of those are being discussed, and you will likely see some of those over time. But I don't know, Peter or Steve, if you guys have any other color on that. Not at all. Not at all. Dean, you want to -- Well, I mean, Novartis is one of the strongest, certainly, pharma companies in the world and certainly one of the strongest companies in the world. All companies of large size, as you know, from your long history in this industry go through rationalizations of different groups. I mean, Glaxo is an example, sold their oncology group at 1 point, which was a core, seemed to me to be kind of an odd thing to do. And then later on, essentially kind of restarted it. Different people are shuffling around different lines of businesses whether they be high-value ethical pharmaceuticals or more commodity-type products. So I think I would view that as having nothing to do with the the industry itself, the state of the industry at this point, but rather a rationalization of that company's own operations. And whenever you get a new CEO or a change, a number of these companies kind of shift focus. And so that's something else that you're seeing from time to time. But I wouldn't read anything into that in particular. Yes, please. Yes, this is Joel. Yes. The answer is yes and yes. Yes. I don't think it's -- we haven't seen any sign that it's a material impact, and we'll monitor that quarter-to-quarter. So I think, right now, it's pretty building and location specific and, obviously, tenant specific. But we haven't seen anything that I would say material as an overall trend at this time. Yes. So certainly, not all companies I would put in, they went to -- went public too early. I would probably put those on preclinical. So if you've not even entered the clinic, and you're going public, probably that's too early. I mean it's obviously case-specific, depends on what the technology is, what the opportunity is, what your shareholder base is from the private side and so forth. But by and large, there's a host of those that were preclinical that just went too early, maybe grew too fast and realized they still got the clinical ahead of them. And then those that went public in the clinic, I think that's generally been a good game plan, but then didn't realize that after 9 years, I mean, I've been saying that for a while, a 9-year bull market in the sector just doesn't continue unabated. So it tends to rationalize itself. And as I said, 5x the capital volume was being raised and kind of went into the industry, which is a lot. On the private side, as I say, many -- I mean, again, it's very case specific, but many of the companies who have blue-chip founder groups or investor groups who've raised large pools of money have good runway. So generally, a lot of those are not going to suffer maybe some of the challenges that may face a host of the public companies in the have-not sector, if you will. Well, yes, I'll ask maybe Peter and Steve. I would say, on your end, I think you guys need to revisit our NAV. I think you guys are off. But in any case, I think it's -- when you look at Binney, Binney is in the heart of the Kendall Square and Cambridge epicenter. So the cap rate there is not real surprising for relatively new construction, high credit quality and just an iconic location and building. And I think you can see across most of our markets, cap rates have held, I think, very strong and continue to be very positive in our favor. But I'd ask Steve and Peter to comment more detailed. Yes. Yes. Peter, you could comment. I would also say we've seen great activity with credit tenants in that -- for that location. Well, I think, Jamie, somebody mentioned, I don't know, or if not, we haven't really done speculative development since before the '08-'09 crisis when we were forced under contract in New York. We're building 2 towers. We stop one after Lehman collapsed, we built the East Tower. And then luckily, we secured Eli Lilly is our anchor tenant there. But we haven't generally built specs since then. And when we tend to put up, if we go vertical, we generally always have either a signed lease, signed LOI, or we have, as a case of one project I can think of a series of companies who have told us they need growth at this point, and we've decided to go forward and working through the mechanics of documenting that. But we wouldn't just put up steel on the hope that they will come, not because of the current market, but we just haven't done that as a matter of policy in the company for literally more than a decade. Generally, we like to -- I can think of a number of situations in San Diego or other markets where absolutely specifically or the Bay Area, the Peninsula, where we have specific tenant interest. Remember, Peter, Steve and Dean have all mentioned, we've got now more than 1,000 innovative tenants. So the amount of information and the amount of requirements really come to us in a way that there's nobody else that could marshal that kind of a resource. And that gives us the confidence to make some moves where we know that we will be successful. There have been a recent -- we're not going to confirm or deny anything, but a recent San Francisco Peninsula report on something on a project we're doing there, and that we have signed an LOI. I mean that's a good example. And again, I won't confirm or deny, but that's an example of if that was true, where it makes sense to do what we did. And that's kind of how we operate. When you say more at risk, what do you mean? No, we diligence tenants before we sign leases or even letters of intent, and we monitor them oftentimes usually quarterly, but sometimes monthly. And if you look at -- on Page 17 of the supplement, we give you a breakdown of our tenants. Half of our tenants are investment grade or large cap. We've got about 7% of the portfolio, which is private. We feel very good about the majority of -- the vast majority of those companies because they generally well-funded, and they've got a pathway for additional funding. We've got -- in our public biotech, the vast majority of those, again, are well funded with cash runways that go out, oftentimes beyond leases. And if not, certainly multiple years or are waiting for readouts oftentimes for Phase III. So we feel pretty good about where we are. And if there's anybody that runs into a problem, we kind of know about it. I mean, a good example might be Nektar, which had a is in our Mission Bay portfolio. We have watched them for quite a while. We're very close to them. They're going to, I think, sublease their office space, which is with Kilroy. They've got  space with us. That project is partnered, but we already have demand for backfilling that space should they decide to give it up, but they said they're going to keep a big chunk of their lab space, so I wouldn't expect them to give the majority of that up. So we've already -- I mean that might be an example of something you're referring to. We're already well ahead of the curve there and could backfill that space probably at much higher rates. Yes, I don't have it in front of me, but it's a long-term lease. And the truth of the matter is, in some cases, and I would never say that with specifics to Nektar. But sometimes, you might hope a company would decide to give up a lease because you could backfill it at a much higher rate. So some of that you'll see happen, I'm sure in -- I mean mission-based still, the vacancy rate there is literally 0 at this point for built-out lab space. And so the demand is significant. There's a high credit quality in that submarket that has a huge pent-up demand for space. I'll tell you that. Yes. So, Steve, you could comment on that. Simply to say thank you, everybody, be safe and God bless."

            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. I'm going to update you all on the value creation pipeline, discuss the continuation of construction costs and supply chain macro issues and comment on the 100 Binney disposition. Leveraging our unique market industry insights and the proven expertise of our best-in-class team, our value creation pipeline is tactically broadening our core clusters to meet the needs of our world-class tenant roster. Reflecting the continuing strong demand referenced in Steve's comments, and our ability to capture it due to our trusted brand, AAA locations, inspiring aesthetics, operational excellence, curated amenities and capability to elevate the tenant experience, our value creation pipeline of projects that are either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters has increased to 8 million square feet that is projected to add more than $665 million in annual rental revenue, primarily commencing from the second quarter of this year through the first quarter of '25, a $55 million increase over what was discussed last quarter. As of quarter end, 77% of this remarkable pipeline was either leased or under negotiation, which means we have an executed LOI. With an astounding 94% of the activity coming from existing relationships, highlighting the incredible loyalty to our stellar brand. Our tenant base is an award for talent and recognize that space at an Alexandria's campus is mission-critical in that fight. Without question, our ability to offer our tenant-based scalability and comprehensive amenity offerings through our mega campuses is a truly unique differentiator and why Alexandria is the clear choice to provide mission-critical facilities to the life science industry's most innovative and successful companies. During the first quarter, we delivered 566,655 square feet from 10 projects located in 8 different submarkets, reflecting the diversity of our pipeline made possible by strong demand across all regions. The deliveries provide strong GAAP yields at approximately 6.7%, translating to approximately $36.1 million of annual NOI. Alexandria's tremendous execution on our value creation pipeline represents a key component of our compelling growth engine, and an example of this is the extraordinary job our highly seasoned development teams are doing in managing cost escalations and supply chain disruptions that continue to proliferate throughout the construction industry. Approximately a year ago, in our first quarter call for 2021, we included commentary on construction cost trends because construction cost inflation was anticipated to be outsized due to double demand for materials and labor caused by the simultaneous restart of paused and new projects, combined with shortages in materials and labor due to closing of mills and fabrication shops, weather events and the loss of workers who migrated to different careers. It was all expected to be transitory, and even last quarter, we noted expectations for things to start normalizing in 2023. However, war, COVID in China and transportation issues have become the latest antagonist in the story and reversed any thoughts to the near-term stabilization. The war in Ukraine's biggest impact on construction costs is an astronomical increase in fuel costs. Sustainability experts will tell you that the embedded carbon of constructing a building is equal to the carbons used to operate the building for 30 years, much of it coming from fuel earned by the trucks delivering materials to the site and the machinery that produces the earthwork on the build.  In addition to fuel, the war has reduced the supply of critical semiconductor materials such as palladium and nickel, exacerbating the chip shortage, which affects such things as building control systems and emergency generators, the latter of which can now take up to a year to deliver. Other raw materials that come from the area are used to make certain metals like aluminum and contributing to their inflation. Transportation issues proliferate throughout the economy and construction is no exception. If you spend any time on a construction job site, you will marvel at the amount of coordination that needs to take place as trucks come in and out of the job delivering materials or hauling things away. In addition to the cost of fuel, inflationary pressures coming from an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 trucker shortage emanating from outdated compensation models and the allure of last-mile delivery companies reducing the pool of candidates. In addition to trucking, we're keeping our eye on labor negotiations for over 22,000 dock workers on the West Coast. The deadline to reach an agreement is July 30. And if they strike, it could place pressure on alternative ports and further delay delivery of materials. Specific material problems today include steel, copper and aluminum, roofing materials, elevators, HVAC equipment, switch gear, transformers and emergency generators. Materials and equipment are both expensive and tough to get. Many of these items take twice as long to get than in normal times and continue to go up in price by double digits. Rest assured, we are tightly managing these conditions.  As mentioned last quarter, the biggest asset we have to leverage is our decades of experience in developing purpose-built laboratory buildings, enabling us to mitigate delays. Currently, approximately 82% of our costs, or development and redevelopment projects, aggregating to 5.4 million square feet are subject to guaranteed maximum or other contracts that enable us to mitigate the risk of inflation. We have contingencies behind those contracts to account for scope creep and unknowns. The other 18% is from projects that are currently pending guaranteed maximum contracts that are in process, and those disclosures include larger contingency allowances. The voracious demand for high-quality life science assets in key cluster markets led to a highly competitive bid for our 100 Binney asset. Our excellent execution led to our third asset sold with a valuation exceeding $1 billion, and the fourth to achieve a sub-4% cap rate. We sold a 70% interest in the 432,932 square foot lab office building anchored with long-term credit tenants for a purchase price based on a total valuation of  through which we received proceeds exceeding $700 million. The cash cap rate was a record for our capital recycling program at 3.5% and enabled us to harvest a profit of approximately $410 million. The price per square foot of $2,356 exceeds the record price we set last quarter in the sale of 50 Binney to 60 Binney in by 3.7%, which is meaningful considering the uncertain interest rate environment we were and continue to be in during the quarter and the disruption caused by Russia's and Beijing of the Ukraine that happened on February 24. With that, I'll pass it over to Dean. Yes, sure. No, the pricing was set during the heat of everything, the war, interest rate volatility. So it is reflective of today's market conditions. The -- I don't know what the -- I don't have the  memorized, but just looking at the top 2 leases, it was very likely close to 10 years, probably maybe 9. So definitely a long time before you realize any upside. And there is upside there probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about 27%, 28%. The rents were overall below market. But again, I think the price is reflective of the fact that someone is going to have to live with that return for a while. The credit there was really good. So there's nothing to worry about. But it was a very fair price considering the amount of demand is looking for high-quality projects, and that was probably the most high-quality project anyone could have found this year. Yes. I mean as you said on the latter part of your comments, I mean being able to take advantage of market conditions where you can get a sub-4 cap rate and then plug that back into your next iconic asset at a 6 plus, it's just -- it's hard not to do that. And remember, we are keeping a pretty material part of each of these assets that we're selling. We are also accrue fees. And so there's some operating leverage that we can achieve there. So it is -- you look at the market, you see what you can monetize at the best price. And you only make that decision, though, if you have opportunities to reinvest that in something that's special. And if you look at our development pipeline today, we think it is full of the next wave of iconic assets. So we don't want to get too in love with things that are legacy. We appreciate them. We, again, don't sell them in whole, but there are other frontiers for us to conquer, and such as the Fenway where we believe there's going to be an incredible rent growth and appreciation as well. So we need to get the cash to make those accretive investments, and we pick carefully, but strategically. Joel, do you want me to take that? Yes, Rich, the -- I think we -- just getting back to my comments, our team has done an incredible job in helping to mitigate cost escalations. And locking things in early. And so because of that and because of the rent growth that we've experienced in all of our markets, we've been able to marginally increase our yields, as Joel mentioned. I -- what other people are doing, I'm not sure. They don't -- certainly don't have the scale advantage that we have, the relationships that we have, probably not even close to the personnel we have. So I'd imagine that they wouldn't be able to do the same thing. I can tell you, I mean I was looking at our comp database yesterday, just seeing what changed from quarter-to-quarter. There's -- a lot of things are still trading with the quality of tenancies completely all over the place, and things are getting for cap rates or more just a certain portfolio that BioMed sold in San Diego with a lot of cats and dogs was a sub-5 cap rate. So there is a lot of demand for exposure to life science assets. And so, unfortunately, for a number of investors, tenant quality probably hasn't been the focus. But we -- rest assured anyone who is looking at our portfolio, we -- our tenants are highly vetted and that doesn't become a question. It's more about the location and lease expiration. Tenant quality is usually soon to be great because it is. Yes. This is Peter. All the markets where there -- I guess, said another way, none of the markets we're in would have a cap rate that would have anything greater than a  handle on it, which is, as you know, remarkably different from a couple of years ago when people were thinking certain markets had 6% or 7%. Some of those markets now are in the 4s or 5s. So I would generally just say, as Joel mentioned, Cambridge is a special place. There are going to be a few submarkets where you probably go below 4% to the mid-3s like we just did. But who knows? I mean there's certainly a lot of money chasing these assets and the competition for high-quality assets, when the investors are thinking, \"Hey, there's great rent growth here. I'll pay the price for it today,\" who knows? We could certainly see breaking through 4% in other markets. But in general, cap rates for lab are like industrial, like logistics, storage or apartments. I mean it's just a hot industry. There's a lot of money out there to be invested and they want to bet on winners and winners are expenses. Well, you bring up a good a good point that actually we don't really talk about too much. But I mean, yes, our large partial interest sales are done with partners that are not buying with leverage. So they're putting this money to work and not looking to lever it up. They're accepting these returns. -- frankly, we don't go into the secured market and buy anything on a levered basis. So kind of hard for me to comment, but I would imagine just seeing where rates are today, that negative leverage is probably the only leverage available if you want to buy a really high-quality asset. Sure. We have a strategic partner in a couple of nearby assets that made a lot of sense for them to participate with us. I can't really go into the details. They'll become apparent later on. But this is a partner that is -- we're in multiple markets with. They have a lot of trust in us. They're a great source of capital that's very attractive compared to common, and they were highly interested in getting involved, and we're keeping the majority share there, but it's also a good opportunity for us to finance something upfront rather than after the fact to keep the capital flowing to other projects as well."

Consistent with Alexandria is building the future of life-changing innovation in medicine and at the Vanguard and the heart of the $5 trillion secularly growing industry, I want to wish everyone a safe and healthy 2024. On the cover of our press release and supplemental package, we've included the great Jim Collins quote about Alexandria, Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a great company: superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. On superior results, we're very proud to say that we've had a very strong total shareholder return since IPO of over 1,500%, beating all of the benchmark REIT indices and also every -- almost every other health care REIT. On distinctive impact, Alexandria's tenants whom we have supported are responsible for an astounding 50% of the novel FDA approved therapies over the last decade, truly amazing. And our unique one of a kind full continuum of care 115 project in Dayton, Ohio has treated more than 7,000 patients afflicted by opioid addiction and other substance abuses and has made a dramatic positive impact on the lives of thousands of people, and we're very proud of that accomplishment. And then moving to lasting endurance want to congratulate the Alexandria family team on this significant 30-year anniversary milestone of our founding on January 5, 1994 and who would or could have imagined in 1994 that this fledgling garage startup would have created an entirely new class of real estate at the Vanguard and the heart of the life science industry, combating many of the illnesses, which afflict our family and friends. So moving on to my take on fourth quarter and year-end 2023, I'd say we have witnessed the unprecedented eight-year bull run of the life science capital markets 2014 through 2021, the longest on record, coupled with the rocket ship funding during COVID. And the market in 2023 has clearly reflected the rationalization of the past decade. With respect to Alexandria in 2023, I would say, I would characterize our 2023 overall operating and financial performance as highly resilient. Notable achievements include 11% plus NOI growth year-over-year, 2023 to 2022 in very, very strong. We delivered a record $265 million of incremental NOI in 2023 with our development capabilities moving that to fruition, which are first-in-class. We've continued very solid leasing in 2023 with over 4 million plus rentable square feet leased with very respectable GAAP and cash numbers. Two key leases in fourth quarter, which are noted in the supplement, the lease to Novo Nordisk and the lease to Cargo Therapeutics. 2023, we had a remarkable 76% of leasing with existing tenants, and we look forward to a strong 2024 leasing effort and expect a handful of significant leases to mature soon. We expect to make significant progress on our lease expirations and filling vacant space, while achieving positive rent growth. 2023 we did a highly confident job of self-funding our growth and will continue to do so in 2024. Our balance sheet and liquidity are in the best shape in the company's history, and we're very proud of that accomplishment. We have given and reconfirmed very solid detailed guidance for 2024, and we believe that the life science industry will continue to benefit most importantly, from some key macro tailwinds in 2024, including positive M&A activity, declining interest rates, increased innovation and some great key data readouts. And finally, before I turn it over to Peter to comment on a range of critical issues. I want to comment on the sale of our 42nd Street asset in New York City, leased to Pfizer through midyear 2024. They previously vacated and moved their headquarters to another site in New York City. We made a strategic decision not to go forward with the contemplated redevelopment of that building to in part to state and local to challenging state and local governmental policies. We also had a somewhat similar, but not on the scale reaction back a number of years ago and our successful reduction in our footprint in the city of San Francisco. We have created and grown the commercial life science lab space market in New York City. When we delivered our East Tower and our ACLS mega campus back in 2010, there were only essentially two companies of any significance that we're doing commercial life science research in New York City, many academics, but no -- virtually no commercial. Today, there are over 100 but New York City, the life science market there remains here 14 years later, still a small start-up market. And we believe that by focusing on our ACLS New York City mega campus. That's the best way for us to continue to be successful. And we have taken this disciplined action out of an abundance of prudence. And with that, let me turn the commentary over to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thanks, Joel. In Flagship Pioneerings 2024 Annual Letter, Founder and CEO, Noubar Afeyan, described 2023 as a polycrisis, encompassing the confluence of economic turbulence, climate change, deeply fractured politics, two global wars, threats to democracy, loss of trust in institutions, and continuing dislocations triggered by the COVID epidemic. Alexandria's solid 2023 performance within such a dismal backdrop is nothing less than extraordinary. I don't want to steal too much of Mark's thunder, but leasing close to our average volume since 2018 ex the rocket ship years and maintaining strong earnings growth, while navigating through this poly crisis is a testament to Alexandria's competitive advantage and the power of our brand that Joel and Dan eloquently articulated at Investor Day. Heading into 2024, the poly crisis remains, but so does our resiliency. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And in 2023, we proved that we can self-fund our investments and still maintain our lowest leverage level in history. Thus, with our unique business model, highly skilled and experienced talent impeccable execution and a healthy underlying industry poised to advance human and planetary health. We've created the fertile industrial ecosystem, Mr. Afan [ph] postulated can generate value while defending against any coming vulnerabilities, we aim to prove that thesis right. I'm going to discuss our development pipeline, leasing, supply and asset sales and hand it over to Hallie. In the Fourth Quarter, we delivered 1,228,604 square feet into our high barrier to entry submarkets bringing total deliveries for the year to 3,271,170 square feet covering 15 projects. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the year of approximately $265 million and the incremental NOI delivered during the quarter of $145 million are both the highest total in company history. The initial weighted average stabilized deal for 2023 deliveries was 7%, supported by a strong stabilized yield on cost of 7.7% from our fourth quarter deliveries. Development and redevelopment leasing activity of approximately 234,000 square feet was higher quarter-over-quarter for the third reporting period in a row, and the positive momentum is expected to continue as we signed 270,000 square feet of LOIs during the quarter. At quarter end, our pipeline of current and near-term projects are 60% leased or under negotiations, which include executed LOIs. From the first quarter of 2024 through the end of 2027, we expect to deliver approximately 90% of the $495 million of stabilized NOI the current pipeline is expected to generate. Demand from our highly innovative credit tenant base, looking to leverage the place-making and scale of our mega campus model is expected to drive future opportunities, such as the Novo Nordisk lease executed during the quarter for 165,000 square feet at the Alexandria Center for Life Science Waltham, Mega Campus in Greater Boston. Transitioning to leasing and supply. We leased 4,306,072 square feet during the year and 889,737 square feet during the quarter. To put some context to that, it's roughly half of the average of the rocket ship years of 2021 and 2022, but very close to the average volume we leased in the three years prior from 2018 through 2020. We've returned to the fundamentals which were trending positively before 2021 and 2022. So we feel really good about the near- and long-term prospects for our business. We spoke a lot about the competitive advantages that our Mega Campus model affords us during Investor Day. 63% of the total leasing we did during the year was completed in our highly curated Class A mega campuses, located in high barrier to entry life science clusters. And they are the key reason we continue to post strong cash and GAAP rent increases, which came in at 15.8% and 29.4%, respectively, for the year. We believe the beginning of 2023 was the low point for demand and are pleased to see that demand for Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay and San Diego are all up year-over-year. A good sign since this does not include a number of projects that are on hold as management teams and Boards remain cautious. However, that should change soon. As you will hear from Hallie, the trajectory of the industry has turned positive. In the meantime, we continue to win the majority of the current high-quality demand due to tenants prioritizing location, place-making experience, ability to scale, proven operational excellence, reliability and trustworthiness. Our teams continue to closely track supply building-by-building in our proprietary databases. As we turn the page on 2023, we expect 2024 to be the peak year for new deliveries then begin to dissipate in 2025. In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 7% of market inventory, a 0.9% increase over last quarter, not due to new projects, but because of project deliveries being pushed from 2023 to 2024. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by another 2.5%, an expected slowdown from 2024 levels. In San Francisco Bay, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 10.7% of market inventory, which is a 2.7% increase. Like Greater Boston, this increase is driven by projects that were expected to deliver in 2023, but are taking longer than expected. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by much less at 2.2%, a good sign, but still a 1% increase over last quarter due to a new project breaking ground in Menlo Park. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 6.8% of market inventory, a slight decrease from last quarter due to an increase in supply from projects being pushed from 2023 to 2024, offset by leasing in those projects. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will decelerate to 2.7% of market inventory. A quick update on direct and sublease vacancy. Direct vacancy in Greater Boston is up 258 basis points to 7.05%, still mid-single-digits despite a number of deliveries in late 2023. It has climbed 270 basis points to 12.36% in our San Francisco Bay markets due to unleased new deliveries. And in San Diego, the increase has been more modest, rising 121 basis points to 7.97% driven primarily by Serina Therapeutics vacating all of their leases in the region. They are not an Alexandria tenant. Subleased vacancy has remained stable, ranging from 5.4% in San Diego to 5.9% in Boston. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. Continued demand for our assets enabled us to self-fund our investments as we presented at Investor Day. Page 6 of the supplemental summarizes the material transaction closed during the year. What can be taken away from the partial interest sales at 15 Necco and 9625 Town Center Drive and the sale of 11119 North Torrey Pines Road is that well-located and stabilized assets located in Alexandria's primary submarkets continue to command a premium valuation. Others in solid locations, but in need of material CapEx for repositioning such as the Second Avenue and Memorial portfolio in Greater Boston completed in the Second Quarter and the Memorial Drive Beaver Street and Roselle Street portfolio completed in the fourth quarter, delivered solid per square foot valuations due to their solid historical performance. Due to the unstabilized nature of these portfolio sales, the cap rates will not provide any meaningful insights to return expectations on stabilized properties. However, I can point you to Healthpeak's 65% sale of 3020 and 3030 Callan Ridge Road in Torrey Pines as a directional comp. The building is fully leased long-term to a credit tenant but is not expected to be occupied by said tenant. The purchase price yielded a 5.3% cap rate despite that change or despite that challenge. As we presented at Investor Day, our strategies that continue to widen the moat with competitive advantages our mega campus model provides by recycling our non-campus assets into our current and future mega campuses. With that, I'll pass the call over to Hallie.\nHallie Kuhn: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I will provide a recap of the life science industry in 2023 and an overview of the health and demand drivers of each of our life science tenant segments as we kick off 2024. John Templeton wisely wrote that bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die of euphoria. While the reset of the life science industry from euphoric 2021 highs has been rocky, healthy pessimism is seeding renewed momentum, underscored by rational valuations and capital flowing to the strongest technologies and experienced management teams. Fundamentally, the staggering unmet medical need that drives the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry has not debated, and the opportunity for companies and investors in the life science sector to positively impact human health and disease is massive. Through the ups and downs, the trajectory of the industry is positive, translating long-term, into a healthy and expanding tenant base. This sentiment is reflected in the numbers. The XBI, a weighted index of small and mid-cap biotech ended 2023, up 8%. Large biopharma performance, which had an exceptional 2022, while the rest of the market generally languished, ended flat. Two notable exceptions were Alexandria tenants, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk both of which ended the year up over 50% as the market for their novel diabetes and obesity medicines accelerated. And as Peter mentioned, in December, we announced a significant lease with Novo Nordisk for their new US R&D headquarters on our Waltham Mega campus in Greater Boston. Another 2023 biopharma trend was M&A. Excluding mega mergers over $50 billion, 2023 set a new high watermark with $159 billion in acquisitions. These were largely sub-$10 billion deals driven by pharma's need to bolster pipelines as they face steep revenue loss due to patent expirations. As M&A dollars are recycled back into the industry, it creates a positive cycle of innovation as scientists and entrepreneurs start their next new venture. Altogether, the M&A life cycle is an important driver of demand across our regions. With respect to the FDA, 55 novel medicines were approved in 2023, the second highest year on record and double the average number of annual approvals 20 years ago. There were also eight advanced cell and gene therapies approved. Tenant Vertex received FDA approval of CASGEVY this December, a potentially curative therapy for severe sickle cell disease and the first approved treatment utilizing a novel genome editing technology known as CRISPR. The takeaway is that the industry's model is working, novel scientific discoveries, such as CRISPR, which was elucidated just over a decade ago are translating into impactful medicines for patients.  Now let's take a closer look at the health and demand across each of our life science tenant segments. First, large pharma, which makes up 19% of our ARR continues to deploy substantial capital towards internal and external R&D, equating to over $270 billion in R&D spend.  Commitment to R&D is an imperative for pharma. Over the next decade, the top 20 pharma are staring down approximately $200 billion of lost revenue as patents expire, new competitors enter the market and a subset of medicines become subject to potential price setting by Medicare through the recently enacted IRA legislation. And where does pharma look to offset gap in revenue to smaller and nimbler biotechs. Currently, $3 out of every $5 of top 20 pharma revenue stemmed from medicines acquired through M&A and partnerships. Fortunately, this segment is well positioned with strong balance sheets and an estimated $1 trillion in available firepower to leverage. All told, we expect healthy levels of internal research and M&A to continue through 2024 and beyond. Importantly, innovation requires people and a critical component of the pharma equation is stellar talent. Recruiting and retaining scientists is more important than ever. Cancer can't be cured from the couch and expectations of a scientific workforce where working from home is not an option or high, requiring amenities and community that the scale of Alexandria's mega campuses are uniquely positioned to provide. This need is driving several large pharma requirements across our clusters. Transitioning to public biotechnology. Our ARR from biotechs with marketed products increased to 17% compared to 14% in 3Q. This increase is due to the delivery of Moderna's new headquarters at 325 Binney Street on our One Kendall Square mega campus, as well as several clinical stage companies transitioning to commercial stage after receiving marketing approval for new therapies. This segment continues to mature, with tenants such as Vertex eclipsing a market cap of $100 billion in 2023. Next step are our pre-commercial public biotech companies, which represent 8% of our ARR. For this segment, data trumps all. Companies that meet expected milestones have executed significant follow-on financings and stock prices have responded positively. In total, nearly $20 billion in follow-on financing was raised on U.S. stock exchanges in 2023, a quarter of which was raised by Alexandria tenants. Companies have also tapped alternative financing structures such as pipes and royalty deals providing additional access to liquidity. Our San Francisco-based tenant BridgeBio has raised over $900 million in the past 12 months from a combination of these sources, driven by clinical data for a novel medicine treating transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, a potential fatal disease of the heart muscle. As the IPO market cracks open in 2024, companies with the right clinical pedigree will be able to access additional liquidity. Last week, the first IPO of the year by asset-based CG Oncology priced above their target range and raised $380 million. On to private biotechnology, which encompasses 10% of our ARR, while life science venture investments slowed in 2023 relative to the highs of 2021 and 2022, it still exceeds pre-COVID levels and came in at approximately $40 billion. Series A, B and C rounds are predominantly being led by outside investors. Speaking to healthy levels of new investments, with the caveat that valuations have come down and deals often take longer to close. Funds have been conservative deploying the capital raised in the past several years and have ample dry powder. As the market's warm, we expect venture activity to remain strong through 2024. One counterbalance is that we may see less later-stage financings as a subset of companies go public instead of raising another round of private capital. Next, our life science product, service and device tenants, which represent 21% of our ARR. This segment includes contract manufacturers, diagnostic firms and research tool companies, all of which are critical and complementary to companies developing new medicines. For example, research tool companies are creating the next generation of advanced life science technologies such as super-resolution microscopes and DNA sequencers that can process an entire genome in half a day. These technologies often require large specialized footprints, complex infrastructure and highly trained scientific talent. As the trusted brand for life science real estate, our tenants look to Alexandria to safeguard the billions of dollars of equipment, intellectual property and assets housed within their labs. Last, our institutional tenants totaling 11% ARR as well-funded often credit tenants, institutions continue to be an engine of innovation within our ecosystems. One pioneering institutional tenant that came out of stealth this month is Cambridge-based Arena BioWorks. With $500 million in funding, Arena hired scientific luminaries from around the country, with the goal to combine and accelerate academic research and venture-backed drug development under one roof. Returning to where we started, the life science industry is squarely in the realm of healthy skepticism, exceeding the very early innings of the next bull run. We are not completely out of the woods yet with question marks around interest rates and 2024 election looming. However, accelerating pace of scientific innovation, access to significant capital from multiple sources and enormous unmet need for life-saving therapies will propel the industry forward and translate into healthy demand and increasing long-term revenue. With that, I will pass it over to Marc.\nMarc Binda: Thank you, Hallie. This is Marc Binda here. Hello, and good afternoon, everyone. Congratulations to our entire team for outstanding execution this past year in a very challenging macroeconomic environment. I'll start with our solid financial results. Total revenues and NOI for 2023 were up 11.5% and 12.2%, respectively, over 22%, primarily driven by solid same-property performance and record high development and redevelopment projects placed into service in 2023 with an incremental annual NOI of $265 million. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was $897, up a solid 6.5% over 2022. We're very proud to report solid operating results for the year, driven by disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy. Our tenants continue to appreciate our brand collaborative mega campuses and our operational excellence by our team. We have high-quality cash flows with 52% of our annual rental revenue as of 4Q 2023 from investment-grade and publicly traded large-cap tenants, up 3% from the prior quarter. And we have one of the highest quality client rosters in the REIT industry. 75% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses, collections remained very high at 99.9%, adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 69% and 96% of our leases contain annual rent escalations approximating 3%. Now, solid rental rate growth and leasing volume drove same-property NOI growth in 2023, up 3.4% and 4.6% on a cash basis. These results were in line with our previous guidance and very solid results, especially considering the macro environment. As expected, our Fourth Quarter same-property results took some pressure due to some temporary vacancy and four properties spread across Boston, San Francisco and San Diego, comprising about 330,000 square feet that is 64% leased or negotiating. We expect same property results to accelerate in the second half of 2024, driven by anticipated solid rental rate growth, occupancy growth in the second half of the year, coupled with the four properties I just mentioned, as well as contractual rent increases and the burn-off of contractual free rent from executed leases. We expect solid same property growth for 2024 consistent with what we provided at our Investor Day in December, up 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the mid point of our guidance range. Leasing volume in the fourth quarter was solid at 890,000 square feet for the quarter and 4.3 million for the year, which is in line with our general historical average from 2013 to 2020. We continue to benefit from our long-standing tenant relationships and brand loyalty with 76% of our leasing completed in 2023 coming from existing tenant relationships. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing space in 2023 was very strong at 29.4% and 15.8% on a cash basis. These are very solid results and are the third highest annual amounts, compared to the 10 years preceding the rocket ship years of 2021 and 2022. 4Q 2023 rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing of space was 9.2% and 5.5% on a cash basis. Due to the incredible execution by our team, we were able to backfill the roughly 100,000 square foot former Atreca space in San Carlos with a very exciting clinical-stage biotech company called Cargo Therapeutics during the quarter at solid economics, including no TIs and limited downtime. The starting cash rent on that deal was slightly negative at about negative 4% compared to the most recent in-place rents from [indiscernible] that was three years into a 10-year lease. Given the quarterly results are driven by a relatively small amount of square feet, the relatively flat results from this transaction had a meaningful impact on the quarterly rental rate increases. Excluding this transaction, rental rate increases for the quarter would have been 21.4% and 9.7% on a cash basis. We expect solid rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing of space for 2024 at a midpoint of 15% and 9% on a cash basis with some variation from quarter-to-quarter. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to our in-place leases for the entire asset base remains solid at 14%. Our non-revenue-enhancing expenditures, including TIs and leasing commissions on second generation space have averaged 15% of NOI over the last five years and remained low during 2023 and in the 12% to 13% range. Year-end occupancy was solid at 94.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior quarter and the primary driver of the increase from the third quarter was space that was delivered in San Diego. The midpoint of our guidance range for occupancy for year-end 2024 is 95.1%, so we do expect some modest growth in occupancy through the year as well as growth in same-property occupancy in the second half of the year. Transitioning to the balance sheet. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the company's history as of 4Q 2023. Our corporate credit rankings link in the top 10% of all publicly traded US public REITs. We met our goal for year-end leverage of 5.1 times for net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly annualized basis. And we ended the year with tremendous liquidity of $5.8 billion fixed rate debt comprising 98.1% of our total debt, a weighted average remaining term of debt of 12.8 years and no debt maturities until 2025. Only 20% of our debt matures in the next five years and 29% of our debt matures in 2049 and beyond with an attractive rate of 3.91%. We continue to focus on the enhancement of our overall asset base and the recycling of capital through outright dispositions of assets that are not integral to our mega campus strategy. We recognize that these types of assets will likely have a higher cost of capital than our core assets located in our mega campuses, but this will allow us to recycle these proceeds into our highly leased development and redevelopment pipeline and to continue to enhance our mega campus strategy. For 2023, we completed dispositions and partial interest sales of $1.3 billion, including $439 million of dispositions completed in the fourth quarter. Importantly, during 2023, we did not issue any new common equity other than the settlement of our outstanding forward equity contracts from 2022, which raised $104 million and we're very proud of our strong execution capability. The team is laser focused on the execution of our capital plan headed into 2024, and we have pending dispositions subject to letters of intent or sales agreements for another $142 million that we expect to close in 2024. Based upon our current outlook, we expect our asset recycling program to be more heavily weighted towards outright dispositions of non-core assets rather than partial interest sales in 2024. In the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $271.9 million, which included two significant items. First was the $94.8 million charge related to the sale of 380 and 420 East Street located in the Seaport, which had been announced last quarter and subsequently closed during the fourth quarter. And then second, as Joel mentioned, $93.5 million of a charge related to an office property located in Manhattan, which was classified as held for sale this quarter. The New York project Joel mentioned was acquired in 2018 as a covered land project with a leaseback and in-place cash flows. But in the fourth quarter, we elected not to proceed with the conversion project and this is now under contract and expected to be sold next year. Cash flows from operating activities after dividends for 2024 is expected to be very strong at $450 million at the midpoint of our guidance, and we'll continue to support growth in our annual common stock dividends per share. We had a low conservative FFO payout ratio of 56% for the quarter with a 6% average per share dividend increase over the last five years and at this pace of retained cash flows over the next three years, Cash flows from operating activities after dividends should generate close to $1.4 billion of efficient capital for reinvestment. Now I'll turn to a couple of important highlights on the external growth side. 2023 and 4Q 2023 were both record years in terms of the amount of incremental annual NOI onboarded with $265 million and $145 million, respectively. Importantly, about 80% of the annual rental revenue delivered in the fourth quarter was the investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants, including Moderna and Eli Lilly. With a very large amount of deliveries around mid-quarter on average in the fourth quarter, we expect a significant earnings benefit headed into 1Q 2024. We expect tremendous growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $114 million upon the burn-off of initial free rent related to recently delivered projects with a weighted average burn-off period of about 10 months. And as Peter highlighted, we have 5.7 million rentable square feet of projects that are 60% leased or negotiating and projects that will generate $495 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next four years. A key item to highlight here is that we had strong leasing activity in the pipeline with over 500,000 square feet either leased or added to the negotiating bucket through signed LOIs during the quarter, which was the most we've had since 2Q 2022. Next, on capitalized interest, our outlook for capitalized interest for 2024 is consistent with our previous guidance. And as a reminder, we expect capitalized interest for 2024 to be impacted by the following: First, and overall decline in average real estate basis subject to capitalization compared to 2023, which was driven in part by the large basis placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2023, and second, we expect an offsetting increase caused by an uptick in our weighted average interest rate on borrowings used in the calculation of capitalization of interest in 2024 compared to 2023. I'll turn next to venture investments. Realized gains from venture investments included in FFO per share as adjusted for the quarter was $12.3 million, which was below our recent run rate, in part due to a large realized loss on one of our investments that occurred late in the quarter. FFO per share as adjusted over the last three years has included on average, $96 million of realized gains in each year from venture investments or approximately $24 million per quarter. Our outlook for quarterly realized gains from venture investments in 2024 and is $95 million to $125 million, which is modestly above our three-year annual average of $96 million. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of the end of the quarter were $320 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. Turning to guidance. We have reaffirmed our solid guidance for 2024 that was initially provided in connection with our Annual Investor Day on November 29th, with a few minor changes as outlined in our supplemental package on Page 4. Our range for guidance for EPS is $3.49 to $3.69 and our range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $9.37 to $9.57, with no change in the midpoint of $9.47, which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share, following excellent growth last year of 6.5%. Lastly, our ATM program expired in early January of this year upon the expiration of our shelf registration, so we do expect to file a new program here in the near future. With that, let me turn it over to Joel.\nJoel Marcus: So, please open it up for questions, operator.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Josh Dennerlein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJosh Dennerlein: Hey guys. Thanks for time. I just wanted to explore the occupancy uplift that you're assuming in guide. Just how much of that occupancy uplift is just driven by leases you've already signed versus leasing that you're assuming that still has to get done?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So, Marc comment?\nMarc Binda: Yes, sure. Hi Josh. So, we do have about 300,000 square feet of leases that we've already signed that have not commenced that will commence next year. So we have a good head start headed into 2024. I think to put things into perspective, we've got about $3.4 million of lease rules next year. But after you back out the space that we've anticipated, we'll go dark into redevelopment or development that only leaves you with about 1 1.8 million square feet that's not resolved. So, I think that number feels pretty manageable relative to our historical run rate on leasing.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So, when Marc says next year, we're in 2024, but the next year from 2023, which we're reporting, just so we're clear.\nJosh Dennerlein: Appreciate that. And then it looks like supply is going to peak this year. Just kind of what's your latest thoughts on timing for net effective rents bottoming, any kind of variation across your three core markets?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Marc, Peter, you guys want to comment?\nPeter Moglia: Yes, I'll take it, Josh. Hard to predict. But certainly, the effects of 2023 supply has been seen net effective rents. We've seen TIs increase remarkably, we've talked about that before. TIs aren't going to go any further up, because they're already pretty high. I'd say, there's some pricing power to the tenant if they've got a very large requirement. But outside of that, I think things have been holding relatively well.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.\nPeter Moglia: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Yes, thanks. First question is, it's early in the year, and it seems like you're approaching the midpoint of your acquisition guide. So just curious, if these were transactions that were in process when you're setting up the guidance or if you just are seeing a lot of stuff that's attractive or you feel like it's a time to play more offense.\nJoel Marcus: Yes, the former, Tony.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. So there's no like anticipation that you want to pick up the [indiscernible]. And then just on the disposition side, you talked about some of the noncore stuff like having New York under contract. But like when you look at the rest of the dispositions that you're thinking about for the rest of this year, do you think you'll have better execution on noncore sales? Or do you think selling stakes in more core higher-quality stuff is where you might get either more capital or better execution at this point?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think we're -- I think as Marc and Peter have indicated, we're focused on really noncore, noncampus assets. So we feel pretty good about that.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. All right. Thanks.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to get some maybe more color on the pipeline that you're kind of looking at today to deal with sort of expirations over the next 12 to 18 months, but also the developments, particularly what's delivering in sort of '25, '26, where maybe more lease-up is expected. So I don't know if you could give us some sort of wide range of like what is the pipeline square footage-wise of tenants you are at some stage of discussion with? Or if not that, at least give us a sense of the composition of these large, small by market? And any color there would be helpful, just to sort of bridge the lease-up that you have to do in terms of expirations and developments?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So I don't think we would want to talk about pipeline that I think is pretty confidential stuff, Vikram. But I think you can assume every lease is somewhat different, and every market is somewhat different. I mean, if you go back and look at the cargo therapeutic, that was a very unique lease in a very unique set of circumstances. So it isn't like -- this is not a commodity product. This is a generally a premium priced, noncommodity product. So, it's not like you have the same bunch of folks waiting for the same amount of space in the same, kind of, market type place. It's just not that kind of a business.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay. And then just maybe one other topic, Biogen announced sort of rationalization of its office space. And I'm wondering if in your conversations with tenants across the portfolio, can you give us a sense of the latest thoughts on how they're thinking about office versus lab or office needs whether it's remote work or just they took on too much space. Just how are the tenants thinking about office space they may have in their last portfolios?\nJoel Marcus: That's always asked. Hallie, do you want to kind of comment on that?\nHallie Kuhn: Sure. And hi Vikram, this is Hallie. I think we need to separate out the component of non-technical space adjacent to the labs. These are desks largely for the researchers that are moving in and out of the labs through the day. And just there's no rationalization of that space. That space is needed, it's part of the workflow that scientists day in and day out are utilizing. Surely, there are larger office requirements that as companies grow, that they will lease up if it's for their clinical or sales and marketing. That's a different set of questions. That is not who we are catering by and large. So when it comes to the lab based infrastructure that space is not going to go away. And we even have examples right now where that lab to non-technical space ratio is shifting. We need more desk king, right? Like we have more scientists going in and out, people don't like to share the same space. They like their own desks. So just to make that clear, you really have to distinguish the two.\nPeter Moglia: This is Peter. Just to be clear, Biogen is rationalizing their pure office space, nothing to do with their lab space.\nJoel Marcus: Yeah. And remember, they're a big cap company. So like big pharma, they have, kind of, dedicated legions of people doing things in traditional office, if you will, so it's not a typical case.\nVikram Malhotra: That\u2019s it. Thank you.\nPeter Moglia: Yeah. Next question, operator.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson of Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to ask about the impairment and specifically, it's behind you now, but as a function of taking on what may be called a creative approach to development in a different macro environment. And I'm curious if you can -- we can expect to see more in the way of an impairment type of model in 2024 as you part ways with non-core assets? Is this something that we might see repeat itself as the year progresses?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Marc, do you want to comment on that?\nMarc Binda: Yeah. Sure. Hi, Rich. Yeah, so under the accounting rules, these -- you can -- the common way where you could have an impairment is at the point where you designate an asset as held for sale. So as we get closer to potentially committing to certain sales, it's definitely possible that we could have additional impairments. But it's really hard to say at this point as we're still refining our approach and which assets to sell. So hard to say at this point.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And then second question, on the $114 million of free rent burn that's good in the sense that you've got new cash flow coming in, but it's also free rent and it is what it is. It's not necessarily a good thing. Where does that compare if you can quantify it to the past and how much of it is a reflection of the current difficult headwinds that are facing you? And how do you expect that free rent sort of exposure to trend on a go-forward basis? \nJoel Marcus: Marc?\nMarc Binda: Yes. Hi, Rich. So we did -- yes, we had $114 million of free rent that will be burning off. I guess just to put that into perspective, we delivered $265 million of NOI this year, that's annual NOI. And a lot of those leases are very long-term in nature. So it's not a direct correlation one for one, but if you just do the simple math there, it's less than less than half a year on what is generally on average, those types of leases are 10 years and longer. So I don't think it's something that we're super concerned with. But to be fair, free rent has trickled up a little bit as we've seen. \nRich Anderson: But \u2013 just not glaringly higher or anything like that. over the past few years. Is that correct?\nMarc Binda: I mean we published our free rent statistics, Rich. And I think it was about months 3 \u2013 0.3 months per year of rent at the end of last year. And I think we're at 0.6, so it's ticked up a little bit this year, but still relatively modest compared to the length of leases. \nRich Anderson: Fair enough. Thank you. \nPeter Moglia: Yes. Hi, Rich. It's Peter. The great financial crisis, it was more like one. So we're -- it's still pretty healthy considering the market dynamics. \nRich Anderson: Great. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, everyone.\nPeter Moglia: Thank you, Rich.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Griffin of Citi. Please go ahead. \nMichael Griffin: Great. Thanks. I want to go back to the Cargo Therapeutics lease at 835 Industrial. Joel, I know you mentioned that it was something specific driving that, but was wondering if you can give any more color on what drove the decline in rents? Was it a function of cargo willing to take occupancy pretty quickly? Or are there more worries about supply and where rental rates are going?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think the key is -- and it's a good question, it's one of those situations where you're trying to find the right key to fit the right lock. You know, an exact amount of space that comes vacant that one would not have wanted to be vacant due to Atreca and finding the exact user of that space with literally very little downtime. And as I think Marc said, we had no TIs. So you don't want to just let that kind of a tenant go into the market and choose from some assorted number of spaces that might be available now or in the future. And so you try to make the deal because it's the perfect lock fitting -- the perfect key fitting the right lock. And so that's kind of the story.\nMichael Griffin: Got you. That's helpful. And then I was wondering if you could provide any additional color on the recent asset sales, the ones in Greater Boston and San Diego. It seems like they're aggregated in the supplemental and given there -- it seems like they're kind of lowly occupied. I'd be curious if you can kind of give us pricing, particularly on the asset in Cambridge, maybe what a yield would be on a stabilized basis?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. So Peter, do you want to give some commentary?\nPeter Moglia : Yes. I mean that speculating on what the Cambridge asset would be on a stabilized basis, I'd just kind of point to where we've seen stabilized things in Boston trade ourselves in the low to mid-5s. With the Necco transaction we had a couple of quarters ago, Boston Properties last quarter did something in the high 5s, but it's about two or three years from cash flowing. So I pointed to, in my commentary, a 5.3% cap rate in Torrey Pines for a building that's fully leased long-term to a credit tenant but that tenant has decided not to move in. So I've said it before, we speculate that good, well-located assets with good credit and good lease term are going to be in the low 5s, the sub-5 cap rates are no longer with us due to rates. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nMichael Griffin: Yes. That's it for me. I appreciate the time. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Kammert of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJim Kammert : Thank you. Good afternoon. Thematically, in Alexandria's experience, Hallie mentioned a lot of this positive M&A activity. Has that historically in your experience translated to a net incremental space demand across your portfolio? Meaning or is it more of a credit upgrade. I'm just trying to understand if the acquirers really tend to over time expand their lab footprint or they already have kind of underutilized space.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Hey, Jim, the way to think about that is every case is different. If it's a smaller company with a specific product, it's sometimes just bolted on and the space isn't necessarily utilized and maybe subleased or terminated. But oftentimes, you find a strategic acquisition, and they could be on the larger medium or even smaller side, where companies, I can think of the Bristol-Myers, Juno in Seattle back a number of years ago, where BMS wanted really to get into the cell therapy issue and that led not only to the acquisition but a fairly big expansion. So if they're buying, if it's a strategic technology platform with multiple product shots on goal, usually, those end up with very, very good expansion results. If it's a smaller bolt-on, sometimes those don't. But everyone is honestly different.\nJim Kammert: All right. Fair enough. And then a technical question, I'm sorry. You note that the fourth quarter sort of same-store progression in the first half of this year will be a little depressed by the vacancy associated with four properties what would have to happen at those properties from a leasing perspective from where they are today to get to 3% same-store NOI guide at the bottom end of your range. I mean, does anything have to happen? Or I'm just trying to understand the order of magnitude might in terms of incremental leasing for that portfolio to bench in your range?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Marc?\nMarc Binda: Yes. So we gave the leased/negotiating stats. I think it was about half of that 64% was leased and the other half was negotiation. And that stuff is expected to benefit the last half of the year. We do need to continue to make progress on that. But then we do have a significant amount of free rent that's contractual that has already been leased. It will also contribute to the numbers in the back half of the year.\nJim Kammert: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead.\nTom Catherwood: Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Peter, you commented in past quarters on tenant space planning trending towards more just-in-time leasing. Is that still a fair characterization across your portfolio? Or are you seeing some markets where tenants are getting ahead of their expirations to lock in space?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. Decision-making has been slow. And I mean, I guess what I've talked about is that and tenants not wanting to invest in space. So the preference has been to go into available build space, things that are vacant or rolling or subleased rather than plan ahead and move in 12 months later into a development project. A lot of that has to do with a lot of the requirements over the past year and a half have been small, versus a larger requirement that you might not be easy to find and you need to put into a newer building. But that I don't think anybody is waiting to the last minute. It's really a function of the size of the company. If you're under 15,000 square feet or even under 20,000 square feet, you probably have options. If you're above that, you definitely need to plan ahead, because there's a lot less inventory in those sizes.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think the other way to think about that is the just-in-time inventory issue is really focused on, primarily biotech companies clinical stage that hit a milestone, and they need to move pretty rapidly the scale because of that milestone, which also yields funding, and that's where you get probably the most kick on the just-in-time space.\nTom Catherwood: Appreciate that. And that actually kind of leads into the second question, which is, Peter, you had mentioned elevated concessions, and we hear about that kind of across the market, yet if we look at your second-generation leasing costs in 2023, they were a good bit lower than in 2022, especially if we do it on a kind of per year average basis. So can you speak maybe about how concessions are trending for new and renewal leases at existing properties as compared to leases at new developments and maybe where the economics are different on that side?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. I mean, the increase in the large increase in tenant improvement concessions has really been almost exclusively in new development space where you would traditionally give somebody $200 a foot plus or minus, depending on the market. With their rental rate and then expect them to invest into the rest of the space that, as we've talked about, has gone to $300 a square foot. If you look at the operating portfolio, and you pointed out that the numbers prove this, that concession isn't needed, because that is already built out. And one of the beautiful things about our business is how the tenants or how the TIs are recyclable. So we build something out first generation. It's very rare that we have to put a material amount of money into it the next time around. And given that it's probably got a large investment from a tenant, the first-generation tenant. We don't have to bump the rents much to make up for that additional investment, right, because we didn't make it. So it becomes a very valuable thing to a tenant to be able to move into something that's already built out. And so they aren't seeking the type of concessions that they are for new space. Now, it ties to what I said before, if you're in the -- a smaller set of space needs 25,000 square feet or less, you might have some options to find. But once you get above that, it becomes tougher to find existing space. So you might end up going more towards new development where you would see the concessions of higher TIs, but you're also paying higher rents.\nTom Catherwood: Appreciate the color. Thanks everyone.\nPeter Moglia: Yeah. Thank you, Tom.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, if you look at your 2024 exploration schedule, the amount of expirations moving into redevelopment declined 13% in the supplemental from 41% when you initially gave guidance? Do you think that's a number that's going to continue to trend lower as the year moves on? Or is that more driven by dispositions? Maybe just talk about what changed and what may change going forward?\nJoel Marcus: Yeah. Marc, do you want to comment on that?\nMarc Binda: Yeah, sure. I think last quarter we -- or at least as of Investor Day, we did have the 219 East 42nd Street asset in there as something that we thought that we would redevelop or develop turned out that we've decided to sell that asset. Aside from that, it's been pretty consistent from the last quarter. I think a lot of those redevelopment assets are in great locations in places that we'd like to be. But certainly, as we go through our process to look at non-core assets. It's always possible that we find things in there that could potentially be sold.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. Thanks for that. And then the $95 million to $125 million of investment gains that you plan to include in earnings, you said you took an impairment recently. I mean, what gives you conviction that you can hit those numbers? And do you think you'll see more impairments netting that out?\nMarc Binda: Yeah. We did have some impairments during the quarter here, Jamie. But I think when we look back over three years, we've averaged like $96 million over the last three years per year. And so over a longer period, when we look back, the impairments have been pretty modest relative to the size of those gains. So I think we're thinking about the things that Hallie mentioned upfront, just with some renewed excitement around M&A that we feel pretty comfortable with that number headed into next year.\nJamie Feldman: So do you mean that you think you'll see some increase in values and take gains on that? Or based on where values are today, you still can deliver that $95 million to $125 million?\nMarc Binda: Yes. Hard to say where values go. Yes. No, I think we're talking about the values today. I think if you look on balance sheet, we've got something like north of $300 million of unrealized gains that we could tap. And part of it too, to be fair, a lot of it is outside of our control, whether it's an M&A event or an acquisition by big pharma or so forth. So some of it, it's hard to predict because these things kind of happen when they happen.\nJoel Marcus: But the fact that we've reiterated guidance here, I think Jamie should give you comfort that we think we can hit those numbers pretty comfortably. Otherwise, we wouldn't stick with it.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. That make sense. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Yes, thanks. I believe you touched on this earlier, but I wanted to see if I can ask it a different way just regarding overall leasing activity. I know that some tenants have been delaying decisions just given the uncertain environment. I mean are there any examples of this starting to loosen up just given the prospect of interest rates that could continue to drop? I mean, is that activity or urgency for attendance? Is that starting to pick up here?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think, again, if you go back to Hallie's comments and think about the different sectors, each sector is kind of driven by different issues when it comes to, say, big pharma or big cap bio, those are dependent upon their needs and not on the vicissitudes of the capital markets today or whatever. But then you contrast those to clinical stage biotech who are waiting to hit a clinical milestone or not, than those -- that's where -- and Peter has reemphasized this a number of times, boards want to be really careful not to get ahead of their skis. So it really depends on the sector that you're looking at. It's not a one-size shoe fits all, if you will.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then on the five projects that are scheduled to be stabilized in 2025, I mean, how are the leasing prospects on those specific buildings? And I know that we're still a year out from the expected stabilization. But when should we start to see leases getting signed those projects that are going to be done here in the next few quarters? Is that a good way to think about it?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So maybe let's do this since we're doing fourth quarter and year-end 2023, let us and Peter Macken [ph] noted this, will specifically address that on our first quarter call, if you don't mind.\nMichael Carroll: Okay, great. Thanks, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Dylan Burzinski of Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDylan Burzinski: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Peter, I just wanted to go back to one of the comments you made regarding one of the questions asked a little bit earlier on $200 a square foot for new development leases for TIs being the norm last year versus $300 a square foot today. Do you -- would you attribute that to solely the imbalance between supply and demand today? Or do you expect that to sort of be the new normal moving forward?\nPeter Moglia: I think it's the new normal going forward? I mean it's driven certainly by more competition in the market, but it's also driven by the higher cost to build out space that's been a considerable increase in construction costs as you guys all know, and I used to comment on. So that alone, I mean, the availability numbers will eventually resolve themselves, but the costs are what they are and the tenants are willing to invest in the space, but only to a certain degree. So, I think that, that that number is here to stay?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And again, I think you have to distinguish different sectors have different tolerances for investing in space and they can be pretty dramatically different. And as Peter said, the structural inflation that we have brought on ourselves over the last number of years as a country and really as a world is pretty much here to stay. So -- and that's true across all real estate classes.\nDylan Burzinski: Okay. I appreciate the details on that. And then one more on sort of the dispositions. You mentioned focusing on noncore noncampus like assets. Can you just talk about sort of typical buyer profile on who's in bidding tense when you go to market with those types of assets?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think we'd rather not get into that issue and just let it be at this moment. I don't think we want to discuss that on an earnings call. Sorry.\nDylan Burzinski: Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, everybody, and I look forward to our call for first quarter and again, safe and healthy new year.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Hallie Kuhn",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I will provide a recap of the life science industry in 2023 and an overview of the health and demand drivers of each of our life science tenant segments as we kick off 2024. John Templeton wisely wrote that bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die of euphoria. While the reset of the life science industry from euphoric 2021 highs has been rocky, healthy pessimism is seeding renewed momentum, underscored by rational valuations and capital flowing to the strongest technologies and experienced management teams. Fundamentally, the staggering unmet medical need that drives the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry has not debated, and the opportunity for companies and investors in the life science sector to positively impact human health and disease is massive. Through the ups and downs, the trajectory of the industry is positive, translating long-term, into a healthy and expanding tenant base. This sentiment is reflected in the numbers. The XBI, a weighted index of small and mid-cap biotech ended 2023, up 8%. Large biopharma performance, which had an exceptional 2022, while the rest of the market generally languished, ended flat. Two notable exceptions were Alexandria tenants, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk both of which ended the year up over 50% as the market for their novel diabetes and obesity medicines accelerated. And as Peter mentioned, in December, we announced a significant lease with Novo Nordisk for their new US R&D headquarters on our Waltham Mega campus in Greater Boston. Another 2023 biopharma trend was M&A. Excluding mega mergers over $50 billion, 2023 set a new high watermark with $159 billion in acquisitions. These were largely sub-$10 billion deals driven by pharma's need to bolster pipelines as they face steep revenue loss due to patent expirations. As M&A dollars are recycled back into the industry, it creates a positive cycle of innovation as scientists and entrepreneurs start their next new venture. Altogether, the M&A life cycle is an important driver of demand across our regions. With respect to the FDA, 55 novel medicines were approved in 2023, the second highest year on record and double the average number of annual approvals 20 years ago. There were also eight advanced cell and gene therapies approved. Tenant Vertex received FDA approval of CASGEVY this December, a potentially curative therapy for severe sickle cell disease and the first approved treatment utilizing a novel genome editing technology known as CRISPR. The takeaway is that the industry's model is working, novel scientific discoveries, such as CRISPR, which was elucidated just over a decade ago are translating into impactful medicines for patients.  Now let's take a closer look at the health and demand across each of our life science tenant segments. First, large pharma, which makes up 19% of our ARR continues to deploy substantial capital towards internal and external R&D, equating to over $270 billion in R&D spend.  Commitment to R&D is an imperative for pharma. Over the next decade, the top 20 pharma are staring down approximately $200 billion of lost revenue as patents expire, new competitors enter the market and a subset of medicines become subject to potential price setting by Medicare through the recently enacted IRA legislation. And where does pharma look to offset gap in revenue to smaller and nimbler biotechs. Currently, $3 out of every $5 of top 20 pharma revenue stemmed from medicines acquired through M&A and partnerships. Fortunately, this segment is well positioned with strong balance sheets and an estimated $1 trillion in available firepower to leverage. All told, we expect healthy levels of internal research and M&A to continue through 2024 and beyond. Importantly, innovation requires people and a critical component of the pharma equation is stellar talent. Recruiting and retaining scientists is more important than ever. Cancer can't be cured from the couch and expectations of a scientific workforce where working from home is not an option or high, requiring amenities and community that the scale of Alexandria's mega campuses are uniquely positioned to provide. This need is driving several large pharma requirements across our clusters. Transitioning to public biotechnology. Our ARR from biotechs with marketed products increased to 17% compared to 14% in 3Q. This increase is due to the delivery of Moderna's new headquarters at 325 Binney Street on our One Kendall Square mega campus, as well as several clinical stage companies transitioning to commercial stage after receiving marketing approval for new therapies. This segment continues to mature, with tenants such as Vertex eclipsing a market cap of $100 billion in 2023. Next step are our pre-commercial public biotech companies, which represent 8% of our ARR. For this segment, data trumps all. Companies that meet expected milestones have executed significant follow-on financings and stock prices have responded positively. In total, nearly $20 billion in follow-on financing was raised on U.S. stock exchanges in 2023, a quarter of which was raised by Alexandria tenants. Companies have also tapped alternative financing structures such as pipes and royalty deals providing additional access to liquidity. Our San Francisco-based tenant BridgeBio has raised over $900 million in the past 12 months from a combination of these sources, driven by clinical data for a novel medicine treating transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, a potential fatal disease of the heart muscle. As the IPO market cracks open in 2024, companies with the right clinical pedigree will be able to access additional liquidity. Last week, the first IPO of the year by asset-based CG Oncology priced above their target range and raised $380 million. On to private biotechnology, which encompasses 10% of our ARR, while life science venture investments slowed in 2023 relative to the highs of 2021 and 2022, it still exceeds pre-COVID levels and came in at approximately $40 billion. Series A, B and C rounds are predominantly being led by outside investors. Speaking to healthy levels of new investments, with the caveat that valuations have come down and deals often take longer to close. Funds have been conservative deploying the capital raised in the past several years and have ample dry powder. As the market's warm, we expect venture activity to remain strong through 2024. One counterbalance is that we may see less later-stage financings as a subset of companies go public instead of raising another round of private capital. Next, our life science product, service and device tenants, which represent 21% of our ARR. This segment includes contract manufacturers, diagnostic firms and research tool companies, all of which are critical and complementary to companies developing new medicines. For example, research tool companies are creating the next generation of advanced life science technologies such as super-resolution microscopes and DNA sequencers that can process an entire genome in half a day. These technologies often require large specialized footprints, complex infrastructure and highly trained scientific talent. As the trusted brand for life science real estate, our tenants look to Alexandria to safeguard the billions of dollars of equipment, intellectual property and assets housed within their labs. Last, our institutional tenants totaling 11% ARR as well-funded often credit tenants, institutions continue to be an engine of innovation within our ecosystems. One pioneering institutional tenant that came out of stealth this month is Cambridge-based Arena BioWorks. With $500 million in funding, Arena hired scientific luminaries from around the country, with the goal to combine and accelerate academic research and venture-backed drug development under one roof. Returning to where we started, the life science industry is squarely in the realm of healthy skepticism, exceeding the very early innings of the next bull run. We are not completely out of the woods yet with question marks around interest rates and 2024 election looming. However, accelerating pace of scientific innovation, access to significant capital from multiple sources and enormous unmet need for life-saving therapies will propel the industry forward and translate into healthy demand and increasing long-term revenue. With that, I will pass it over to Marc. Sure. And hi Vikram, this is Hallie. I think we need to separate out the component of non-technical space adjacent to the labs. These are desks largely for the researchers that are moving in and out of the labs through the day. And just there's no rationalization of that space. That space is needed, it's part of the workflow that scientists day in and day out are utilizing. Surely, there are larger office requirements that as companies grow, that they will lease up if it's for their clinical or sales and marketing. That's a different set of questions. That is not who we are catering by and large. So when it comes to the lab based infrastructure that space is not going to go away. And we even have examples right now where that lab to non-technical space ratio is shifting. We need more desk king, right? Like we have more scientists going in and out, people don't like to share the same space. They like their own desks. So just to make that clear, you really have to distinguish the two."

Consistent with Alexandria is building the future of life-changing innovation in medicine and at the Vanguard and the heart of the $5 trillion secularly growing industry, I want to wish everyone a safe and healthy 2024. On the cover of our press release and supplemental package, we've included the great Jim Collins quote about Alexandria, Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a great company: superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. On superior results, we're very proud to say that we've had a very strong total shareholder return since IPO of over 1,500%, beating all of the benchmark REIT indices and also every -- almost every other health care REIT. On distinctive impact, Alexandria's tenants whom we have supported are responsible for an astounding 50% of the novel FDA approved therapies over the last decade, truly amazing. And our unique one of a kind full continuum of care 115 project in Dayton, Ohio has treated more than 7,000 patients afflicted by opioid addiction and other substance abuses and has made a dramatic positive impact on the lives of thousands of people, and we're very proud of that accomplishment. And then moving to lasting endurance want to congratulate the Alexandria family team on this significant 30-year anniversary milestone of our founding on January 5, 1994 and who would or could have imagined in 1994 that this fledgling garage startup would have created an entirely new class of real estate at the Vanguard and the heart of the life science industry, combating many of the illnesses, which afflict our family and friends. So moving on to my take on fourth quarter and year-end 2023, I'd say we have witnessed the unprecedented eight-year bull run of the life science capital markets 2014 through 2021, the longest on record, coupled with the rocket ship funding during COVID. And the market in 2023 has clearly reflected the rationalization of the past decade. With respect to Alexandria in 2023, I would say, I would characterize our 2023 overall operating and financial performance as highly resilient. Notable achievements include 11% plus NOI growth year-over-year, 2023 to 2022 in very, very strong. We delivered a record $265 million of incremental NOI in 2023 with our development capabilities moving that to fruition, which are first-in-class. We've continued very solid leasing in 2023 with over 4 million plus rentable square feet leased with very respectable GAAP and cash numbers. Two key leases in fourth quarter, which are noted in the supplement, the lease to Novo Nordisk and the lease to Cargo Therapeutics. 2023, we had a remarkable 76% of leasing with existing tenants, and we look forward to a strong 2024 leasing effort and expect a handful of significant leases to mature soon. We expect to make significant progress on our lease expirations and filling vacant space, while achieving positive rent growth. 2023 we did a highly confident job of self-funding our growth and will continue to do so in 2024. Our balance sheet and liquidity are in the best shape in the company's history, and we're very proud of that accomplishment. We have given and reconfirmed very solid detailed guidance for 2024, and we believe that the life science industry will continue to benefit most importantly, from some key macro tailwinds in 2024, including positive M&A activity, declining interest rates, increased innovation and some great key data readouts. And finally, before I turn it over to Peter to comment on a range of critical issues. I want to comment on the sale of our 42nd Street asset in New York City, leased to Pfizer through midyear 2024. They previously vacated and moved their headquarters to another site in New York City. We made a strategic decision not to go forward with the contemplated redevelopment of that building to in part to state and local to challenging state and local governmental policies. We also had a somewhat similar, but not on the scale reaction back a number of years ago and our successful reduction in our footprint in the city of San Francisco. We have created and grown the commercial life science lab space market in New York City. When we delivered our East Tower and our ACLS mega campus back in 2010, there were only essentially two companies of any significance that we're doing commercial life science research in New York City, many academics, but no -- virtually no commercial. Today, there are over 100 but New York City, the life science market there remains here 14 years later, still a small start-up market. And we believe that by focusing on our ACLS New York City mega campus. That's the best way for us to continue to be successful. And we have taken this disciplined action out of an abundance of prudence. And with that, let me turn the commentary over to Peter. So, please open it up for questions, operator. Yes. So, Marc comment? Yes. So, when Marc says next year, we're in 2024, but the next year from 2023, which we're reporting, just so we're clear. Yes. So Marc, Peter, you guys want to comment? Yes, the former, Tony. Yes. I think we're -- I think as Marc and Peter have indicated, we're focused on really noncore, noncampus assets. So we feel pretty good about that. Thank you. Yes. So I don't think we would want to talk about pipeline that I think is pretty confidential stuff, Vikram. But I think you can assume every lease is somewhat different, and every market is somewhat different. I mean, if you go back and look at the cargo therapeutic, that was a very unique lease in a very unique set of circumstances. So it isn't like -- this is not a commodity product. This is a generally a premium priced, noncommodity product. So, it's not like you have the same bunch of folks waiting for the same amount of space in the same, kind of, market type place. It's just not that kind of a business. That's always asked. Hallie, do you want to kind of comment on that? Yeah. And remember, they're a big cap company. So like big pharma, they have, kind of, dedicated legions of people doing things in traditional office, if you will, so it's not a typical case. Yes. Marc, do you want to comment on that? Marc? Well, I think the key is -- and it's a good question, it's one of those situations where you're trying to find the right key to fit the right lock. You know, an exact amount of space that comes vacant that one would not have wanted to be vacant due to Atreca and finding the exact user of that space with literally very little downtime. And as I think Marc said, we had no TIs. So you don't want to just let that kind of a tenant go into the market and choose from some assorted number of spaces that might be available now or in the future. And so you try to make the deal because it's the perfect lock fitting -- the perfect key fitting the right lock. And so that's kind of the story. Yes. So Peter, do you want to give some commentary? Yes. Thank you. Yes. Hey, Jim, the way to think about that is every case is different. If it's a smaller company with a specific product, it's sometimes just bolted on and the space isn't necessarily utilized and maybe subleased or terminated. But oftentimes, you find a strategic acquisition, and they could be on the larger medium or even smaller side, where companies, I can think of the Bristol-Myers, Juno in Seattle back a number of years ago, where BMS wanted really to get into the cell therapy issue and that led not only to the acquisition but a fairly big expansion. So if they're buying, if it's a strategic technology platform with multiple product shots on goal, usually, those end up with very, very good expansion results. If it's a smaller bolt-on, sometimes those don't. But everyone is honestly different. Yes. So Marc? Yes. I think the other way to think about that is the just-in-time inventory issue is really focused on, primarily biotech companies clinical stage that hit a milestone, and they need to move pretty rapidly the scale because of that milestone, which also yields funding, and that's where you get probably the most kick on the just-in-time space. Yeah. Marc, do you want to comment on that? But the fact that we've reiterated guidance here, I think Jamie should give you comfort that we think we can hit those numbers pretty comfortably. Otherwise, we wouldn't stick with it. Well, I think, again, if you go back to Hallie's comments and think about the different sectors, each sector is kind of driven by different issues when it comes to, say, big pharma or big cap bio, those are dependent upon their needs and not on the vicissitudes of the capital markets today or whatever. But then you contrast those to clinical stage biotech who are waiting to hit a clinical milestone or not, than those -- that's where -- and Peter has reemphasized this a number of times, boards want to be really careful not to get ahead of their skis. So it really depends on the sector that you're looking at. It's not a one-size shoe fits all, if you will. Yes. So maybe let's do this since we're doing fourth quarter and year-end 2023, let us and Peter Macken [ph] noted this, will specifically address that on our first quarter call, if you don't mind. Okay. Thank you. Yes. And again, I think you have to distinguish different sectors have different tolerances for investing in space and they can be pretty dramatically different. And as Peter said, the structural inflation that we have brought on ourselves over the last number of years as a country and really as a world is pretty much here to stay. So -- and that's true across all real estate classes. Yes. I think we'd rather not get into that issue and just let it be at this moment. I don't think we want to discuss that on an earnings call. Sorry. Thank you, everybody, and I look forward to our call for first quarter and again, safe and healthy new year."

            "name": "Marc Binda",
            "content": "Thank you, Hallie. This is Marc Binda here. Hello, and good afternoon, everyone. Congratulations to our entire team for outstanding execution this past year in a very challenging macroeconomic environment. I'll start with our solid financial results. Total revenues and NOI for 2023 were up 11.5% and 12.2%, respectively, over 22%, primarily driven by solid same-property performance and record high development and redevelopment projects placed into service in 2023 with an incremental annual NOI of $265 million. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was $897, up a solid 6.5% over 2022. We're very proud to report solid operating results for the year, driven by disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy. Our tenants continue to appreciate our brand collaborative mega campuses and our operational excellence by our team. We have high-quality cash flows with 52% of our annual rental revenue as of 4Q 2023 from investment-grade and publicly traded large-cap tenants, up 3% from the prior quarter. And we have one of the highest quality client rosters in the REIT industry. 75% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses, collections remained very high at 99.9%, adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 69% and 96% of our leases contain annual rent escalations approximating 3%. Now, solid rental rate growth and leasing volume drove same-property NOI growth in 2023, up 3.4% and 4.6% on a cash basis. These results were in line with our previous guidance and very solid results, especially considering the macro environment. As expected, our Fourth Quarter same-property results took some pressure due to some temporary vacancy and four properties spread across Boston, San Francisco and San Diego, comprising about 330,000 square feet that is 64% leased or negotiating. We expect same property results to accelerate in the second half of 2024, driven by anticipated solid rental rate growth, occupancy growth in the second half of the year, coupled with the four properties I just mentioned, as well as contractual rent increases and the burn-off of contractual free rent from executed leases. We expect solid same property growth for 2024 consistent with what we provided at our Investor Day in December, up 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the mid point of our guidance range. Leasing volume in the fourth quarter was solid at 890,000 square feet for the quarter and 4.3 million for the year, which is in line with our general historical average from 2013 to 2020. We continue to benefit from our long-standing tenant relationships and brand loyalty with 76% of our leasing completed in 2023 coming from existing tenant relationships. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing space in 2023 was very strong at 29.4% and 15.8% on a cash basis. These are very solid results and are the third highest annual amounts, compared to the 10 years preceding the rocket ship years of 2021 and 2022. 4Q 2023 rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing of space was 9.2% and 5.5% on a cash basis. Due to the incredible execution by our team, we were able to backfill the roughly 100,000 square foot former Atreca space in San Carlos with a very exciting clinical-stage biotech company called Cargo Therapeutics during the quarter at solid economics, including no TIs and limited downtime. The starting cash rent on that deal was slightly negative at about negative 4% compared to the most recent in-place rents from [indiscernible] that was three years into a 10-year lease. Given the quarterly results are driven by a relatively small amount of square feet, the relatively flat results from this transaction had a meaningful impact on the quarterly rental rate increases. Excluding this transaction, rental rate increases for the quarter would have been 21.4% and 9.7% on a cash basis. We expect solid rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing of space for 2024 at a midpoint of 15% and 9% on a cash basis with some variation from quarter-to-quarter. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to our in-place leases for the entire asset base remains solid at 14%. Our non-revenue-enhancing expenditures, including TIs and leasing commissions on second generation space have averaged 15% of NOI over the last five years and remained low during 2023 and in the 12% to 13% range. Year-end occupancy was solid at 94.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior quarter and the primary driver of the increase from the third quarter was space that was delivered in San Diego. The midpoint of our guidance range for occupancy for year-end 2024 is 95.1%, so we do expect some modest growth in occupancy through the year as well as growth in same-property occupancy in the second half of the year. Transitioning to the balance sheet. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the company's history as of 4Q 2023. Our corporate credit rankings link in the top 10% of all publicly traded US public REITs. We met our goal for year-end leverage of 5.1 times for net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly annualized basis. And we ended the year with tremendous liquidity of $5.8 billion fixed rate debt comprising 98.1% of our total debt, a weighted average remaining term of debt of 12.8 years and no debt maturities until 2025. Only 20% of our debt matures in the next five years and 29% of our debt matures in 2049 and beyond with an attractive rate of 3.91%. We continue to focus on the enhancement of our overall asset base and the recycling of capital through outright dispositions of assets that are not integral to our mega campus strategy. We recognize that these types of assets will likely have a higher cost of capital than our core assets located in our mega campuses, but this will allow us to recycle these proceeds into our highly leased development and redevelopment pipeline and to continue to enhance our mega campus strategy. For 2023, we completed dispositions and partial interest sales of $1.3 billion, including $439 million of dispositions completed in the fourth quarter. Importantly, during 2023, we did not issue any new common equity other than the settlement of our outstanding forward equity contracts from 2022, which raised $104 million and we're very proud of our strong execution capability. The team is laser focused on the execution of our capital plan headed into 2024, and we have pending dispositions subject to letters of intent or sales agreements for another $142 million that we expect to close in 2024. Based upon our current outlook, we expect our asset recycling program to be more heavily weighted towards outright dispositions of non-core assets rather than partial interest sales in 2024. In the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $271.9 million, which included two significant items. First was the $94.8 million charge related to the sale of 380 and 420 East Street located in the Seaport, which had been announced last quarter and subsequently closed during the fourth quarter. And then second, as Joel mentioned, $93.5 million of a charge related to an office property located in Manhattan, which was classified as held for sale this quarter. The New York project Joel mentioned was acquired in 2018 as a covered land project with a leaseback and in-place cash flows. But in the fourth quarter, we elected not to proceed with the conversion project and this is now under contract and expected to be sold next year. Cash flows from operating activities after dividends for 2024 is expected to be very strong at $450 million at the midpoint of our guidance, and we'll continue to support growth in our annual common stock dividends per share. We had a low conservative FFO payout ratio of 56% for the quarter with a 6% average per share dividend increase over the last five years and at this pace of retained cash flows over the next three years, Cash flows from operating activities after dividends should generate close to $1.4 billion of efficient capital for reinvestment. Now I'll turn to a couple of important highlights on the external growth side. 2023 and 4Q 2023 were both record years in terms of the amount of incremental annual NOI onboarded with $265 million and $145 million, respectively. Importantly, about 80% of the annual rental revenue delivered in the fourth quarter was the investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants, including Moderna and Eli Lilly. With a very large amount of deliveries around mid-quarter on average in the fourth quarter, we expect a significant earnings benefit headed into 1Q 2024. We expect tremendous growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $114 million upon the burn-off of initial free rent related to recently delivered projects with a weighted average burn-off period of about 10 months. And as Peter highlighted, we have 5.7 million rentable square feet of projects that are 60% leased or negotiating and projects that will generate $495 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next four years. A key item to highlight here is that we had strong leasing activity in the pipeline with over 500,000 square feet either leased or added to the negotiating bucket through signed LOIs during the quarter, which was the most we've had since 2Q 2022. Next, on capitalized interest, our outlook for capitalized interest for 2024 is consistent with our previous guidance. And as a reminder, we expect capitalized interest for 2024 to be impacted by the following: First, and overall decline in average real estate basis subject to capitalization compared to 2023, which was driven in part by the large basis placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2023, and second, we expect an offsetting increase caused by an uptick in our weighted average interest rate on borrowings used in the calculation of capitalization of interest in 2024 compared to 2023. I'll turn next to venture investments. Realized gains from venture investments included in FFO per share as adjusted for the quarter was $12.3 million, which was below our recent run rate, in part due to a large realized loss on one of our investments that occurred late in the quarter. FFO per share as adjusted over the last three years has included on average, $96 million of realized gains in each year from venture investments or approximately $24 million per quarter. Our outlook for quarterly realized gains from venture investments in 2024 and is $95 million to $125 million, which is modestly above our three-year annual average of $96 million. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of the end of the quarter were $320 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. Turning to guidance. We have reaffirmed our solid guidance for 2024 that was initially provided in connection with our Annual Investor Day on November 29th, with a few minor changes as outlined in our supplemental package on Page 4. Our range for guidance for EPS is $3.49 to $3.69 and our range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $9.37 to $9.57, with no change in the midpoint of $9.47, which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share, following excellent growth last year of 6.5%. Lastly, our ATM program expired in early January of this year upon the expiration of our shelf registration, so we do expect to file a new program here in the near future. With that, let me turn it over to Joel. Yes, sure. Hi Josh. So, we do have about 300,000 square feet of leases that we've already signed that have not commenced that will commence next year. So we have a good head start headed into 2024. I think to put things into perspective, we've got about $3.4 million of lease rules next year. But after you back out the space that we've anticipated, we'll go dark into redevelopment or development that only leaves you with about 1 1.8 million square feet that's not resolved. So, I think that number feels pretty manageable relative to our historical run rate on leasing. Yeah. Sure. Hi, Rich. Yeah, so under the accounting rules, these -- you can -- the common way where you could have an impairment is at the point where you designate an asset as held for sale. So as we get closer to potentially committing to certain sales, it's definitely possible that we could have additional impairments. But it's really hard to say at this point as we're still refining our approach and which assets to sell. So hard to say at this point. Yes. Hi, Rich. So we did -- yes, we had $114 million of free rent that will be burning off. I guess just to put that into perspective, we delivered $265 million of NOI this year, that's annual NOI. And a lot of those leases are very long-term in nature. So it's not a direct correlation one for one, but if you just do the simple math there, it's less than less than half a year on what is generally on average, those types of leases are 10 years and longer. So I don't think it's something that we're super concerned with. But to be fair, free rent has trickled up a little bit as we've seen. I mean we published our free rent statistics, Rich. And I think it was about months 3 \u2013 0.3 months per year of rent at the end of last year. And I think we're at 0.6, so it's ticked up a little bit this year, but still relatively modest compared to the length of leases. Yes. So we gave the leased/negotiating stats. I think it was about half of that 64% was leased and the other half was negotiation. And that stuff is expected to benefit the last half of the year. We do need to continue to make progress on that. But then we do have a significant amount of free rent that's contractual that has already been leased. It will also contribute to the numbers in the back half of the year. Yeah, sure. I think last quarter we -- or at least as of Investor Day, we did have the 219 East 42nd Street asset in there as something that we thought that we would redevelop or develop turned out that we've decided to sell that asset. Aside from that, it's been pretty consistent from the last quarter. I think a lot of those redevelopment assets are in great locations in places that we'd like to be. But certainly, as we go through our process to look at non-core assets. It's always possible that we find things in there that could potentially be sold. Yeah. We did have some impairments during the quarter here, Jamie. But I think when we look back over three years, we've averaged like $96 million over the last three years per year. And so over a longer period, when we look back, the impairments have been pretty modest relative to the size of those gains. So I think we're thinking about the things that Hallie mentioned upfront, just with some renewed excitement around M&A that we feel pretty comfortable with that number headed into next year. Yes. Hard to say where values go. Yes. No, I think we're talking about the values today. I think if you look on balance sheet, we've got something like north of $300 million of unrealized gains that we could tap. And part of it too, to be fair, a lot of it is outside of our control, whether it's an M&A event or an acquisition by big pharma or so forth. So some of it, it's hard to predict because these things kind of happen when they happen."

            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thanks, Joel. In Flagship Pioneerings 2024 Annual Letter, Founder and CEO, Noubar Afeyan, described 2023 as a polycrisis, encompassing the confluence of economic turbulence, climate change, deeply fractured politics, two global wars, threats to democracy, loss of trust in institutions, and continuing dislocations triggered by the COVID epidemic. Alexandria's solid 2023 performance within such a dismal backdrop is nothing less than extraordinary. I don't want to steal too much of Mark's thunder, but leasing close to our average volume since 2018 ex the rocket ship years and maintaining strong earnings growth, while navigating through this poly crisis is a testament to Alexandria's competitive advantage and the power of our brand that Joel and Dan eloquently articulated at Investor Day. Heading into 2024, the poly crisis remains, but so does our resiliency. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And in 2023, we proved that we can self-fund our investments and still maintain our lowest leverage level in history. Thus, with our unique business model, highly skilled and experienced talent impeccable execution and a healthy underlying industry poised to advance human and planetary health. We've created the fertile industrial ecosystem, Mr. Afan [ph] postulated can generate value while defending against any coming vulnerabilities, we aim to prove that thesis right. I'm going to discuss our development pipeline, leasing, supply and asset sales and hand it over to Hallie. In the Fourth Quarter, we delivered 1,228,604 square feet into our high barrier to entry submarkets bringing total deliveries for the year to 3,271,170 square feet covering 15 projects. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the year of approximately $265 million and the incremental NOI delivered during the quarter of $145 million are both the highest total in company history. The initial weighted average stabilized deal for 2023 deliveries was 7%, supported by a strong stabilized yield on cost of 7.7% from our fourth quarter deliveries. Development and redevelopment leasing activity of approximately 234,000 square feet was higher quarter-over-quarter for the third reporting period in a row, and the positive momentum is expected to continue as we signed 270,000 square feet of LOIs during the quarter. At quarter end, our pipeline of current and near-term projects are 60% leased or under negotiations, which include executed LOIs. From the first quarter of 2024 through the end of 2027, we expect to deliver approximately 90% of the $495 million of stabilized NOI the current pipeline is expected to generate. Demand from our highly innovative credit tenant base, looking to leverage the place-making and scale of our mega campus model is expected to drive future opportunities, such as the Novo Nordisk lease executed during the quarter for 165,000 square feet at the Alexandria Center for Life Science Waltham, Mega Campus in Greater Boston. Transitioning to leasing and supply. We leased 4,306,072 square feet during the year and 889,737 square feet during the quarter. To put some context to that, it's roughly half of the average of the rocket ship years of 2021 and 2022, but very close to the average volume we leased in the three years prior from 2018 through 2020. We've returned to the fundamentals which were trending positively before 2021 and 2022. So we feel really good about the near- and long-term prospects for our business. We spoke a lot about the competitive advantages that our Mega Campus model affords us during Investor Day. 63% of the total leasing we did during the year was completed in our highly curated Class A mega campuses, located in high barrier to entry life science clusters. And they are the key reason we continue to post strong cash and GAAP rent increases, which came in at 15.8% and 29.4%, respectively, for the year. We believe the beginning of 2023 was the low point for demand and are pleased to see that demand for Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay and San Diego are all up year-over-year. A good sign since this does not include a number of projects that are on hold as management teams and Boards remain cautious. However, that should change soon. As you will hear from Hallie, the trajectory of the industry has turned positive. In the meantime, we continue to win the majority of the current high-quality demand due to tenants prioritizing location, place-making experience, ability to scale, proven operational excellence, reliability and trustworthiness. Our teams continue to closely track supply building-by-building in our proprietary databases. As we turn the page on 2023, we expect 2024 to be the peak year for new deliveries then begin to dissipate in 2025. In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 7% of market inventory, a 0.9% increase over last quarter, not due to new projects, but because of project deliveries being pushed from 2023 to 2024. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by another 2.5%, an expected slowdown from 2024 levels. In San Francisco Bay, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 10.7% of market inventory, which is a 2.7% increase. Like Greater Boston, this increase is driven by projects that were expected to deliver in 2023, but are taking longer than expected. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by much less at 2.2%, a good sign, but still a 1% increase over last quarter due to a new project breaking ground in Menlo Park. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 6.8% of market inventory, a slight decrease from last quarter due to an increase in supply from projects being pushed from 2023 to 2024, offset by leasing in those projects. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will decelerate to 2.7% of market inventory. A quick update on direct and sublease vacancy. Direct vacancy in Greater Boston is up 258 basis points to 7.05%, still mid-single-digits despite a number of deliveries in late 2023. It has climbed 270 basis points to 12.36% in our San Francisco Bay markets due to unleased new deliveries. And in San Diego, the increase has been more modest, rising 121 basis points to 7.97% driven primarily by Serina Therapeutics vacating all of their leases in the region. They are not an Alexandria tenant. Subleased vacancy has remained stable, ranging from 5.4% in San Diego to 5.9% in Boston. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. Continued demand for our assets enabled us to self-fund our investments as we presented at Investor Day. Page 6 of the supplemental summarizes the material transaction closed during the year. What can be taken away from the partial interest sales at 15 Necco and 9625 Town Center Drive and the sale of 11119 North Torrey Pines Road is that well-located and stabilized assets located in Alexandria's primary submarkets continue to command a premium valuation. Others in solid locations, but in need of material CapEx for repositioning such as the Second Avenue and Memorial portfolio in Greater Boston completed in the Second Quarter and the Memorial Drive Beaver Street and Roselle Street portfolio completed in the fourth quarter, delivered solid per square foot valuations due to their solid historical performance. Due to the unstabilized nature of these portfolio sales, the cap rates will not provide any meaningful insights to return expectations on stabilized properties. However, I can point you to Healthpeak's 65% sale of 3020 and 3030 Callan Ridge Road in Torrey Pines as a directional comp. The building is fully leased long-term to a credit tenant but is not expected to be occupied by said tenant. The purchase price yielded a 5.3% cap rate despite that change or despite that challenge. As we presented at Investor Day, our strategies that continue to widen the moat with competitive advantages our mega campus model provides by recycling our non-campus assets into our current and future mega campuses. With that, I'll pass the call over to Hallie. Yes, I'll take it, Josh. Hard to predict. But certainly, the effects of 2023 supply has been seen net effective rents. We've seen TIs increase remarkably, we've talked about that before. TIs aren't going to go any further up, because they're already pretty high. I'd say, there's some pricing power to the tenant if they've got a very large requirement. But outside of that, I think things have been holding relatively well. Yes, thank you. This is Peter. Just to be clear, Biogen is rationalizing their pure office space, nothing to do with their lab space. Yeah. Next question, operator. Yes. Hi, Rich. It's Peter. The great financial crisis, it was more like one. So we're -- it's still pretty healthy considering the market dynamics. Thank you, Rich. Yes. I mean that speculating on what the Cambridge asset would be on a stabilized basis, I'd just kind of point to where we've seen stabilized things in Boston trade ourselves in the low to mid-5s. With the Necco transaction we had a couple of quarters ago, Boston Properties last quarter did something in the high 5s, but it's about two or three years from cash flowing. So I pointed to, in my commentary, a 5.3% cap rate in Torrey Pines for a building that's fully leased long-term to a credit tenant but that tenant has decided not to move in. So I've said it before, we speculate that good, well-located assets with good credit and good lease term are going to be in the low 5s, the sub-5 cap rates are no longer with us due to rates. Hopefully, that's helpful. Yes. Decision-making has been slow. And I mean, I guess what I've talked about is that and tenants not wanting to invest in space. So the preference has been to go into available build space, things that are vacant or rolling or subleased rather than plan ahead and move in 12 months later into a development project. A lot of that has to do with a lot of the requirements over the past year and a half have been small, versus a larger requirement that you might not be easy to find and you need to put into a newer building. But that I don't think anybody is waiting to the last minute. It's really a function of the size of the company. If you're under 15,000 square feet or even under 20,000 square feet, you probably have options. If you're above that, you definitely need to plan ahead, because there's a lot less inventory in those sizes. Yes. I mean, the increase in the large increase in tenant improvement concessions has really been almost exclusively in new development space where you would traditionally give somebody $200 a foot plus or minus, depending on the market. With their rental rate and then expect them to invest into the rest of the space that, as we've talked about, has gone to $300 a square foot. If you look at the operating portfolio, and you pointed out that the numbers prove this, that concession isn't needed, because that is already built out. And one of the beautiful things about our business is how the tenants or how the TIs are recyclable. So we build something out first generation. It's very rare that we have to put a material amount of money into it the next time around. And given that it's probably got a large investment from a tenant, the first-generation tenant. We don't have to bump the rents much to make up for that additional investment, right, because we didn't make it. So it becomes a very valuable thing to a tenant to be able to move into something that's already built out. And so they aren't seeking the type of concessions that they are for new space. Now, it ties to what I said before, if you're in the -- a smaller set of space needs 25,000 square feet or less, you might have some options to find. But once you get above that, it becomes tougher to find existing space. So you might end up going more towards new development where you would see the concessions of higher TIs, but you're also paying higher rents. Yeah. Thank you, Tom. I think it's the new normal going forward? I mean it's driven certainly by more competition in the market, but it's also driven by the higher cost to build out space that's been a considerable increase in construction costs as you guys all know, and I used to comment on. So that alone, I mean, the availability numbers will eventually resolve themselves, but the costs are what they are and the tenants are willing to invest in the space, but only to a certain degree. So, I think that, that that number is here to stay?"

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaula Schwartz: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our third quarter conference call and the order of speaking today will be, I\u2019ll kick off, Hallie will follow, Peter will follow Hallie and then Marc will do clean up as most of you know, Dean Shigenaga stepped down as Chief Financial Officer on September 15th. He'll remain full-time employee and will be on our Q&A call. But Marc is going to, and Dean is mostly responsible for the quarter. But Marc will handle today's call on the presentation.  I want to start off with two quotes. First by one of the most legendary, by two legendary investors. First one is Warren Buffett who has said and many know, this quote, be fearful when others are greedy and opportunistic when others are fearful and so we are. And a quote from one of the most legendary institutional investors on Alexandria.  Alexandria is a life science industry leader solely publicly traded pure-play REIT at its current discounted valuation we believe concerns about competitive supply and distress for some of the company\u2019s life science tenants were overblown and sufficiently discounted in the company\u2019s valuation. We believe the management team has assembled a desirable real estate portfolio, enjoys a leading market share position in its geographic markets and has solid expectations for long-term demand-driven growth.  So I want to thank each and every member of the Alexandria family team for a strong and operationally outstanding third quarter for this one of a kind read, especially in a very challenging, and continuing disruptive macro environment. Our size, scale and the dominance we've chosen to undertake in our key submarkets coupled with our irreplaceable brand of importance to our over 1800 tenants represents a distinctive impact few other REITs will ever enjoy.  We continue to dominate those of our key submarkets where we have created a leading position and continue to maintain pricing power for a highly desirable mega campuses which enable life science entities to meet their mission-critical needs and also a path for future growth.  Couple of thoughts on the third quarter. We continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet, one of the best in the entire REIT industry. We continue our consistent strong and increasing dividend with a focus on retaining significant cash flows after dividend payment for reinvestment. We're well on track for a 7% FFO per share growth for 2023, fueled by our onboarding of substantial net operating income, the first half approximately $81 million, the third quarter approximately $39 million and the fourth quarter, approximately $114 million.  A few comments on FDA drug approvals, which is the holy grail of the life science industry and Hallie will have more to say. During the period, which was the bull biotech market 2015 to 2021, almost three quarters of approvals were biotech and 25% were pharma. So biotech continues to be the mainstay of innovation.  This year as Hallie will detail, 45 approvals to-date and it could surpass the all-time high of 59 in 2018. Hallie will address the health of the life science industry and the demand generators. But third quarter leasing of approximately 870,000 rentable square feet was very solid and especially with a weighted average lease term of an amazing 13 years and very strong, leasing spreads, almost 20% on the cash basis and almost 29% on a GAAP basis while leasing costs were decreasing.  Life science tenant health is one of the most frequently asked questions and again Hallie will address that in depth. We are in a de facto recession and in the self-inflicted inflationary and high interest rate environment. So that is driving caution, but the life science industry is unequivocally healthy thriving, and the key to improved healthcare outcomes which are desperately needed for all of us.  Internal growth remains steady and solid with same-store cash NOI growth for the year at a strong 5.6%, occupancy on course for about 95% plus as of yearend and Mark will have much more to say on internal growth. Peter will detail external growth and our strong efforts of onboarding the substantial net operating income as I just referred to, and he will also update as he does each quarter supply dynamics.  Peter will also give a brief update on the status of our self-funding for the balance of 2023 and the year as a whole.  Let me say in summary, we know this is a tough show me market filled with many skeptics. Many of those skeptics doubting the health of life science industry despite clear facts to the contrary over blowing the impact of the elevated levels of new construction, no matter the quality location and/or sponsor or operations and we know of numerous operating debacles causing substantial damage to tenants by so-called other operators to their science doubting the ability of Alexandria, the self-funded business, despite clear facts to the contrary.  Each and every reporting quarter, we intend to continue our world-class operational excellence with exceptionalism in all we do and we intend to capture virtually all of the future demand of our over 800 tenants and virtually all of the future demand of non-tenants who meet our underwriting requirements. And we intend to execute a perfect thread the needle self-funding plan for the remainder of 2023, as well, as 2024 as our assets continue to remain scarce and still in demand.  And then finally, before I turn it over to Hallie, I would say remembering that CREDO of the Navy Navy SEALs, the only easy day is yesterday. So Hallie take it away. \nHallie Kuhn : Thank you, Joel and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Alexandria is at the Vanguard and Heart of the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry, which translates into numerous demand drivers for Alexandria's mission-critical lab space and we are the go-to partner for the life science industry. Today I am going to review these demand drivers and exciting new areas of life science, research and development all of which translates into a healthy and expanding tenant base and increasing long-term revenue.  So first, what do we mean when we say the life science industry is secularly growing? First, massive unmet medical need with over 90% of known diseases having no available treatments drives the life science industry providing a tremendous opportunity for innovation, new company formation and life science industry growth. This opportunity set does not change at the whims of the market. It is non-cyclical and non-discretionary.  Second, tenant growth and demand are event and milestone-driven. Important milestones include new biological discoveries, successful advancement of experimental therapies into the clinic and ultimately the demonstration of safety and efficacy of new medicines. Expansion of new therapeutic modalities such as cell, gene and RNA medicines; better diagnostic tools to accurately identify and diagnose patients, and increasingly efficient and predictive clinical trial designs have the potential to increase the number of new medicines over the coming years.  Third, multifaceted and differentiated funding sources ensure that life science companies founded on impactful and differentiated technologies with experienced management teams continue to thrive Altogether, we estimate over $400 billion will be deployed to support life science companies in 2023 across venture funding, biopharma R&D, philanthropy, government, grants and public equity financings.  Notably, 2023 has already exceeded the previous 10 year average of $360 billion and the total market capitalization of public life science companies currently exceeds five trillion. Together, the massive unmet medical need, event-driven growth, and robust and diverse funding sources result in secular growth of the life science industry that drive additional demand for Alexandria lab space, even amid an economic downturn.  The output of this significant investment is longer, healthier lives. As Joel commented, 43 new therapies have been approved this year by the FDA, and six novel gene, cell and RNA-based therapies have been approved. These numbers are on track to meet or exceed the all-time high for annual FDA approvals. That was in 2018 when 59 novel therapies were approved by the FDA.  This is extremely positive above all for the patients that need these medicines. An example of important new therapies on track for approval include the class of GLP1 medicines for obesity, a disease, which accounts for direct costs of over a $170 billion in healthcare spending in the US per year and afflicts, one, and three children and one in five adults.  A decade ago, obesity was considered a minefield for drug development and the industry sentiment was that medicine could not address such a complex disease. Fast forward, and pharma has unlocked an entirely new class of anti-obesity medicines and analyst estimate upwards of 10% of the US population will have been treated with a GLP1 by 2030 with an estimated market size of $40 billion to $50 billion.  Another exciting area is artificial intelligence and machine learning tools. As highlighted in our recent press release, AI is not new to the life science industry. In 2021, there were over a hundred drug and biologic submissions to the FDA developed using AI components. Nor do AI tools negate the need for lab space. In many cases, AI focused life science companies require significant lab footprints to generate the immense biological and chemical datasets needed to effectively train AI ML models.  To this end, the acceleration of AI may in fact, increase the need for laboratory footprints. And we already see this manifesting as an exciting emerging segment of demand.  Now, moving to the health of our diverse life science tenant base. While some analysts and investors have a misconception that small and mid-cap biotech are a proxy for the entire life science industry, and its growth, the reality is broader, and far more complex. Starting with multinational pharma, which account for 18% of our ARR, companies are leveraging healthy balance sheets to double down on R&D and in licensing, acquire innovative products. Biopharma alone invested $278 billion in R&D in 2022, representing a 66% increase, compared to 10 years prior.  Biopharma also has an estimated $500 million in M&A firepower to continue to bring external innovation into their portfolios. To that end, M&A has regained momentum with $112 billion in acquisitions in 2023 exceeding the 2021 and 2022 levels. Large pharma continues to heavily rely on innovation from smaller biotechs to backfill their pipelines.  For example, BMS\u2019 top five products in. 2022 were all derived from acquisitions. For J&J, Merck and Pfizer, four out of five of the company's top selling therapies were from licensing or M&A deals. So how does M&A impacts net absorption within our clusters? The specific impact of M&A events needs to be looked at on a case-by-case basis, but it\u2019s broadly positive.  Platform companies acquired not just for their clinical assets, but for their R&D platform and scientific talent, lend tend to land and expand so to speak. A great example is in San Diego where the significant presence of large pharma tenants including BMS, Eli Lily, Takeda, and Vertex were all driven by acquisitions of smaller biotech companies.  We are also in the process of supporting the significant expansion of a pharma acquired company in Greater Boston more to come on this at Investor Day. Companies acquired for specific assets may not lead to additional expansion, but we do benefit from an upgrading credit in all cases as the acquirer will be responsible for each in place lease.  M&A also leads to capital being returned to investors and can drive formation of new companies within our ecosystems as experienced scientists and entrepreneurs start their next new endeavors, which also creates additional demand for Alexandria lab space. Critically, for pharma to remain competitive and ensure a steady stream of successful, innovative medicines over the next decade, they need to attract the best talent and have the infrastructure and operational supports to accelerate and safeguard their mission-critical science.  This need is driving several significant requirements in key R&D clusters and Alexandria is the go-to brand.  Transitioning to public biotechnology companies, 14% ARR is represented by companies with marketed products and 10% ARR by preclinical and clinical companies. For our commercial stage biotech tenants, they notched a $108 billion in revenue through the third quarter of 2023, including the likes of Gilead, Vertex and Amgen.  For our pre-commercial companies, the public market for small and mid cap biotechs certainly remains challenging. However, companies that meet expected milestones have executed significant follow-on financings and stock prices have responded positively. Through 3Q $14 billion has been raised in follow on offerings, which is on track to beat total 2022 follow-ons of $14.5 billion.  This includes tenant vaccite which earlier this year netted $545 million in total proceeds to fund their potentially best-in-class, pneumonia vaccine and others including Editas and Etera. There are also some green shoots in the IPO market for companies with the right pedigree, namely deep clinical pipelines with line of sight to important inflection points.  In September, San Diego tenant RayzeBio raised an oversubscribed $358 million IPO driven by near-term clinical trial data readouts, testing their first-in-class radio pharmaceutical therapies for rare forms of cancer. On to private biotech which makes up 9% ARR, while life science funding has largely reverted to pre-pandemic levels, it remains robust.  Annualized projections of life science venture funding for 2023 are trending towards an estimated $27 billion which exceeds 2019 levels of nearly $24 billion. Further while a frequent assumption is that many financings are being propped up by current insiders, the data highlights that this is just not true. In a detailed analysis by Oppenheimer of Series A and B financings year-to-date, nearly 80% of all financings were led or co-led by outside investors speaking to a healthy appetite from investors to fund new deals.  Our new lease with Altos Labs on our One Alexandria Square Mega Campus in San Diego is one example of a stellar private company, having raised a historic $3 billion to deploy towards self reprogramming to treat diseases associated with aging.  Last, life science products, service and devices which represent 22% of our ARR continue to be the workhorse of the industry, providing the hardware and software so to speak that fueled experiments in the lab. There are challenges that exist post-COVID as some companies ramped up products and services, either directly or indirectly driven by COVID-19 and are now resetting strategic priorities.  But novel areas of science and successful products are emerging and generating new forms of demand such as the new obesity drugs, which will require significant CDMO capacity to manufacture and new forms of drug discovery such as proteonics highlighted by the recent acquisition of Olink for a $3.1 billion by Thermo Fisher.  Altogether, the results of the current market conditions is that companies are highly conscious of every dollar spent. They do not have the luxury of risking their science and unreliable lab space or in locations where they can't recruit the right talent.  We continue to see increasing demand for companies looking - by companies for looking for just in time availability of high quality lab space in amenitized campuses in the best locations with the infrastructure and operations that ensure their mission-critical work is supported 24/7 and that there is a path for future growth needs. And this is what Alexandria's one of a kind lab space within our world-class mega campuses is uniquely positioned to deliver.  To end, I want to share some insight from Dr. Robert Langer, an MIT professor Moderna co-founder and luminary in the field of drug development. When recently asked what scientific innovations, he is most excited about his answer was simple, but profound. The science and medicines that have not yet been discovered.  So, as we traverse challenging times, remember that the resilience of this industry is rooted in a truly vast opportunity for new discoveries that will improve the lives of everyone on this call today. The most impactful of which is yet to come.  With that, I will pass it to Peter. \nPeter Moglia: Thanks, Hallie. Before I launch into my commentary, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the great contributions we've received from Dean Shigenaga, Dean is one of the smartest and hardest working people I've come across in my 33 year career. He's played a huge part in the building of Alexandria and to what it is today, and wanting to thank him very much for everything he's done for this company. Thanks Dean.  On our fourth quarter 2022 call, I spoke about our optimism for the future of the life science industry referencing that we are in the early innings of the golden age of biology. And I pointed out that we've only had the blueprint of the human genome for 20 years. And in that time, we've developed more new modalities to attack disease than in the previous 100.  On Friday, October 13th, buried on the third page of Section A in the Wall Street Journal, another scientific revelation was reported. One that scientists liked into the human genome project and that could yield similar results in neuroscience. And the international team of scientists unveiled the most comprehensive map of the human brain ever completed.  A map that the article stated will set a critical foundation for the understanding and eventually treating brain-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's, epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism and depression. As I watched my own mother declined daily due to Alzheimer's and experienced the enormous emotional, monetary and time burden and inflicts on our family, I have a full appreciation of what this map being do for mankind.  It's yet another example of how important the life science industry is to improving our lives and how it's only going to grow and influence. And that ladies and gentlemen, is why this $5 trillion secular growth industry is poised to drive our business for decades to come.  I'm going to discuss our development pipeline, leasing supply and asset sales, and then hand it over to our very capable new CFO, Marc Binda. In the third quarter, we delivered 450,134 square feet and seven projects into our high barrier to entry submarkets, bringing total deliveries year-to-date to one million, two hundred ninety thousand seven hundred and twenty one square feet covering 10 projects.  Annual NOI for this quarter\u2019s deliveries totals $39 million bringing the year-to-date total incremental additions to NOI to $120 million. The initial weighted average stabilized yield is 6.5%. Six of the 10 projects delivering spaces here have initial stabilized yields ranging from 7% to 9.5%. Two are at 6.3% and two are in the mid fives. One of those developments in the mid fives is located in Cambridge and is 99% leased and the other is in our Shady Grove mega campus and successfully leased 23% of its space in the third quarter.  The Cambridge asset is in a prime location and its yield reflects the cost to acquire it, which was justified, because we had commitments to fill 100% of it before closing making it a build-to-suit core investment that expanded our ACKS mega campus. The Maryland asset\u2019s yield has been driven down by complex site conditions, but it has been very well received by the market and we are bullish on its long-term performance as part of our Shady Grove mega campus.  Development and redevelopment, leasing activity at approximately 205,000 square feet was higher quarter-over-quarter for the second quarter in a row, which we are pleased to see in an environment where tight financing markets have focused tenant demand on turnkey space.  In addition to the increase in development, redevelopment, leasing during the quarter, we signed LOI's covering nearly 230,000 square feet of space in our pipeline, including one for 185,000 square feet, with a high quality tenant - high quality credit tenant that may materially expand into the mega campus as they refine their programming indicating a continuation of positive momentum.  During the quarter, we executed a lease termination with a tenant at our 10935 and 10945 Alexandria Way mega campus development in Torrey Pines, and leased approximately 89% of the space to a stronger credit tenant. This is a win for Alexandria as we were able to substitute a higher credit tenant into the new development, increase the term for that space by three years and receive higher rents.  We did increased the TI allowance for the new tenant, but the incremental rent we are receiving yields at 14% return over that incremental TI allowance, all in all a great outcome. At quarter end, our pipeline of current and near-term projects is 63% leased and 66% leased in negotiating which includes executed LOIs and is expected to generate $580 million of annual incremental NOI through the end or through the third quarter of 2026.  The decline from 70% lease last quarter despite leasing approximately 205,000 square feet was mainly due to the, to the delivery of fully leased projects at 141st Street and 751 Gateway and the addition of 10075 Barnes Canyon Road in Sorrento Mesa, which has 17% of its future space underwhelm LOI and significant additional activity underway.  Transitioning to leasing and supply, Alexandria's pioneering establishment of highly curated mega campuses featuring Class A, A plus facilities at main and main and the world's most desirable high buried entry life science clusters provides an enduring foundation for our existing asset base to perform in even the most challenging times.  We are executing and winning nearly every high quality leasing opportunity when we have available product, a testament to the daily operational excellence demanded and required by our mission-critical tenants. We leased 867,582 square feet and the third quarter of \u201823 with Maryland significantly supporting the leasing activity led by San Diego and Greater Boston.  Leasing activity has come from a broad base of our regions, both this quarter and year-to-date in which we have leased a total of 3.41 million square feet with Seattle San Francisco, San Diego, Greater Boston, and Maryland all materially contributing to our overall leasing activity. These quarterly and year-to-date leasing volumes are consistent with our pre-COVID levels.  As you can see in the company highlights section of the Q3 supplemental on pages little Roman numeral, 19 and 20. Although below our historic average of a million square feet, this leasing volume is strong considering the amount of expiring leases available for lease for the rest of the year is relatively low at approximately 623,000 square feet.  Very strong cash rent increases of 19.7% and GAAP rent increases of 28.8% during the third quarter, provide clear evidence of the long-term enduring value of Alexandria\u2019s brand and platform and are consistent with our year-to-date stats of 18.1% and 33.9% for cash and GAAP increases respectively.  We'd like to call your attention to the year-to-date weighted average lease term of 11 years, which you can find on page little Roman numeral 22 of the supplemental that significantly exceeds our weighted average lease earned since 2014 of 8.7 years. In our first quarter earnings call, we noted that demand has slowed from the rocket shift COVID period of 2020 and 2021.  And last quarter, we reported that we were seeing demand increase especially in our Greater Boston, San Francisco and San Diego markets. We see demand holding steady today and believe it will trend upward, but are fully aware that the volatile geopolitical environment we are in can create the uncertainty that sometimes slows decision making.  As we've discussed in a number of investor meetings since our last earnings call, the demand profile is best described as a barbell. We're seeing most of the requirements in the 5,000 to 30,000 square foot range coming from either emerging stage companies that have achieved milestones and need growth space or large requirements of a hundred thousand square feet or more from large pharma and biotech looking to grow or establish a footprint in our clusters, driven by specific new modalities prevalent in those clusters coupled with the talent available on those locations.  Alexandria is well positioned to capture this demand because many of these opportunities are coming from existing relationships, which typically account for a significant amount of our leasing. Over the past year 80% of our leasing has been generated from existing tenants. In addition, our mega campus offerings provide the ability to scale in a wide variety of amenities making them the clear choice for high quality companies. I am sure you are all interested to hear analysis of supply, so I\u2019ll conclude this section with an update on these statistics, which will include our projected competitive supply additions delivering in 2025.  As a reminder, we perform a robust building-by-building analysis to identify and track new supply from high quality projects we believe are competitive to ours in our high barrier to entry submarkets. We focus primarily on high barrier to entry markets and our brand mega campus offerings in triple A locations and operational excellence enables us to continually mine our vast deep and loyal tenant base to drive our leasing activity, which will likely lessen the impacts of generic supply.  The slides we provided on pages Roman numeral 8 through Roman numeral 13 of the supplemental illustrate this and are hopefully helpful.  In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 1.1% of market inventory, a 0.5%, decrease over last quarter. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 6.1%, a 1.1% increase driven by the addition of a new competitive project. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 3.7% an expected slowdown from 2024 levels.  In San Francisco Bay, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in the second quarter of \u201823 is estimated to be 5% of market inventory, which is a reduction of 1.6% over last quarter due mainly from deliveries. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 8%, a 0.8% reduction unfortunately not driven by leasing, but due to a downward revision of estimated square footage to be delivered during the year.  In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by only 1.2%, which is a good indication that developers in this market are beginning to act rationally. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in the third quarter of \u201823 is estimated to be 1.9% of market inventory, which is a decrease of 1.6% due mainly to projects being delayed into 2024 or delivered with unleased space now reflected in direct vacancy and one project developer deciding not to pursue a laboratory use.  In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 6.9%, a 1.9% increase driven primarily by the aforementioned projects delivering in 2024 instead of 2023. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 3.3%, driven primarily by our 75% pre-leased 10935, 10945 and 10955, Alexandria Way project.  Direct and sublease market vacancy for our core submarkets is updated as follows: Greater Boston, direct vacancy increased 1.7% to 4.5% and subleased vacancy increased slightly to 5.6% for a net increase in available space in operation quarter-over-quarter of 1.9%.  San Francisco, direct vacancy increased by 7.4% to 9.7% driven mainly by the inclusion of the Mission Rock projects into laboratory inventory when it was previously thought to be leasing as an office project. Move outs and delivery of new inventory are also drivers. Sub lease vacancy remains stable at 6.2% for a net increase in available space in operation of 7.4%.  San Diego direct vacancy increased from 4.8% to 6.8%, largely due to delivered unleased new supply and move outs. And sublease vacancy remains stable at 4.1% for a net increase in available space in operation of 2% quarter-over-quarter.  I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. We continue to be fortunate that there is a considerable demand for Alexandria's assets and life science assets broadly. As you can see on page 7 of the supplemental, we are approximately 95% through completing dispositions needed to hit the midpoint of our guidance, when totaling completed sales and those under LOI or executed purchased and sale agreements not yet closed.  Our overall strategy for the full year of 2023 has been to execute on a combination of partial interest sales and sales in whole of non-core workhorse assets. These sales will provide the capital needed to recycle our high quality development redevelopment mega campus pipeline which will widen our moat by expanding our highly differentiated mega campuses offering unmatched scale and amenities highly sought after by the full spectrum of tenants we serve. And the identified supply I just mentioned can't compete with.  We only closed on one asset this quarter we can report on, but to give some color on dispositions that are pending, they are all non-core, solid workhorse assets. Obviously, it's a challenging interest rate environment and economic volatility has reduced overall transactional activity, but demand for our assets has remains resilient. As mentioned, we are on track to meet our goals.  In September, we closed on the previously announced sale of a vertical ownership unit comprising approximately 268,000 rental square feet or approximately 44% of Alexandria's 660,000, 34 square foot 421, part drive purpose built ground ups life science development in the Fenway submarket of Greater Boston to Boston Children's Hospital.  The units sold will house Boston, Children's Hospital future medical research facilities. The sale serves the dual purpose of providing substantial funding for the significant development project and brings in a key bedrock anchor to the project and our Fenway campus in whole. Austin Children's is a long-term strategic partner of Alexandria who invests heavily in basic clinical and translational research to accelerate the discovery of new treatments for devastating diseases to improve the health of both children and adults.  They ranked number one in NIH funding among all US children's hospitals in fiscal year 2023. Their presence will help attract tenant companies looking to collaborate with world-class research institutions much like our campuses in Cambridge benefit from those looking to collaborate with MIT. Alexandria will receive development fees as well as the significant capital to the fund the project.  With that long update, I'm going to go ahead and pass it over to Marc. \nMarc Binda : Thank you, Peter. Hello and good afternoon. This is Marc Binda, CFO and I'm going to cover some of the key financial metrics for the quarter. We reported very solid operating and financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended 3Q \u201923, which was driven by strong core results and reflects the strength of our brand, scale, high quality and well-located campuses and operational excellence.  Total revenues for 3Q were up 8.2% over the prior year. NOI was also up 8.2% over the prior quarter and the prior year driven primarily by the commencement of a $120 million of annual NOI related to 1.3 million rentable square feet of development, redevelopment projects, placed into service year-to-date through 3Q \u201823 coupled with strong same-property performance.  FFO per shared diluted as adjusted was $2.26, up 6.1% over 3Q \u201822 and we are on track to generate another solid year of growth in FFO per share of 6.7% at the midpoint of our guidance for 2023. Our tenants continue to appreciate our brand, the mega a campus strategy and operational excellence by our team. 49% of our ARR is from investment-grade and publicly traded large cap tenants and we have one of the highest quality client rosters in the REIT industry.  Collections remain very high at 99.9%, adjusted EBITDA margins remain very strong at 69%. The weighted average lease terms for leases completed in 2023 has far outpaced our historical averages at 11 years on average. And 96% of our leases contain annual rent escalations approximating 3%. Same-property NOI growth was solid and in line with guidance for 2023. 3Q \u201823 was up 3.1% and 4.6% on a cash basis and for the year-to-date period up 3.7% and 5.6% on a cash basis.  Our outlook for 2023 same-property NOI growth remained solid at a midpoint of 3% and 5% on a cash basis. We do expect our fourth quarter same-property results to be somewhat impacted by the timing of free rents and some temporary vacancy, including a hundred thousand square foot lease termination in the fourth quarter, by our tenant Atreka at our, San Carlos mega campus.  Important to note that we don't expect any income to be recognized on this space for same-property purposes in the fourth quarter, since termination fees are excluded from our same-property results. The good news is that we have a signed LOI with a new tenant to potentially take that space as early as December.  Turning to leasing, quarterly leasing volume was 867,000 square feet for the quarter and $3.4 million for the first nine months, which on an annualized basis is in line with our historical annual average from 2013 to 2020. Also after stripping out spaces already leased and projects going into redevelopment, the 2023 expirations at the beginning of the quarter were relatively low at only 623,000 square feet. 3Q \u201823 rental rate growth for lease renewals and re-leasing of space was very strong at 28.8% and 19.7% on a cash basis.  Rental rate growth in 3Q was driven by transactions in Seattle Maryland and Greater Boston, and these results were driven by a mix of transactions in markets which can vary from quarter to quarter. Our outlook for rental rate growth on leased renewals and re-leasing space remains solid at a midpoint of 30.5% and 14.5% on a cash basis.  The overall mark-to-market for cash run rates related to in place leases for the entire asset base remains very strong at up 18%.  Turning next to capital expenditures, they generally fall into two buckets. The first category being focused on development and redevelopment, which includes the first time conversion of non-lab space to lab space through redevelopment. The second category is non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures. Our non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures over the last 5 years have averaged 15% of NOI and that rate has been trending lower with 13% last year, and 12% for 2023.  Tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions related to lease renewals and releasing of space, which is included in non-revenue enhancing expenditures were very low for the quarter at $19 per square foot.  Turning to occupancy, 3Q occupancy was in line with our expectation at 93.7%, up 10 basis points from the prior quarter. This included vacancy of 2.1% or approximately 870,000 square feet from properties acquired in 2021 and \u201822. 30% of that recently acquired vacancy is leased and will be ready for occupancy in the next number of quarters.  Our outlook for 2023 reflects occupancy growth by the end of 4Q \u201923. The midpoint of our occupancy guidance is 95.1%, which implies 140, basis point increase by the end of the year. The bridge to our range for yearend occupancy breaks down as follows: About 50% is related to spaces already leased and expected to deliver by year end.  Another 20% relates to assets that were designated as held for sale in October that contains some vacancy. This leaves about 30% left to resolve, which includes the 100,000 square feet space at our San Carlos mega campus which I mentioned earlier, which is under negotiation.  I'd also like to highlight that it's often difficult to reconcile leasing activity to changes in occupancy, given that leasing activity doesn't always result in immediate occupancy. The main driver of the expected ramp up in occupancy related to previously leased space delivering in 4Q 2023 I just mentioned is a perfect example.  Turning to the balance sheet, we have a very strong balance sheet with $5.9 billion of liquidity, no debt maturities until 2025, 99% of our debt is subject to fixed interest rates and we remain on track to achieve our net debt to adjusted EBITDA goal of 5.1 times on a quarterly annualized basis by 4Q \u201923. We continue to focus on our self-funding strategy through the execution dispositions and partial interest sales with no common equity expected for 2023 other than the $100 million of forward equity sales agreements from 2022, which are still outstanding. Our strategy for dispositions and sales of partial interest for 2023 reflects our focus on the enhancement of the overall asset base through it outright disposition to properties no longer integral to our mega campus strategy with fewer sales of partial interests.  For the year, we expect about 90% of the proceeds from our program to be focused on outright dispositions. Our team has made excellent progress with $875 million completed and another $699 million under LOI or purchase and sale contract, which are expected to be closed in the fourth quarter, which is primarily comprised of outright dispositions.  Our targeted fourth quarter dispositions include land, non-core assets and some properties which require significant capital to lease and are expected to have a higher FFO cap rate, compared to the transactions we closed in the first half of the year. We have a low and conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for 3Q \u201823 annualized with a 5.2% increase in common stock dividends over the last 12 months.  We're projecting $375 million in net cash flows from operating activities after dividends for reinvestment, for this year, which represents a three-year run rate of over $1.1 billion.  Turning to venture gains, realized gains from venture investments included in FFO for 3Q \u201823 was $25 million, which is the same as our eight prior quarter average. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of 3Q \u201823 were $311 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. On external growth, we have $580 million of the incremental annual NOI coming online from our pipeline of $6.4 million square feet.  In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver two key projects at 325 Binney and 15 Necco, which will generate a whopping $114 million of incremental annual NOI. We expect to place these projects into service in mid to late November on average, which will drive significant NOI growth in the fourth quarter, as well as the first quarter of 2024.  For 2024, we expect another $1.8 million square feet, which is 94% leased to stabilize around mid to late summer on average and generate another $127 million of incremental annual NOI. Additionally, we have another 3.8 million square feet that's expected to reach stabilization after 2024 and will generate another $339 million of incremental annual NOI.  With the expected significant deliveries at 325 Binney and 15 Necco in 4Q \u201823, we expect a slight decline in capitalized interest in 4Q 2023. Capitalized interest for 3Q, was up about $4 million over the prior quarter, which resulted from some shifts in timing on the delivery of our 140 First Street redevelopment project and the sale of a portion of our 421 Park project.  It's important to note that these changes were slightly dilutive to FFO per share results for the quarter, but were offset by strong core operations during the quarter.  Turning to guidance, our detailed updated underlying guidance assumptions are disclosed beginning on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Our per share outlook for 2023 was updated to a range of plus or minus $0.01 from the midpoint of guidance. Our range of guidance for EPS is a $1.36 to $1.38 and our range for FFO per shared diluted as adjusted is 897 to 899 which represents a $0.02 increase in the midpoint of 898. This represents a very strong 6.7% growth in FFO per share following excellent growth last year of 8.5%. As a reminder, we're about a month away from the issuance of our detailed guidance for 2024 and therefore, we're unable to comment on details for \u201824.  Lastly, just want to extend this special thank you to Dean Shigenaga for all his years of leadership and service to the company, as well as his tremendous mentorship.  Next I\u2019ll turn it over to Joel to open it up for questions. \nJoel Marcus : Yeah, let's go to Q&A. And sorry for the long presentation but important to get all the facts out there. \nOperator: All right. Thank you. [Operator Instructions]  Our first question today will come from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey guys, I appreciate all the color in the new slides on the supply dynamic across your submarkets. Just kind of curious how we should think about that supply that's coming online and the vacancy you mentioned and just how that will impact market rents and GI's across maybe as in particular, Cambridge in South San Francisco? \nJoel Marcus: Yeah. So, Peter thoughts comments? \nPeter Moglia: Yeah, certainly, it's going to be part of the negotiation with tenants. What we believe is that our mega campus platform and our reliability and brand will - gives confidence to tenants that they're going to be well taken care of. And so there is a premium to that that will help us overcome the competitive supply dynamic when it comes to that. \nJoel Marcus: Yeah, I would say also important to distinguish, we think in Cambridge the impact would be far less than South San Francisco. South San Francisco as you can see from the slide just adds too much stupid supply. The good news is a lot of that supply is in an area that people don't want to be in. \nJoshua Dennerlein: Then one more question from me on the occupancy front going from your 3Q 93.7 to just the occupancy guide range of I think 94.6 to 95.6 just, what are the kind of moving pieces in there? Is there anything you still have to accomplish? Or is that kind of all baked in at this point? \nJoel Marcus: Okay. I think Marc, just answered that question. But Marc, do you want to repeat that? \nMarc Binda: Yes, sure. Hi, it's Marc. Yeah, so about - going from that 140 basis point increase, about half of it was from leases that we leased either in the current quarter or prior quarters that\u2019s delivering next quarter. So a big chunk of it's in the bag. And then about another 20% was for some assets that were designated as held for sale after the end of the quarter, in October that we expect to sell.  And then that that leaves about 30% and then of that, a big chunk of it relates to that space in San Carlos. It was the former - space which we do have a signed LOI there and hope to execute on. \nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Thanks, sorry for missing that. Appreciate that. \nJoel Marcus: Yeah, no problem. Our pleasure. \nOperator: Our next question, we'll come from Georgi Dinkov of Mizuho. Please go ahead. \nGeorgi Dinkov: Hi, this is Georgi on for Vikram. Can you square your views on not losing more occupancy than the GFC given you have seen several tenant pay issues and lease terminations in the past two quarters. And even though you have limited expirations, good credit issues, depressed occupancy? \nJoel Marcus: Well, I think number one, Marc just went through the details of occupancy and guidance in giving and he just answered the question from the analyst on what we're thinking about occupancy. And we said, for example, on a - we have a signed LOI and negotiating a lease for all that space. I'm not sure what else you referring to. \nGeorgi Dinkov: Okay. And can you just give, I guess more color on 270 Bio? I believe they're backed by Bluebird, but how would it would work if their cash position deteriorates going forward? \nJoel Marcus: Well, at the moment they have over $300 million in cash. It gives them a runway out through 2026 as I recall. You have to remember both 270 Bio and Bluebird or both joint and severely liable on the lease. We expect that's a great location. It'll be subleased. And we don't see any challenge to yards successful collection or rent over the coming few years. \nGeorgi Dinkov: Right. Thank you. \nJoel Marcus: Yes. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Griffin of Citi. Please go ahead. \nMichael Griffin: Great. Thanks. Maybe just a question on development starts. Kind of how you're thinking about that over the next couple years the funding needs for potential impact on capitalized interest will be helpful. \nJoel Marcus: Yeah, so I think as Marc said, let's wait for Investor Day to do that. \nMichael Griffin: All right. And then just on the pending asset sales I know Marc kind of talked about in a higher cap rates than expected. I was wondering if there's any numbers if you could maybe associate with that? And any color you can give around the buyer pool, their interest there would be helpful. \nJoel Marcus: Yeah we're under confidentiality. So we can't. So stay tuned for Investor Day or year-round and we will give you know as much detail as we're able to. \nMichael Griffin: All right. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Rich Anderson of Wedbush. Please go ahead. \nRich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So I was kind of doing some back reading and I looked at the second quarter of 2022 where it was the comment was beyond 2024 and beyond, we don't see large disruptive projects well underway in our core markets that are preparing to go vertical. Does that comment, I mean, I guess the question is, what change between that comment little bit more than a year ago and today because the market for developing only has gotten worse with that macro environment and all that? Or do you still - would you still agree that this is not disruptive relative to that comment that was made about a year and change ago? \nJoel Marcus: Yep. Peter do you want to maybe address that? \nPeter Moglia : Yeah. Rich, I mean, the comment, the intent of the comment was to express that 2024 was going to be a peak of supply deliveries and that the numbers that I just went through I think illustrated that. There will be some, some things that we thought would deliver in \u201824 that might get pushed into \u201825. But we're not seeing more than less and probably in total in all of our markets like a handful of things that have started in recent times meaning like the last few months.  It does appear and the numbers themselves in San Francisco I think were really telling it does appear that developers are finally understanding that the market has plenty of supply underway. And not - there's not more needed on a speculative basis. And so that's good news for the coming years. \nRich Anderson: Okay. Fair enough. And then, real quick second question and then we're running along here. Joel, you said the word self-funding for this year and for 2024 and anticipating your response wait till Investor Day, but let me just ask anyway, is the disposition program kind of not infinite, but I mean, if you're always selling assets and funding something that's probably a better and newer asset to your development pipeline, is that something that can go on in perpetuity or is there a ceiling to which you have to sort of cut off the disposition program and reassess? \nJoel Marcus: Yeah. I think that's a really good question and that'll be a cornerstone of the Investor Day presentation. But I think it's fair to say Rich that the way to think about it is we continue to have, the company owns and operates 40 million square feet and has the capability to double our size and what we own beyond that. So there's a pretty deep pool for partial interest and sales of outright non-core assets, but we do have an approach to self-funding for next year in addition to that, which I think will be pretty, pretty exciting. So let us wait to announce that that at Investor Day. \nRich Anderson: You got it. Thanks very much, everyone. \nJoel Marcus: Yep. Thank you guys. \nOperator: And our next question today will come from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Please go ahead. \nTom Catherwood: Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Maybe Joel or Peter, we always think of your team doing such a great job partnering with tenants understanding their business, helping them solve real estate problems, Peter I think the examples you talked about in San Diego with the developments really speak to that this quarter.  When we think of that partnership, how have you seen the needs and maybe the pain points of your tenants changed over the past six to 12 months? \nJoel Marcus: Well, I think that the obvious one is one that a number of people mentioned throughout the commentary. And that is certainly in the small and medium size companies that are emerging that are dependent upon whether it be private financing or public market financing or cash on hand. The fact that we're in this de facto recession, inflation and high interest rate environment just makes the management of cash, the management of burn, the management of decisions, just more methodical.  And yeah, maybe just more methodical. So our job is to understand those needs and work intimately with the clients to make sure that we're doing the best job that we can to meet their needs. And I think we've done a great job of that. And we have very, very close relationships. These are not ones they sign a lease and that's it. These are ongoing very deep relationships.  So we're generally pretty intimately involved in a lot of the decision making. \nPeter Moglia : And, remember, I mean, this isn't the first time we've hit hard times as a company. We've been around for, close to 30 years. And we've worked with our tenant base during all of these times. And the goodwill that accumulates and how we're able to help them is why 80% of our leasing comes from these existing tenants.  I mean, we have the ability - we have the size, the ability to work with folks that need assistance and it provides great goodwill for future endeavors for those of the - those management teams that are in the buildings that we're helping them out with. \nTom Catherwood: Got it. Thank you. Thank you for those answers. And then, kind of following up on that, maybe if I switchover to Hallie, Hallie I appreciate - Hallie I apologize. Appreciate the detailed market update. I was kind of really interested in the comment you made around AI adoption potentially leading to the need for incremental lab space. And that you were potentially seeing the early signs of that. Can you provide more kind of color on that comment? And maybe what you're seeing in the market in that regard? \nHallie Kuhn : Sure. Happy to. A great example and we had a quote from the CEO, Roger Perlmutter the former CSO of Merck in our press release is icons, which we have a signed lease with a property under development in San Francisco. With AI you have to have data to train the models. And so, when folks kind of \u2013 there has been commentary thrown out that oh! AI is going to and, make it so that you don't have to run experiments as extensively in labs.  What we see is actually the opposite, because you need such vast datasets to train the AI ML models in order to optimize and drive towards results that we see really large footprints whether it's robotic, high throughput, both chemical, and biological data these companies are generating in order to be able to actually apply AI and ML.  It would be like applying generative AI to the internet in 1995, right? You have to have a really vast starting dataset in order to get something that's meaningful on the back end. So we're continuing to see that evolve I think across all of our clusters. There's some really interesting ways that companies are integrating this tool into their toolkit for developing new medicines and that the end results 10, 20 years from now it's hopefully a lot more medicines for patients and additional lab space demand. \nTom Catherwood: Appreciate the color. Thanks everyone. \nJoel Marcus: Yep. Thanks, Tom. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Connor Siversky of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nConnor Siversky: Good afternoon. Thanks for having me on the call. I got a question on 2025 deliveries. So correct me if I'm wrong here, but the pre-leasing rate of the 2025 delivery should have a significant impact on how we're looking at capitalized interests in this context. So, assuming the pre-lease rate remains stable as it was reported in the supplemental release last night, can you give us an idea of how this would impact the interest expense on the P&L? \nJoel Marcus: So Marc you might want to comment on that, but that's kind of used in isolation because that's just one piece of the business. But Marc, go ahead and comment. \nMarc Binda: Yeah. Hi Connor. So, yeah, so capitalized interest is really determined based upon the size and magnitude of the assets under construction activities or under broadly all types of activities to get that asset ready for its intended use. So, to the extent that deliveries outpace construction spending and assets that are going through, either redevelopment or development, then capitalized interest would go down and the opposite is true if construction costs exceed the pace of deliveries.  What I'd say on 2025, if you're looking at the leasing percentages is, we've got some time on some of those and we've seen that that pre-leasing percentage pick up. Definitely, if those assets, we get to \u201825 and those assets seize activities and yeah, then capitalized interest would turn off. But we're, we got a long headway there. We got a long time and we've done - we've definitely done studies to look at the timing of pre-leasing and we're not quite in that sweet spot for some of these assets that are out in \u201825 and beyond in terms of when tenants are ready to make decisions. So, I guess, stay tuned. \nConnor Siversky: I appreciate the color. Is there any way, I mean, let's just say we took the most simplistic form of the deliveries in that context, what a kind of breakeven pre-leased rate would look like as those projects come online? \nMarc Binda: I'm not sure I understand your question, Connor. \nConnor Siversky: Well, I mean, we can we can take it offline. What I mean to say is if we if we use the schedule of deliveries and when those projects are supposed to roll online is what would be the breakeven rate between say the NOI contribution and the interest expense, that would be absorbed on the P&L as those projects roll online and they are moved from capitalized to the P&L on the interest expense? \nMarc Binda: Yeah. I guess the way to look at that, Connor is this, if you're looking at projects that has say just to make the math easy 7% yield and capitalization is in the high 3% range that that would, that would kind of tell you that, if half the building turned got delivered and half the building got turned off, you'd be neutral, but that's really, it's really not typically the case.  I mean, that the pre-leasing on all the, all the assets that we have for \u201823 and \u201824 is extremely high. So, we'll have to wait and see, but like I said before, we've seen the pre-leasing on \u201825 pickup as we get closer and closer to delivery, which is, which is pretty typical for tenants that of smaller size that make decisions much closer to the point at which they can see the building coming out of the ground and can visualize it. \nConnor Siversky: Got it. Understood. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question will come from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Lot my questions have been asked. But I guess Joel, I'm just curious given the challenging funding market for maybe many of your private competitors. I'm just wondering to what extent are you gaining any kind of market share to the extent that you can do fit outs and build outs of smaller lab space and to what extent have your peers maybe not been able to do that? And is that maybe delaying some of the new supply coming to market? \nJoel Marcus: Well. Yeah, hey Steve. So I think the way to think about that is other landlords who may have laboratory assets. If they're in - if you're in Cambridge or you're in other key markets that are directly competitive of ours, it always depends on their financial capability and also the needs of the tenant. I mean, it's really hard to say.  I think at the moment we feel very good about our positioning because if you're a tenant and you need especially now just in time space and you need a path for future growth, you hit a valuation milestone, value inflection milestone, which is very typical today. A one-off building, no matter whether it's fitted out or not fitted out, doesn't really offer you that opportunity.  You need a campus. You need a campus and generally you want one run by Alexandria because you want the best operator because a one-off building may get you some space, but oftentimes there's no path to future growth or expansion. And so that that's how we kind of see things. So we think we have an enormous competitive advantage and moat against one-off buildings by whether they be landlords who know what they're doing or landlords, who have no idea of what they're doing. \nPeter Moglia : Hey, to dive a little - this is Peter. To dive a little bit deeper into that. You'll notice the big increase in vacancy in San Francisco of buildings essentially that delivered and they delivered in shell condition. I took a deep dive with the team as like guys, what does this product look like? And a lot of it is just our buildings that are basically waiting to see whether they should be office or lab.  They were built with an ability to be lab and so we're counting them in our supply numbers, but they could very well go office because nobody is super committed. But you're also right in that those developers are not able to go ahead and just build out TI's because their financing isn't there for that. But I wanted to bring attention to that because you reminded me of it, you're seeing vacancy numbers, you're seeing supply numbers.  A lot of these projects are agnostic about whether or not they're going to be office or lab especially in the larger markets. But we are counting on them on our competitive supply because they could be. But they may very well not be and they very well may fail if they don't have financing to provide TI's. \nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks, guys. That's it for me. \nJoel Marcus: Okay. Thanks, Peter. \nOperator: The next question will come from Dylan Burzinski of Green Street. Please go ahead. \nDylan Burzinski: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question this afternoon. Just curious, I know you guys touched a little bit on the development pipeline, but just wondering if there's any sort of interesting opportunities that are you guys are witnessing or seeing on the acquisitions front? And if not today, do you expect to sort of see any interesting opportunities come refreshing over the next, call it 12 to 18 months? \nJoel Marcus: Yeah. So, first of all I think you noted we had a slow quarter. I don't think any quarter is slow. So you might rethink about that commentary. Second, yes, just remember the quote that I gave regarding Warren Buffett. So we think there may be some opportunities, but we certainly won't comment on them. \nDylan Burzinski: Thanks. That's all I had. \nOperator: And our final questions today will come from Aditi Balachandran of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nAditi Balachandran: Hi all. Just a quick one for me. I know how you mentioned that M&A is an overall positive. So do you have an idea of how much incremental demand it could possibly drive? And I guess, how much of that would be for pure lab space versus the product or drug manufacturing space? \nJoel Marcus: Well, most of it. Hallie can comment. We see as a big, big opportunity as, if you look at these schedules of drugs coming off patent for the balance of the decade, it\u2019s pretty large and virtually the only way to fill pipeline in that shorter time is to acquire technologies and pipelines that are available. And so we see it as a big opportunity, number one. And by and large most of that is R&D related. We're not so focused.  Sometimes you have the new modalities that are you've got intimate manufacturing with the new modalities as part of the R&D Center, but kind of classic manufacturing. We don't really deal with that. And we don't see that as an opportunity for us. But Hallie, I don't know if you have any other comments. \nHallie Kuhn: Yeah, with M&A as I mentioned, you really have to look at it as a on a case-by-case basis for specific M&A, I think that the better way to look at it is holistically and as Joel mentioned, M&A and licensing is a huge component of large pharma strategy for the next decade and that will likely continue beyond that. They're looking to recoup something on the order of over $130 billion in revenue, that'll be lost due to patent expirations.  And so when you look at that acquisition activity on a whole, the net positive is certainly going to lead to additional R&D needs and is also a benefit from the perspective of upgrades and credits. Given that when an acquirer comes in and buys a smaller company, we get the upgrade on the credit from the in place lease. \nAditi Balachandran: Great. That\u2019s really Helpful. Thank you. \nJoel Marcus: Yeah. Thank you. \nOperator: And we did have an additional question coming from Wes Golladay of Baird. Please go ahead. \nWes Golladay: Hey everyone. Thanks for sticking around for the final question. I just had a quick question on the development pipeline, just like the \u201823 and the \u201824 pipeline that\u2019s well leased. Do you have any, I guess plans to change any more of those tenants out like you did this quarter? Or is it pretty much locked in at this point? \nJoel Marcus: Yeah, that's a kind of an unusual circumstance where we felt we had a robust client that needed space even a little more quickly than we anticipated. We had another client. We saw that maybe had taken on too much space. So it was actually an ideal mix and marriage of putting the two together. They come up from time to time. I'm not sure I'd read anything into that, but that's kind of normal, but that's how it happened. \nWes Golladay: Fantastic. And a quick follow-up. Are you seeing any - I guess pent-up demand to get into some of these mega campuses where they've been fully occupied for years and do you have a little bit of tenant churn? And do you have any situations where multiple tenants are going to the space? \nJoel Marcus: The answer to that is yes. And but that tends to be more like Cambridge-centric. Maybe our San Carlos campus, not quite a mega campus yet. It's about 600,000 feet, but to grow much larger. So, Alexandria Center for Life Science in York City is another example. So, yes, some places we see that there are multiple tenants we're having to kind of juggle. \nWes Golladay: Thanks for paying attention to. \nJoel Marcus: Yeah. \nOperator: This will conclude our question and answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Marcus for any closing remarks. \nJoel Marcus: Okay, thank you very much for taking time to listen. And god bless everybody. \nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thanks, Hallie. Before I launch into my commentary, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the great contributions we've received from Dean Shigenaga, Dean is one of the smartest and hardest working people I've come across in my 33 year career. He's played a huge part in the building of Alexandria and to what it is today, and wanting to thank him very much for everything he's done for this company. Thanks Dean.  On our fourth quarter 2022 call, I spoke about our optimism for the future of the life science industry referencing that we are in the early innings of the golden age of biology. And I pointed out that we've only had the blueprint of the human genome for 20 years. And in that time, we've developed more new modalities to attack disease than in the previous 100.  On Friday, October 13th, buried on the third page of Section A in the Wall Street Journal, another scientific revelation was reported. One that scientists liked into the human genome project and that could yield similar results in neuroscience. And the international team of scientists unveiled the most comprehensive map of the human brain ever completed.  A map that the article stated will set a critical foundation for the understanding and eventually treating brain-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's, epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism and depression. As I watched my own mother declined daily due to Alzheimer's and experienced the enormous emotional, monetary and time burden and inflicts on our family, I have a full appreciation of what this map being do for mankind.  It's yet another example of how important the life science industry is to improving our lives and how it's only going to grow and influence. And that ladies and gentlemen, is why this $5 trillion secular growth industry is poised to drive our business for decades to come.  I'm going to discuss our development pipeline, leasing supply and asset sales, and then hand it over to our very capable new CFO, Marc Binda. In the third quarter, we delivered 450,134 square feet and seven projects into our high barrier to entry submarkets, bringing total deliveries year-to-date to one million, two hundred ninety thousand seven hundred and twenty one square feet covering 10 projects.  Annual NOI for this quarter\u2019s deliveries totals $39 million bringing the year-to-date total incremental additions to NOI to $120 million. The initial weighted average stabilized yield is 6.5%. Six of the 10 projects delivering spaces here have initial stabilized yields ranging from 7% to 9.5%. Two are at 6.3% and two are in the mid fives. One of those developments in the mid fives is located in Cambridge and is 99% leased and the other is in our Shady Grove mega campus and successfully leased 23% of its space in the third quarter.  The Cambridge asset is in a prime location and its yield reflects the cost to acquire it, which was justified, because we had commitments to fill 100% of it before closing making it a build-to-suit core investment that expanded our ACKS mega campus. The Maryland asset\u2019s yield has been driven down by complex site conditions, but it has been very well received by the market and we are bullish on its long-term performance as part of our Shady Grove mega campus.  Development and redevelopment, leasing activity at approximately 205,000 square feet was higher quarter-over-quarter for the second quarter in a row, which we are pleased to see in an environment where tight financing markets have focused tenant demand on turnkey space.  In addition to the increase in development, redevelopment, leasing during the quarter, we signed LOI's covering nearly 230,000 square feet of space in our pipeline, including one for 185,000 square feet, with a high quality tenant - high quality credit tenant that may materially expand into the mega campus as they refine their programming indicating a continuation of positive momentum.  During the quarter, we executed a lease termination with a tenant at our 10935 and 10945 Alexandria Way mega campus development in Torrey Pines, and leased approximately 89% of the space to a stronger credit tenant. This is a win for Alexandria as we were able to substitute a higher credit tenant into the new development, increase the term for that space by three years and receive higher rents.  We did increased the TI allowance for the new tenant, but the incremental rent we are receiving yields at 14% return over that incremental TI allowance, all in all a great outcome. At quarter end, our pipeline of current and near-term projects is 63% leased and 66% leased in negotiating which includes executed LOIs and is expected to generate $580 million of annual incremental NOI through the end or through the third quarter of 2026.  The decline from 70% lease last quarter despite leasing approximately 205,000 square feet was mainly due to the, to the delivery of fully leased projects at 141st Street and 751 Gateway and the addition of 10075 Barnes Canyon Road in Sorrento Mesa, which has 17% of its future space underwhelm LOI and significant additional activity underway.  Transitioning to leasing and supply, Alexandria's pioneering establishment of highly curated mega campuses featuring Class A, A plus facilities at main and main and the world's most desirable high buried entry life science clusters provides an enduring foundation for our existing asset base to perform in even the most challenging times.  We are executing and winning nearly every high quality leasing opportunity when we have available product, a testament to the daily operational excellence demanded and required by our mission-critical tenants. We leased 867,582 square feet and the third quarter of \u201823 with Maryland significantly supporting the leasing activity led by San Diego and Greater Boston.  Leasing activity has come from a broad base of our regions, both this quarter and year-to-date in which we have leased a total of 3.41 million square feet with Seattle San Francisco, San Diego, Greater Boston, and Maryland all materially contributing to our overall leasing activity. These quarterly and year-to-date leasing volumes are consistent with our pre-COVID levels.  As you can see in the company highlights section of the Q3 supplemental on pages little Roman numeral, 19 and 20. Although below our historic average of a million square feet, this leasing volume is strong considering the amount of expiring leases available for lease for the rest of the year is relatively low at approximately 623,000 square feet.  Very strong cash rent increases of 19.7% and GAAP rent increases of 28.8% during the third quarter, provide clear evidence of the long-term enduring value of Alexandria\u2019s brand and platform and are consistent with our year-to-date stats of 18.1% and 33.9% for cash and GAAP increases respectively.  We'd like to call your attention to the year-to-date weighted average lease term of 11 years, which you can find on page little Roman numeral 22 of the supplemental that significantly exceeds our weighted average lease earned since 2014 of 8.7 years. In our first quarter earnings call, we noted that demand has slowed from the rocket shift COVID period of 2020 and 2021.  And last quarter, we reported that we were seeing demand increase especially in our Greater Boston, San Francisco and San Diego markets. We see demand holding steady today and believe it will trend upward, but are fully aware that the volatile geopolitical environment we are in can create the uncertainty that sometimes slows decision making.  As we've discussed in a number of investor meetings since our last earnings call, the demand profile is best described as a barbell. We're seeing most of the requirements in the 5,000 to 30,000 square foot range coming from either emerging stage companies that have achieved milestones and need growth space or large requirements of a hundred thousand square feet or more from large pharma and biotech looking to grow or establish a footprint in our clusters, driven by specific new modalities prevalent in those clusters coupled with the talent available on those locations.  Alexandria is well positioned to capture this demand because many of these opportunities are coming from existing relationships, which typically account for a significant amount of our leasing. Over the past year 80% of our leasing has been generated from existing tenants. In addition, our mega campus offerings provide the ability to scale in a wide variety of amenities making them the clear choice for high quality companies. I am sure you are all interested to hear analysis of supply, so I\u2019ll conclude this section with an update on these statistics, which will include our projected competitive supply additions delivering in 2025.  As a reminder, we perform a robust building-by-building analysis to identify and track new supply from high quality projects we believe are competitive to ours in our high barrier to entry submarkets. We focus primarily on high barrier to entry markets and our brand mega campus offerings in triple A locations and operational excellence enables us to continually mine our vast deep and loyal tenant base to drive our leasing activity, which will likely lessen the impacts of generic supply.  The slides we provided on pages Roman numeral 8 through Roman numeral 13 of the supplemental illustrate this and are hopefully helpful.  In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 1.1% of market inventory, a 0.5%, decrease over last quarter. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 6.1%, a 1.1% increase driven by the addition of a new competitive project. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 3.7% an expected slowdown from 2024 levels.  In San Francisco Bay, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in the second quarter of \u201823 is estimated to be 5% of market inventory, which is a reduction of 1.6% over last quarter due mainly from deliveries. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 8%, a 0.8% reduction unfortunately not driven by leasing, but due to a downward revision of estimated square footage to be delivered during the year.  In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by only 1.2%, which is a good indication that developers in this market are beginning to act rationally. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in the third quarter of \u201823 is estimated to be 1.9% of market inventory, which is a decrease of 1.6% due mainly to projects being delayed into 2024 or delivered with unleased space now reflected in direct vacancy and one project developer deciding not to pursue a laboratory use.  In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 6.9%, a 1.9% increase driven primarily by the aforementioned projects delivering in 2024 instead of 2023. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 3.3%, driven primarily by our 75% pre-leased 10935, 10945 and 10955, Alexandria Way project.  Direct and sublease market vacancy for our core submarkets is updated as follows: Greater Boston, direct vacancy increased 1.7% to 4.5% and subleased vacancy increased slightly to 5.6% for a net increase in available space in operation quarter-over-quarter of 1.9%.  San Francisco, direct vacancy increased by 7.4% to 9.7% driven mainly by the inclusion of the Mission Rock projects into laboratory inventory when it was previously thought to be leasing as an office project. Move outs and delivery of new inventory are also drivers. Sub lease vacancy remains stable at 6.2% for a net increase in available space in operation of 7.4%.  San Diego direct vacancy increased from 4.8% to 6.8%, largely due to delivered unleased new supply and move outs. And sublease vacancy remains stable at 4.1% for a net increase in available space in operation of 2% quarter-over-quarter.  I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. We continue to be fortunate that there is a considerable demand for Alexandria's assets and life science assets broadly. As you can see on page 7 of the supplemental, we are approximately 95% through completing dispositions needed to hit the midpoint of our guidance, when totaling completed sales and those under LOI or executed purchased and sale agreements not yet closed.  Our overall strategy for the full year of 2023 has been to execute on a combination of partial interest sales and sales in whole of non-core workhorse assets. These sales will provide the capital needed to recycle our high quality development redevelopment mega campus pipeline which will widen our moat by expanding our highly differentiated mega campuses offering unmatched scale and amenities highly sought after by the full spectrum of tenants we serve. And the identified supply I just mentioned can't compete with.  We only closed on one asset this quarter we can report on, but to give some color on dispositions that are pending, they are all non-core, solid workhorse assets. Obviously, it's a challenging interest rate environment and economic volatility has reduced overall transactional activity, but demand for our assets has remains resilient. As mentioned, we are on track to meet our goals.  In September, we closed on the previously announced sale of a vertical ownership unit comprising approximately 268,000 rental square feet or approximately 44% of Alexandria's 660,000, 34 square foot 421, part drive purpose built ground ups life science development in the Fenway submarket of Greater Boston to Boston Children's Hospital.  The units sold will house Boston, Children's Hospital future medical research facilities. The sale serves the dual purpose of providing substantial funding for the significant development project and brings in a key bedrock anchor to the project and our Fenway campus in whole. Austin Children's is a long-term strategic partner of Alexandria who invests heavily in basic clinical and translational research to accelerate the discovery of new treatments for devastating diseases to improve the health of both children and adults.  They ranked number one in NIH funding among all US children's hospitals in fiscal year 2023. Their presence will help attract tenant companies looking to collaborate with world-class research institutions much like our campuses in Cambridge benefit from those looking to collaborate with MIT. Alexandria will receive development fees as well as the significant capital to the fund the project.  With that long update, I'm going to go ahead and pass it over to Marc. Yeah, certainly, it's going to be part of the negotiation with tenants. What we believe is that our mega campus platform and our reliability and brand will - gives confidence to tenants that they're going to be well taken care of. And so there is a premium to that that will help us overcome the competitive supply dynamic when it comes to that. Yeah. Rich, I mean, the comment, the intent of the comment was to express that 2024 was going to be a peak of supply deliveries and that the numbers that I just went through I think illustrated that. There will be some, some things that we thought would deliver in \u201824 that might get pushed into \u201825. But we're not seeing more than less and probably in total in all of our markets like a handful of things that have started in recent times meaning like the last few months.  It does appear and the numbers themselves in San Francisco I think were really telling it does appear that developers are finally understanding that the market has plenty of supply underway. And not - there's not more needed on a speculative basis. And so that's good news for the coming years. And, remember, I mean, this isn't the first time we've hit hard times as a company. We've been around for, close to 30 years. And we've worked with our tenant base during all of these times. And the goodwill that accumulates and how we're able to help them is why 80% of our leasing comes from these existing tenants.  I mean, we have the ability - we have the size, the ability to work with folks that need assistance and it provides great goodwill for future endeavors for those of the - those management teams that are in the buildings that we're helping them out with. Hey, to dive a little - this is Peter. To dive a little bit deeper into that. You'll notice the big increase in vacancy in San Francisco of buildings essentially that delivered and they delivered in shell condition. I took a deep dive with the team as like guys, what does this product look like? And a lot of it is just our buildings that are basically waiting to see whether they should be office or lab.  They were built with an ability to be lab and so we're counting them in our supply numbers, but they could very well go office because nobody is super committed. But you're also right in that those developers are not able to go ahead and just build out TI's because their financing isn't there for that. But I wanted to bring attention to that because you reminded me of it, you're seeing vacancy numbers, you're seeing supply numbers.  A lot of these projects are agnostic about whether or not they're going to be office or lab especially in the larger markets. But we are counting on them on our competitive supply because they could be. But they may very well not be and they very well may fail if they don't have financing to provide TI's."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our third quarter conference call and the order of speaking today will be, I\u2019ll kick off, Hallie will follow, Peter will follow Hallie and then Marc will do clean up as most of you know, Dean Shigenaga stepped down as Chief Financial Officer on September 15th. He'll remain full-time employee and will be on our Q&A call. But Marc is going to, and Dean is mostly responsible for the quarter. But Marc will handle today's call on the presentation.  I want to start off with two quotes. First by one of the most legendary, by two legendary investors. First one is Warren Buffett who has said and many know, this quote, be fearful when others are greedy and opportunistic when others are fearful and so we are. And a quote from one of the most legendary institutional investors on Alexandria.  Alexandria is a life science industry leader solely publicly traded pure-play REIT at its current discounted valuation we believe concerns about competitive supply and distress for some of the company\u2019s life science tenants were overblown and sufficiently discounted in the company\u2019s valuation. We believe the management team has assembled a desirable real estate portfolio, enjoys a leading market share position in its geographic markets and has solid expectations for long-term demand-driven growth.  So I want to thank each and every member of the Alexandria family team for a strong and operationally outstanding third quarter for this one of a kind read, especially in a very challenging, and continuing disruptive macro environment. Our size, scale and the dominance we've chosen to undertake in our key submarkets coupled with our irreplaceable brand of importance to our over 1800 tenants represents a distinctive impact few other REITs will ever enjoy.  We continue to dominate those of our key submarkets where we have created a leading position and continue to maintain pricing power for a highly desirable mega campuses which enable life science entities to meet their mission-critical needs and also a path for future growth.  Couple of thoughts on the third quarter. We continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet, one of the best in the entire REIT industry. We continue our consistent strong and increasing dividend with a focus on retaining significant cash flows after dividend payment for reinvestment. We're well on track for a 7% FFO per share growth for 2023, fueled by our onboarding of substantial net operating income, the first half approximately $81 million, the third quarter approximately $39 million and the fourth quarter, approximately $114 million.  A few comments on FDA drug approvals, which is the holy grail of the life science industry and Hallie will have more to say. During the period, which was the bull biotech market 2015 to 2021, almost three quarters of approvals were biotech and 25% were pharma. So biotech continues to be the mainstay of innovation.  This year as Hallie will detail, 45 approvals to-date and it could surpass the all-time high of 59 in 2018. Hallie will address the health of the life science industry and the demand generators. But third quarter leasing of approximately 870,000 rentable square feet was very solid and especially with a weighted average lease term of an amazing 13 years and very strong, leasing spreads, almost 20% on the cash basis and almost 29% on a GAAP basis while leasing costs were decreasing.  Life science tenant health is one of the most frequently asked questions and again Hallie will address that in depth. We are in a de facto recession and in the self-inflicted inflationary and high interest rate environment. So that is driving caution, but the life science industry is unequivocally healthy thriving, and the key to improved healthcare outcomes which are desperately needed for all of us.  Internal growth remains steady and solid with same-store cash NOI growth for the year at a strong 5.6%, occupancy on course for about 95% plus as of yearend and Mark will have much more to say on internal growth. Peter will detail external growth and our strong efforts of onboarding the substantial net operating income as I just referred to, and he will also update as he does each quarter supply dynamics.  Peter will also give a brief update on the status of our self-funding for the balance of 2023 and the year as a whole.  Let me say in summary, we know this is a tough show me market filled with many skeptics. Many of those skeptics doubting the health of life science industry despite clear facts to the contrary over blowing the impact of the elevated levels of new construction, no matter the quality location and/or sponsor or operations and we know of numerous operating debacles causing substantial damage to tenants by so-called other operators to their science doubting the ability of Alexandria, the self-funded business, despite clear facts to the contrary.  Each and every reporting quarter, we intend to continue our world-class operational excellence with exceptionalism in all we do and we intend to capture virtually all of the future demand of our over 800 tenants and virtually all of the future demand of non-tenants who meet our underwriting requirements. And we intend to execute a perfect thread the needle self-funding plan for the remainder of 2023, as well, as 2024 as our assets continue to remain scarce and still in demand.  And then finally, before I turn it over to Hallie, I would say remembering that CREDO of the Navy Navy SEALs, the only easy day is yesterday. So Hallie take it away. Yeah, let's go to Q&A. And sorry for the long presentation but important to get all the facts out there. Yeah. So, Peter thoughts comments? Yeah, I would say also important to distinguish, we think in Cambridge the impact would be far less than South San Francisco. South San Francisco as you can see from the slide just adds too much stupid supply. The good news is a lot of that supply is in an area that people don't want to be in. Okay. I think Marc, just answered that question. But Marc, do you want to repeat that? Yeah, no problem. Our pleasure. Well, I think number one, Marc just went through the details of occupancy and guidance in giving and he just answered the question from the analyst on what we're thinking about occupancy. And we said, for example, on a - we have a signed LOI and negotiating a lease for all that space. I'm not sure what else you referring to. Well, at the moment they have over $300 million in cash. It gives them a runway out through 2026 as I recall. You have to remember both 270 Bio and Bluebird or both joint and severely liable on the lease. We expect that's a great location. It'll be subleased. And we don't see any challenge to yards successful collection or rent over the coming few years. Yes. Thank you. Yeah, so I think as Marc said, let's wait for Investor Day to do that. Yeah we're under confidentiality. So we can't. So stay tuned for Investor Day or year-round and we will give you know as much detail as we're able to. Yep. Peter do you want to maybe address that? Yeah. I think that's a really good question and that'll be a cornerstone of the Investor Day presentation. But I think it's fair to say Rich that the way to think about it is we continue to have, the company owns and operates 40 million square feet and has the capability to double our size and what we own beyond that. So there's a pretty deep pool for partial interest and sales of outright non-core assets, but we do have an approach to self-funding for next year in addition to that, which I think will be pretty, pretty exciting. So let us wait to announce that that at Investor Day. Yep. Thank you guys. Well, I think that the obvious one is one that a number of people mentioned throughout the commentary. And that is certainly in the small and medium size companies that are emerging that are dependent upon whether it be private financing or public market financing or cash on hand. The fact that we're in this de facto recession, inflation and high interest rate environment just makes the management of cash, the management of burn, the management of decisions, just more methodical.  And yeah, maybe just more methodical. So our job is to understand those needs and work intimately with the clients to make sure that we're doing the best job that we can to meet their needs. And I think we've done a great job of that. And we have very, very close relationships. These are not ones they sign a lease and that's it. These are ongoing very deep relationships.  So we're generally pretty intimately involved in a lot of the decision making. Yep. Thanks, Tom. So Marc you might want to comment on that, but that's kind of used in isolation because that's just one piece of the business. But Marc, go ahead and comment. Well. Yeah, hey Steve. So I think the way to think about that is other landlords who may have laboratory assets. If they're in - if you're in Cambridge or you're in other key markets that are directly competitive of ours, it always depends on their financial capability and also the needs of the tenant. I mean, it's really hard to say.  I think at the moment we feel very good about our positioning because if you're a tenant and you need especially now just in time space and you need a path for future growth, you hit a valuation milestone, value inflection milestone, which is very typical today. A one-off building, no matter whether it's fitted out or not fitted out, doesn't really offer you that opportunity.  You need a campus. You need a campus and generally you want one run by Alexandria because you want the best operator because a one-off building may get you some space, but oftentimes there's no path to future growth or expansion. And so that that's how we kind of see things. So we think we have an enormous competitive advantage and moat against one-off buildings by whether they be landlords who know what they're doing or landlords, who have no idea of what they're doing. Okay. Thanks, Peter. Yeah. So, first of all I think you noted we had a slow quarter. I don't think any quarter is slow. So you might rethink about that commentary. Second, yes, just remember the quote that I gave regarding Warren Buffett. So we think there may be some opportunities, but we certainly won't comment on them. Well, most of it. Hallie can comment. We see as a big, big opportunity as, if you look at these schedules of drugs coming off patent for the balance of the decade, it\u2019s pretty large and virtually the only way to fill pipeline in that shorter time is to acquire technologies and pipelines that are available. And so we see it as a big opportunity, number one. And by and large most of that is R&D related. We're not so focused.  Sometimes you have the new modalities that are you've got intimate manufacturing with the new modalities as part of the R&D Center, but kind of classic manufacturing. We don't really deal with that. And we don't see that as an opportunity for us. But Hallie, I don't know if you have any other comments. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, that's a kind of an unusual circumstance where we felt we had a robust client that needed space even a little more quickly than we anticipated. We had another client. We saw that maybe had taken on too much space. So it was actually an ideal mix and marriage of putting the two together. They come up from time to time. I'm not sure I'd read anything into that, but that's kind of normal, but that's how it happened. The answer to that is yes. And but that tends to be more like Cambridge-centric. Maybe our San Carlos campus, not quite a mega campus yet. It's about 600,000 feet, but to grow much larger. So, Alexandria Center for Life Science in York City is another example. So, yes, some places we see that there are multiple tenants we're having to kind of juggle. Yeah. Okay, thank you very much for taking time to listen. And god bless everybody."

            "name": "Marc Binda",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Hello and good afternoon. This is Marc Binda, CFO and I'm going to cover some of the key financial metrics for the quarter. We reported very solid operating and financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended 3Q \u201923, which was driven by strong core results and reflects the strength of our brand, scale, high quality and well-located campuses and operational excellence.  Total revenues for 3Q were up 8.2% over the prior year. NOI was also up 8.2% over the prior quarter and the prior year driven primarily by the commencement of a $120 million of annual NOI related to 1.3 million rentable square feet of development, redevelopment projects, placed into service year-to-date through 3Q \u201823 coupled with strong same-property performance.  FFO per shared diluted as adjusted was $2.26, up 6.1% over 3Q \u201822 and we are on track to generate another solid year of growth in FFO per share of 6.7% at the midpoint of our guidance for 2023. Our tenants continue to appreciate our brand, the mega a campus strategy and operational excellence by our team. 49% of our ARR is from investment-grade and publicly traded large cap tenants and we have one of the highest quality client rosters in the REIT industry.  Collections remain very high at 99.9%, adjusted EBITDA margins remain very strong at 69%. The weighted average lease terms for leases completed in 2023 has far outpaced our historical averages at 11 years on average. And 96% of our leases contain annual rent escalations approximating 3%. Same-property NOI growth was solid and in line with guidance for 2023. 3Q \u201823 was up 3.1% and 4.6% on a cash basis and for the year-to-date period up 3.7% and 5.6% on a cash basis.  Our outlook for 2023 same-property NOI growth remained solid at a midpoint of 3% and 5% on a cash basis. We do expect our fourth quarter same-property results to be somewhat impacted by the timing of free rents and some temporary vacancy, including a hundred thousand square foot lease termination in the fourth quarter, by our tenant Atreka at our, San Carlos mega campus.  Important to note that we don't expect any income to be recognized on this space for same-property purposes in the fourth quarter, since termination fees are excluded from our same-property results. The good news is that we have a signed LOI with a new tenant to potentially take that space as early as December.  Turning to leasing, quarterly leasing volume was 867,000 square feet for the quarter and $3.4 million for the first nine months, which on an annualized basis is in line with our historical annual average from 2013 to 2020. Also after stripping out spaces already leased and projects going into redevelopment, the 2023 expirations at the beginning of the quarter were relatively low at only 623,000 square feet. 3Q \u201823 rental rate growth for lease renewals and re-leasing of space was very strong at 28.8% and 19.7% on a cash basis.  Rental rate growth in 3Q was driven by transactions in Seattle Maryland and Greater Boston, and these results were driven by a mix of transactions in markets which can vary from quarter to quarter. Our outlook for rental rate growth on leased renewals and re-leasing space remains solid at a midpoint of 30.5% and 14.5% on a cash basis.  The overall mark-to-market for cash run rates related to in place leases for the entire asset base remains very strong at up 18%.  Turning next to capital expenditures, they generally fall into two buckets. The first category being focused on development and redevelopment, which includes the first time conversion of non-lab space to lab space through redevelopment. The second category is non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures. Our non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures over the last 5 years have averaged 15% of NOI and that rate has been trending lower with 13% last year, and 12% for 2023.  Tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions related to lease renewals and releasing of space, which is included in non-revenue enhancing expenditures were very low for the quarter at $19 per square foot.  Turning to occupancy, 3Q occupancy was in line with our expectation at 93.7%, up 10 basis points from the prior quarter. This included vacancy of 2.1% or approximately 870,000 square feet from properties acquired in 2021 and \u201822. 30% of that recently acquired vacancy is leased and will be ready for occupancy in the next number of quarters.  Our outlook for 2023 reflects occupancy growth by the end of 4Q \u201923. The midpoint of our occupancy guidance is 95.1%, which implies 140, basis point increase by the end of the year. The bridge to our range for yearend occupancy breaks down as follows: About 50% is related to spaces already leased and expected to deliver by year end.  Another 20% relates to assets that were designated as held for sale in October that contains some vacancy. This leaves about 30% left to resolve, which includes the 100,000 square feet space at our San Carlos mega campus which I mentioned earlier, which is under negotiation.  I'd also like to highlight that it's often difficult to reconcile leasing activity to changes in occupancy, given that leasing activity doesn't always result in immediate occupancy. The main driver of the expected ramp up in occupancy related to previously leased space delivering in 4Q 2023 I just mentioned is a perfect example.  Turning to the balance sheet, we have a very strong balance sheet with $5.9 billion of liquidity, no debt maturities until 2025, 99% of our debt is subject to fixed interest rates and we remain on track to achieve our net debt to adjusted EBITDA goal of 5.1 times on a quarterly annualized basis by 4Q \u201923. We continue to focus on our self-funding strategy through the execution dispositions and partial interest sales with no common equity expected for 2023 other than the $100 million of forward equity sales agreements from 2022, which are still outstanding. Our strategy for dispositions and sales of partial interest for 2023 reflects our focus on the enhancement of the overall asset base through it outright disposition to properties no longer integral to our mega campus strategy with fewer sales of partial interests.  For the year, we expect about 90% of the proceeds from our program to be focused on outright dispositions. Our team has made excellent progress with $875 million completed and another $699 million under LOI or purchase and sale contract, which are expected to be closed in the fourth quarter, which is primarily comprised of outright dispositions.  Our targeted fourth quarter dispositions include land, non-core assets and some properties which require significant capital to lease and are expected to have a higher FFO cap rate, compared to the transactions we closed in the first half of the year. We have a low and conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for 3Q \u201823 annualized with a 5.2% increase in common stock dividends over the last 12 months.  We're projecting $375 million in net cash flows from operating activities after dividends for reinvestment, for this year, which represents a three-year run rate of over $1.1 billion.  Turning to venture gains, realized gains from venture investments included in FFO for 3Q \u201823 was $25 million, which is the same as our eight prior quarter average. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of 3Q \u201823 were $311 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. On external growth, we have $580 million of the incremental annual NOI coming online from our pipeline of $6.4 million square feet.  In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver two key projects at 325 Binney and 15 Necco, which will generate a whopping $114 million of incremental annual NOI. We expect to place these projects into service in mid to late November on average, which will drive significant NOI growth in the fourth quarter, as well as the first quarter of 2024.  For 2024, we expect another $1.8 million square feet, which is 94% leased to stabilize around mid to late summer on average and generate another $127 million of incremental annual NOI. Additionally, we have another 3.8 million square feet that's expected to reach stabilization after 2024 and will generate another $339 million of incremental annual NOI.  With the expected significant deliveries at 325 Binney and 15 Necco in 4Q \u201823, we expect a slight decline in capitalized interest in 4Q 2023. Capitalized interest for 3Q, was up about $4 million over the prior quarter, which resulted from some shifts in timing on the delivery of our 140 First Street redevelopment project and the sale of a portion of our 421 Park project.  It's important to note that these changes were slightly dilutive to FFO per share results for the quarter, but were offset by strong core operations during the quarter.  Turning to guidance, our detailed updated underlying guidance assumptions are disclosed beginning on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Our per share outlook for 2023 was updated to a range of plus or minus $0.01 from the midpoint of guidance. Our range of guidance for EPS is a $1.36 to $1.38 and our range for FFO per shared diluted as adjusted is 897 to 899 which represents a $0.02 increase in the midpoint of 898. This represents a very strong 6.7% growth in FFO per share following excellent growth last year of 8.5%. As a reminder, we're about a month away from the issuance of our detailed guidance for 2024 and therefore, we're unable to comment on details for \u201824.  Lastly, just want to extend this special thank you to Dean Shigenaga for all his years of leadership and service to the company, as well as his tremendous mentorship.  Next I\u2019ll turn it over to Joel to open it up for questions. Yes, sure. Hi, it's Marc. Yeah, so about - going from that 140 basis point increase, about half of it was from leases that we leased either in the current quarter or prior quarters that\u2019s delivering next quarter. So a big chunk of it's in the bag. And then about another 20% was for some assets that were designated as held for sale after the end of the quarter, in October that we expect to sell.  And then that that leaves about 30% and then of that, a big chunk of it relates to that space in San Carlos. It was the former - space which we do have a signed LOI there and hope to execute on. Yeah. Hi Connor. So, yeah, so capitalized interest is really determined based upon the size and magnitude of the assets under construction activities or under broadly all types of activities to get that asset ready for its intended use. So, to the extent that deliveries outpace construction spending and assets that are going through, either redevelopment or development, then capitalized interest would go down and the opposite is true if construction costs exceed the pace of deliveries.  What I'd say on 2025, if you're looking at the leasing percentages is, we've got some time on some of those and we've seen that that pre-leasing percentage pick up. Definitely, if those assets, we get to \u201825 and those assets seize activities and yeah, then capitalized interest would turn off. But we're, we got a long headway there. We got a long time and we've done - we've definitely done studies to look at the timing of pre-leasing and we're not quite in that sweet spot for some of these assets that are out in \u201825 and beyond in terms of when tenants are ready to make decisions. So, I guess, stay tuned. I'm not sure I understand your question, Connor. Yeah. I guess the way to look at that, Connor is this, if you're looking at projects that has say just to make the math easy 7% yield and capitalization is in the high 3% range that that would, that would kind of tell you that, if half the building turned got delivered and half the building got turned off, you'd be neutral, but that's really, it's really not typically the case.  I mean, that the pre-leasing on all the, all the assets that we have for \u201823 and \u201824 is extremely high. So, we'll have to wait and see, but like I said before, we've seen the pre-leasing on \u201825 pickup as we get closer and closer to delivery, which is, which is pretty typical for tenants that of smaller size that make decisions much closer to the point at which they can see the building coming out of the ground and can visualize it."

            "name": "Hallie Kuhn",
            "content": "Thank you, Joel and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Alexandria is at the Vanguard and Heart of the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry, which translates into numerous demand drivers for Alexandria's mission-critical lab space and we are the go-to partner for the life science industry. Today I am going to review these demand drivers and exciting new areas of life science, research and development all of which translates into a healthy and expanding tenant base and increasing long-term revenue.  So first, what do we mean when we say the life science industry is secularly growing? First, massive unmet medical need with over 90% of known diseases having no available treatments drives the life science industry providing a tremendous opportunity for innovation, new company formation and life science industry growth. This opportunity set does not change at the whims of the market. It is non-cyclical and non-discretionary.  Second, tenant growth and demand are event and milestone-driven. Important milestones include new biological discoveries, successful advancement of experimental therapies into the clinic and ultimately the demonstration of safety and efficacy of new medicines. Expansion of new therapeutic modalities such as cell, gene and RNA medicines; better diagnostic tools to accurately identify and diagnose patients, and increasingly efficient and predictive clinical trial designs have the potential to increase the number of new medicines over the coming years.  Third, multifaceted and differentiated funding sources ensure that life science companies founded on impactful and differentiated technologies with experienced management teams continue to thrive Altogether, we estimate over $400 billion will be deployed to support life science companies in 2023 across venture funding, biopharma R&D, philanthropy, government, grants and public equity financings.  Notably, 2023 has already exceeded the previous 10 year average of $360 billion and the total market capitalization of public life science companies currently exceeds five trillion. Together, the massive unmet medical need, event-driven growth, and robust and diverse funding sources result in secular growth of the life science industry that drive additional demand for Alexandria lab space, even amid an economic downturn.  The output of this significant investment is longer, healthier lives. As Joel commented, 43 new therapies have been approved this year by the FDA, and six novel gene, cell and RNA-based therapies have been approved. These numbers are on track to meet or exceed the all-time high for annual FDA approvals. That was in 2018 when 59 novel therapies were approved by the FDA.  This is extremely positive above all for the patients that need these medicines. An example of important new therapies on track for approval include the class of GLP1 medicines for obesity, a disease, which accounts for direct costs of over a $170 billion in healthcare spending in the US per year and afflicts, one, and three children and one in five adults.  A decade ago, obesity was considered a minefield for drug development and the industry sentiment was that medicine could not address such a complex disease. Fast forward, and pharma has unlocked an entirely new class of anti-obesity medicines and analyst estimate upwards of 10% of the US population will have been treated with a GLP1 by 2030 with an estimated market size of $40 billion to $50 billion.  Another exciting area is artificial intelligence and machine learning tools. As highlighted in our recent press release, AI is not new to the life science industry. In 2021, there were over a hundred drug and biologic submissions to the FDA developed using AI components. Nor do AI tools negate the need for lab space. In many cases, AI focused life science companies require significant lab footprints to generate the immense biological and chemical datasets needed to effectively train AI ML models.  To this end, the acceleration of AI may in fact, increase the need for laboratory footprints. And we already see this manifesting as an exciting emerging segment of demand.  Now, moving to the health of our diverse life science tenant base. While some analysts and investors have a misconception that small and mid-cap biotech are a proxy for the entire life science industry, and its growth, the reality is broader, and far more complex. Starting with multinational pharma, which account for 18% of our ARR, companies are leveraging healthy balance sheets to double down on R&D and in licensing, acquire innovative products. Biopharma alone invested $278 billion in R&D in 2022, representing a 66% increase, compared to 10 years prior.  Biopharma also has an estimated $500 million in M&A firepower to continue to bring external innovation into their portfolios. To that end, M&A has regained momentum with $112 billion in acquisitions in 2023 exceeding the 2021 and 2022 levels. Large pharma continues to heavily rely on innovation from smaller biotechs to backfill their pipelines.  For example, BMS\u2019 top five products in. 2022 were all derived from acquisitions. For J&J, Merck and Pfizer, four out of five of the company's top selling therapies were from licensing or M&A deals. So how does M&A impacts net absorption within our clusters? The specific impact of M&A events needs to be looked at on a case-by-case basis, but it\u2019s broadly positive.  Platform companies acquired not just for their clinical assets, but for their R&D platform and scientific talent, lend tend to land and expand so to speak. A great example is in San Diego where the significant presence of large pharma tenants including BMS, Eli Lily, Takeda, and Vertex were all driven by acquisitions of smaller biotech companies.  We are also in the process of supporting the significant expansion of a pharma acquired company in Greater Boston more to come on this at Investor Day. Companies acquired for specific assets may not lead to additional expansion, but we do benefit from an upgrading credit in all cases as the acquirer will be responsible for each in place lease.  M&A also leads to capital being returned to investors and can drive formation of new companies within our ecosystems as experienced scientists and entrepreneurs start their next new endeavors, which also creates additional demand for Alexandria lab space. Critically, for pharma to remain competitive and ensure a steady stream of successful, innovative medicines over the next decade, they need to attract the best talent and have the infrastructure and operational supports to accelerate and safeguard their mission-critical science.  This need is driving several significant requirements in key R&D clusters and Alexandria is the go-to brand.  Transitioning to public biotechnology companies, 14% ARR is represented by companies with marketed products and 10% ARR by preclinical and clinical companies. For our commercial stage biotech tenants, they notched a $108 billion in revenue through the third quarter of 2023, including the likes of Gilead, Vertex and Amgen.  For our pre-commercial companies, the public market for small and mid cap biotechs certainly remains challenging. However, companies that meet expected milestones have executed significant follow-on financings and stock prices have responded positively. Through 3Q $14 billion has been raised in follow on offerings, which is on track to beat total 2022 follow-ons of $14.5 billion.  This includes tenant vaccite which earlier this year netted $545 million in total proceeds to fund their potentially best-in-class, pneumonia vaccine and others including Editas and Etera. There are also some green shoots in the IPO market for companies with the right pedigree, namely deep clinical pipelines with line of sight to important inflection points.  In September, San Diego tenant RayzeBio raised an oversubscribed $358 million IPO driven by near-term clinical trial data readouts, testing their first-in-class radio pharmaceutical therapies for rare forms of cancer. On to private biotech which makes up 9% ARR, while life science funding has largely reverted to pre-pandemic levels, it remains robust.  Annualized projections of life science venture funding for 2023 are trending towards an estimated $27 billion which exceeds 2019 levels of nearly $24 billion. Further while a frequent assumption is that many financings are being propped up by current insiders, the data highlights that this is just not true. In a detailed analysis by Oppenheimer of Series A and B financings year-to-date, nearly 80% of all financings were led or co-led by outside investors speaking to a healthy appetite from investors to fund new deals.  Our new lease with Altos Labs on our One Alexandria Square Mega Campus in San Diego is one example of a stellar private company, having raised a historic $3 billion to deploy towards self reprogramming to treat diseases associated with aging.  Last, life science products, service and devices which represent 22% of our ARR continue to be the workhorse of the industry, providing the hardware and software so to speak that fueled experiments in the lab. There are challenges that exist post-COVID as some companies ramped up products and services, either directly or indirectly driven by COVID-19 and are now resetting strategic priorities.  But novel areas of science and successful products are emerging and generating new forms of demand such as the new obesity drugs, which will require significant CDMO capacity to manufacture and new forms of drug discovery such as proteonics highlighted by the recent acquisition of Olink for a $3.1 billion by Thermo Fisher.  Altogether, the results of the current market conditions is that companies are highly conscious of every dollar spent. They do not have the luxury of risking their science and unreliable lab space or in locations where they can't recruit the right talent.  We continue to see increasing demand for companies looking - by companies for looking for just in time availability of high quality lab space in amenitized campuses in the best locations with the infrastructure and operations that ensure their mission-critical work is supported 24/7 and that there is a path for future growth needs. And this is what Alexandria's one of a kind lab space within our world-class mega campuses is uniquely positioned to deliver.  To end, I want to share some insight from Dr. Robert Langer, an MIT professor Moderna co-founder and luminary in the field of drug development. When recently asked what scientific innovations, he is most excited about his answer was simple, but profound. The science and medicines that have not yet been discovered.  So, as we traverse challenging times, remember that the resilience of this industry is rooted in a truly vast opportunity for new discoveries that will improve the lives of everyone on this call today. The most impactful of which is yet to come.  With that, I will pass it to Peter. Sure. Happy to. A great example and we had a quote from the CEO, Roger Perlmutter the former CSO of Merck in our press release is icons, which we have a signed lease with a property under development in San Francisco. With AI you have to have data to train the models. And so, when folks kind of \u2013 there has been commentary thrown out that oh! AI is going to and, make it so that you don't have to run experiments as extensively in labs.  What we see is actually the opposite, because you need such vast datasets to train the AI ML models in order to optimize and drive towards results that we see really large footprints whether it's robotic, high throughput, both chemical, and biological data these companies are generating in order to be able to actually apply AI and ML.  It would be like applying generative AI to the internet in 1995, right? You have to have a really vast starting dataset in order to get something that's meaningful on the back end. So we're continuing to see that evolve I think across all of our clusters. There's some really interesting ways that companies are integrating this tool into their toolkit for developing new medicines and that the end results 10, 20 years from now it's hopefully a lot more medicines for patients and additional lab space demand. Yeah, with M&A as I mentioned, you really have to look at it as a on a case-by-case basis for specific M&A, I think that the better way to look at it is holistically and as Joel mentioned, M&A and licensing is a huge component of large pharma strategy for the next decade and that will likely continue beyond that. They're looking to recoup something on the order of over $130 billion in revenue, that'll be lost due to patent expirations.  And so when you look at that acquisition activity on a whole, the net positive is certainly going to lead to additional R&D needs and is also a benefit from the perspective of upgrades and credits. Given that when an acquirer comes in and buys a smaller company, we get the upgrade on the credit from the in place lease."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaula Schwartz: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The Company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our second quarter earnings call. Our one-of-a-kind company, which pioneered the lab space niche, continues to perform well in both good times and tough times, demonstrating the resiliency of our unique business model in our now post-pandemic world. In fact, COVID-19 really reaffirmed the sustained strength of our life science industry fundamentals and the need for our essential lab space infrastructure. This favorable backdrop for this nation's -- one of the nation's most mission-critical industries, which we serve, continues to underpin our business, driving demand for our world-class brand and highly differentiated assets and operations. I want to thank each and every member of the Alexandria family team for an operationally and financially excellent second quarter. A big shout out to the finance and accounting team for winning the 2023 NAREIT Gold Award awarded by NAREIT in June for the best REIT reporting and transparency, and amazingly, an unprecedented eighth award and most ever by any REIT. Alexandria is truly a best-in-class REIT, which pioneered the lab space niche and which I believe has made a metamorphic and innovative and transformational impact on our life science industry for the last 29 years. We're very proud of the stellar balance sheet we built since the days of the great financial crisis when we were a small and unrated REIT. Upon the closing of our $1 billion line of credit accordion add-on, one of the banks said of Alexandria \"Congratulations on the successful expansion of your credit facility to $5 billion.\" This is a significant accomplishment in any environment where many real estate owners are struggling to source debt capital. It is a testament to the strength, quality and endurance of the Alexandria platform. So let me turn to some highlights of the quarter. Dean will cover in detail, but I want to just give a little bit of perspective. The second quarter was a very strong reporting quarter, generally in line with our 5- and 10-year historical run rates, REIT financial metrics and certainly outside of the rocket ship performance during COVID. We had strong FFO per share growth in both the second quarter and the first half approximating 7%, especially in a continuing challenging macro and nicely beating consensus. Strong leasing quarter at 1.3 million rentable square feet ahead of the historical run rate of about 1.1 million square feet and NOI was up nicely, almost $200 million for the quarter. Positive rental growth, stable occupancy and solid same-store NOI increases also hosted. The continuing strength and I think overall solidity of our fortress balance sheet continues. Our ability to reiterate and maintain strong guidance, way, all the metrics should demonstrate our continuing confidence and our tenants demand for essential lab space, coupled with our ability to operate successfully in a moderately elevated supply dynamic environment. And then let me make a couple of comments on the life science industry, which Jenna will detail in just a moment, a couple of high-level observations. M&A, a critical part of the capital recycling, continues to increase mostly with bolt-on product deals, which is a good and positive sign. Series A rounds in 2023 so far have averaged about $60 million, an all-time high, and biologics, not surprisingly, have attracted the majority of early-stage investments. And with that kind of brief intro, let me turn it over to Jenna Foger.\nJenna Foger: Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Jenna Foger, Senior Vice President and Co-Lead of our Science and Technology team here at Alexandria. Today, I'm going to comment on the solid fundamentals of the secularly growing life science industry, how these fundamentals contribute to the continued vitality and health of Alexandria's best-in-class life science tenant base and innovation as a long-term driver of life science industry growth. The secularly growing life science industry, which has an estimated market value of over $5 trillion and approximately $450 billion in estimated 2023 R&D funding, fuel is continuing demand for Alexandria's essential 24/7 lab space infrastructure across our cluster markets. This industry is driven by the achievement of scientific, clinical and commercial milestones and is not significantly impacted by market cyclicality nor by some of the macro trends impacting commodity REITs today. With over 10,000 diseases known to humankind and less than 10% addressable with current therapies, the incredible innovation taking place within our lab-based facilities is and will remain a national imperative. Taking a closer look at the health of our tenant base, beginning with multinational pharma, which makes up 17% of our ARR, this segment continues to operate from a position of strength. In 2022, biopharma deployed an estimated $267 billion into R&D, representing a 57% increase in biopharma R&D spend over the past 10 years, which is expected to continue to increase. Given the immense capital firepower on the balance sheets of large-cap pharma in excess of $300 billion and the healthy pressure on pharma to continue to pad its late-stage pipelines with sources of new revenue, there's been a significant uptick in M&A, as Joel mentioned. The first half of 2023 M&A deal value has already totaled $97 billion, surpassing total M&A transaction values for full years '21 and '22, pumping additional liquidity into the sector. We also see increased pharma partnering activity across our regional ecosystems as well. Transitioning to private venture-backed biotech, which makes up 10% of our total ARR, we continue to see healthy life science center activity with a significant $17.7 billion invested in the first half of 2023, which while down from the record pandemic period peak, life science venture activity remains quite strong by historic standards and in line with 2018 and 2019 levels. Given the record high years of venture fundraising by life science venture funds in '21 and '22, there is still plenty of dry powder to deploy of course, given the broader capital market context and a very narrow IPO window, venture capitalists are more discriminate, disciplined and demanding of new and future investments with the expectation that companies may need to stay private for longer. Private biotechs with tenured management teams, strong differentiated technologies and clear line of sight to value inflection milestones consistent with our own tenant underwriting selection criteria are the ones that continue to rise above the fray. As for public biotech, our public biotech tenants with marketed products make up 14% of our ARR and include companies such as Amgen, Gilead, Vertex and Moderna. This is also a very healthy segment of our tenant base with substantial revenues and continues to be a critical contributor to innovation and partnerships across our ecosystem. For our preclinical and clinical stage public biotech comprising 10% of our ARR, compelling clinical data remains king, and this segment of our tenant base continues to perform. Tenants such as Black Diamond, Medicine and Biomass Fusion to name a few have recently raised substantial follow-on public equity financing on the heels of promising clinical data. As we always have, our science and technology team continues to meticulously underwrite and monitor all of our tenants very closely. Notwithstanding in the process of developing novel medicines, there will always be some that fail in every type of macro market environment. And this is, of course, baked into our model. With a deep tenant base relationships across every facet of the industry and in each of our regional ecosystems and of course, the highest quality infrastructure and operations, we get ahead of potential tenant challenges to backfill and further enhance our tenant roster. Reflecting the health of our current tenant base in 2Q '23, tenant rent collections were at 99.9%, and we've already collected over 99.7% of July rent. Now a word on innovation, catalyzed by groundbreaking technologies, new modalities, massive unmet medical need and strong fundamentals, the life science industry remains uniquely positioned to tackle and solve our most persistent and major health care challenges. The emergence of a new golden age of biology only bolsters the strength and growth potential of this vital industry. In this new historic age, the FDA has approved over 450 new drugs over the past decade, and 2023 is on track to be a near all-time record high year of new drug approvals, starting the year off with over 60 PDUFA dates set on the FDA calendar to review new drug applications. Collectively reflecting the productivity and impact of the life science industry to bringing new medicines to patients, many of our tenants are at the forefront of this innovation. To name a few, Pfizer and GSK, each received new approvals this year for their respective RSV vaccines, an incredible feat given a long history of failed vaccine development in RSV. And Biogen's tofersen also received a Vanguard approval for ALS, a debilitating neurodegenerative treatment lacking current -- debilitating neurodegenerative disorder lacking current treatments. These trends reaffirm the fundamental truth Alexandria recognized nearly three decades ago. Our fully integrated mission-critical lab space infrastructure centered in core hubs of innovation is essential for our tenants to advance scientific discoveries and improve human health. Through every market cycle, Alexandria's tenants rely on a central lab-based infrastructure for the intended purpose to provide 24/7 compliant fully integrated and workflow optimized facilities to house, operate, advance and help safeguard in aggregate billions of dollars of scientific research, specialized equipment, pipeline programs and commercial assets. It is the advancement of this science and related intellectual property in Alexandria's lab space building that drives the utilization of and demand for space. Much like a data center that is constantly and consistently capturing and storing data throughput, the volume, velocity and value of the scientific throughput occurring in our spaces at any point in time is not correlated with the volume of people flowing in and out of our buildings and campuses. As such, a more relevant metric for measuring the utilization of Alexandria's lab space assets by our tenants is energy consumption. And we have seen consistent same-store electricity energy consumption -- same-store electricity consumption across Alexandria's lab space asset base today as we did in pre-pandemic years. Equally as important to note, within Alexandria's lab space assets, the laboratories and adjacent non-technical space cannot be decoupled. Each tenant base floor and building plan is fully integrated and intentionally designed to enable seamless workflows between laboratory and nontechnical spaces within the leased premises. Remember, the majority of tenant employees in our lab space assets interact with the science in the lab in some ways, including to conduct experiments, analyze and interpret data, plan new experiments, make business decisions about the data or engage in other related activities. This is the nature of life science companies research workflows, critical aspects of which clearly cannot be performed from home. And lastly, collaboration, collaboration is also fundamental to innovation and overall life science industry productivity and really critical for translating discoveries from academia into treatments, diagnostics and cures by biotech and pharma companies. It is also a key reason why 17 of the top 20 multinational biopharma's lease space from Alexandria across our regional markets to access this early innovation. And I point to the recent example from Verve and Lilly collaboration in Greater Boston, Pipeline Therapeutics and J&J collaboration in San Diego as two recent examples of collaboration across our campuses. Now given the proprietary and regulatory considerations, these collaborations are, of course, intentionally and tightly managed by executive teams and employees from one company are not wandering back and forth between discrete tenant spaces to collaborate ad hoc. Clearly, more or less people in a building or on a campus is really not correlated with more or less collaboration. So to wrap my comments, while today's broader macro environment will continue to warrant extreme prudence, it is an opportunity for the best life science companies reflected across Alexandria tenant base to benefit from the secularly growing life science industry solid fundamentals and to continue to advance the technologies and medicines that will bring the most value to patients. And with that, I pass it off to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thanks, Jenna. A few days ago, when reading a capital markets report, I came upon the line, uncertainty is arguably the harshest enemy of investing. It was a very concise way of describing what we have all been seeing in the broad economy over the past couple of years. It has even hit the somewhat insulated life science industry over the past few quarters, manifested by slower decision-making and the tightening of budgets by executive teams and boards. Nonetheless, progress continues in the labs, milestones are being achieved and success is being rewarded. The golden age of biology will not be stopped. The flywheel is starting to turn again, and we're excited to see the like changing innovations that inertia will bring, and Alexandria is perfectly positioned to capitalize on it. I'm going to briefly touch on our development pipeline, leasing, supply, and asset sales and then hand it over to Dean. In the first quarter, we delivered 387,076 square feet in four projects into our high barrier to entry submarkets, bringing total deliveries year-to-date to 840,587 square feet covering seven projects. Annual NOI for this quarter's deliveries totaled $58 million, bringing the year-to-date total incremental additions to NOI to $81 million. The initial weighted average stabilized yield is 6.4%, influenced by a build-to-core project in East Cambridge housing the next generation of companies from the investors who brought the world Moderna. Development and redevelopment projects saw an uptick in activity for the quarter with approximately 142,000 square feet of leases signed, covering six multi-tenant projects. As of quarter end, we have another 42,000 square feet under negotiation. During the quarter, we placed a lab conversion opportunity at 401 Park Drive and the ground-up development of neighboring 421 Park Drive, both located in the Greater Boston submarket of the Fenway into near-term projects expected to commence construction in the next three quarters, stabilizing in 2025 and beyond. A portion of the 421 Park Drive project is in process of being presold to a research institute, which will be a highly complementary to the development of the mega campus and the proceeds will help fund the remaining 392,000 square feet of the development. This transaction, along with a joint venture that will fund the remainder of 15 Necco, which closed in April, are great examples of the optionality Alexandria has to fund its value creation pipeline. At quarter end, our pipeline of current and near-term projects is 70% leased and is expected to generate greater than $605 million of annual incremental NOI, primarily through the second quarter of 2026. The decline from 72% leased last quarter was due to the addition of the new Fenway projects. Excluding those additions, the pipeline would have been 74% leased. Transitioning to leasing and supply. Once again, our strong brand loyalty, mega campus offerings and operational excellence continue to drive strong leasing numbers in a challenging market. We are pleased to report leasing volume of 1.3 million square feet achieved in the second quarter, which again exceeded our five-year pre-2021 average and is the 13th consecutive quarter where we have achieved a leasing volume above 1 million square feet. Rental rate increases were 16.6% and 8.3% on a cash basis reflective of leasing volume heavily weighted towards Seattle, Research Triangle and Maryland. Despite spreads coming down from the COVID rocket ship numbers, net effective rents remained strong in our operating assets due to their generic build-out, which enables renewals in the re-leasing of vacant space with minimum CapEx. Another positive realized this quarter was a notable increase in demand, ranging from 15% to 20% in our top three markets, a sign that perhaps investors are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to economic uncertainty, but also likely driven by significant dry powder they need to put to work. There have also been an increase in 100,000 square foot plus requirements in a few regions driven by large pharma and biotech anticipated venture creation investments. Alexandria is well positioned to capture this demand because many of these opportunities are coming from existing relationships, which typically account for a significant amount of our leasing. In the first half of the year, we have leased 2.55 million square feet, of which 82% was generated from existing tenants. In addition, our mega campus offerings providing the ability to scale in a wide variety of amenities are the clear choice of high-quality companies. We spent considerable time during our G&A REIT meetings discussing supply and recently covered it in our white paper. The data presented in those meetings and the white paper was from the first quarter of '23, and we'll update it for you here. As a reminder, we perform robust on the ground, building-by-building analysis to identify and track new supply from high-quality projects we believe are competitive to ours in our high barrier to entry submarkets. We focus primarily on high barrier to entry markets and our brand mega campus offerings in AAA locations and operational excellence enables us to continually mine our vast, deep and loyal tenant base to drive our leasing activity, which will likely lessen the impact of generic supply. In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 1.6% of market inventory, a slight increase of 0.01% over last quarter. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 5%, a 0.3% reduction due to the lease-up of that inventory during the quarter. In San Francisco, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 6.6% of market inventory, which is unchanged. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 8.8%, a 0.3% reduction due to a downward revision of estimated square footage to be delivered during the year. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 3.5% of market inventory, which is a decrease of 0.8%, due mainly to projects being delivered with unleased space now reflected in direct vacancy. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 4.9%, a 0.4% reduction due in part to a pause conversion project and a decrease in scope of another one. Direct and sublease market vacancy for our core submarkets is updated as follows. Greater Boston direct vacancy stayed stable at 2.8%, but sublease vacancy increased by 1.5% to 5.4% for a net increase in available space and operation of 1.5%. San Francisco direct vacancy stayed stable at 2.3%, but sublease vacancy increased by 2.7% to a total of 6.2% for a net increase in available space and operation of 2.7%. San Diego direct vacancy increased from 4.1% to 4.8%, largely due to delivered unleased new supply, and sublease vacancy increased by 1.8% for a net increase in available space in operation of 2.5%. We are tracking new supply to be delivered in 2025, and we'll update you on those statistics next quarter. For our current read is that volume will be below 2024 deliveries, likely due to high construction costs, higher cost of capital, a lack of available debt financing and adequate supply currently under construction. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. We are quite proud and fortunate to own assets in a scarce asset class. As you all know, the past few months have had little transactional activity in the broad markets. But because of the attractiveness of our product type, Alexandria has been able to make great progress towards reaching our value harvesting goals. At quarter end, we had closed $701 million of sales, including the 15 Necco sale announced last quarter and have another $175 million pending for a total of $876 million, which is a little over halfway to our midpoint guidance. We have a number of other efforts in progress or soon to be launched that would exceed our guidance if we choose to execute on all of the opportunities. The vast majority of those identified assets are noncore non-campus assets we plan to fully dispose of and reinvest the proceeds into our value-add pipeline. Notable sales closed in the first quarter include the sale of 100% interest in 11119 North Torrey Pines Road for $86 million or $1,186 per square foot at a strong 4.6% cap rate. There is a significant mark-to-market on the asset when the lease expires in approximately 4.5 years, but a fair amount of capital will be needed to execute on that opportunity. This asset was a one-off for us, and there was no opportunity for us to aggregate a campus around it. We sold 20.1% of our joint venture interest in 9625 Towne Centre Drive, an asset jointly owned with an institutional partner who wanted to exit their position and initiated the sales process for their interest only. Given the strong demand for this University Towne Centre asset, we decided to participate in the sale, which captured $32 million in proceeds at a strong 4.5% cap rate, reflective of the high-quality building, tenant credit and the future mark-to-market opportunity we will participate in with our continued ownership. A portfolio of non-core assets inclusive of our Second Avenue assets in Waltham and our legacy non-mega campus affiliated 780 & 790 Memorial Drive asset located in Mid-Cambridge sold for $365.2 million or $852 per square foot at a combined cash cap rate of 5.2%, reflective of a mix of credit quality, some vacancy and term. We also completed the sale of pure office asset 275 Grocery in Newton, Massachusetts. Originally planned for conversion to lab as part of an assemblage of adjacent assets into a mega campus with green line access, the opportunity did not come to fruition. So, we made the prudent decision to sell this noncore office asset. The $214 per square foot price reflects its 70% occupancy. The negative sentiment of office buildings outside of cluster locations and a significant amount of capital needed to reposition the asset. Overall, we are very pleased with the results achieved thus far in our value harvesting asset recycling program. As mentioned, we have identified more than enough noncore opportunities to achieve our goals to fund our 2023 growth, primarily through dispositions. With that, I'll pass it over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: All right. Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported very solid operating and financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023. Total revenues for the second quarter were $713.9 million, up 10.9% over the second quarter of 2022. NOI was up 12.2% over the second quarter of 2022, driven primarily by the commencement of $58 million of annual net operating income related to the 387,000 rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that were placed in service in the second quarter. The significant NOI growth from completion of pipeline projects was the key driver of our outperformance this quarter in comparison to consensus. Additionally, we slightly beat other key line items relative to consensus. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was $2.24, up 6.7% over the second quarter of 2022, and we're on track to generate another solid year of growth in FFO per share growth of 6.4% at the midpoint of our guidance for the year. Now high-quality life science entities continue to appreciate our brand mega-campus strategy and operational excellence by our team. 49% of our annual rental revenue is generated from investment-grade or large-cap publicly traded tenants, and this statistic represents one of the highest quality client rosters in the REIT industry today. Our collections remain very high at 99.9%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin remains very strong at 70%. Same-property NOI growth was very solid and in line with guidance for the full year. Same property results for the second quarter were 3%, up 3% and up 4.9% on a cash basis, and for the first half of the year, up 3.4% and up 6.5% on a cash basis. As a reminder, our outlook for 2023 same-property NOI growth remains very solid at a midpoint of 3% and 5% on a cash basis. Now turning to leasing. Quarterly leasing results are driven by a relatively small volume of and mix of transactions that drive the overall rental rate growth related to lease renewals and re-leasing the space. Now for the second quarter, leasing volume was 1.3 million rentable square feet, and rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-lease in the space was up 16.6% and 8.3% on a cash basis. Now rental rate growth for the second quarter was driven by transactions based out of the Seattle region, Maryland and Research Triangle in comparison to record rental rate growth in the first quarter of 48.3% and 24.2% on a cash basis, which was driven by transactions out of Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. Our outlook for rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing space remained solid at the midpoint of 30.5% and 14.5% on a cash basis. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to in-place leases for the entire asset base remains very strong at 19%. Now capital expenditures generally fall into two key categories. The first category is focused on development and redevelopment. And redevelopment specifically is the first time conversion of non-lab space to lab space through redevelopment. Now the second category is nonrevenue-enhancing capital expenditures. And our nonrevenue-enhancing capital expenditures over the last five years have averaged 15% of net operating income and has been trending lower for 2022 at 13%. For 2023, this is closer to 10% based upon the second quarter '23 net operating income on an annualized basis. Tenant improvement allowances related to lease renewals and re-leasing the space have been very modest at about $16 per square foot for the first half of the year, and these costs are included in the nonrevenue-enhancing capital expenditures that I mentioned earlier. Second quarter occupancy was in line with expectations at 93.6%, consistent with first quarter occupancy. Our outlook for 2023 reflects flat occupancy from the second quarter to the third quarter and occupancy growth in the fourth quarter. The midpoint of occupancy guidance is 95.1%, and occupancy as of June 30 of 93.6% included vacancy of 2.2% or approximately 900,000 rentable square feet from properties that were recently acquired in 2021 and 2022. Now 23% of the recently acquired vacancy is already -- has already been leased and will be ready for occupancy over the next number of quarters and an additional 14% is under negotiation. Now a huge thank you to Marc Binda and his entire team and our important relationship lenders under our $5 billion line of credit. During the quarter, we increased aggregate commitments available under our line of credit to $5 billion, up from $4 billion. Now this has allowed us to increase liquidity on our balance sheet to over $6.3 billion as of June 30. Now during the first half of '23, we had remained very flexible with our strategy and pivoted toward outright dispositions versus sales of partial interest. Our team has made excellent progress on dispositions and sales of partial interest for the first half of the year and are working on a number of transactions for the second half focused primarily on outright dispositions. There are more details on Page 7 of our supplemental package for your reference. Now turning to consistent growth in dividends from our high-quality cash flows. We have a low and conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for the second quarter annualized with 5.2% increase in common stock dividends over the last 12 months. We're projecting $375 million, representing a three-year run rate of over $1.1 billion in net cash flows from operating activities after dividends for reinvestment. Turning to venture investments. Realized gains from our venture investments included in FFO for the second quarter was $22.5 million and has averaged about $25 million per quarter for the last eight quarters. Gross unrealized gains on our venture investments as of June 30 were $373 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. Now on external growth, we have $605 million of incremental net operating income from our pipeline of 6.7 million rentable square feet. Now projects aggregating 3.7 million rentable square feet is expected to reach stabilization in 2020 -- in the remainder of 2023 and 2024. And these projects are 94% leased and will generate $277 million of incremental net operating income. Additionally, we have another 3.7 million rentable square feet that is expected to reach stabilization after 2024 and will generate another $328 million of incremental net operating income. Turning to guidance, our detailed updated underlying guidance assumptions are disclosed beginning on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Our per share outlook for 2023 was updated to a range plus or minus $0.03 from the midpoint of guidance down from a range plus or minus $0.05 last quarter. Now our range of guidance for EPS is from $2.72 to $2.78 and our range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $8.93 to $8.99 with no change in the midpoint of $8.96. Now this represents a strong 6.4% growth in FFO per share following excellent growth last year of 8.5%. Our strategy for dispositions and sales of partial interest for 2023 reflects our focus on enhancement of our overall asset base through outright disposition of properties no longer integral to our mega-campus strategy with fewer sales of partial interest. Now this is reflected in the transactions we have completed to date in 2023 and our target transactions for the second half of the year. This strategy did result in an update to sources and uses of capital due to the replacement of a potential sale of a partial interest with an outright sale of properties. Now while this change did not result in a change in gross construction spend, it did reduce funding for construction spend by a potential JV partner that was replaced with funding from an additional $225 million in dispositions of real estate. Let me stop there and turn it back over to Joel to open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Dean, I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on that occupancy build that you talked about. It sounds like things are flat Q2 to Q3. But to get to the midpoint, there's a pretty big uplift, I guess, from 93.6% to 95.1%. So are there a bunch of signed leases that are just not commenced yet? Or is that based on kind of incremental leasing you think you're going to do? Just kind of help us walk through that bridge, please.\nDean Shigenaga: Sure, Steve. So the growth in occupancy anticipated in the fourth quarter, some of it is from signed leases. We have about 400,000 square feet of executed leases that will commence in time for the occupancy growth by the end of the year. That includes some of the spaces that I mentioned in the recently acquired vacancy. We also anticipate some leasing activity that we need to complete in order to drive that occupancy growth. And then we also have some key spaces being delivered out of our development pipeline, which by the time they're delivered should be pretty much close to 100% leased. And that doesn't have quite the same impact of delivering space to tenants out of the operating portfolio, but there is a slight benefit from that as well.\nSteve Sakwa: So just as a quick follow-up, could you just help frame maybe the spec leasing that you think you need to get done maybe as a range that the team needs to complete over the next five months to hit that target?\nDean Shigenaga: I don't have that figure right at my fingertips, Steve. But look, if you look at our volume of leasing activity that we've averaged pre -- the record period of leasing in '21 and 2022, we're back to that run rate of leasing activity on a quarterly basis, which is 1.2 million, 1.3 million rentable square feet. A portion of that, as you know, comes out of the value creation pipeline development and redevelopment and previously vacant stuff. So, our run rate on renewals and re-leasing the space is probably, on average, about 1 million square feet per quarter; and only a portion of that is stuff that we need to complete related to fourth quarter deliveries. As you can imagine, most space, probably for any real estate company, sometimes it's ready for delivery immediately, but only a portion of that -- of that 1 million square feet can actually be delivered that quickly. So, it's not a big number, Steve. But to be fair, we do have to get some leasing done. And so we've got to work through that opportunity.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And just a second question. I know that you had talked about the Toast termination. But I think there's just maybe some confusion or uncertainty over kind of the dollar amount. Maybe when it hits, how it might have been in guidance or not in guidance. So could you just maybe walk through the space take back, maybe some offsets to the termination fee and maybe what flowed through in Q2 and what we should expect in Q3 from that transaction?\nDean Shigenaga: Sure, Steve. So this is a pretty good example of space that we opportunistically took back in the second quarter. The background for this tenant, there was an in-place lease related to an acquisition that we completed in January of 2021. Toast was at 401 Park in the Fenway submarket for reference. And during our due diligence for the acquisition, our team had identified multiple floors of this office building that will be suited for conversion to lab space through redevelopment. These floors were targeted for redevelopment. Obviously, after our successful lease-up of 201 Brookline, now if you remember, 201 Brookline that was a development site at the Fenway campus that the seller had commenced construction on, and it was only 20% pre-leased at the time we acquired it. Our team quickly leased the remainder of that project -- the construction development project at rental rates that were well exceeded our initial underwriting. And so when we had the opportunity to take back space from Toast, I think it was about 133,000 rentable square feet in total. We're going to get about 111,000 rental square feet back in 3Q here to commence our redevelopment. And the remaining 22,000 rentable square feet we get back at the end of 2024. The bottom line, the way to think about this arrangement we entered into with Toast is that net of the write-off of deferred rent, we'll earn the remaining of the revenue from Toast overtime. And this really covers the quarterly rent that was due to rent Toast about 1.59 a quarter. And so, this arrangement allows us to earn our revenue through the end of 2024. And the way to think about this is the net benefit we're going to earn is a slight pickup relative to the prior run rate rent. So for 2023, we might pick up about $2 million in FFO. And then in 2024, there's a similar expected benefit of a couple of million bucks or so. The key takeaway is that we were able to move up the timing of new lab space at 401 Park after our successful lease up of 201 Brookline. And so, we were excited to be able to get access to that earlier to start the redevelopment sooner than later.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joshua Dennerlein with BOA. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I appreciate all the color. Maybe a follow-on based on the occupancy earlier, but focused on the lease rate growth. It looks like your guidance is still assuming an acceleration in the second half of the year off of 2Q growth rates. What gives you the confidence that you'll see that reacceleration?\nDean Shigenaga: Can you clarify, were you asking about occupancy or rental rate growth?\nJoshua Dennerlein: Rental rate growth.\nDean Shigenaga: So, our outlook -- just to remind everybody, our outlook for rental rate growth for 2023 is a range of 28% to 30%, call it, a midpoint of 28.5%, 12% to 17% with a midpoint of 14.5% on a cash basis. Our rental rate growth for the first quarter, just to remind everybody, was pretty record at 48% and 24% on a cash basis. And most of that was driven by Greater Boston, San Francisco, Bay Area and Seattle. It's important to recognize that the second quarter was a very different subset geographically, which consisted primarily of Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle. When you think about rental rate growth of 16% -- 16.6% on a GAAP basis, 8.3% on a cash basis, that's pretty outstanding in this type of market and when you think across the REIT sector today. So we're very pleased with the rental rate growth that we actually delivered on the quarter and feel comfortable as we look out that we're on track to hit the range of guidance that we gave. What gives us that comfort? I think you've heard us talk about we have a unique brand our mega-campus strategy and our operational excellence, I think, puts us at an advantage to capture opportunities in the marketplace.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. It's not based on stuff that's already signed. It's kind of just what you're seeing in the pipeline are signed? Just kind of...\nDean Shigenaga: Well, we're only 3 weeks or 3.5 weeks after quarter end. So, there's very little activity relative to what we're going to sign for the full six months as we look forward. So you'll have to stay tuned.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Okay. And then Peter, I heard you mentioned potential sales above your disposition guidance range. Just what would give you the go ahead to make those additional sales?\nPeter Moglia: We're going to market in a very targeted way so that we don't overdo it, if we don't need to. But if we end up with values that are highly attractive, we'll definitely consider selling that amount over what we need and apply that towards next year's program.\nJoel Marcus: Any other question there?\nJoshua Dennerlein: I'm good.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: First question, I think -- Dean, I think you mentioned 19% mark-to-market across the portfolio. And I think that number was about 27% coming into the year. So just wondering, can you talk to how much of that's just from moving rents higher and the bumps closing some of that gap versus maybe what's happened in the market thus far?\nDean Shigenaga: Tony, it's Dean here. Yes, so 19% is our current outlook for where we are today on the mark-to-market. Last quarter, you're correct, it was 22%. The quarter before that was 24% and the quarter before that was 27%. So, we have made our way through some of the mark-to-market with leases that we've executed over the last number of quarters. So, it's primarily driven by that, maybe a slight adjustment here and there on our outlook on specific spaces. But most of the move is related to actual leases we've executed.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then, I guess, you talked a bit about 401 and 421 Park Drive and the reason for kind of moving forward with that. But just in general, just think about incremental development and redevelopment, so for instance, in 2024, it looks like you got another 1.5 million or so teed up coming out of expirations for that. But just what's the hurdle to start new projects, whether it's pre-leasing, returns? Just how should we think about just what's coming out in the next 12, 18 months, whether it's the stuff expiring that will go into redevelopment or just new ground up?\nDean Shigenaga: So Tony, let me start with your first part of your question on the exploration front. What we're really looking at is if you look at 2024 as an example, we do have a number of spaces that are coming up for contractual exploration. And keep in mind, these are all related for the most part to recently acquired opportunities where we saw. In this case, these projects have in-place leases and from acquisition that are burning off here. Only a portion of that overall number is something that we expect to actually tackle in the near term. It's roughly -- it's about 684,000 square feet of that is actually development opportunities for the future. So 1.1 -- 1.2 million is expiring in '24 that's been targeted for future development and redevelopment, but 684,000 of that is future development. And that's not going to start immediately on vertical construction because it needs to go through entitlements, design, possibly some site work, and these are really associated with mega campus opportunities. The remainder of that, so roughly 400,000 square feet or so, 400,000 to 500,000 square feet is redevelopment opportunities. Those are more near-term speed to market, less time to build out the projects, and we'll look at those. But our current view as we sit here today would be there's potential to start those because of opportunities we can tackle. So, the number is much smaller. As far as your other question, Tony, how do we look at it? I think you're going to find that we need to remain very disciplined with our approach to new redevelopment and development projects given the macro environment. We're going to focus primarily on projects that are concentrated in our mega campuses, and we really have well-located land for future development. It's important to keep in mind we have the flexibility and not the requirement to address these expansions -- expansion needs from our clients. And maybe as you think about development opportunities on our future pipeline, it's important to recognize that we are going to continue to advance preconstruction activities on the future pipeline projects. Entitlements for large campuses -- mega campuses, it require years to fully entitled. They require design. And oftentimes, the sites are so large, they do require infrastructure before we can actually commence vertical construction. And these preconstruction activities add value to the sites ultimately reduce the time from commencement of vertical construction to delivery a Class A space to our clients. So again, just getting back to where we started with your question, Tony, we'll have to remain very disciplined in our approach, given the macro environment.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Maybe just a little more color, Tony. We have one new mega campus that we're entitling on the West Coast and one on the East Coast. And in both cases, we have, in one case, a current tenant, in the other case, a former tenant, have approached us to take a significant portion of those campuses. So, we're actively pushing entitlements and thinking about site design and all those things. But before we would kick something off, as Dean said, and as Peter said many times, we want to make sure that our spread to our cost of capital is sufficient and long-term IRRs to be certainly positive.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And if I could just ask one last one. Just can you remind us just in the discussion around perhaps scientists working from home as well, just what's the split between lab and I guess, like workstation, office type space in your buildings today? And do you think that changes over time?\nJenna Foger: Tony, it's Jenna Foger over here. So, I guess a comment on that. So again, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, in our lab space assets, of course, the lab training on technical space cannot be decoupled. It -- historically, we've seen about a 50-50 split between the lab and the nontechnical space. In some cases, we're seeing it kind of go up a bit to 55% or 60% lab that's mostly attributable to platform companies kind of prosecuting multiple platforms and pipeline programs at once. But yes, I guess that's probably a high level thing.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And remember, Tony, too, and as we've pointed out before, COVID certainly enabled and caused a lot of companies to repatriate certain overseas processes back into the kind of the home lab and also with the much more sophisticated new modalities, cell therapy, gene therapy, et cetera. The enhancements and the complication of work environments have been expanded as well. So those are two kind of big macro forces that have made a big difference, say, over the last three to five years.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: It's Nick Joseph here with Griff. Maybe just starting up a follow-up, I guess, on the lease termination with Toast. Just want to clarify, was the $16 million in guidance initially or is that new and incremental?\nDean Shigenaga: So Nick, the way to think about the arrangement with Toast is that what was -- the total consideration was something in that $15 million range. The deferred rent number was written down to take that down. I don't have it right in front of me, but $5 million to $6 million or something in that range. The net number is earned out over time effectively replaces rent or cash flows that were in place prior to that arrangement with Toast. And so net-net, at least through 2024, there's very little upside. Like I mentioned, it's a couple million bucks in each year. So, it's not really changing net FFO in any big way. So, in response to your specific question, was the revenue that we're going to generate from the lease with Toast in guidance? It was because it was already a lease in our business. Remember this building was acquired with the lease in place back in 2021. What did change for 2023, a couple of million dollar pickup to FFO.\nNick Joseph: Got it. And then just on the capital plan. Obviously, the pivot, I guess, from selling more JVs to wholly-owned asset sales, can you just expand on that? Is that more of a pricing decision? Was it more strategic in terms of improving the portfolio by maybe selling some that's noncore? But how do you think about that broadly?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I'm going to have -- this is Joel. I'll have Peter kind of respond to that. But I think about -- the Company has -- was a garage startup back in '94. So over many years as it kind of grew, grew its regions, we've had a variety of assets. We did not start a mega-campus strategy. We didn't start even a campus strategy. We couldn't even afford to go into Cambridge in those days. So the nature of a set of our assets really very, very solid workhorse assets in solid locations with solid tenants and with solid cash flows. Now as we move to this or as we've been moving over the last couple of years to this mega-campus strategy in core really high barrier to entry markets has enabled us to let go of those noncore assets. So that's kind of the fundamental frame. But Peter?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. Nick, it was very tempting to bring somebody in to complete the funding of that JV development just like we did at Necco. But at the end of the day, it is part of a mega campus. It is one of the best assets in likely in the world as far as long duration of value. And then reexamining our portfolio and seeing that we still had a number of assets that we could substitute and do just as well as far as getting the proceeds needed to fund our pipeline and just made it, much better story for us to keep 100% of that other development asset, sell the non-cores and really continue to improve our overall asset base towards concentrating it into mega campuses and lessening the one-off assets.\nMichael Griffin: This is Michael Griffin on here with Nick. Just one question around VC funding, I saw there was a report recently that showed some incremental positivity in VC funding in Boston. Is Joel's expectation for this to translate to your other markets? And kind of where do you need to see VC capital pick up in order to see incremental demand?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think I'll have Jenna kind of give you her take on venture capital. But remember, we've returned to kind of the high run rates pre-COVID. So it still is healthy. What you've seen is a slower allocation and greater reserves just given the macro market. But Jenna, maybe some numbers.\nJenna Foger: Yes, that's absolutely true. So as I mentioned in my comments, we've seen in 1H '23 so far about $17.7 billion. So this is right on -- in line, if not slightly above 2018, 2019 levels, and this is really across our market, obviously, with Greater Boston being kind of the center of life science activity. So kind of leading the chart, but we are kind of seeing this across our ecosystem. And again, as Joel mentioned, I mean, there's been a disciplined allocation of capital as we see a potential opening maybe a little bit towards the end of the year but into next year in the IPO window and then kind of a rationalization of follow-on financings on the public side. We're seeing also that kind of trickle down to a venture in terms of the pace increasing, but certainly no dearth of investment opportunities to be had. And like I mentioned in my comments, with '21, '22 and even kind of early '23 life science center fundraising, really being at all-time highs, there continues to be dry powder to deploy.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And remember the comment that I made, Series A, $60 million this year, all-time high, that's pretty astounding when you think about it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: I wanted to jump on, I guess, Peter, in your prepared remarks, you did mention that the biotech flywheel is starting to turn again. Can you provide some additional color on that? Did the flywheel slow down in the past year or so and now it's improving? Or were you mentioning that like tenants were just delaying decisions and now are just being more active? I mean, what -- can you provide some color around that comment?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Mike, I'll ask Peter to answer that in fact. But just keep in mind, the central thesis is the industry has been on a bull market tariff since maybe 2013, 2014 through early 2021. It was the longest biotech bull market that I've seen in -- since the days of Amgen and Genentech and Biogen when they were started late '70s, early '80s. So that says something. And then remember, the rocket ship years with the huge amount of funding and just activity of '21 and -- 2021 and into '22, and remember kind of the first quarter of '21, you saw the biotech index start to move. Now remember, biotech is a sub-segment of all of the life science, but it started to move as a leading indicator of the macro. But Peter?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. So Michael, last quarter, in my prepared remarks, I had mentioned that we had seen a weakening in demand. And one of the positives that I pointed out in this quarter's comments is that we actually have had, I would call, a significant uptick, 15% to 20% in demand in our top three markets. That, coupled with some knowing financings that are happening, as companies have been getting good news, to me, it just feels like the wheel starting to turn again momentum is building, and I'm confident it's going to continue.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And I would say as a footnote, I know personally that there are a number of companies preparing for an IPO in 2024 and that just has not been possible over the last, say, except for extraordinarily rare exceptions on the public markets for the sector. That's a really good sign. I think people are looking at the Fed action maybe today or tomorrow. I forgot what day that is where they think it's kind of going to peak and obviously, the strength of activity, M&A and partnering has all had significant upticks. So that means pretty darn good activity. And I think Peter said or Jenna said, there's always clinical failures in all -- across all modalities and therapeutic classifications. But there's been some awfully good news these days in the diabetes and obesity area and the neurodegenerative area, ALS, which is one of our former directors had a young daughter who died of that disease. We're seeing some remarkable advancements here.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Great. And then like what is driving, I guess, that uptick in tenant activity, I guess, today? Is it just people are more comfortable with the overall market and are willing to make decisions? Are they more comfortable and are actually trying to execute and get financing, allowing them to kind of expand their research process? I guess what is driving that right now? And do you think that will cause incremental demand growth over the next few quarters? I mean can we read that into your comments?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. I mean what's happening is -- and I touched on the theme of my comments, I think that uncertainty has really held back the entire economy. It has held back the life science industry, and that uncertainty is starting to go away and people are starting to realize that there's a lot of dry powder they need to put to work. So that -- we think that the investing of things that were not investing before, new company formation is going to occur, the science continues to move forward. When clinical milestones are met, we're seeing companies be able to raise a lot of money. And on top of that, we're seeing big pharma and biotech position themselves in our markets to grow. So that is what is giving us the positive outlook.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Great. And then last question for me. On the supply front, have you seen a slowdown of some of those non-dedicated life science developers stop-breaking around the new projects? Has that occurred over the past quarter or so?\nPeter Moglia: With a couple of exceptions that are inexplicable, yes. We're not seeing much of anything new breaking ground, but there are some folks that have decided to move forward, which will be in the numbers for next quarter's update on '25.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: I just want to go back and get some more color. You talked about the 15% to 20% increase in the top markets. But in your comments, you also mentioned specifically 100,000 square foot deals, I guess, are back in the market and smaller ones picking up. Can you just give us more color? Are these new requirements for expansion in those top three markets? And then if you look into the second half as we think about the sustainability of the 1.3 million leasing, can you just give us color on the pipeline in terms of maybe qualitative and quantitative comments around kind of how the pipeline of deals are developing in the second half??\nJoel Marcus: Well, yes, this is Joel. Vikram, let me say maybe this regarding your first question. I think we probably don't want to say given just the proprietary nature of what we do and how we do it, talk too much about requirements. Some are sole-sourced RFPs. Some are broader RFPs. Some are existing tenants that come from our own tenant base that aren't in the markets. I don't think we want to make any comments, particularly about that. I think when it comes to leasing, we can only give you the best judgment we have based on Dean's affirmation of guidance both on -- when it comes to the issue of rental rates, occupancy, et cetera. We haven't given our view of 2024 yet. We will do that toward year-end. But I think it's fair to say that, remember, we've got a long history, and Peter cited some of the numbers of quarterly leasing. The vast majority of that comes from our own tenants. And so we have -- I think we have our finger on the pulse and ear to the ground in a way that very few people or groups could have. And I think that gives us the confidence that we can achieve our business plan for this year that by the way we articulated last November, and we'll do the same. I think beyond that, I'm not sure we can or want to give any further color.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay. I was just talking about like the second half of '23 in terms of the pipeline to hit the second half run rate of 1 million or whatever, 1.2 million feet in leasing. But I'm happy to clarify that off-line. I guess just, Dean, on the quarter, you mentioned there was a very modest pickup from Toast, but you did beat Street estimates. And I'm wondering if you can just clarify, a, from your vantage point, the source of that beat and then why that beat did not translate into an uptick in the guide? Is there something offsetting in the second half that kind of reduces the magnitude of the beat in 2Q?\nDean Shigenaga: Not as it relates to NOI, Vikram. I think that was just a timing difference. I can't speak to the various sell-side models on what drove the timing differences. But from our view of the world, our deliveries were, by and large, on track with our expectations. So that doesn't translate to upside there. And there were -- that wasn't the only line item that there was a variance on. If you look across consensus, there were some other line items. I think the G&A is an example. We are lower on G&A than consensus across coverage. But the key driver was that the NOI line item.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay. That's helpful. And then just last one. Specifically, I think one of your top tenants, maybe I'm pronouncing them wrong, Illumina, they called out reduction of real estate as a part of their cost reduction plan overall into the next year or so, call out, one or two specific projects on their call. And I'm wondering you have any update in terms of your exposure with them?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So I'll make a comment. Remember, Illumina still is a pioneer and a leader in their category. They did have an activist attack from icon regarding some management strategies kind of weirdly enough a lot to do about GRAIL, the EU and the FTC took issue with or Illumina acquiring GRAIL. Well, the weird thing is GRAIL was started and spun out of Illumina, and it made no sense, but yet here's an ideological kind of a thing going on. Illumina is as strong as ever. They have a -- they've got a lot of their market that they can still left to penetrate, but I'll ask Dan Ryan, who run San Diego and who's been very involved in Illumina that maybe give you a kind of a broad view of what's going on in their campus.\nDan Ryan: Yes. So the -- what you saw in the headlines is they are currently subleasing. They leased about 300,000 square feet in -- not on our campus, but in the UTC area for pure office space. They have put that on the sublease market. They continue to advance with us discussions about adding a building or two to the campus, which would be more of their laboratory life science and manufacturing space, they look that they're kind of in desperate need to continue to innovate. So that's really what we're seeing from them. And then they -- I think they've had bits and pieces of real estate up in the Bay Area that they no longer deem as critical. So, we expect a pullback to San Diego, and I do expect to engage with them later in the year on additional laboratory office space on campus.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. The two sites that they announced, they were retrenching from were not owned by and operated by us.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nTom Catherwood: Just one for me. Peter, I appreciate all your commentary about continuing to focus on mega campuses and allocate capital there. In the past, you've talked about how these campuses garner rental rate premiums. Do you have a sense of kind of the level of premium you're getting compared to market? And then maybe a little bit more broadly, do you have a sense of how your 19% mark-to-market is split between your mega campuses and the noncore assets that you're bringing to market?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. As far as the premium goes, Tom, our study indicates that it's about 20% more in net effective rent that you're going to get versus a one-off project. Companies are going to pay for the amenities and pay for the scalability and the desirability of the asset. What else did I not cover on your question there?\nTom Catherwood: Just trying to see if you have a breakdown with what you're selling as you're looking at that 19% mark-to-market that Dean had referenced is what you're selling 5%, 0% and what you're holding in the mega campuses is, is that 25%, 30% when it comes to mark-to-market? Or is it more consistent kind of across your portfolio?\nPeter Moglia: Yes, I don't have the breakdown of each and every asset we're selling and what the mark-to-market is. But by and large, the best mark-to-market opportunities are in the mega campuses, and we are holding onto those assets. So what we are selling would be the one-offs that would not garner those types of premiums.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And I think we've historically said on a number of the asset sales we've had to date, a typical mark-to-market has been 15% to high 20%, somewhere in that range, which is pretty good.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDylan Burzinski: And appreciate the comments on sort of net effective rent for the operating portfolio. But just curious, we're hearing that concessions are higher today for new leases, particularly on the development side. So you guys expect that you might start to feel pressure in terms of net effective rents impacting development yields moving forward?\nPeter Moglia: Yes, you are correct. On the development side, new leases, tenants are conserving cash. They are looking to the landlord to provide more tenant improvement. So that is creeping into the ether there. We will be, in some instances, able to push the rents to make up for that -- some of that or all of that. The good news is on the operating side because the spaces are built out because they're built out generically. We have very few concessions and TIs. We need to put out in order to lease or renew that space.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I would also say if you look at the bigger the credit and the bigger the Company, the landlord contribution to build out is not as essential. And in fact, the -- one of the big pharma buildouts that we're working on in one of the top markets, the contribution by the pharma is about $750 a foot. So, oftentimes, the configuration or triangulation or architecture of a deal oftentimes is based, to some extent, on credit and need to put in unusual situations, unusual features that only that tenant would want and that's -- that would be on the tenant's bill not something we would do. So that's something else you have to keep in mind.\nDylan Burzinski: That's helpful. And I just one more, going back to sort of occupancy and realizing that you guys are still targeting, call it, low 95% in terms of occupancy at year-end. Just as we think about the trajectory over the intermediate term, I mean, do you guys think that you can continue to grow on this front? Or should we sort of view this as you guys approaching structural vacancy?\nJoel Marcus: No, I don't think so. I think look historically at how we've grown, I'll ask Dean to comment, but then also think about over time, we have an asset base where we can almost double the size of the Company. So, I don't think we've reached any plateau in any way, shape or form.\nDean Shigenaga: Yes, it's Dean here, Dylan. I agree. You've seen occupancy in our asset base the way we manage our business have really strong relationships with our tenants and really deliver a level of excellence in operating our buildings. Our occupancy can grow to 300 basis points from or more than that above our bogey -- 200 or 300 above our midpoint bogey for the end of '23. So at 95.1% is the midpoint you referenced. I mean we've been in the 98% occupancy range. So there's plenty of room to grow there. And as Joel had also mentioned and as you guys are well aware, our pipeline is set to bring on a tremendous amount of NOI and that gives you visibility all the way into '25 and a little bit going up to '26 now.\nJoel Marcus: Yes, remember, a number of our acquisitions that happened over the last couple of years in Greater Boston involved and one was mentioned the whole Fenway area, existing vacancy that as part of, say, a conversion to first-time lab space and those give, I think, great opportunities for occupancy gains.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: Just want to say thank you, everybody, wishing you a great summer and look forward to our third quarter call.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thanks, Jenna. A few days ago, when reading a capital markets report, I came upon the line, uncertainty is arguably the harshest enemy of investing. It was a very concise way of describing what we have all been seeing in the broad economy over the past couple of years. It has even hit the somewhat insulated life science industry over the past few quarters, manifested by slower decision-making and the tightening of budgets by executive teams and boards. Nonetheless, progress continues in the labs, milestones are being achieved and success is being rewarded. The golden age of biology will not be stopped. The flywheel is starting to turn again, and we're excited to see the like changing innovations that inertia will bring, and Alexandria is perfectly positioned to capitalize on it. I'm going to briefly touch on our development pipeline, leasing, supply, and asset sales and then hand it over to Dean. In the first quarter, we delivered 387,076 square feet in four projects into our high barrier to entry submarkets, bringing total deliveries year-to-date to 840,587 square feet covering seven projects. Annual NOI for this quarter's deliveries totaled $58 million, bringing the year-to-date total incremental additions to NOI to $81 million. The initial weighted average stabilized yield is 6.4%, influenced by a build-to-core project in East Cambridge housing the next generation of companies from the investors who brought the world Moderna. Development and redevelopment projects saw an uptick in activity for the quarter with approximately 142,000 square feet of leases signed, covering six multi-tenant projects. As of quarter end, we have another 42,000 square feet under negotiation. During the quarter, we placed a lab conversion opportunity at 401 Park Drive and the ground-up development of neighboring 421 Park Drive, both located in the Greater Boston submarket of the Fenway into near-term projects expected to commence construction in the next three quarters, stabilizing in 2025 and beyond. A portion of the 421 Park Drive project is in process of being presold to a research institute, which will be a highly complementary to the development of the mega campus and the proceeds will help fund the remaining 392,000 square feet of the development. This transaction, along with a joint venture that will fund the remainder of 15 Necco, which closed in April, are great examples of the optionality Alexandria has to fund its value creation pipeline. At quarter end, our pipeline of current and near-term projects is 70% leased and is expected to generate greater than $605 million of annual incremental NOI, primarily through the second quarter of 2026. The decline from 72% leased last quarter was due to the addition of the new Fenway projects. Excluding those additions, the pipeline would have been 74% leased. Transitioning to leasing and supply. Once again, our strong brand loyalty, mega campus offerings and operational excellence continue to drive strong leasing numbers in a challenging market. We are pleased to report leasing volume of 1.3 million square feet achieved in the second quarter, which again exceeded our five-year pre-2021 average and is the 13th consecutive quarter where we have achieved a leasing volume above 1 million square feet. Rental rate increases were 16.6% and 8.3% on a cash basis reflective of leasing volume heavily weighted towards Seattle, Research Triangle and Maryland. Despite spreads coming down from the COVID rocket ship numbers, net effective rents remained strong in our operating assets due to their generic build-out, which enables renewals in the re-leasing of vacant space with minimum CapEx. Another positive realized this quarter was a notable increase in demand, ranging from 15% to 20% in our top three markets, a sign that perhaps investors are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to economic uncertainty, but also likely driven by significant dry powder they need to put to work. There have also been an increase in 100,000 square foot plus requirements in a few regions driven by large pharma and biotech anticipated venture creation investments. Alexandria is well positioned to capture this demand because many of these opportunities are coming from existing relationships, which typically account for a significant amount of our leasing. In the first half of the year, we have leased 2.55 million square feet, of which 82% was generated from existing tenants. In addition, our mega campus offerings providing the ability to scale in a wide variety of amenities are the clear choice of high-quality companies. We spent considerable time during our G&A REIT meetings discussing supply and recently covered it in our white paper. The data presented in those meetings and the white paper was from the first quarter of '23, and we'll update it for you here. As a reminder, we perform robust on the ground, building-by-building analysis to identify and track new supply from high-quality projects we believe are competitive to ours in our high barrier to entry submarkets. We focus primarily on high barrier to entry markets and our brand mega campus offerings in AAA locations and operational excellence enables us to continually mine our vast, deep and loyal tenant base to drive our leasing activity, which will likely lessen the impact of generic supply. In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 1.6% of market inventory, a slight increase of 0.01% over last quarter. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 5%, a 0.3% reduction due to the lease-up of that inventory during the quarter. In San Francisco, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 6.6% of market inventory, which is unchanged. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 8.8%, a 0.3% reduction due to a downward revision of estimated square footage to be delivered during the year. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply remaining to be delivered in 2023 is estimated to be 3.5% of market inventory, which is a decrease of 0.8%, due mainly to projects being delivered with unleased space now reflected in direct vacancy. In 2024, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by 4.9%, a 0.4% reduction due in part to a pause conversion project and a decrease in scope of another one. Direct and sublease market vacancy for our core submarkets is updated as follows. Greater Boston direct vacancy stayed stable at 2.8%, but sublease vacancy increased by 1.5% to 5.4% for a net increase in available space and operation of 1.5%. San Francisco direct vacancy stayed stable at 2.3%, but sublease vacancy increased by 2.7% to a total of 6.2% for a net increase in available space and operation of 2.7%. San Diego direct vacancy increased from 4.1% to 4.8%, largely due to delivered unleased new supply, and sublease vacancy increased by 1.8% for a net increase in available space in operation of 2.5%. We are tracking new supply to be delivered in 2025, and we'll update you on those statistics next quarter. For our current read is that volume will be below 2024 deliveries, likely due to high construction costs, higher cost of capital, a lack of available debt financing and adequate supply currently under construction. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. We are quite proud and fortunate to own assets in a scarce asset class. As you all know, the past few months have had little transactional activity in the broad markets. But because of the attractiveness of our product type, Alexandria has been able to make great progress towards reaching our value harvesting goals. At quarter end, we had closed $701 million of sales, including the 15 Necco sale announced last quarter and have another $175 million pending for a total of $876 million, which is a little over halfway to our midpoint guidance. We have a number of other efforts in progress or soon to be launched that would exceed our guidance if we choose to execute on all of the opportunities. The vast majority of those identified assets are noncore non-campus assets we plan to fully dispose of and reinvest the proceeds into our value-add pipeline. Notable sales closed in the first quarter include the sale of 100% interest in 11119 North Torrey Pines Road for $86 million or $1,186 per square foot at a strong 4.6% cap rate. There is a significant mark-to-market on the asset when the lease expires in approximately 4.5 years, but a fair amount of capital will be needed to execute on that opportunity. This asset was a one-off for us, and there was no opportunity for us to aggregate a campus around it. We sold 20.1% of our joint venture interest in 9625 Towne Centre Drive, an asset jointly owned with an institutional partner who wanted to exit their position and initiated the sales process for their interest only. Given the strong demand for this University Towne Centre asset, we decided to participate in the sale, which captured $32 million in proceeds at a strong 4.5% cap rate, reflective of the high-quality building, tenant credit and the future mark-to-market opportunity we will participate in with our continued ownership. A portfolio of non-core assets inclusive of our Second Avenue assets in Waltham and our legacy non-mega campus affiliated 780 & 790 Memorial Drive asset located in Mid-Cambridge sold for $365.2 million or $852 per square foot at a combined cash cap rate of 5.2%, reflective of a mix of credit quality, some vacancy and term. We also completed the sale of pure office asset 275 Grocery in Newton, Massachusetts. Originally planned for conversion to lab as part of an assemblage of adjacent assets into a mega campus with green line access, the opportunity did not come to fruition. So, we made the prudent decision to sell this noncore office asset. The $214 per square foot price reflects its 70% occupancy. The negative sentiment of office buildings outside of cluster locations and a significant amount of capital needed to reposition the asset. Overall, we are very pleased with the results achieved thus far in our value harvesting asset recycling program. As mentioned, we have identified more than enough noncore opportunities to achieve our goals to fund our 2023 growth, primarily through dispositions. With that, I'll pass it over to Dean. We're going to market in a very targeted way so that we don't overdo it, if we don't need to. But if we end up with values that are highly attractive, we'll definitely consider selling that amount over what we need and apply that towards next year's program. Yes. Nick, it was very tempting to bring somebody in to complete the funding of that JV development just like we did at Necco. But at the end of the day, it is part of a mega campus. It is one of the best assets in likely in the world as far as long duration of value. And then reexamining our portfolio and seeing that we still had a number of assets that we could substitute and do just as well as far as getting the proceeds needed to fund our pipeline and just made it, much better story for us to keep 100% of that other development asset, sell the non-cores and really continue to improve our overall asset base towards concentrating it into mega campuses and lessening the one-off assets. Yes. So Michael, last quarter, in my prepared remarks, I had mentioned that we had seen a weakening in demand. And one of the positives that I pointed out in this quarter's comments is that we actually have had, I would call, a significant uptick, 15% to 20% in demand in our top three markets. That, coupled with some knowing financings that are happening, as companies have been getting good news, to me, it just feels like the wheel starting to turn again momentum is building, and I'm confident it's going to continue. Yes. I mean what's happening is -- and I touched on the theme of my comments, I think that uncertainty has really held back the entire economy. It has held back the life science industry, and that uncertainty is starting to go away and people are starting to realize that there's a lot of dry powder they need to put to work. So that -- we think that the investing of things that were not investing before, new company formation is going to occur, the science continues to move forward. When clinical milestones are met, we're seeing companies be able to raise a lot of money. And on top of that, we're seeing big pharma and biotech position themselves in our markets to grow. So that is what is giving us the positive outlook. With a couple of exceptions that are inexplicable, yes. We're not seeing much of anything new breaking ground, but there are some folks that have decided to move forward, which will be in the numbers for next quarter's update on '25. Yes. As far as the premium goes, Tom, our study indicates that it's about 20% more in net effective rent that you're going to get versus a one-off project. Companies are going to pay for the amenities and pay for the scalability and the desirability of the asset. What else did I not cover on your question there? Yes, I don't have the breakdown of each and every asset we're selling and what the mark-to-market is. But by and large, the best mark-to-market opportunities are in the mega campuses, and we are holding onto those assets. So what we are selling would be the one-offs that would not garner those types of premiums. Yes, you are correct. On the development side, new leases, tenants are conserving cash.

We need to put out in order to lease or renew that space."

            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our second quarter earnings call. Our one-of-a-kind company, which pioneered the lab space niche, continues to perform well in both good times and tough times, demonstrating the resiliency of our unique business model in our now post-pandemic world. In fact, COVID-19 really reaffirmed the sustained strength of our life science industry fundamentals and the need for our essential lab space infrastructure. This favorable backdrop for this nation's -- one of the nation's most mission-critical industries, which we serve, continues to underpin our business, driving demand for our world-class brand and highly differentiated assets and operations. I want to thank each and every member of the Alexandria family team for an operationally and financially excellent second quarter. A big shout out to the finance and accounting team for winning the 2023 NAREIT Gold Award awarded by NAREIT in June for the best REIT reporting and transparency, and amazingly, an unprecedented eighth award and most ever by any REIT. Alexandria is truly a best-in-class REIT, which pioneered the lab space niche and which I believe has made a metamorphic and innovative and transformational impact on our life science industry for the last 29 years. We're very proud of the stellar balance sheet we built since the days of the great financial crisis when we were a small and unrated REIT. Upon the closing of our $1 billion line of credit accordion add-on, one of the banks said of Alexandria \"Congratulations on the successful expansion of your credit facility to $5 billion.\" This is a significant accomplishment in any environment where many real estate owners are struggling to source debt capital. It is a testament to the strength, quality and endurance of the Alexandria platform. So let me turn to some highlights of the quarter. Dean will cover in detail, but I want to just give a little bit of perspective. The second quarter was a very strong reporting quarter, generally in line with our 5- and 10-year historical run rates, REIT financial metrics and certainly outside of the rocket ship performance during COVID. We had strong FFO per share growth in both the second quarter and the first half approximating 7%, especially in a continuing challenging macro and nicely beating consensus. Strong leasing quarter at 1.3 million rentable square feet ahead of the historical run rate of about 1.1 million square feet and NOI was up nicely, almost $200 million for the quarter. Positive rental growth, stable occupancy and solid same-store NOI increases also hosted. The continuing strength and I think overall solidity of our fortress balance sheet continues. Our ability to reiterate and maintain strong guidance, way, all the metrics should demonstrate our continuing confidence and our tenants demand for essential lab space, coupled with our ability to operate successfully in a moderately elevated supply dynamic environment. And then let me make a couple of comments on the life science industry, which Jenna will detail in just a moment, a couple of high-level observations. M&A, a critical part of the capital recycling, continues to increase mostly with bolt-on product deals, which is a good and positive sign. Series A rounds in 2023 so far have averaged about $60 million, an all-time high, and biologics, not surprisingly, have attracted the majority of early-stage investments. And with that kind of brief intro, let me turn it over to Jenna Foger. Any other question there? Yes. Maybe just a little more color, Tony. We have one new mega campus that we're entitling on the West Coast and one on the East Coast. And in both cases, we have, in one case, a current tenant, in the other case, a former tenant, have approached us to take a significant portion of those campuses. So, we're actively pushing entitlements and thinking about site design and all those things. But before we would kick something off, as Dean said, and as Peter said many times, we want to make sure that our spread to our cost of capital is sufficient and long-term IRRs to be certainly positive. Yes. And remember, Tony, too, and as we've pointed out before, COVID certainly enabled and caused a lot of companies to repatriate certain overseas processes back into the kind of the home lab and also with the much more sophisticated new modalities, cell therapy, gene therapy, et cetera. The enhancements and the complication of work environments have been expanded as well. So those are two kind of big macro forces that have made a big difference, say, over the last three to five years. Yes. I'm going to have -- this is Joel. I'll have Peter kind of respond to that. But I think about -- the Company has -- was a garage startup back in '94. So over many years as it kind of grew, grew its regions, we've had a variety of assets. We did not start a mega-campus strategy. We didn't start even a campus strategy. We couldn't even afford to go into Cambridge in those days. So the nature of a set of our assets really very, very solid workhorse assets in solid locations with solid tenants and with solid cash flows. Now as we move to this or as we've been moving over the last couple of years to this mega-campus strategy in core really high barrier to entry markets has enabled us to let go of those noncore assets. So that's kind of the fundamental frame. But Peter? Well, I think I'll have Jenna kind of give you her take on venture capital. But remember, we've returned to kind of the high run rates pre-COVID. So it still is healthy. What you've seen is a slower allocation and greater reserves just given the macro market. But Jenna, maybe some numbers. Yes. And remember the comment that I made, Series A, $60 million this year, all-time high, that's pretty astounding when you think about it. Yes. So Mike, I'll ask Peter to answer that in fact. But just keep in mind, the central thesis is the industry has been on a bull market tariff since maybe 2013, 2014 through early 2021. It was the longest biotech bull market that I've seen in -- since the days of Amgen and Genentech and Biogen when they were started late '70s, early '80s. So that says something. And then remember, the rocket ship years with the huge amount of funding and just activity of '21 and -- 2021 and into '22, and remember kind of the first quarter of '21, you saw the biotech index start to move. Now remember, biotech is a sub-segment of all of the life science, but it started to move as a leading indicator of the macro. But Peter? Yes. And I would say as a footnote, I know personally that there are a number of companies preparing for an IPO in 2024 and that just has not been possible over the last, say, except for extraordinarily rare exceptions on the public markets for the sector. That's a really good sign. I think people are looking at the Fed action maybe today or tomorrow. I forgot what day that is where they think it's kind of going to peak and obviously, the strength of activity, M&A and partnering has all had significant upticks. So that means pretty darn good activity. And I think Peter said or Jenna said, there's always clinical failures in all -- across all modalities and therapeutic classifications. But there's been some awfully good news these days in the diabetes and obesity area and the neurodegenerative area, ALS, which is one of our former directors had a young daughter who died of that disease. We're seeing some remarkable advancements here. Well, yes, this is Joel. Vikram, let me say maybe this regarding your first question. I think we probably don't want to say given just the proprietary nature of what we do and how we do it, talk too much about requirements. Some are sole-sourced RFPs. Some are broader RFPs. Some are existing tenants that come from our own tenant base that aren't in the markets. I don't think we want to make any comments, particularly about that. I think when it comes to leasing, we can only give you the best judgment we have based on Dean's affirmation of guidance both on -- when it comes to the issue of rental rates, occupancy, et cetera. We haven't given our view of 2024 yet. We will do that toward year-end. But I think it's fair to say that, remember, we've got a long history, and Peter cited some of the numbers of quarterly leasing. The vast majority of that comes from our own tenants. And so we have -- I think we have our finger on the pulse and ear to the ground in a way that very few people or groups could have. And I think that gives us the confidence that we can achieve our business plan for this year that by the way we articulated last November, and we'll do the same. I think beyond that, I'm not sure we can or want to give any further color. Yes. So I'll make a comment. Remember, Illumina still is a pioneer and a leader in their category. They did have an activist attack from icon regarding some management strategies kind of weirdly enough a lot to do about GRAIL, the EU and the FTC took issue with or Illumina acquiring GRAIL. Well, the weird thing is GRAIL was started and spun out of Illumina, and it made no sense, but yet here's an ideological kind of a thing going on. Illumina is as strong as ever. They have a -- they've got a lot of their market that they can still left to penetrate, but I'll ask Dan Ryan, who run San Diego and who's been very involved in Illumina that maybe give you a kind of a broad view of what's going on in their campus. Yes. The two sites that they announced, they were retrenching from were not owned by and operated by us. Yes. And I think we've historically said on a number of the asset sales we've had to date, a typical mark-to-market has been 15% to high 20%, somewhere in that range, which is pretty good. Yes. I would also say if you look at the bigger the credit and the bigger the Company, the landlord contribution to build out is not as essential. And in fact, the -- one of the big pharma buildouts that we're working on in one of the top markets, the contribution by the pharma is about $750 a foot. So, oftentimes, the configuration or triangulation or architecture of a deal oftentimes is based, to some extent, on credit and need to put in unusual situations, unusual features that only that tenant would want and that's -- that would be on the tenant's bill not something we would do. So that's something else you have to keep in mind. No, I don't think so. I think look historically at how we've grown, I'll ask Dean to comment, but then also think about over time, we have an asset base where we can almost double the size of the Company. So, I don't think we've reached any plateau in any way, shape or form. Yes, remember, a number of our acquisitions that happened over the last couple of years in Greater Boston involved and one was mentioned the whole Fenway area, existing vacancy that as part of, say, a conversion to first-time lab space and those give, I think, great opportunities for occupancy gains. Just want to say thank you, everybody, wishing you a great summer and look forward to our third quarter call."

            "name": "Jenna Foger",
            "content": "Thank you so much, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Jenna Foger, Senior Vice President and Co-Lead of our Science and Technology team here at Alexandria. Today, I'm going to comment on the solid fundamentals of the secularly growing life science industry, how these fundamentals contribute to the continued vitality and health of Alexandria's best-in-class life science tenant base and innovation as a long-term driver of life science industry growth. The secularly growing life science industry, which has an estimated market value of over $5 trillion and approximately $450 billion in estimated 2023 R&D funding, fuel is continuing demand for Alexandria's essential 24/7 lab space infrastructure across our cluster markets. This industry is driven by the achievement of scientific, clinical and commercial milestones and is not significantly impacted by market cyclicality nor by some of the macro trends impacting commodity REITs today. With over 10,000 diseases known to humankind and less than 10% addressable with current therapies, the incredible innovation taking place within our lab-based facilities is and will remain a national imperative. Taking a closer look at the health of our tenant base, beginning with multinational pharma, which makes up 17% of our ARR, this segment continues to operate from a position of strength. In 2022, biopharma deployed an estimated $267 billion into R&D, representing a 57% increase in biopharma R&D spend over the past 10 years, which is expected to continue to increase. Given the immense capital firepower on the balance sheets of large-cap pharma in excess of $300 billion and the healthy pressure on pharma to continue to pad its late-stage pipelines with sources of new revenue, there's been a significant uptick in M&A, as Joel mentioned. The first half of 2023 M&A deal value has already totaled $97 billion, surpassing total M&A transaction values for full years '21 and '22, pumping additional liquidity into the sector. We also see increased pharma partnering activity across our regional ecosystems as well. Transitioning to private venture-backed biotech, which makes up 10% of our total ARR, we continue to see healthy life science center activity with a significant $17.7 billion invested in the first half of 2023, which while down from the record pandemic period peak, life science venture activity remains quite strong by historic standards and in line with 2018 and 2019 levels. Given the record high years of venture fundraising by life science venture funds in '21 and '22, there is still plenty of dry powder to deploy of course, given the broader capital market context and a very narrow IPO window, venture capitalists are more discriminate, disciplined and demanding of new and future investments with the expectation that companies may need to stay private for longer. Private biotechs with tenured management teams, strong differentiated technologies and clear line of sight to value inflection milestones consistent with our own tenant underwriting selection criteria are the ones that continue to rise above the fray. As for public biotech, our public biotech tenants with marketed products make up 14% of our ARR and include companies such as Amgen, Gilead, Vertex and Moderna. This is also a very healthy segment of our tenant base with substantial revenues and continues to be a critical contributor to innovation and partnerships across our ecosystem. For our preclinical and clinical stage public biotech comprising 10% of our ARR, compelling clinical data remains king, and this segment of our tenant base continues to perform. Tenants such as Black Diamond, Medicine and Biomass Fusion to name a few have recently raised substantial follow-on public equity financing on the heels of promising clinical data. As we always have, our science and technology team continues to meticulously underwrite and monitor all of our tenants very closely. Notwithstanding in the process of developing novel medicines, there will always be some that fail in every type of macro market environment. And this is, of course, baked into our model. With a deep tenant base relationships across every facet of the industry and in each of our regional ecosystems and of course, the highest quality infrastructure and operations, we get ahead of potential tenant challenges to backfill and further enhance our tenant roster. Reflecting the health of our current tenant base in 2Q '23, tenant rent collections were at 99.9%, and we've already collected over 99.7% of July rent. Now a word on innovation, catalyzed by groundbreaking technologies, new modalities, massive unmet medical need and strong fundamentals, the life science industry remains uniquely positioned to tackle and solve our most persistent and major health care challenges. The emergence of a new golden age of biology only bolsters the strength and growth potential of this vital industry. In this new historic age, the FDA has approved over 450 new drugs over the past decade, and 2023 is on track to be a near all-time record high year of new drug approvals, starting the year off with over 60 PDUFA dates set on the FDA calendar to review new drug applications. Collectively reflecting the productivity and impact of the life science industry to bringing new medicines to patients, many of our tenants are at the forefront of this innovation. To name a few, Pfizer and GSK, each received new approvals this year for their respective RSV vaccines, an incredible feat given a long history of failed vaccine development in RSV. And Biogen's tofersen also received a Vanguard approval for ALS, a debilitating neurodegenerative treatment lacking current -- debilitating neurodegenerative disorder lacking current treatments. These trends reaffirm the fundamental truth Alexandria recognized nearly three decades ago. Our fully integrated mission-critical lab space infrastructure centered in core hubs of innovation is essential for our tenants to advance scientific discoveries and improve human health. Through every market cycle, Alexandria's tenants rely on a central lab-based infrastructure for the intended purpose to provide 24/7 compliant fully integrated and workflow optimized facilities to house, operate, advance and help safeguard in aggregate billions of dollars of scientific research, specialized equipment, pipeline programs and commercial assets. It is the advancement of this science and related intellectual property in Alexandria's lab space building that drives the utilization of and demand for space. Much like a data center that is constantly and consistently capturing and storing data throughput, the volume, velocity and value of the scientific throughput occurring in our spaces at any point in time is not correlated with the volume of people flowing in and out of our buildings and campuses. As such, a more relevant metric for measuring the utilization of Alexandria's lab space assets by our tenants is energy consumption. And we have seen consistent same-store electricity energy consumption -- same-store electricity consumption across Alexandria's lab space asset base today as we did in pre-pandemic years. Equally as important to note, within Alexandria's lab space assets, the laboratories and adjacent non-technical space cannot be decoupled. Each tenant base floor and building plan is fully integrated and intentionally designed to enable seamless workflows between laboratory and nontechnical spaces within the leased premises. Remember, the majority of tenant employees in our lab space assets interact with the science in the lab in some ways, including to conduct experiments, analyze and interpret data, plan new experiments, make business decisions about the data or engage in other related activities. This is the nature of life science companies research workflows, critical aspects of which clearly cannot be performed from home. And lastly, collaboration, collaboration is also fundamental to innovation and overall life science industry productivity and really critical for translating discoveries from academia into treatments, diagnostics and cures by biotech and pharma companies. It is also a key reason why 17 of the top 20 multinational biopharma's lease space from Alexandria across our regional markets to access this early innovation. And I point to the recent example from Verve and Lilly collaboration in Greater Boston, Pipeline Therapeutics and J&J collaboration in San Diego as two recent examples of collaboration across our campuses. Now given the proprietary and regulatory considerations, these collaborations are, of course, intentionally and tightly managed by executive teams and employees from one company are not wandering back and forth between discrete tenant spaces to collaborate ad hoc. Clearly, more or less people in a building or on a campus is really not correlated with more or less collaboration. So to wrap my comments, while today's broader macro environment will continue to warrant extreme prudence, it is an opportunity for the best life science companies reflected across Alexandria tenant base to benefit from the secularly growing life science industry solid fundamentals and to continue to advance the technologies and medicines that will bring the most value to patients. And with that, I pass it off to Peter. Tony, it's Jenna Foger over here. So, I guess a comment on that. So again, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, in our lab space assets, of course, the lab training on technical space cannot be decoupled. It -- historically, we've seen about a 50-50 split between the lab and the nontechnical space. In some cases, we're seeing it kind of go up a bit to 55% or 60% lab that's mostly attributable to platform companies kind of prosecuting multiple platforms and pipeline programs at once. But yes, I guess that's probably a high level thing. Yes, that's absolutely true. So as I mentioned in my comments, we've seen in 1H '23 so far about $17.7 billion. So this is right on -- in line, if not slightly above 2018, 2019 levels, and this is really across our market, obviously, with Greater Boston being kind of the center of life science activity. So kind of leading the chart, but we are kind of seeing this across our ecosystem. And again, as Joel mentioned, I mean, there's been a disciplined allocation of capital as we see a potential opening maybe a little bit towards the end of the year but into next year in the IPO window and then kind of a rationalization of follow-on financings on the public side. We're seeing also that kind of trickle down to a venture in terms of the pace increasing, but certainly no dearth of investment opportunities to be had. And like I mentioned in my comments, with '21, '22 and even kind of early '23 life science center fundraising, really being at all-time highs, there continues to be dry powder to deploy."

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported very solid operating and financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023. Total revenues for the second quarter were $713.9 million, up 10.9% over the second quarter of 2022. NOI was up 12.2% over the second quarter of 2022, driven primarily by the commencement of $58 million of annual net operating income related to the 387,000 rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that were placed in service in the second quarter. The significant NOI growth from completion of pipeline projects was the key driver of our outperformance this quarter in comparison to consensus. Additionally, we slightly beat other key line items relative to consensus. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was $2.24, up 6.7% over the second quarter of 2022, and we're on track to generate another solid year of growth in FFO per share growth of 6.4% at the midpoint of our guidance for the year. Now high-quality life science entities continue to appreciate our brand mega-campus strategy and operational excellence by our team. 49% of our annual rental revenue is generated from investment-grade or large-cap publicly traded tenants, and this statistic represents one of the highest quality client rosters in the REIT industry today. Our collections remain very high at 99.9%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin remains very strong at 70%. Same-property NOI growth was very solid and in line with guidance for the full year. Same property results for the second quarter were 3%, up 3% and up 4.9% on a cash basis, and for the first half of the year, up 3.4% and up 6.5% on a cash basis. As a reminder, our outlook for 2023 same-property NOI growth remains very solid at a midpoint of 3% and 5% on a cash basis. Now turning to leasing. Quarterly leasing results are driven by a relatively small volume of and mix of transactions that drive the overall rental rate growth related to lease renewals and re-leasing the space. Now for the second quarter, leasing volume was 1.3 million rentable square feet, and rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-lease in the space was up 16.6% and 8.3% on a cash basis. Now rental rate growth for the second quarter was driven by transactions based out of the Seattle region, Maryland and Research Triangle in comparison to record rental rate growth in the first quarter of 48.3% and 24.2% on a cash basis, which was driven by transactions out of Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. Our outlook for rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing space remained solid at the midpoint of 30.5% and 14.5% on a cash basis. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to in-place leases for the entire asset base remains very strong at 19%. Now capital expenditures generally fall into two key categories. The first category is focused on development and redevelopment. And redevelopment specifically is the first time conversion of non-lab space to lab space through redevelopment. Now the second category is nonrevenue-enhancing capital expenditures. And our nonrevenue-enhancing capital expenditures over the last five years have averaged 15% of net operating income and has been trending lower for 2022 at 13%. For 2023, this is closer to 10% based upon the second quarter '23 net operating income on an annualized basis. Tenant improvement allowances related to lease renewals and re-leasing the space have been very modest at about $16 per square foot for the first half of the year, and these costs are included in the nonrevenue-enhancing capital expenditures that I mentioned earlier. Second quarter occupancy was in line with expectations at 93.6%, consistent with first quarter occupancy. Our outlook for 2023 reflects flat occupancy from the second quarter to the third quarter and occupancy growth in the fourth quarter. The midpoint of occupancy guidance is 95.1%, and occupancy as of June 30 of 93.6% included vacancy of 2.2% or approximately 900,000 rentable square feet from properties that were recently acquired in 2021 and 2022. Now 23% of the recently acquired vacancy is already -- has already been leased and will be ready for occupancy over the next number of quarters and an additional 14% is under negotiation. Now a huge thank you to Marc Binda and his entire team and our important relationship lenders under our $5 billion line of credit. During the quarter, we increased aggregate commitments available under our line of credit to $5 billion, up from $4 billion. Now this has allowed us to increase liquidity on our balance sheet to over $6.3 billion as of June 30. Now during the first half of '23, we had remained very flexible with our strategy and pivoted toward outright dispositions versus sales of partial interest. Our team has made excellent progress on dispositions and sales of partial interest for the first half of the year and are working on a number of transactions for the second half focused primarily on outright dispositions. There are more details on Page 7 of our supplemental package for your reference. Now turning to consistent growth in dividends from our high-quality cash flows. We have a low and conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for the second quarter annualized with 5.2% increase in common stock dividends over the last 12 months. We're projecting $375 million, representing a three-year run rate of over $1.1 billion in net cash flows from operating activities after dividends for reinvestment. Turning to venture investments. Realized gains from our venture investments included in FFO for the second quarter was $22.5 million and has averaged about $25 million per quarter for the last eight quarters. Gross unrealized gains on our venture investments as of June 30 were $373 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. Now on external growth, we have $605 million of incremental net operating income from our pipeline of 6.7 million rentable square feet. Now projects aggregating 3.7 million rentable square feet is expected to reach stabilization in 2020 -- in the remainder of 2023 and 2024. And these projects are 94% leased and will generate $277 million of incremental net operating income. Additionally, we have another 3.7 million rentable square feet that is expected to reach stabilization after 2024 and will generate another $328 million of incremental net operating income. Turning to guidance, our detailed updated underlying guidance assumptions are disclosed beginning on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Our per share outlook for 2023 was updated to a range plus or minus $0.03 from the midpoint of guidance down from a range plus or minus $0.05 last quarter. Now our range of guidance for EPS is from $2.72 to $2.78 and our range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $8.93 to $8.99 with no change in the midpoint of $8.96. Now this represents a strong 6.4% growth in FFO per share following excellent growth last year of 8.5%. Our strategy for dispositions and sales of partial interest for 2023 reflects our focus on enhancement of our overall asset base through outright disposition of properties no longer integral to our mega-campus strategy with fewer sales of partial interest. Now this is reflected in the transactions we have completed to date in 2023 and our target transactions for the second half of the year. This strategy did result in an update to sources and uses of capital due to the replacement of a potential sale of a partial interest with an outright sale of properties. Now while this change did not result in a change in gross construction spend, it did reduce funding for construction spend by a potential JV partner that was replaced with funding from an additional $225 million in dispositions of real estate. Let me stop there and turn it back over to Joel to open it up for questions. Sure, Steve. So the growth in occupancy anticipated in the fourth quarter, some of it is from signed leases. We have about 400,000 square feet of executed leases that will commence in time for the occupancy growth by the end of the year. That includes some of the spaces that I mentioned in the recently acquired vacancy. We also anticipate some leasing activity that we need to complete in order to drive that occupancy growth. And then we also have some key spaces being delivered out of our development pipeline, which by the time they're delivered should be pretty much close to 100% leased. And that doesn't have quite the same impact of delivering space to tenants out of the operating portfolio, but there is a slight benefit from that as well. I don't have that figure right at my fingertips, Steve. But look, if you look at our volume of leasing activity that we've averaged pre -- the record period of leasing in '21 and 2022, we're back to that run rate of leasing activity on a quarterly basis, which is 1.2 million, 1.3 million rentable square feet. A portion of that, as you know, comes out of the value creation pipeline development and redevelopment and previously vacant stuff. So, our run rate on renewals and re-leasing the space is probably, on average, about 1 million square feet per quarter; and only a portion of that is stuff that we need to complete related to fourth quarter deliveries. As you can imagine, most space, probably for any real estate company, sometimes it's ready for delivery immediately, but only a portion of that -- of that 1 million square feet can actually be delivered that quickly. So, it's not a big number, Steve. But to be fair, we do have to get some leasing done. And so we've got to work through that opportunity. Sure, Steve. So this is a pretty good example of space that we opportunistically took back in the second quarter. The background for this tenant, there was an in-place lease related to an acquisition that we completed in January of 2021. Toast was at 401 Park in the Fenway submarket for reference. And during our due diligence for the acquisition, our team had identified multiple floors of this office building that will be suited for conversion to lab space through redevelopment. These floors were targeted for redevelopment. Obviously, after our successful lease-up of 201 Brookline, now if you remember, 201 Brookline that was a development site at the Fenway campus that the seller had commenced construction on, and it was only 20% pre-leased at the time we acquired it. Our team quickly leased the remainder of that project -- the construction development project at rental rates that were well exceeded our initial underwriting. And so when we had the opportunity to take back space from Toast, I think it was about 133,000 rentable square feet in total. We're going to get about 111,000 rental square feet back in 3Q here to commence our redevelopment. And the remaining 22,000 rentable square feet we get back at the end of 2024. The bottom line, the way to think about this arrangement we entered into with Toast is that net of the write-off of deferred rent, we'll earn the remaining of the revenue from Toast overtime. And this really covers the quarterly rent that was due to rent Toast about 1.59 a quarter. And so, this arrangement allows us to earn our revenue through the end of 2024. And the way to think about this is the net benefit we're going to earn is a slight pickup relative to the prior run rate rent. So for 2023, we might pick up about $2 million in FFO. And then in 2024, there's a similar expected benefit of a couple of million bucks or so. The key takeaway is that we were able to move up the timing of new lab space at 401 Park after our successful lease up of 201 Brookline. And so, we were excited to be able to get access to that earlier to start the redevelopment sooner than later. Can you clarify, were you asking about occupancy or rental rate growth? So, our outlook -- just to remind everybody, our outlook for rental rate growth for 2023 is a range of 28% to 30%, call it, a midpoint of 28.5%, 12% to 17% with a midpoint of 14.5% on a cash basis. Our rental rate growth for the first quarter, just to remind everybody, was pretty record at 48% and 24% on a cash basis. And most of that was driven by Greater Boston, San Francisco, Bay Area and Seattle. It's important to recognize that the second quarter was a very different subset geographically, which consisted primarily of Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle. When you think about rental rate growth of 16% -- 16.6% on a GAAP basis, 8.3% on a cash basis, that's pretty outstanding in this type of market and when you think across the REIT sector today. So we're very pleased with the rental rate growth that we actually delivered on the quarter and feel comfortable as we look out that we're on track to hit the range of guidance that we gave. What gives us that comfort? I think you've heard us talk about we have a unique brand our mega-campus strategy and our operational excellence, I think, puts us at an advantage to capture opportunities in the marketplace. Well, we're only 3 weeks or 3.5 weeks after quarter end. So, there's very little activity relative to what we're going to sign for the full six months as we look forward. So you'll have to stay tuned. Tony, it's Dean here. Yes, so 19% is our current outlook for where we are today on the mark-to-market. Last quarter, you're correct, it was 22%. The quarter before that was 24% and the quarter before that was 27%. So, we have made our way through some of the mark-to-market with leases that we've executed over the last number of quarters. So, it's primarily driven by that, maybe a slight adjustment here and there on our outlook on specific spaces. But most of the move is related to actual leases we've executed. So Tony, let me start with your first part of your question on the exploration front. What we're really looking at is if you look at 2024 as an example, we do have a number of spaces that are coming up for contractual exploration. And keep in mind, these are all related for the most part to recently acquired opportunities where we saw. In this case, these projects have in-place leases and from acquisition that are burning off here. Only a portion of that overall number is something that we expect to actually tackle in the near term. It's roughly -- it's about 684,000 square feet of that is actually development opportunities for the future. So 1.1 -- 1.2 million is expiring in '24 that's been targeted for future development and redevelopment, but 684,000 of that is future development. And that's not going to start immediately on vertical construction because it needs to go through entitlements, design, possibly some site work, and these are really associated with mega campus opportunities. The remainder of that, so roughly 400,000 square feet or so, 400,000 to 500,000 square feet is redevelopment opportunities. Those are more near-term speed to market, less time to build out the projects, and we'll look at those. But our current view as we sit here today would be there's potential to start those because of opportunities we can tackle. So, the number is much smaller. As far as your other question, Tony, how do we look at it? I think you're going to find that we need to remain very disciplined with our approach to new redevelopment and development projects given the macro environment. We're going to focus primarily on projects that are concentrated in our mega campuses, and we really have well-located land for future development. It's important to keep in mind we have the flexibility and not the requirement to address these expansions -- expansion needs from our clients. And maybe as you think about development opportunities on our future pipeline, it's important to recognize that we are going to continue to advance preconstruction activities on the future pipeline projects. Entitlements for large campuses -- mega campuses, it require years to fully entitled. They require design. And oftentimes, the sites are so large, they do require infrastructure before we can actually commence vertical construction. And these preconstruction activities add value to the sites ultimately reduce the time from commencement of vertical construction to delivery a Class A space to our clients. So again, just getting back to where we started with your question, Tony, we'll have to remain very disciplined in our approach, given the macro environment. So Nick, the way to think about the arrangement with Toast is that what was -- the total consideration was something in that $15 million range. The deferred rent number was written down to take that down. I don't have it right in front of me, but $5 million to $6 million or something in that range. The net number is earned out over time effectively replaces rent or cash flows that were in place prior to that arrangement with Toast. And so net-net, at least through 2024, there's very little upside. Like I mentioned, it's a couple million bucks in each year. So, it's not really changing net FFO in any big way. So, in response to your specific question, was the revenue that we're going to generate from the lease with Toast in guidance? It was because it was already a lease in our business. Remember this building was acquired with the lease in place back in 2021. What did change for 2023, a couple of million dollar pickup to FFO. Not as it relates to NOI, Vikram. I think that was just a timing difference. I can't speak to the various sell-side models on what drove the timing differences. But from our view of the world, our deliveries were, by and large, on track with our expectations. So that doesn't translate to upside there. And there were -- that wasn't the only line item that there was a variance on. If you look across consensus, there were some other line items. I think the G&A is an example. We are lower on G&A than consensus across coverage. But the key driver was that the NOI line item. Yes, it's Dean here, Dylan. I agree. You've seen occupancy in our asset base the way we manage our business have really strong relationships with our tenants and really deliver a level of excellence in operating our buildings. Our occupancy can grow to 300 basis points from or more than that above our bogey -- 200 or 300 above our midpoint bogey for the end of '23. So at 95.1% is the midpoint you referenced. I mean we've been in the 98% occupancy range. So there's plenty of room to grow there. And as Joel had also mentioned and as you guys are well aware, our pipeline is set to bring on a tremendous amount of NOI and that gives you visibility all the way into '25 and a little bit going up to '26 now."

Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to Alexandria's first quarter '23 Earnings Call. With me today are Peter, Dean, Hallie and Dan. And first of all, I want to send a big thank you to our entire, ARE family team for an operationally and financially strong first quarter in a tough -- continuing tough macro environment. As you know, Alexandria is truly a one-of-a-kind S&P 500 company. And we're very pleased that we just received new -- one of Newsweek's most trusted company awards. We have no peers. We're kind of a pure play. In our field, we first identified and pioneered the lab space niche back in 1994 and then through our disciplined execution of our original vision using the strategic architecture of our cluster model, which we customize to the life science industry. We have brought the mission-critical real estate infrastructure of the life science industry and integrated it with an unparalleled and world-class 24/7 operational excellence service component aimed to protect the hundreds of billions of dollars of leading-edge science, which is conducted 24/7 within our asset base. And we have brought this to a highly respected and recognized real estate product type today. Alexandria is definitely not a health care service facilities company nor a generic office company. Our disciplined core focus is our patented and trademark lab space. It's a premium priced, non-commodity product generally characterized by high barrier to entry markets, where we have a dominant franchise and where we exercise pricing power, especially in our highly sought after Alexandria-branded mega campuses, and those markets exhibit deep science base, deep life science talent base, a rich abundance of risk capital and also are ones that are generally safe and have excellent transportation access. And what we saw in 1994 in the embryonic days of the life science industry is multiplied geometrically today, 30 years later, as Steve Jobs said, the 21st century will be the century of the intersection of biology and technology innovation. We have 10,000 known diseases wreaking havoc on human beings each and every day and the personal and economic cost of sickness, illness and today, the mental health crisis is continuing to skyrocket. Continued innovation in medicine is an absolute national priority and the transformative work of our tenants in the industry is critical to addressing the massive unmet medical need. Literally every day, we hear of great progress. And today, for example, one of our Greater Boston tenants, Morphic Therapeutic which has an oral drug addressing moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. And if you've ever had it, it is a tough condition, a major GI indication announced that it hit its Phase 2a clinical trial endpoint and their stock has been up 75% this year. The 10 most prevalent diseases in the U.S., heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, obesity, Alzheimer's, diabetes, substance abuse, infectious disease, chronic kidney disease and mental illness are not being solved to-date. We have a large mountain decline, and the industry is really in its formative days. Weathering a tough macro environment, ARE posted a very solid first quarter. Our funds FFO per share is up 7%, as you see in revenues, top line revenue is up almost 14%. And Dean will go into the metrics, but almost 100% collections, which is -- bodes well for our continued strength and stability of the Company. We've maintained strong while lowering uses and sources of capital. We've had very solid leasing with the highest-ever rental rate increase, and we've had continuing strong operating and EBITDA margins. All stakeholders should recognize and appreciate this management team took a highly disciplined approach over a multiyear period to create a fortress balance sheet to successfully weather what now is the current self-inflected economic storm by the various policies that we implemented over the last many years. We have taken judicious measure to cut our CapEx, while at the same time, making strong progress on our funding plan for 2023, and you'll hear more about that from Peter. So without any further hesitation, let me turn it over to Hallie, who's going to give you some bird's-eye view of our view on the life science industry. So, Hallie?\nHallie Kuhn: Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, Senior Vice President of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to comment on the life science industry following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The health of ARE's best-in-class life science tenant base and innovation is a long-term driver of life science industry growth. Beginning with SVB, there remains some misperceptions on the long-term impact of its collapse on the life science industry. SVB certainly was a go-to provider for banking needs of many venture-backed companies, particularly in the tech industry. And while SVB has created a niche serving the segment, it was also cultural. Early-stage start-ups work within a very tightened community and many used SVB because that's what everyone else used, not necessarily because there were no other options. And many banks, including G-SIBs have been working for years to carve out their own share of this market. For our own private biotech tenants in the days following the collapse, we had conversations with over 100 companies. Some of which use SVB, but many of which did not or had multiple banking relationships. Importantly, within approximately 72 hours from the start of the bank run, companies had access to all deposits and the near-term risks such as making payroll were mitigated. As for long-term risk driven by instability of regional banks, unlike some tech companies that maintain significant cash and deposit accounts, our tenants largely rely on safer third-party custodial and sweep accounts to minimize cash deposits. Biotech is also not reliant on venture debt to the same extent as the tech industry. And for those that do seek venture debt, SVB is by no means the only option. We expect that the life science sector will be minimally affected going forward as evidenced by venture financing rounds that closed in March is expected and continue to do so in April, which I'll touch on in more detail shortly. Before transitioning to the health of our tenant base, one quick reminder on the differentiation of our life science real estate product from traditional office, importantly, the office component of our life science buildings directly supports researchers in the lab. A scientist does not spend all day at the bench, but spends time moving back and forth between lab and adjacent office in order to, for example, analyze data, plan the next set of experiments and meet with colleagues. Thus, the office component cannot be broken out or compared to traditional office, but is an adjacent, highly integrated and critical component of laboratory design and workflows. Of course, this is also not work that can be done from home. Now transitioning to the health of our world-class diverse life science tenant base, perhaps the best way to frame the current environment is the old adage in God we trust all else spring data. Starting with pharma, which makes up 18% of our ARR, this segment continues to operate from a position of strength with strong balance sheet and significant free cash flows, pharma is less sensitive to rising rates. In 2022, biopharma deployed an estimated $267 billion into R&D. The result is tenants like Eli Lilly that continue to translate this R&D into transformative medicines. Mounjaro, which aims to treat obesity in type 2 diabetes, is predicted to eclipse $50 billion per year globally in revenue. And to put this in perspective, nearly one out of every $4 of U.S. health care spend is deployed to care for people with diabetes. And obesity is estimated to account for over $480 billion in direct health care costs in the U.S. with an additional $1.2 trillion in indirect costs due to lost economic productivity. To that end, therapies such as Mounjaro, save and extend lives and have the potential to significantly drive down the cost of health care more broadly. Transitioning to private venture-backed biotech which makes up 8% of our total ARR, we continue to see a reset of venture deployment to pre-2020, 2021 levels, which while down from peak remains strong by historic standards. Venture capitalists are more discriminate, disciplined and demanding of current and future investments. And the companies with tenured management teams and strong differentiated technologies and near-term value inflection milestones are the ones that rise above the fray. We continue to underwrite and monitor all tenants closely, and our private biotech tenants remain compared to the broader market. In fact, across this tenant base, they have raised over $1.9 billion from BC and pharma partnerships since the beginning of the year, of which $800 million has closed following the collapse of SVB. As a testament to this point, with the week remaining in April, private biotech tenant rent collection is at 99.7%. Next to public biotech, our tenants with marketed products make up 14% of our ARR generated $150 billion in revenue in 2022 and include names such as Amgen, Gilead, Vertex and Moderna. Moderna continues to highlight the potential of novel platforms to deliver innovative new medicines to patients. This month, the Company's personalized mRNA cancer vaccine in combination with an immunotherapy drug from tenant Merck, demonstrated promising clinical trial results in aggressive forms of skin cancer. Companies also continue to set high bars for continued innovation and product launches. For example, Alexandria tenant Gilead has laid out an ambitious plan to achieve 20 new drug approvals by 2030, which will entail advancement of their current pipeline, particularly in oncology, supplemented by additional M&A. For our preclinical and clinical stage public biotechs comprising 10% of our ARR, compelling clinical data remains king. Tenants such as [indiscernible] and Biomea Fusion, for example, have recently raised additional capital of promising clinical data. Prometheus Biosciences, while not a tenant exemplify how data drives the lifeblood of the industry. The Company announced stellar data in December, driving their stock up over 600% in the past 12 months and culminating in a $10.8 billion acquisition by Merck. To be clear, in the process of developing novel medicines, there will always be some that fail no matter what the market conditions. But this is baked into our mall. With the deep tenant base, relationships across every facet of the industry, and the highest quality space in operations, we can get ahead of potential tenant challenges to backfill and further optimize our tenant base. Reflecting this, in April, we've collected 100% rent from our preclinical and clinical stage public biotech tenants. Next, transitioning to academic and institutional tenants, which constitute 12% of our ARR, it's an opportunity to remember that the life science industry's cornerstone is innovation, which is not slowing. Bipartisan support for life science research remains strong. At $47.5 billion, the NIH's 2023 budget is a 21% increase over 2019. The Academic and medical institutions continue to be highly productive, a key metric being the pace of new intellectual property. In 2021, U.S. academic institutions accounted for 20,000 invention disclosures and nearly 1,000 new startups. And this activity in return is an important long-term funding mechanism for these institutions. For example, for Prometheus Bio was originally spun out of Cedars-Sinai, which is set to receive nearly $800 million from the recently announced M&A. In sum, with the majority of our academic and institutional ARR from investment-grade tenants and funding cycles that are based on multiyear grant funding time lines, this segment continues to be sheltered from larger macroeconomic conditions. Staying on the topic of innovation, a few final data points to orient the growth of the life science industry beyond the next few quarters but to the decades to come. According to the American Society of Cell and Gene Therapy, there are over 3,700 gene cell and RNA therapies in preclinical and clinical development. For chronic diseases, which drives the bulk of health care spend in the United States, there are over 800 medicines in clinical development. The culmination is continued FDA approvals and 2023 has started at a fast clip. Year-to-date, 14 novel therapies have been approved including a novel therapy for ALS developed by Tenant Biogen just announced this morning. And altogether for the year, nearly 60 novel medicines have been scheduled for FDA approval review which mirrors 2018's record year of 59 novel FDA approvals. To end, I want to reiterate that we are acutely aware of the years of abundance and easy capital that have passed and that the separation of haves and have-nots will continue to widen as the industry drills down on the technologies and medicines that bring the most value to patients and investors. But as Winston Churchill once said, \"Never let a good crisis go to waste.\" While this market is and will continue to warrant extreme prudence, it is an opportunity for the best companies to hone in on their long-term fundamentals and thrive. And that's what our tenants and Alexandria exemplify. With that, I'll pass it off to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thanks, Hallie. I just had my 25th anniversary with the Company, In addition to that milestone reminding me of how fast time moves by brought about a nostalgic look back at my time at Alexandria. I recall my interview with Joel, where I learned about this novel idea of forming a real estate company to serve the life science industry, which made me both nervous as nobody had ever done it before and equally inspired to help enable an industry that was hell bent on changing the world. After serious contemplation, I decided that if I was going to make it different in the world, this was a heck of an opportunity to do it. Plus after having been in real estate for about eight years at that point, I could see a tremendous value in offering mission-critical facilities over commodity product. I could not have made a better decision as it all proved out. Alexandria has played a critical role in the evolution of the life science industry over the last three decades by creating and growing the ecosystems and clusters that ignite and accelerate the world's leading innovators in their pursuit to advanced human health, which is our solid mission. In addition, we've built an irreplaceable world-class asset base of robust and highly differentiated properties and campuses that attract a diversified best-in-class tenant base who values our expertise and operational excellence by providing 75% to 85% of our leasing quarter-to-quarter. The result of all this is we have built a brand without here that puts us in a position where we don't rely on third parties to bring us tenants. They come to us directly as we are a trusted partner with a long successful track record of developing and operating mission-critical facilities. This is an important distinction in any part of the cycle, but perhaps even more when things have slowed down. Our results prove it out. Thank you for indulging me on that retrospective. I'm going to go and briefly touch on our development pipeline, construction costs, leasing and asset sales and then hand it over to Dean. In the first quarter, we delivered 453,511 square feet in five projects into our high barrier to entry submarkets. Annual NOI for these deliveries totals $23 million, and the initial stabilized yield is strong at 7.3%. At quarter end, projects under construction and near-term projects expected to commence construction over the next four quarters totaled 7.6 million square feet and are 74% leased or under negotiation. This is very similar to last quarter, but in response to the uncertainty and volatility in the markets, we have made a strategic decision to reduce 2023 construction spend by $250 million by pausing or delaying projects that had been classified as under construction, so we can focus our capital on the most strategic projects that have the most attractive terms, enabling our highly bedded and vast tenant base. The reduction in spend results in NOI from deliveries primarily commencing from the second quarter of '23 through the first quarter of '26 to be approximately $610 million. After commenting on construction costs for the past two years, I can still say they remain volatile but are on their way to stabilizing. The availability and price of commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum and concrete, continue to fluctuate due to shortages of raw materials, low yields for mines, high demand from electrification or low capability utilization rates in the mills and fabrication shops due to labor shortages. Cost of materials and supply chain volatility were the initial drivers of construction inflation, but now the primary driver is labor with a triple whammy of wage increases, shortage of workers and the inefficiency of the remaining labor force due to the retirement of older, more skilled labor. There are 330,000 open construction jobs today and the time it takes to train the new entrants to be highly skilled as measured in years. So these inefficiencies will be with us for a while. Specific to life science buildings, the availability of switchgear and equipment such as HVAC units and generators are -- has slightly improved but their lead times are still extraordinarily long with custom air handlers taking 27 weeks longer to get than before COVID and switch gear and generators and astounding 64 weeks longer. Even worse is the availability of large transformers provided by the utility companies, which can take as long as three years now to get. What's driving these delays are chip shortages and demand from electrification projects happening all over the world as investors, governments and end users demand improvement in carbon emissions. As you can imagine, the cost of this equipment is reflective of these shortages and paired with high labor cost is making new laboratory office projects more expensive to build than ever before. The upside for us is that 84% of our costs for our active development and redevelopment projects are under GMP or other fixed contracts with contingencies behind that. So, we are largely locked in. Anyone contemplating a speculative development these days will have to contend with these delays and associated high costs, which will put the feasibility of building and financing the project at considerable risk. One reason, we will likely not see the supply many are expecting beyond what is under construction today. Transitioning to leasing, our strong brand loyalty, mega campus offerings and operational excellence continue to drive strong leasing numbers in a challenging market. The 1.2 million square feet leased in the first quarter is above our five-year pre-2021 average and is the 12th consecutive quarter with leasing volume above 1 million square feet. We achieved attractive economics primarily from our vast tenant base, accounting for 85% of the leasing this quarter, resulting in a rental rate increase of 48.3%, which was the highest in company history and a strong cash rate of 24.2%. As we have noted previously, demand has normalized from the record year of 2021. Depending on who you ask, demand is at slightly below or slightly above pre-COVID levels. There are less tenants actively seeking space in the market today, which we believe is being significantly driven by uncertainty in the economy. As Hallie put it, this market is and will continue to warrant extreme prudence. However, we're not dependent at all on broker deal flow. There are pending opportunities from our tenant base that the broader market likely does not see due to our direct relationships with company management teams. Such relationships are a huge differentiator for us and will continue to drive solid leasing even in tough environments. Some private and preclinical clinical stage companies are making do with the space they have today until they can better understand their ability to raise capital on its cost. Capital is available. But as Hallie mentioned, BCs are more discriminate disciplined in demanding of future investments and companies with tenured management teams, strong differentiated technologies and near-term value inflection milestones are the ones that will rise above the fray. Those are the halves who by and large are Alexandria's tenants, which we have underwritten and placed into our world-class asset base, differentiated from the have nots tenant base of others who take on any tenant that can fill space with hope as their underwriting strategy. On the supply side, we track high-quality projects, we believe, are competitive to ours in the high barrier-to-entry submarkets. Accordingly, we're tracking direct vacancy in Greater Boston to be 2.8%. On lease sublease space is at 3.9% and unleased directly competitive with our AAA locations and building quality to be 1.5% to be delivered in 2023 and 5.1% to be delivered in 2024, a 1.3% total increase in availability from last quarter. In San Francisco, direct vacancy is 3.5% and sublease space is at 5.8% and unleased supply directly competitive with our assets continues to be the highest in all of our markets at 6.6% and 8.9% to be delivered in '23 and '24, respectively. This is an increase of 3.4% in total availability over last quarter, largely driven by spec building in South San Francisco. In San Diego, direct vacancy is at 4.1%, sublease space is at 2.3% and unleased competitive supply is 3.2% in 2023 and 5.4% in 2024, a slight increase of 0.2% over last quarter. Supply in all submarkets is very likely to be muted beyond what is under construction today due to high construction costs that I referenced, higher cost of capital and the lessening of generic tenant demand. We focus primarily on high barrier-to-entry markets where supply is inherently limited. We focus primarily on high barrier to entry markets and brand mega-campus offerings in those AAA high barrier to entry market locations and operational excellence enables us to continually mine our vast and deep tenant base to drive our leasing activity, which will likely lessen the impact of generic supply. I'll end with some commentary on our value harvesting and recycling progress. As we all know, the rapid rise in interest rates have not only increased investors' cost of capital but created a lot of uncertainty causing a number of investors to remain on the sidelines. Adding to the difficulty to execute in this environment is the increasing desperation of a number of office building owners trying to raise cash to stay afloat by offering quality long-term leased assets with credit tenants at 6.5% to 7.5% cap rates. Despite these challenges, the demand for high-quality life science assets which is vastly different from office assets continued in the quarter. As noted in our press release, we were pleased to transfer an 18% interest in our current JV at 15 Necco which we control and owned 90% prior to the sale. The asset is under construction and will not be delivered until the end of this year with cash flow commencing in mid-2024. The buyer will fund the remaining construction costs to deliver the property to our tenant until they reach a 37% ownership, which is expected to be the remainder of the cost to deliver the project. Given that the receipt of cash flow is over a year away, it's difficult to translate the valuation to an operating cap rate. But to give you some color, the parties agreed to evaluation at closing to be $576 million or $1,665 per square foot, which is an initial yield of 5.25% on their investment based on in-place NOI at closing. But we also agreed to credit our partner $5.5 million in fees payable. Because we sold 33% of the total 37% our partner purchased those fees equate to approximately $15 million in value. Stripping that $15 million from the purchase price gets you to a total valuation of $561 million increasing the cap rate to 5.4%. If you want to tie that to the supplemental, the $66 million price for the 18%. And the other -- if you add the other $119 million to be funded to completion and divide it by the 33% we sold, you get $561 million. This was a great outcome for Alexandria as we were able to partner with a world-class investor to monetize the value creation and secure the capital for the remaining spend in an accretive manner while retaining control of the asset and all management fees. We have not yet closed on the other transaction we signed an LOI on in the fourth quarter, but we expect to do so in the second quarter. In addition to this transaction, we have signed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements for a number of assets, including the office campus referenced in the press release, aggregating to a total sales price of $799.3 million. These future transactions and 15 Necco account for approximately 57% of the progress needed to meet the midpoint of our disposition guidance. With that, I'm going to hand it over to Dean.\nDean Shigenaga: Thanks Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported excellent operating and financial results that exceeded consensus with strong core results, and our team is off to a strong start towards a solid growth for 2023. Our client tenants continued very timely payment of rent year-to-date through April. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have meaningfully reduced uses of capital for 2023, made excellent progress on dispositions and sales of partial interest, have a conservative FFO payout ratio and a growing dividend and are the go-to brand for life science real estate. We have a very strong balance sheet with $5.3 billion in liquidity, no debt maturities until 2025. Our team made excellent progress on our dispositions and sales of partial interest only four months into 2023. As Peter highlighted, we've advanced transactions aggregating $865 million. They're either completed or subject to executed LOIs or purchase and sales agreements, including the new JV partner for our build-to-suit project for UI Lilly. Many of the in-process transactions are targeted to close on or about June 30. Now we have also identified other dispositions and sales of partial interest to bring our total for the year to $1.5 billion. While the macro environment remains challenging, we are reasonably optimistic that we can execute on our disposition plan in 2023 at attractive values and cap rates. We will provide values and cap rates quarter-to-quarter as we close transactions since we're unable to do so sooner while transactions are in process. In addition to the $1.5 billion in dispositions and sales of partial interest, New JV capital forecasted for the full year of 2023 will contribute over $300 million towards construction spend this year, including most of the $119 million of contributions from the new partner we just added to our build-to-suit project for Eli Lilly. Now JV contributions to construction spend, including forecasted joint ventures were added to our detailed disclosures on Page 48 of our supplemental package. Now turning to outstanding financial and operating results, we had really strong growth of $342.9 million or up 13.9% in total revenues for the first quarter annualized in comparison to the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis was up $246.2 million or 15.4% really strong growth of 6.8% in FFO per share for the quarter in comparison to the first quarter of 2022, again, off to a very strong start and on track for 6.4% growth in FFO per share for 2023. Now key highlights of our continued strong operating and financial performance Strong growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share was driven by the continued strength across key areas of our unique and differentiated business. We had continued strength and timely payment of rent from our client tenants, 99.9% and for the first quarter and 99.7% for April that was through April 21, only three weeks into this month, pretty amazing. Continued strength in same-property NOI growth of 3.7%, 9% on a cash basis and really reflects the benefit of strong rental rate growth on leasing in recent quarters, contractual annual escalations in rent and the burn-off of some free rent. Our outlook -- our strong outlook for 2023 same-property NOI growth is 3% on a GAAP basis, 5% on a cash basis and generally consistent with our strong 10-year average for same property growth. Now turning to record rental rate growth and strong leasing volume, strong rental rate growth continued into 2023 at 48.3% on a GAAP basis, 24.2% on a cash basis from lease renewals and re-leasing the space in the first quarter. Now this was an exceptional rental rate growth, GAAP at the highest in the Company's history, both GAAP and cash rental rate growth higher than the strong rental rate growth for the full year of 2022 and 2021. Now leasing volume for the first quarter was strong at 1.2 million rentable square feet, slightly ahead of the strong quarterly average of leasing volume prior to the exceptional record-level leasing volume in both 2021 and 2022. Now the key takeaway is that the scale of our high-quality tenant roster combined with operational excellence from our team, puts us in an excellent position to benefit from the unique pool of demand from our client tenants even in this unusual macro environment. Now our strong occupancy was in line with our expectations. Occupancy was 96 -- 93.6% as of March 31 and really in line with expectations and the comments I provided on our year-end earnings call. There are three key takeaways here. First, occupancy is expected to improve in the back half of the year. Second, 371,000 rentable square feet of the recent vacancy has significant rental rate growth of 110% on a GAAP basis and 115% on a cash basis; and third, 29% of this 371,000 rentable square feet has already been leased with occupancy of some of the space beginning in the third quarter of '23. Please refer to Footnote 1 on Page 26 of our supplemental package for more information. We also absorbed $71,000 of vacancy from a building located in Texas. This is one of two buildings that were undergoing redevelopment last quarter, one building, aggregating 131,000 rentable square feet is currently 36% pre-leased and undergoing redevelopment. We decided to hold on further redevelopment of the second building, aggregating 71,000 rentable square feet until we lease up the remainder of the 131,000 rentable square foot building. The 71,000 rentable square foot building is vacant and is classified in operating properties. We continued with very strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. Briefly on a high-quality tenant roster, Alexander really is the brand for life science real estate, has built long-term trusted relationships and is a true partner to the life science industry. 90% of our top 20 tenants are investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies. And we highlighted continued strength of timely payments of rent from client tenants at 99.9% of rent that was due in the first quarter really reflects the strength of our high-quality client tenants, important tenant relationships and the high-quality underwriting from our research team. Briefly on venture investments, realized gains from the venture investments included in FFO averaged about $25.8 million per quarter for the last eight quarters through the end of 2022 in comparison to $20.7 million for the first quarter of 2023. Now we do expect realized gains each quarter from our venture investments for the remainder of '23 to be more consistent to slightly up from the historical quarterly average of $25.8 million that I just highlighted. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of March 31 were $459 million on a cost basis of $1.2 billion. Now we've got continued consistency and growth in dividends from really high-quality cash flows we generate in our business. We've got a very low and conservative FFO payout ratio, 55% for the first quarter annualized with 5.3% increases in common stock dividends over the last 12 months. We're projecting $375 million in net cash flows from operating activities after dividends for reinvestment. At this rate, this represents over $1.1 billion of capital for reinvestment over the next three years. Briefly on external growth, we have $610 million of incremental net operating income from our pipeline of 6.7 million square feet that is 74% leased. Approximately 30% of this NOI will commence in the remaining three quarters of 2023, about 40% will commence in 2024, about 26% in 2025 and the remaining 4% thereafter. Now turning to guidance. We updated our underlying guidance assumptions for 2023. These assumptions are disclosed on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Our per share outlook for 2023 was updated to plus or minus $0.05 of a range from the midpoint of guidance, down from the plus or minus $0.10 range last quarter. Our range of guidance for EPS is $2.21 and to $2.31 and a range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $8.91 to $9.01 with no change at the midpoint of $8.96. Now this represents a strong 6.4% growth in FFO per share for 2023 following excellent growth last year of 8.5%. Now key updates on the underlying detailed assumptions included the following: a significant reduction of $325 million in both sources and uses of capital, including a $75 million reduction in the midpoint of acquisitions to $225 million and a $250 million reduction in construction spend at $2.725 billion. We also gave updates on significant dispositions and partial interest sales aggregating $865 million including significant transactions that are under executed LOIs and purchase and sale agreements. Now rental rate growth on lease renewals, re-lease in this space was increased 1% for both GAAP and cash to a range of 28% to 33% for GAAP and 12% to 17% on cash and occupancy was adjusted 20 basis points to reflect vacancy from 170,000 rentable square foot building located in Texas that is on hold while we lease up the adjacent building under redevelopment that is currently 36% leased. Importantly, occupancy is expected to recover in the second half of 2023. With that, let me turn it back to Joel Marcus. Thank you.\nJoel Marcus: So operator, can we go to questions, please?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Joe, look, I can appreciate that you still haven't closed a lot of these deals, but I think the market would certainly appreciate just any range of commentary you could provide on sort of how to think about cap rates? I realize not singling out individual deals, but is there a way to sort of bracket them or bucket them kind of against maybe where your implied cap rate is today or maybe against the deal that Peter discussed?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think the way -- and I'll have Peter certainly and Dan may want to comment as well. I think it's fair to think about we were posting low 4% cap rates, again, on Class A facilities over the last couple of years, and Peter just went through, I thought, a pretty clear explanation of the transaction in Greater Boston, which is essentially a 5.4%. So you might think about an adjustment of cap rates maybe over this transition transitioning economic time of maybe 100 basis points. So that's maybe a way to frame it, but I think you'll be pretty impressed. And I think people would be impressed when we do our second quarter call. But Peter, any comments?\nPeter Moglia: Yes, I agree with that assessment. I would say that we will see things that are still lower than 5% potentially when there's a good mark-to-market opportunity that can be monetized. But if it's stable, high-quality assets going to have a five handle on it just like this one did.\nJoel Marcus: Dan, any other comment you would throw out?\nDan Ryan: Yes. No, I think not Peter did perfectly.\nJoel Marcus: Okay. Steve, hopefully, that's helpful.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. No, that's great. And then, Joel, and maybe you and Hallie could just comment. I saw that I guess in the last supplemental, you talked about sort of dealing with 1,000 tenants. This time, you've kind of mentioned $850. My sense is half of that is retail tenants that maybe are leaving for an asset. But I suspect that maybe some of them are not retail. And I guess that really just speaks to how are you changing maybe your underwriting in the tenants that you're sort of willing to do business with today versus maybe tenants who were willing to do business with either post SVB or a couple of years ago?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. We didn't have 150 failures. But Dean, do you want to highlight that for a moment?\nDean Shigenaga: Yes. So Steve, -- so the huge majority of the change was really due to a simple future mega campus development project that we acquired. It's a retail project known as the shops at 10 Fran. That was almost all of the change in the tenancy from roughly 1,000 to 850. You're right. Beyond that, like we highlighted, not just during this call, but over the last couple of quarters, we've had, as you would always expect some normal lease expirations that occur at the end where the tenant doesn't choose to extend. And that's fairly normal activity. And then we've also had a few tenants that have come back, as you guys are well aware and have come back to and their lease a little bit early. But that was really a handful of leases over the last couple of quarters. I think the big takeaway though is, look, you know that we do a really good job at selecting really high-quality locations in the core of the life science cluster markets. So, great locations, great facilities, and I think our operational excellence and our brand puts us in a great position to capture mark-to-market on most of these spaces that have come back. I mean the comments I provided on the vacancies that came up just in the first quarter alone with mark-to-market, both GAAP and cash north of 100%. And 29% of that space has already been leased. If you go back to my comments in the fourth quarter, I believe I gave similar comments of pre-leasing on space that had just rolled as well. So, we've got good activity. And again, going back to the crux of your question, Steve, almost all that change in the tenancy was retail related at that shopping mall.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And let me maybe put a footnote on that, Steve. You asked about the nature of underwriting. I think kind of Hallie said it all that when we look at private companies or we look at preclinical public companies or even companies in the clinic that are public. So that group of tenants, you're always looking now even much more so for much nearer-term value inflection milestones and really good data and importantly, large unmet medical needs. I mean we've always done that, but I think now it just goes to show that they're going to be the haves and the others that have not. So that's really, I think, where the mindset is.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. And just one last question, Dean, do you have like an overall mark-to-market on kind of what you think the portfolio kind of lost the leases on the overall assets today?\nDean Shigenaga: Meaning if we were to mark-to-market the rental rate, Steve, on the whole portfolio?\nSteve Sakwa: Yes.\nDean Shigenaga: Yes, it's somewhere around -- I think last quarter, it was somewhere around 27%. This quarter, it's closer to 22% overall in the whole portfolio.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: You guys talked about driving a lot of your leasing from just internal relationships in your existing tenant base. And so I was wondering -- if I don't know if there's an Alexandria dashboard, so to speak, or what, but can you maybe give us a sense as to what either like leasing traffic, rate or just the aggregate amount of demand that's coming out of your portfolio today looks like versus, say, now two, three, four quarters ago?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. That is almost -- that's hard to do generally, and it's so submarket and building specific, Tony. Clearly, demand is overall down from the peak of '20 and '21. You see that just everywhere and you certainly see it on more of a normalization of our historical leasing, which has bounced around over the last either five-year benchmark or 10-year. But maybe the thing to say is companies that are active are pharma, and I think Peter alluded to this, bigger biotech product and service companies that aren't so much focused on the manufacturing side or the supply side. And then clearly, biotechs that whether they be public or private that have got good data coming. I think that's where you see it, but I'm not sure we could give you a numerical characterization of that.\nAnthony Paolone: I guess maybe a different way to ask it is if you think about the next couple of years, you see where the growth is within your portfolio, and you also know space that's coming due in your development pipeline, do you see enough demand today to absorb the space that's coming online in the next couple of years? Or do you think we should expect some moderation in occupancy levels as the demand is lower.\nJoel Marcus: Well, yes, I'll let maybe Peter comment on that as well. But I think it's fair to say if you look at our pipeline, which is pretty highly leased, I think we have a reasonably high level of confidence that we can fully lease those projects. And there are demand that doesn't even show up today on projects that may be on the future drawing board that we're also comfortable with. I don't think we see demand dropping off a cliff here at all. But Peter, you want to comment and Dan, you could comment as well.\nPeter Moglia: Yes. There's been a slowdown in activity due to the fact that boards and companies are really just trying to figure out where the economy is heading. There's definitely expansion needs. They're just not going forward with some of them, which is contributing to the reduction in demand. So, I would say that there's a nice amount of pent-up demand building. And I would say a couple of years from now that, that's definitely going to be in the market if not sooner.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just one -- second question, maybe a bit of detail. In the supplemental package on Page 34, you break out the portfolio between the operating assets and the various buckets of future opportunities. I guess what I'm trying to just make sure if I'm putting a cap rate on ARE's NOI and getting a value what from that slide do I need to add to that to kind of capture the totality? So I'm just trying to understand if in some of these future opportunities buckets, if there's some operating assets in those? Or I'm just trying to piece that all together, so either we're capturing everything or not double-counting something?\nDean Shigenaga: Tony, it's Dean here. So you're referring to the Page 34 for others on the call, which is in the bottom right-hand corner. This page highlights square footage of our operating, but most importantly, the different categories of our pipeline, everything from construction to the future. There's no significant cash flows from assets that are sitting in the pipeline. I just want to make clear that there's a line item that adjusts the future pipeline for square footage that's sitting in operations, but those cash flows are in the operating portfolio of, Tony, as you pick up that NOI to value the Company. We just don't want you to double count the square footage as you go towards the future pipeline. But from an NOI perspective, if that's your fundamental question, the future pipeline doesn't have any significant NOI being generated at the moment.\nAnthony Paolone: So like that 4.2 million square feet, there's not an appreciable amount of NOI from that that we would be picking up.\nDean Shigenaga: We'll wait a second, the $4.2 million is in rental properties today. It's in operations, Tony. I thought you were asking about the $38 million right above it. $37.889 million\nAnthony Paolone: Right. So, the $4.2 million does have some meaningful NOI associated with it. That's that we'd be out...\nDean Shigenaga: Correct. So you don't want to double count the square footage there. That's why we net down the square footage in that disclosure to 30 -- roughly $34 million.\nPeter Moglia: Right, right. But the book value has that $4.2 million in there.\nDean Shigenaga: The book value would only have it to the extent it's not related to the operating component, Tony? It's in operations, the book value would be sitting in the operating component if a larger campus had two operating buildings and a pad to support two buildings, the pad to support the future buildings would be in the future pipeline, the book basis, but the cost base is related to the operating buildings would be in operations, not in the pipeline.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Maybe just on the sourcing uses. Obviously, there's dispositions and partial interest sales that are continuing to come at different points in the cycle right now. But as you think about the ability to flex that going forward, if the transaction market stalls even more, how are you thinking about the flexibility on your end? And where could equity play into that?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Dean?\nDean Shigenaga: Well, I don't know that -- I mean, it's interesting the way you posed the question. Maybe I'll start from the back end of your question. Flexing capital plan and turning to equity as a solution is not really something we are contemplating. I think the way to look at our capital point is what we are doing internally, like we did in the current quarter for earnings as well as over the last several quarters and prep for initial guidance for Investor Day this year was to really challenge the uses of capital. I think one thing to keep in mind is that -- our pipeline is $610 million of incremental net operating income from projects that are highly leased today. There's so much equity type capital that's invested in CIP today, there's very little incremental equity needed to fund that pipeline. And so, we're looking at spend across other projects as we look forward over into '24 and beyond to be sure we're prioritizing things that we should be investing into and maybe holding on things that we shouldn't be just given the macro environment. So, hopefully, that gives you just some color on how we're thinking more broadly about it. I think, as I mentioned on the call earlier, we're mindful of the macro environment. We're also in a position where we know where we are here at the end of April with a lot of good activity on the pipeline. And so, we're reasonably comfortable with our outlook into 2023 and we'll obviously provide an update as we go quarter-to-quarter, but a bulk of what we have under executed LOI or PSA agreements today is sliding to close here fairly soon, plus or minus mid-year. So we feel good about it, and we'll keep an eye on things as we go through the next two quarters.\nNick Joseph: Absolutely, that's helpful. And then maybe just on that kind of reduction in development spend. How does that play into capitalized interest and interest expense in 2023?\nDean Shigenaga: Yes. Well, it's all reflected in our guidance. We just gave -- so you saw there was no changes in capped interest down in the details, obviously, if you -- we did on a number of projects review strategically what we wanted to do and a number of them were put on temporary hold. If you want to look at it from that perspective, redevelopments were placed into operations as vacant assets, development projects for the future for -- they have been paused on a few circumstances, which basically were left in the future development pipeline. From a capitalization perspective, that operating building that went in -- I'm sorry, the redevelopment building that's vacant that went into operations capitalization ceased immediately. The other projects have activities that are winding down as we speak, meaning capitalization will cease over the next month to a number of months going forward. But they're all basically shutting down in the near term in the scheme of things, they're relatively small. So, we've been able to absorb that. It sits within our range of guidance. It sits within our range of FFO with other assumptions offsetting those changes. So, we are able to pick up some improvement to offset those. So hopefully, that gives you a sense. I mean we look at qualifying activities carefully across all of our projects that are undergoing construction activities and capped interest and shut them down accordingly. So you will see some of that, but they're fairly small in the scheme of this.\nNick Joseph: That's helpful. And then just on the transaction market, I know you touched on cap rates, maybe up about 100 basis points in each asset, very different, though. Is there anything you're seeing from a buyer or kind of bidder pool buyer pools kind of change relative to what you've seen really over the last 12 months, just given kind of where financing costs have moved different institutions either fallen out? Or have you seen kind of any institutional interest that you hadn't seen before?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. It's Peter. I'll take that. We actually have a number of choices still in the market. But there are definitely some folks that are on the sidelines that are facing redemptions. And so, they're interested in accumulating more life science product, but they can't necessarily play right now. But that's been filled in by some other new folks coming in that want exposure that are also high-quality institutional investors. And yes, we have liquidity, and I'm not too concerned about that at this point. I think it will get better once there's more certainty in where the terminal rate is going to land and where cost of capital is so people get comfortable in spending their allocations for '23.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Peter, can you talk a little bit about the supply comments that you're making in your remarks. I mean are you seeing developers being more cautious pursuing new projects? I know there's a few data sources out there saying that developers are still pursuing life science projects specifically in Boston, I mean, would you agree with that statement?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. Certainly, there are -- there have been -- there has been spec building, especially in Boston. What we are seeing is in areas outside of our core submarkets where we don't own product, there are vacant buildings sitting there. And it's -- we're hearing that there's no tours, there's no activity. So, we don't necessarily think that those buildings are competitive to ours. There are a few projects, obviously, that we do believe, and that's where those percentages are coming in. So obviously, '23, a lot of stuff has already been delivered. There's some more coming in '24, there's more coming. We are seeing very little that is starting new today. I think there was one project in South San Francisco that has started recently, which is just beyond comprehension. But outside of that, we believe that anything that would compete in -- of our quality is in our numbers and that we don't think many, if any, people will start new projects from here on out, at least not in a material manner, but who knows?\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Great. And then just last, on 15 Necco, what's the reason for selling that specific, I guess, development stake? Is there any something about that building that didn't like or that was more particularly attractive to certain investors, I guess, why that property?\nPeter Moglia: Well, it was a fairly low yield. So we're giving away not too much upside by selling part of it, right? And are the investors that we attracted really like the building, and it was an opportunity to fund something that was near-term dollars. So it made a lot of sense.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And I mean it's a world-class building with a world-class tenant. So it certainly is one of those opportunities that would attract a variety of capital sources. And we continue to be the dominant owner as well. So it kind of meets all the requirements that we have for monetization.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: So, on the $7.6 million square foot pipeline, how much -- what does that imply in terms of development spend in 2024? And how much of that is potentially some place where you can sort of tap the brakes like you kind of did this quarter in deference to the current capital raising market, please?\nDean Shigenaga: Rich, it's Dean Shigenaga here. So you said $7.6 million...\nRich Anderson: You use any pipeline place you want. I'm curious as to what you've committed to in terms of development spending.\nDean Shigenaga: I see what number you're referring to. So you were referring to the pipeline that's under construction, 5.5 million square feet, plus another $1.2 million near term. Those are all 100% pre-leased projects. So that ties to the $610 million for others of incremental net operating income. We haven't broken out that number for '24 to spend just related to that, but that's not -- within that bucket now we've slimmed down the focus of what is continuing to generate the $610 million of NOI. And for the most part, Rich, for the most part, those are either 100% leased projects or multi-tenant projects, most of which have some level of pre-leasing. Some that don't have pre-leasing today are multi-tenant projects anywhere from a building to multiple buildings. So rightsized for delivery to requirements in the market, they're not lumpy, large build-to-suit opportunities that could be more specific to larger requirements. So I guess, a long way of saying, Rich, I think we feel comfortable with what we've rightsized for the pipeline of activity. The construction spend, plus or minus will play out like a normal curve for spend over that pipeline, roughly two years from the start of new projects, the active pipelines part way through that already. So -- what you're really focused on, though, in your question is a spend outside of that, which goes to quite a bit of activity, site work, advancing site work as well as entitlements. Entitlements are important. They add a lot of value. Site work shrinks the time to deliver buildings to a tenant, which if you looked at us two years ago, we said, let's move that along. If you look at us today, we'd say, well, let's think carefully about site work given cost of capital considerations with the macro environment today, and let's just hold on that until the right time. And so, I think we're going to look hard, as I mentioned earlier, over the next couple of quarters. We continue to refine our plan for 2024 because as I mentioned earlier, the $610 million of pipe, that pipeline does not require much more equity capital at stabilization because we have so much already in CIP which the incremental EBITDA will allow us to debt fund leverage neutral, the wide majority of the incremental capital for that pipeline such more general TIs kind of renovation costs that aren't part of development and redevelopment that we need to scrutinize in our business.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And that's kind of the critical message.\nRich Anderson: Yes, got it. And then the second question for me is on the success that you're having from asset sales and partial interest. It's obviously the best way to one of the best ways to raise equity capital right now for you guys today. But at what point does it become too much? Where you're parting ways with your preeminent assets, you only want to do that to a certain degree before you're giving away stuff you'd rather own 100%. So is there a sort of a number you can point to that this is how much we can raise from a disposition standpoint, still be in a range where we're comfortable with our ownership position in these fantastic assets longer term.\nDean Shigenaga: Rich, it's here. I think the way to think about at a high level is that we just close the conversation about the pipeline 6.7 million square feet under construction or including 1.2 million to start in the near term here. That's a lot of product. And we just completed a lot of product over the last two or three years. So, we have added a lot of high-quality assets to our portfolio in recent years as well as coming online here over the next two to three years. So put off a piece of the portfolio makes sense. And we're mindful of your question, but we have so much coming online and that we have completed in recent years. I think we feel we're in pretty good shape.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nTom Catherwood: Just following up on Michael's previous question about Boston. Can you provide some more insight on the decision not to redevelop 275 Grove Street? And is there any read-through to other recent acquisitions, Greater Boston like Gatehouse Drive or presidential way?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think Peter can comment as well. I think the way we're trying to think about it is to -- I mean, we have a very significant position in the Greater Boston market, 14 million, 15 million square feet. And I think in a tougher macro environment, it's kind of thought to prune and rightsize you see what we've done last year would be a good example of -- we sold a set of really good high-quality workhorse assets, but we felt in locations that were not necessarily high barrier to entry markets, but good economics for buyers as well and good economics for us. And I think as we think about different assets, we're trying to make sure that we're more focused on the highest barrier to entry markets rather than less. And I think that's probably the best example I could maybe share Peter, but you could give you color.\nPeter Moglia: Yes. I mean there was one nuance to kind of focus us on 275 Grove, which was when we acquired that, there was a thought an opportunity to expand our holdings in that neighborhood and in fact, adjacent to it. So we in addition to high-barrier to enter, we also really are focused on aggregating into mega emphasis and the opportunity to do that wasn't attractive enough for us to move forward. And so we ended up with this kind of stand-alone asset, which is a really good office asset. But you have to start prioritizing and that one just kind of lost some of it shine when the opportunity to expand kind of went away.\nTom Catherwood: Got it. And then Peter, sticking with you, appreciated your comments on availability rates when including 2023 and '24 deliveries. When it comes to upcoming lease expirations, you're typically in conversations with tenants a year or multiple years in advance. Are you getting any sense that tenants are engaging less on their '24 expirations or space needs given the large amount of expected deliveries between now and the end?\nPeter Moglia: That's a hard question to answer because it's pretty -- would be pretty granular for me to understand when I'm looking at leasing reports remembering what is expiring today versus in the future. But I believe our early renewal statistics have been fairly strong recently. So, I guess the short answer is, I don't -- I haven't noticed anything. We are constantly in communication with the regions about their upcoming renewals in a year to two years, even three years ahead at times, our -- what's the status of the Company and are they expanding? And do we want in the portfolio or not. And so, we're pretty aware. And if I think -- if there was some weakness there, I think I would have probably noticed it by now.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I just wanted to follow up on some of those supply comments, particularly the San Francisco supply. It sounds like that's where the biggest incremental change was when you're looking at 2023 and '24 on lease unleased new supply. What in particular kind of changed on that front, new supply coming online? Or was it projects that were previously signed and then kind of the lease went away?\nPeter Moglia: Just some new recent starts and one, large one in particular in South San Francisco, you made up most of that change. It is just uncanny that people are still trying to put new products into the queue in a market that has a lot of vacancy. We're fortunate we have one project moving that is kind of a good niche for earlier-stage companies, mid-stage companies, so we don't have to go on an elephant hunt to lease some really large project, but there's a lot of folks out there that are going to be in a lot of trouble because of what I would think is fairly reckless investing.\nJoel Marcus: Well, and also, historically, if you go back to my comments, I said we have tried to shape the Company and allocate our capital as much as possible the high barrier to entry markets and mega campuses. South San Francisco, we've never had a dominant position. We chose not to win the Britannia assets came for sale quite a number of years ago and in those days, HCP bought that, I think, almost $3 billion, we valued at about $1.7 billion. So we decided to pass on that. But what's changed in South San Francisco is transportation is now a bit of an issue. Genentech transitioned to Roche, which is a great company, a world-class company, but they're not company creating in that market like Genentech was like a factory for spin-outs much like MIT is. And some of those aspects of what would otherwise be a high barrier to entry market don't exist there. So you saw some of the moves we made last year in South San Francisco, exiting a number of assets, passing on -- we passed on an option we had to do a development. And so we're being pretty darn cautious there, and you'll see that continue.\nJoshua Dennerlein: And then one other question. I saw you revised upward the leasing spread guidance. What was that a function of just market rent growth or just leases you actually signed in 1Q?\nDean Shigenaga: It's reflective of where we usually start at the beginning of the year. If you look back over time, I think we've enjoyed the opportunity to move rental rate growth and same-property performance northward as we make our way through the year. And so, a combination of settling in on activity this quarter, as well as our continued outlook for the remainder of the year, so slight improvement overall.\nOperator: Next question comes from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDylan Burzinski: And I appreciate the color that you guys have provided thus far on sort of demand and the normalization on that front. But just curious, from a geographic perspective, are there certain markets or submarkets where the normalization is a little bit more onerous?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think maybe South San Francisco might be not so much for us but maybe others. Yes, that's a good example. And we've tried to minimize limit our exposure there and transaction that we build to suit was really a bit -- it's in the South San Francisco submarket, but it's a little bit out of there. But directly on transportation, we felt was a huge competitive advantage in landed a world-class tenant to 100% occupy that development. So, I think that's one example, yes.\nDylan Burzinski: And I guess just on that line of thought, like our markets like in the non-cluster markets, like RTP, suburban Maryland, are those sort of seeing similar kind of normalization demand trends as San Francisco versus maybe like your core mark submarkets like Cambridge, BTC, Torrey Pines in San Diego\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I think we're still seeing decent activity maybe RTP or RT, I should say, has slowed maybe a bit more than we would have guessed, but part of that's due to my guess is the mix of tenants down there in the -- not so much our tenants per se, but the mix of life science, the components of life science tenants in that market. And I think we see in Maryland, it's still pretty good. It's slower than it has been because obviously, '20 and '21 were peak times and obviously COVID dollars we're heavily focused on that market, but we're still seeing pretty decent activity that I would say, matches our historical numbers. So that's just two examples.\nOperator: The next question comes from Georgi Dinkov with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Could you please provide more color on the internal leasing pipeline that comes from your existing tenants? And how that demand compares to the broader industry?\nJoel Marcus: I don't think you can compare that because no one has the scale and depth of the tenant base that we do, and we know pretty instantaneously about the needs of those tenants versus if you're just in the market using brokers and you're kind of hearing here, say, your secondhand. So, the two are pretty fundamentally different.\nGeorgi Dinkov: Understood. And apologies if I missed it, but do you have any lease termination since this quarter? And if so, how much?\nJoel Marcus: Dean?\nDean Shigenaga: Yes, nothing significant in the quarter.\nOperator: Great. Appreciate it.\nJoel Marcus: Next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJamie Feldman: Can you talk about the credit watch list today and just what that looks like as a percentage of your revenue versus, say, six months ago, how that number has changed?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I don't know that -- I mean, we don't call it a credit watch list. I think Hallie indicated, we have a pretty methodical deep and judicious approach that has always been there. And I mean, if you looked at, say, the Rubius situation, we would say that if there's a management change that then you look at -- or you put that scrutiny at a higher level when it happens. And then as technology developments or take hold that you are informed about. And rumor sometimes when you're dealing with public companies, you have to -- sometimes we have confidentiality agreements, sometimes we don't. So information comes in different ways in different fashions. We just have a more -- much more hands-on work approach with clients. But I think the bottom line is the simple bottom line. If you look at Hallie indicated, if you look at the tenant collections by segment, they're 99% to 100%. So we've, I think, done an extraordinary job of managing rent collections and monitoring all of our tenants in a way that I don't think anyone else could even imagine. So I don't know if that's a helpful way to characterize it, Jamie.\nJamie Feldman: No, that is helpful. I mean, I guess the big picture is like everyone kind of sees the headlines on what's going on in life science. Clearly, you are flying above the clouds or just have a better portfolio, a better tenant base, but it's so hard to handicap just how bad this cycle could get for you I think if you look.\nJoel Marcus: Yes, I mean if you look at the tenant base and where we, again, how they went through each of the segment or a number of the segments, and I think you could always say to me, the privates are in pretty good shape because they're not exposed to the public markets, and they generally assuming we've underwritten them well, and we have. They generally have good and deep backers, whether it's venture or institutional. And then you look at public, which are preclinical or in the clinic, but don't have near-term milestones. I think that's the area that everybody is really focused on, and we have very limited exposure there. I mean, for example, we turned down a lease with Sorrento Therapeutics down in San Diego some years ago because we -- it was kind of like Elizabeth well, Theranos, forget her last name, but Elizabeth Holmes. I know people who did diligence and they said they could never look at the Edison machine. Well, if you can't look at the Edison how it works and so forth, you can't underwrite the tenant. Well, that's kind of how we looked at Sorrento. We couldn't understand the science, not that we had some ability to say, hey, this is going to fail or not fail, but we simply could not understand the science that we passed on the tenancy. And that's just how we do things.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then I guess, Dean, just back to your comment on the $25.8 million of gains you might show. I mean what's the maximum you think you could do on that number on that line item?\nDean Shigenaga: Well, I mean, a couple of years back now, I think it was two years ago, Jamie, we took -- the market was able to deliver on some unique liquidity events within the portfolio, and we had something just north of $200 million in realized gains. Now, our policy has been these large significant unusual items. They're one-off. There aren't events that we control. And those, as you go back about $100 million of that was excluded from FFO per share. These were individually very significant gains. But that's just one example as a historical data point, Jamie, is -- but if you look back for now, I think this would be the third year that we're into this run rate right at about $100 million, $105 million on average, I think, for the last couple of years. And that's kind of the general outlook other than having a slightly lower number for the first quarter.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: Just simply thank you very much, and we look forward to talking to you on second quarter call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Hallie Kuhn",
            "content": "Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, Senior Vice President of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to comment on the life science industry following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The health of ARE's best-in-class life science tenant base and innovation is a long-term driver of life science industry growth. Beginning with SVB, there remains some misperceptions on the long-term impact of its collapse on the life science industry. SVB certainly was a go-to provider for banking needs of many venture-backed companies, particularly in the tech industry. And while SVB has created a niche serving the segment, it was also cultural. Early-stage start-ups work within a very tightened community and many used SVB because that's what everyone else used, not necessarily because there were no other options. And many banks, including G-SIBs have been working for years to carve out their own share of this market. For our own private biotech tenants in the days following the collapse, we had conversations with over 100 companies. Some of which use SVB, but many of which did not or had multiple banking relationships. Importantly, within approximately 72 hours from the start of the bank run, companies had access to all deposits and the near-term risks such as making payroll were mitigated. As for long-term risk driven by instability of regional banks, unlike some tech companies that maintain significant cash and deposit accounts, our tenants largely rely on safer third-party custodial and sweep accounts to minimize cash deposits. Biotech is also not reliant on venture debt to the same extent as the tech industry. And for those that do seek venture debt, SVB is by no means the only option. We expect that the life science sector will be minimally affected going forward as evidenced by venture financing rounds that closed in March is expected and continue to do so in April, which I'll touch on in more detail shortly. Before transitioning to the health of our tenant base, one quick reminder on the differentiation of our life science real estate product from traditional office, importantly, the office component of our life science buildings directly supports researchers in the lab. A scientist does not spend all day at the bench, but spends time moving back and forth between lab and adjacent office in order to, for example, analyze data, plan the next set of experiments and meet with colleagues. Thus, the office component cannot be broken out or compared to traditional office, but is an adjacent, highly integrated and critical component of laboratory design and workflows. Of course, this is also not work that can be done from home. Now transitioning to the health of our world-class diverse life science tenant base, perhaps the best way to frame the current environment is the old adage in God we trust all else spring data. Starting with pharma, which makes up 18% of our ARR, this segment continues to operate from a position of strength with strong balance sheet and significant free cash flows, pharma is less sensitive to rising rates. In 2022, biopharma deployed an estimated $267 billion into R&D. The result is tenants like Eli Lilly that continue to translate this R&D into transformative medicines. Mounjaro, which aims to treat obesity in type 2 diabetes, is predicted to eclipse $50 billion per year globally in revenue. And to put this in perspective, nearly one out of every $4 of U.S. health care spend is deployed to care for people with diabetes. And obesity is estimated to account for over $480 billion in direct health care costs in the U.S. with an additional $1.2 trillion in indirect costs due to lost economic productivity. To that end, therapies such as Mounjaro, save and extend lives and have the potential to significantly drive down the cost of health care more broadly. Transitioning to private venture-backed biotech which makes up 8% of our total ARR, we continue to see a reset of venture deployment to pre-2020, 2021 levels, which while down from peak remains strong by historic standards. Venture capitalists are more discriminate, disciplined and demanding of current and future investments. And the companies with tenured management teams and strong differentiated technologies and near-term value inflection milestones are the ones that rise above the fray. We continue to underwrite and monitor all tenants closely, and our private biotech tenants remain compared to the broader market. In fact, across this tenant base, they have raised over $1.9 billion from BC and pharma partnerships since the beginning of the year, of which $800 million has closed following the collapse of SVB. As a testament to this point, with the week remaining in April, private biotech tenant rent collection is at 99.7%. Next to public biotech, our tenants with marketed products make up 14% of our ARR generated $150 billion in revenue in 2022 and include names such as Amgen, Gilead, Vertex and Moderna. Moderna continues to highlight the potential of novel platforms to deliver innovative new medicines to patients. This month, the Company's personalized mRNA cancer vaccine in combination with an immunotherapy drug from tenant Merck, demonstrated promising clinical trial results in aggressive forms of skin cancer. Companies also continue to set high bars for continued innovation and product launches. For example, Alexandria tenant Gilead has laid out an ambitious plan to achieve 20 new drug approvals by 2030, which will entail advancement of their current pipeline, particularly in oncology, supplemented by additional M&A. For our preclinical and clinical stage public biotechs comprising 10% of our ARR, compelling clinical data remains king. Tenants such as [indiscernible] and Biomea Fusion, for example, have recently raised additional capital of promising clinical data. Prometheus Biosciences, while not a tenant exemplify how data drives the lifeblood of the industry. The Company announced stellar data in December, driving their stock up over 600% in the past 12 months and culminating in a $10.8 billion acquisition by Merck. To be clear, in the process of developing novel medicines, there will always be some that fail no matter what the market conditions. But this is baked into our mall. With the deep tenant base, relationships across every facet of the industry, and the highest quality space in operations, we can get ahead of potential tenant challenges to backfill and further optimize our tenant base. Reflecting this, in April, we've collected 100% rent from our preclinical and clinical stage public biotech tenants. Next, transitioning to academic and institutional tenants, which constitute 12% of our ARR, it's an opportunity to remember that the life science industry's cornerstone is innovation, which is not slowing. Bipartisan support for life science research remains strong. At $47.5 billion, the NIH's 2023 budget is a 21% increase over 2019. The Academic and medical institutions continue to be highly productive, a key metric being the pace of new intellectual property. In 2021, U.S. academic institutions accounted for 20,000 invention disclosures and nearly 1,000 new startups. And this activity in return is an important long-term funding mechanism for these institutions. For example, for Prometheus Bio was originally spun out of Cedars-Sinai, which is set to receive nearly $800 million from the recently announced M&A. In sum, with the majority of our academic and institutional ARR from investment-grade tenants and funding cycles that are based on multiyear grant funding time lines, this segment continues to be sheltered from larger macroeconomic conditions. Staying on the topic of innovation, a few final data points to orient the growth of the life science industry beyond the next few quarters but to the decades to come. According to the American Society of Cell and Gene Therapy, there are over 3,700 gene cell and RNA therapies in preclinical and clinical development. For chronic diseases, which drives the bulk of health care spend in the United States, there are over 800 medicines in clinical development. The culmination is continued FDA approvals and 2023 has started at a fast clip. Year-to-date, 14 novel therapies have been approved including a novel therapy for ALS developed by Tenant Biogen just announced this morning. And altogether for the year, nearly 60 novel medicines have been scheduled for FDA approval review which mirrors 2018's record year of 59 novel FDA approvals. To end, I want to reiterate that we are acutely aware of the years of abundance and easy capital that have passed and that the separation of haves and have-nots will continue to widen as the industry drills down on the technologies and medicines that bring the most value to patients and investors. But as Winston Churchill once said, \"Never let a good crisis go to waste.\" While this market is and will continue to warrant extreme prudence, it is an opportunity for the best companies to hone in on their long-term fundamentals and thrive. And that's what our tenants and Alexandria exemplify. With that, I'll pass it off to Peter."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to Alexandria's first quarter '23 Earnings Call. With me today are Peter, Dean, Hallie and Dan. And first of all, I want to send a big thank you to our entire, ARE family team for an operationally and financially strong first quarter in a tough -- continuing tough macro environment. As you know, Alexandria is truly a one-of-a-kind S&P 500 company. And we're very pleased that we just received new -- one of Newsweek's most trusted company awards. We have no peers. We're kind of a pure play. In our field, we first identified and pioneered the lab space niche back in 1994 and then through our disciplined execution of our original vision using the strategic architecture of our cluster model, which we customize to the life science industry. We have brought the mission-critical real estate infrastructure of the life science industry and integrated it with an unparalleled and world-class 24/7 operational excellence service component aimed to protect the hundreds of billions of dollars of leading-edge science, which is conducted 24/7 within our asset base. And we have brought this to a highly respected and recognized real estate product type today. Alexandria is definitely not a health care service facilities company nor a generic office company. Our disciplined core focus is our patented and trademark lab space. It's a premium priced, non-commodity product generally characterized by high barrier to entry markets, where we have a dominant franchise and where we exercise pricing power, especially in our highly sought after Alexandria-branded mega campuses, and those markets exhibit deep science base, deep life science talent base, a rich abundance of risk capital and also are ones that are generally safe and have excellent transportation access. And what we saw in 1994 in the embryonic days of the life science industry is multiplied geometrically today, 30 years later, as Steve Jobs said, the 21st century will be the century of the intersection of biology and technology innovation. We have 10,000 known diseases wreaking havoc on human beings each and every day and the personal and economic cost of sickness, illness and today, the mental health crisis is continuing to skyrocket. Continued innovation in medicine is an absolute national priority and the transformative work of our tenants in the industry is critical to addressing the massive unmet medical need. Literally every day, we hear of great progress. And today, for example, one of our Greater Boston tenants, Morphic Therapeutic which has an oral drug addressing moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. And if you've ever had it, it is a tough condition, a major GI indication announced that it hit its Phase 2a clinical trial endpoint and their stock has been up 75% this year. The 10 most prevalent diseases in the U.S., heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, obesity, Alzheimer's, diabetes, substance abuse, infectious disease, chronic kidney disease and mental illness are not being solved to-date. We have a large mountain decline, and the industry is really in its formative days. Weathering a tough macro environment, ARE posted a very solid first quarter. Our funds FFO per share is up 7%, as you see in revenues, top line revenue is up almost 14%. And Dean will go into the metrics, but almost 100% collections, which is -- bodes well for our continued strength and stability of the Company. We've maintained strong while lowering uses and sources of capital. We've had very solid leasing with the highest-ever rental rate increase, and we've had continuing strong operating and EBITDA margins. All stakeholders should recognize and appreciate this management team took a highly disciplined approach over a multiyear period to create a fortress balance sheet to successfully weather what now is the current self-inflected economic storm by the various policies that we implemented over the last many years. We have taken judicious measure to cut our CapEx, while at the same time, making strong progress on our funding plan for 2023, and you'll hear more about that from Peter. So without any further hesitation, let me turn it over to Hallie, who's going to give you some bird's-eye view of our view on the life science industry. So, Hallie? So operator, can we go to questions, please? Well, I think the way -- and I'll have Peter certainly and Dan may want to comment as well. I think it's fair to think about we were posting low 4% cap rates, again, on Class A facilities over the last couple of years, and Peter just went through, I thought, a pretty clear explanation of the transaction in Greater Boston, which is essentially a 5.4%. So you might think about an adjustment of cap rates maybe over this transition transitioning economic time of maybe 100 basis points. So that's maybe a way to frame it, but I think you'll be pretty impressed. And I think people would be impressed when we do our second quarter call. But Peter, any comments? Dan, any other comment you would throw out? Okay. Steve, hopefully, that's helpful. Yes. We didn't have 150 failures. But Dean, do you want to highlight that for a moment? Yes. And let me maybe put a footnote on that, Steve. You asked about the nature of underwriting. I think kind of Hallie said it all that when we look at private companies or we look at preclinical public companies or even companies in the clinic that are public. So that group of tenants, you're always looking now even much more so for much nearer-term value inflection milestones and really good data and importantly, large unmet medical needs. I mean we've always done that, but I think now it just goes to show that they're going to be the haves and the others that have not. So that's really, I think, where the mindset is. Yes. That is almost -- that's hard to do generally, and it's so submarket and building specific, Tony. Clearly, demand is overall down from the peak of '20 and '21. You see that just everywhere and you certainly see it on more of a normalization of our historical leasing, which has bounced around over the last either five-year benchmark or 10-year. But maybe the thing to say is companies that are active are pharma, and I think Peter alluded to this, bigger biotech product and service companies that aren't so much focused on the manufacturing side or the supply side. And then clearly, biotechs that whether they be public or private that have got good data coming. I think that's where you see it, but I'm not sure we could give you a numerical characterization of that. Well, yes, I'll let maybe Peter comment on that as well. But I think it's fair to say if you look at our pipeline, which is pretty highly leased, I think we have a reasonably high level of confidence that we can fully lease those projects. And there are demand that doesn't even show up today on projects that may be on the future drawing board that we're also comfortable with. I don't think we see demand dropping off a cliff here at all. But Peter, you want to comment and Dan, you could comment as well. Yes. So Dean? Yes. And I mean it's a world-class building with a world-class tenant. So it certainly is one of those opportunities that would attract a variety of capital sources. And we continue to be the dominant owner as well. So it kind of meets all the requirements that we have for monetization. Yes. And that's kind of the critical message. Yes. I think Peter can comment as well. I think the way we're trying to think about it is to -- I mean, we have a very significant position in the Greater Boston market, 14 million, 15 million square feet. And I think in a tougher macro environment, it's kind of thought to prune and rightsize you see what we've done last year would be a good example of -- we sold a set of really good high-quality workhorse assets, but we felt in locations that were not necessarily high barrier to entry markets, but good economics for buyers as well and good economics for us. And I think as we think about different assets, we're trying to make sure that we're more focused on the highest barrier to entry markets rather than less. And I think that's probably the best example I could maybe share Peter, but you could give you color. Well, and also, historically, if you go back to my comments, I said we have tried to shape the Company and allocate our capital as much as possible the high barrier to entry markets and mega campuses. South San Francisco, we've never had a dominant position. We chose not to win the Britannia assets came for sale quite a number of years ago and in those days, HCP bought that, I think, almost $3 billion, we valued at about $1.7 billion. So we decided to pass on that. But what's changed in South San Francisco is transportation is now a bit of an issue. Genentech transitioned to Roche, which is a great company, a world-class company, but they're not company creating in that market like Genentech was like a factory for spin-outs much like MIT is. And some of those aspects of what would otherwise be a high barrier to entry market don't exist there. So you saw some of the moves we made last year in South San Francisco, exiting a number of assets, passing on -- we passed on an option we had to do a development. And so we're being pretty darn cautious there, and you'll see that continue. Well, I think maybe South San Francisco might be not so much for us but maybe others. Yes, that's a good example. And we've tried to minimize limit our exposure there and transaction that we build to suit was really a bit -- it's in the South San Francisco submarket, but it's a little bit out of there. But directly on transportation, we felt was a huge competitive advantage in landed a world-class tenant to 100% occupy that development. So, I think that's one example, yes. Yes. I think we're still seeing decent activity maybe RTP or RT, I should say, has slowed maybe a bit more than we would have guessed, but part of that's due to my guess is the mix of tenants down there in the -- not so much our tenants per se, but the mix of life science, the components of life science tenants in that market. And I think we see in Maryland, it's still pretty good. It's slower than it has been because obviously, '20 and '21 were peak times and obviously COVID dollars we're heavily focused on that market, but we're still seeing pretty decent activity that I would say, matches our historical numbers. So that's just two examples. I don't think you can compare that because no one has the scale and depth of the tenant base that we do, and we know pretty instantaneously about the needs of those tenants versus if you're just in the market using brokers and you're kind of hearing here, say, your secondhand. So, the two are pretty fundamentally different. Dean? Next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Yes. I don't know that -- I mean, we don't call it a credit watch list. I think Hallie indicated, we have a pretty methodical deep and judicious approach that has always been there. And I mean, if you looked at, say, the Rubius situation, we would say that if there's a management change that then you look at -- or you put that scrutiny at a higher level when it happens.

If you look at Hallie indicated, if you look at the tenant collections by segment, they're 99% to 100%.

So I don't know if that's a helpful way to characterize it, Jamie.

We couldn't understand the science, not that we had some ability to say, hey, this is going to fail or not fail, but we simply could not understand the science that we passed on the tenancy. And that's just how we do things. Just simply thank you very much, and we look forward to talking to you on second quarter call."

            "content": "Thanks, Hallie. I just had my 25th anniversary with the Company, In addition to that milestone reminding me of how fast time moves by brought about a nostalgic look back at my time at Alexandria. I recall my interview with Joel, where I learned about this novel idea of forming a real estate company to serve the life science industry, which made me both nervous as nobody had ever done it before and equally inspired to help enable an industry that was hell bent on changing the world. After serious contemplation, I decided that if I was going to make it different in the world, this was a heck of an opportunity to do it. Plus after having been in real estate for about eight years at that point, I could see a tremendous value in offering mission-critical facilities over commodity product. I could not have made a better decision as it all proved out. Alexandria has played a critical role in the evolution of the life science industry over the last three decades by creating and growing the ecosystems and clusters that ignite and accelerate the world's leading innovators in their pursuit to advanced human health, which is our solid mission. In addition, we've built an irreplaceable world-class asset base of robust and highly differentiated properties and campuses that attract a diversified best-in-class tenant base who values our expertise and operational excellence by providing 75% to 85% of our leasing quarter-to-quarter. The result of all this is we have built a brand without here that puts us in a position where we don't rely on third parties to bring us tenants. They come to us directly as we are a trusted partner with a long successful track record of developing and operating mission-critical facilities. This is an important distinction in any part of the cycle, but perhaps even more when things have slowed down. Our results prove it out. Thank you for indulging me on that retrospective. I'm going to go and briefly touch on our development pipeline, construction costs, leasing and asset sales and then hand it over to Dean. In the first quarter, we delivered 453,511 square feet in five projects into our high barrier to entry submarkets. Annual NOI for these deliveries totals $23 million, and the initial stabilized yield is strong at 7.3%. At quarter end, projects under construction and near-term projects expected to commence construction over the next four quarters totaled 7.6 million square feet and are 74% leased or under negotiation. This is very similar to last quarter, but in response to the uncertainty and volatility in the markets, we have made a strategic decision to reduce 2023 construction spend by $250 million by pausing or delaying projects that had been classified as under construction, so we can focus our capital on the most strategic projects that have the most attractive terms, enabling our highly bedded and vast tenant base. The reduction in spend results in NOI from deliveries primarily commencing from the second quarter of '23 through the first quarter of '26 to be approximately $610 million. After commenting on construction costs for the past two years, I can still say they remain volatile but are on their way to stabilizing. The availability and price of commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum and concrete, continue to fluctuate due to shortages of raw materials, low yields for mines, high demand from electrification or low capability utilization rates in the mills and fabrication shops due to labor shortages. Cost of materials and supply chain volatility were the initial drivers of construction inflation, but now the primary driver is labor with a triple whammy of wage increases, shortage of workers and the inefficiency of the remaining labor force due to the retirement of older, more skilled labor. There are 330,000 open construction jobs today and the time it takes to train the new entrants to be highly skilled as measured in years. So these inefficiencies will be with us for a while. Specific to life science buildings, the availability of switchgear and equipment such as HVAC units and generators are -- has slightly improved but their lead times are still extraordinarily long with custom air handlers taking 27 weeks longer to get than before COVID and switch gear and generators and astounding 64 weeks longer. Even worse is the availability of large transformers provided by the utility companies, which can take as long as three years now to get. What's driving these delays are chip shortages and demand from electrification projects happening all over the world as investors, governments and end users demand improvement in carbon emissions. As you can imagine, the cost of this equipment is reflective of these shortages and paired with high labor cost is making new laboratory office projects more expensive to build than ever before. The upside for us is that 84% of our costs for our active development and redevelopment projects are under GMP or other fixed contracts with contingencies behind that. So, we are largely locked in. Anyone contemplating a speculative development these days will have to contend with these delays and associated high costs, which will put the feasibility of building and financing the project at considerable risk. One reason, we will likely not see the supply many are expecting beyond what is under construction today. Transitioning to leasing, our strong brand loyalty, mega campus offerings and operational excellence continue to drive strong leasing numbers in a challenging market. The 1.2 million square feet leased in the first quarter is above our five-year pre-2021 average and is the 12th consecutive quarter with leasing volume above 1 million square feet. We achieved attractive economics primarily from our vast tenant base, accounting for 85% of the leasing this quarter, resulting in a rental rate increase of 48.3%, which was the highest in company history and a strong cash rate of 24.2%. As we have noted previously, demand has normalized from the record year of 2021. Depending on who you ask, demand is at slightly below or slightly above pre-COVID levels. There are less tenants actively seeking space in the market today, which we believe is being significantly driven by uncertainty in the economy. As Hallie put it, this market is and will continue to warrant extreme prudence. However, we're not dependent at all on broker deal flow. There are pending opportunities from our tenant base that the broader market likely does not see due to our direct relationships with company management teams. Such relationships are a huge differentiator for us and will continue to drive solid leasing even in tough environments. Some private and preclinical clinical stage companies are making do with the space they have today until they can better understand their ability to raise capital on its cost. Capital is available. But as Hallie mentioned, BCs are more discriminate disciplined in demanding of future investments and companies with tenured management teams, strong differentiated technologies and near-term value inflection milestones are the ones that will rise above the fray. Those are the halves who by and large are Alexandria's tenants, which we have underwritten and placed into our world-class asset base, differentiated from the have nots tenant base of others who take on any tenant that can fill space with hope as their underwriting strategy. On the supply side, we track high-quality projects, we believe, are competitive to ours in the high barrier-to-entry submarkets. Accordingly, we're tracking direct vacancy in Greater Boston to be 2.8%. On lease sublease space is at 3.9% and unleased directly competitive with our AAA locations and building quality to be 1.5% to be delivered in 2023 and 5.1% to be delivered in 2024, a 1.3% total increase in availability from last quarter. In San Francisco, direct vacancy is 3.5% and sublease space is at 5.8% and unleased supply directly competitive with our assets continues to be the highest in all of our markets at 6.6% and 8.9% to be delivered in '23 and '24, respectively. This is an increase of 3.4% in total availability over last quarter, largely driven by spec building in South San Francisco. In San Diego, direct vacancy is at 4.1%, sublease space is at 2.3% and unleased competitive supply is 3.2% in 2023 and 5.4% in 2024, a slight increase of 0.2% over last quarter. Supply in all submarkets is very likely to be muted beyond what is under construction today due to high construction costs that I referenced, higher cost of capital and the lessening of generic tenant demand. We focus primarily on high barrier-to-entry markets where supply is inherently limited. We focus primarily on high barrier to entry markets and brand mega-campus offerings in those AAA high barrier to entry market locations and operational excellence enables us to continually mine our vast and deep tenant base to drive our leasing activity, which will likely lessen the impact of generic supply. I'll end with some commentary on our value harvesting and recycling progress. As we all know, the rapid rise in interest rates have not only increased investors' cost of capital but created a lot of uncertainty causing a number of investors to remain on the sidelines. Adding to the difficulty to execute in this environment is the increasing desperation of a number of office building owners trying to raise cash to stay afloat by offering quality long-term leased assets with credit tenants at 6.5% to 7.5% cap rates. Despite these challenges, the demand for high-quality life science assets which is vastly different from office assets continued in the quarter. As noted in our press release, we were pleased to transfer an 18% interest in our current JV at 15 Necco which we control and owned 90% prior to the sale. The asset is under construction and will not be delivered until the end of this year with cash flow commencing in mid-2024. The buyer will fund the remaining construction costs to deliver the property to our tenant until they reach a 37% ownership, which is expected to be the remainder of the cost to deliver the project. Given that the receipt of cash flow is over a year away, it's difficult to translate the valuation to an operating cap rate. But to give you some color, the parties agreed to evaluation at closing to be $576 million or $1,665 per square foot, which is an initial yield of 5.25% on their investment based on in-place NOI at closing. But we also agreed to credit our partner $5.5 million in fees payable. Because we sold 33% of the total 37% our partner purchased those fees equate to approximately $15 million in value. Stripping that $15 million from the purchase price gets you to a total valuation of $561 million increasing the cap rate to 5.4%. If you want to tie that to the supplemental, the $66 million price for the 18%. And the other -- if you add the other $119 million to be funded to completion and divide it by the 33% we sold, you get $561 million. This was a great outcome for Alexandria as we were able to partner with a world-class investor to monetize the value creation and secure the capital for the remaining spend in an accretive manner while retaining control of the asset and all management fees. We have not yet closed on the other transaction we signed an LOI on in the fourth quarter, but we expect to do so in the second quarter. In addition to this transaction, we have signed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements for a number of assets, including the office campus referenced in the press release, aggregating to a total sales price of $799.3 million. These future transactions and 15 Necco account for approximately 57% of the progress needed to meet the midpoint of our disposition guidance. With that, I'm going to hand it over to Dean. Yes, I agree with that assessment. I would say that we will see things that are still lower than 5% potentially when there's a good mark-to-market opportunity that can be monetized. But if it's stable, high-quality assets going to have a five handle on it just like this one did. Yes. There's been a slowdown in activity due to the fact that boards and companies are really just trying to figure out where the economy is heading. There's definitely expansion needs. They're just not going forward with some of them, which is contributing to the reduction in demand. So, I would say that there's a nice amount of pent-up demand building. And I would say a couple of years from now that, that's definitely going to be in the market if not sooner. Right, right. But the book value has that $4.2 million in there. Yes. It's Peter. I'll take that. We actually have a number of choices still in the market. But there are definitely some folks that are on the sidelines that are facing redemptions. And so, they're interested in accumulating more life science product, but they can't necessarily play right now. But that's been filled in by some other new folks coming in that want exposure that are also high-quality institutional investors. And yes, we have liquidity, and I'm not too concerned about that at this point. I think it will get better once there's more certainty in where the terminal rate is going to land and where cost of capital is so people get comfortable in spending their allocations for '23. Yes. Certainly, there are -- there have been -- there has been spec building, especially in Boston. What we are seeing is in areas outside of our core submarkets where we don't own product, there are vacant buildings sitting there. And it's -- we're hearing that there's no tours, there's no activity. So, we don't necessarily think that those buildings are competitive to ours. There are a few projects, obviously, that we do believe, and that's where those percentages are coming in. So obviously, '23, a lot of stuff has already been delivered. There's some more coming in '24, there's more coming. We are seeing very little that is starting new today. I think there was one project in South San Francisco that has started recently, which is just beyond comprehension. But outside of that, we believe that anything that would compete in -- of our quality is in our numbers and that we don't think many, if any, people will start new projects from here on out, at least not in a material manner, but who knows? Well, it was a fairly low yield. So we're giving away not too much upside by selling part of it, right? And are the investors that we attracted really like the building, and it was an opportunity to fund something that was near-term dollars. So it made a lot of sense. Yes. I mean there was one nuance to kind of focus us on 275 Grove, which was when we acquired that, there was a thought an opportunity to expand our holdings in that neighborhood and in fact, adjacent to it. So we in addition to high-barrier to enter, we also really are focused on aggregating into mega emphasis and the opportunity to do that wasn't attractive enough for us to move forward. And so we ended up with this kind of stand-alone asset, which is a really good office asset. But you have to start prioritizing and that one just kind of lost some of it shine when the opportunity to expand kind of went away. That's a hard question to answer because it's pretty -- would be pretty granular for me to understand when I'm looking at leasing reports remembering what is expiring today versus in the future. But I believe our early renewal statistics have been fairly strong recently. So, I guess the short answer is, I don't -- I haven't noticed anything. We are constantly in communication with the regions about their upcoming renewals in a year to two years, even three years ahead at times, our -- what's the status of the Company and are they expanding? And do we want in the portfolio or not. And so, we're pretty aware. And if I think -- if there was some weakness there, I think I would have probably noticed it by now. Just some new recent starts and one, large one in particular in South San Francisco, you made up most of that change. It is just uncanny that people are still trying to put new products into the queue in a market that has a lot of vacancy. We're fortunate we have one project moving that is kind of a good niche for earlier-stage companies, mid-stage companies, so we don't have to go on an elephant hunt to lease some really large project, but there's a lot of folks out there that are going to be in a lot of trouble because of what I would think is fairly reckless investing."

            "name": "Dean Shigenaga",
            "content": "Thanks Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported excellent operating and financial results that exceeded consensus with strong core results, and our team is off to a strong start towards a solid growth for 2023. Our client tenants continued very timely payment of rent year-to-date through April. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have meaningfully reduced uses of capital for 2023, made excellent progress on dispositions and sales of partial interest, have a conservative FFO payout ratio and a growing dividend and are the go-to brand for life science real estate. We have a very strong balance sheet with $5.3 billion in liquidity, no debt maturities until 2025. Our team made excellent progress on our dispositions and sales of partial interest only four months into 2023. As Peter highlighted, we've advanced transactions aggregating $865 million. They're either completed or subject to executed LOIs or purchase and sales agreements, including the new JV partner for our build-to-suit project for UI Lilly. Many of the in-process transactions are targeted to close on or about June 30. Now we have also identified other dispositions and sales of partial interest to bring our total for the year to $1.5 billion. While the macro environment remains challenging, we are reasonably optimistic that we can execute on our disposition plan in 2023 at attractive values and cap rates. We will provide values and cap rates quarter-to-quarter as we close transactions since we're unable to do so sooner while transactions are in process. In addition to the $1.5 billion in dispositions and sales of partial interest, New JV capital forecasted for the full year of 2023 will contribute over $300 million towards construction spend this year, including most of the $119 million of contributions from the new partner we just added to our build-to-suit project for Eli Lilly. Now JV contributions to construction spend, including forecasted joint ventures were added to our detailed disclosures on Page 48 of our supplemental package. Now turning to outstanding financial and operating results, we had really strong growth of $342.9 million or up 13.9% in total revenues for the first quarter annualized in comparison to the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis was up $246.2 million or 15.4% really strong growth of 6.8% in FFO per share for the quarter in comparison to the first quarter of 2022, again, off to a very strong start and on track for 6.4% growth in FFO per share for 2023. Now key highlights of our continued strong operating and financial performance Strong growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share was driven by the continued strength across key areas of our unique and differentiated business. We had continued strength and timely payment of rent from our client tenants, 99.9% and for the first quarter and 99.7% for April that was through April 21, only three weeks into this month, pretty amazing. Continued strength in same-property NOI growth of 3.7%, 9% on a cash basis and really reflects the benefit of strong rental rate growth on leasing in recent quarters, contractual annual escalations in rent and the burn-off of some free rent. Our outlook -- our strong outlook for 2023 same-property NOI growth is 3% on a GAAP basis, 5% on a cash basis and generally consistent with our strong 10-year average for same property growth. Now turning to record rental rate growth and strong leasing volume, strong rental rate growth continued into 2023 at 48.3% on a GAAP basis, 24.2% on a cash basis from lease renewals and re-leasing the space in the first quarter. Now this was an exceptional rental rate growth, GAAP at the highest in the Company's history, both GAAP and cash rental rate growth higher than the strong rental rate growth for the full year of 2022 and 2021. Now leasing volume for the first quarter was strong at 1.2 million rentable square feet, slightly ahead of the strong quarterly average of leasing volume prior to the exceptional record-level leasing volume in both 2021 and 2022. Now the key takeaway is that the scale of our high-quality tenant roster combined with operational excellence from our team, puts us in an excellent position to benefit from the unique pool of demand from our client tenants even in this unusual macro environment. Now our strong occupancy was in line with our expectations. Occupancy was 96 -- 93.6% as of March 31 and really in line with expectations and the comments I provided on our year-end earnings call. There are three key takeaways here. First, occupancy is expected to improve in the back half of the year. Second, 371,000 rentable square feet of the recent vacancy has significant rental rate growth of 110% on a GAAP basis and 115% on a cash basis; and third, 29% of this 371,000 rentable square feet has already been leased with occupancy of some of the space beginning in the third quarter of '23. Please refer to Footnote 1 on Page 26 of our supplemental package for more information. We also absorbed $71,000 of vacancy from a building located in Texas. This is one of two buildings that were undergoing redevelopment last quarter, one building, aggregating 131,000 rentable square feet is currently 36% pre-leased and undergoing redevelopment. We decided to hold on further redevelopment of the second building, aggregating 71,000 rentable square feet until we lease up the remainder of the 131,000 rentable square foot building. The 71,000 rentable square foot building is vacant and is classified in operating properties. We continued with very strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. Briefly on a high-quality tenant roster, Alexander really is the brand for life science real estate, has built long-term trusted relationships and is a true partner to the life science industry. 90% of our top 20 tenants are investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies. And we highlighted continued strength of timely payments of rent from client tenants at 99.9% of rent that was due in the first quarter really reflects the strength of our high-quality client tenants, important tenant relationships and the high-quality underwriting from our research team. Briefly on venture investments, realized gains from the venture investments included in FFO averaged about $25.8 million per quarter for the last eight quarters through the end of 2022 in comparison to $20.7 million for the first quarter of 2023. Now we do expect realized gains each quarter from our venture investments for the remainder of '23 to be more consistent to slightly up from the historical quarterly average of $25.8 million that I just highlighted. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of March 31 were $459 million on a cost basis of $1.2 billion. Now we've got continued consistency and growth in dividends from really high-quality cash flows we generate in our business. We've got a very low and conservative FFO payout ratio, 55% for the first quarter annualized with 5.3% increases in common stock dividends over the last 12 months. We're projecting $375 million in net cash flows from operating activities after dividends for reinvestment. At this rate, this represents over $1.1 billion of capital for reinvestment over the next three years. Briefly on external growth, we have $610 million of incremental net operating income from our pipeline of 6.7 million square feet that is 74% leased. Approximately 30% of this NOI will commence in the remaining three quarters of 2023, about 40% will commence in 2024, about 26% in 2025 and the remaining 4% thereafter. Now turning to guidance. We updated our underlying guidance assumptions for 2023. These assumptions are disclosed on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Our per share outlook for 2023 was updated to plus or minus $0.05 of a range from the midpoint of guidance, down from the plus or minus $0.10 range last quarter. Our range of guidance for EPS is $2.21 and to $2.31 and a range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $8.91 to $9.01 with no change at the midpoint of $8.96. Now this represents a strong 6.4% growth in FFO per share for 2023 following excellent growth last year of 8.5%. Now key updates on the underlying detailed assumptions included the following: a significant reduction of $325 million in both sources and uses of capital, including a $75 million reduction in the midpoint of acquisitions to $225 million and a $250 million reduction in construction spend at $2.725 billion. We also gave updates on significant dispositions and partial interest sales aggregating $865 million including significant transactions that are under executed LOIs and purchase and sale agreements. Now rental rate growth on lease renewals, re-lease in this space was increased 1% for both GAAP and cash to a range of 28% to 33% for GAAP and 12% to 17% on cash and occupancy was adjusted 20 basis points to reflect vacancy from 170,000 rentable square foot building located in Texas that is on hold while we lease up the adjacent building under redevelopment that is currently 36% leased. Importantly, occupancy is expected to recover in the second half of 2023. With that, let me turn it back to Joel Marcus. Thank you. Yes. So Steve, -- so the huge majority of the change was really due to a simple future mega campus development project that we acquired. It's a retail project known as the shops at 10 Fran. That was almost all of the change in the tenancy from roughly 1,000 to 850. You're right. Beyond that, like we highlighted, not just during this call, but over the last couple of quarters, we've had, as you would always expect some normal lease expirations that occur at the end where the tenant doesn't choose to extend. And that's fairly normal activity. And then we've also had a few tenants that have come back, as you guys are well aware and have come back to and their lease a little bit early. But that was really a handful of leases over the last couple of quarters. I think the big takeaway though is, look, you know that we do a really good job at selecting really high-quality locations in the core of the life science cluster markets. So, great locations, great facilities, and I think our operational excellence and our brand puts us in a great position to capture mark-to-market on most of these spaces that have come back. I mean the comments I provided on the vacancies that came up just in the first quarter alone with mark-to-market, both GAAP and cash north of 100%. And 29% of that space has already been leased. If you go back to my comments in the fourth quarter, I believe I gave similar comments of pre-leasing on space that had just rolled as well. So, we've got good activity. And again, going back to the crux of your question, Steve, almost all that change in the tenancy was retail related at that shopping mall. Meaning if we were to mark-to-market the rental rate, Steve, on the whole portfolio? Yes, it's somewhere around -- I think last quarter, it was somewhere around 27%. This quarter, it's closer to 22% overall in the whole portfolio. Tony, it's Dean here. So you're referring to the Page 34 for others on the call, which is in the bottom right-hand corner. This page highlights square footage of our operating, but most importantly, the different categories of our pipeline, everything from construction to the future. There's no significant cash flows from assets that are sitting in the pipeline. I just want to make clear that there's a line item that adjusts the future pipeline for square footage that's sitting in operations, but those cash flows are in the operating portfolio of, Tony, as you pick up that NOI to value the Company. We just don't want you to double count the square footage as you go towards the future pipeline. But from an NOI perspective, if that's your fundamental question, the future pipeline doesn't have any significant NOI being generated at the moment. We'll wait a second, the $4.2 million is in rental properties today. It's in operations, Tony. I thought you were asking about the $38 million right above it. $37.889 million Correct. So you don't want to double count the square footage there. That's why we net down the square footage in that disclosure to 30 -- roughly $34 million. The book value would only have it to the extent it's not related to the operating component, Tony? It's in operations, the book value would be sitting in the operating component if a larger campus had two operating buildings and a pad to support two buildings, the pad to support the future buildings would be in the future pipeline, the book basis, but the cost base is related to the operating buildings would be in operations, not in the pipeline. Well, I don't know that -- I mean, it's interesting the way you posed the question. Maybe I'll start from the back end of your question. Flexing capital plan and turning to equity as a solution is not really something we are contemplating. I think the way to look at our capital point is what we are doing internally, like we did in the current quarter for earnings as well as over the last several quarters and prep for initial guidance for Investor Day this year was to really challenge the uses of capital. I think one thing to keep in mind is that -- our pipeline is $610 million of incremental net operating income from projects that are highly leased today. There's so much equity type capital that's invested in CIP today, there's very little incremental equity needed to fund that pipeline. And so, we're looking at spend across other projects as we look forward over into '24 and beyond to be sure we're prioritizing things that we should be investing into and maybe holding on things that we shouldn't be just given the macro environment. So, hopefully, that gives you just some color on how we're thinking more broadly about it. I think, as I mentioned on the call earlier, we're mindful of the macro environment. We're also in a position where we know where we are here at the end of April with a lot of good activity on the pipeline. And so, we're reasonably comfortable with our outlook into 2023 and we'll obviously provide an update as we go quarter-to-quarter, but a bulk of what we have under executed LOI or PSA agreements today is sliding to close here fairly soon, plus or minus mid-year. So we feel good about it, and we'll keep an eye on things as we go through the next two quarters. Yes. Well, it's all reflected in our guidance. We just gave -- so you saw there was no changes in capped interest down in the details, obviously, if you -- we did on a number of projects review strategically what we wanted to do and a number of them were put on temporary hold. If you want to look at it from that perspective, redevelopments were placed into operations as vacant assets, development projects for the future for -- they have been paused on a few circumstances, which basically were left in the future development pipeline. From a capitalization perspective, that operating building that went in -- I'm sorry, the redevelopment building that's vacant that went into operations capitalization ceased immediately. The other projects have activities that are winding down as we speak, meaning capitalization will cease over the next month to a number of months going forward. But they're all basically shutting down in the near term in the scheme of things, they're relatively small. So, we've been able to absorb that. It sits within our range of guidance. It sits within our range of FFO with other assumptions offsetting those changes. So, we are able to pick up some improvement to offset those. So hopefully, that gives you a sense. I mean we look at qualifying activities carefully across all of our projects that are undergoing construction activities and capped interest and shut them down accordingly. So you will see some of that, but they're fairly small in the scheme of this. Rich, it's Dean Shigenaga here. So you said $7.6 million... I see what number you're referring to. So you were referring to the pipeline that's under construction, 5.5 million square feet, plus another $1.2 million near term. Those are all 100% pre-leased projects. So that ties to the $610 million for others of incremental net operating income. We haven't broken out that number for '24 to spend just related to that, but that's not -- within that bucket now we've slimmed down the focus of what is continuing to generate the $610 million of NOI. And for the most part, Rich, for the most part, those are either 100% leased projects or multi-tenant projects, most of which have some level of pre-leasing. Some that don't have pre-leasing today are multi-tenant projects anywhere from a building to multiple buildings. So rightsized for delivery to requirements in the market, they're not lumpy, large build-to-suit opportunities that could be more specific to larger requirements. So I guess, a long way of saying, Rich, I think we feel comfortable with what we've rightsized for the pipeline of activity. The construction spend, plus or minus will play out like a normal curve for spend over that pipeline, roughly two years from the start of new projects, the active pipelines part way through that already. So -- what you're really focused on, though, in your question is a spend outside of that, which goes to quite a bit of activity, site work, advancing site work as well as entitlements. Entitlements are important. They add a lot of value. Site work shrinks the time to deliver buildings to a tenant, which if you looked at us two years ago, we said, let's move that along. If you look at us today, we'd say, well, let's think carefully about site work given cost of capital considerations with the macro environment today, and let's just hold on that until the right time. And so, I think we're going to look hard, as I mentioned earlier, over the next couple of quarters. We continue to refine our plan for 2024 because as I mentioned earlier, the $610 million of pipe, that pipeline does not require much more equity capital at stabilization because we have so much already in CIP which the incremental EBITDA will allow us to debt fund leverage neutral, the wide majority of the incremental capital for that pipeline such more general TIs kind of renovation costs that aren't part of development and redevelopment that we need to scrutinize in our business. Rich, it's here. I think the way to think about at a high level is that we just close the conversation about the pipeline 6.7 million square feet under construction or including 1.2 million to start in the near term here. That's a lot of product. And we just completed a lot of product over the last two or three years. So, we have added a lot of high-quality assets to our portfolio in recent years as well as coming online here over the next two to three years. So put off a piece of the portfolio makes sense. And we're mindful of your question, but we have so much coming online and that we have completed in recent years. I think we feel we're in pretty good shape. It's reflective of where we usually start at the beginning of the year. If you look back over time, I think we've enjoyed the opportunity to move rental rate growth and same-property performance northward as we make our way through the year. And so, a combination of settling in on activity this quarter, as well as our continued outlook for the remainder of the year, so slight improvement overall. Yes, nothing significant in the quarter. Well, I mean, a couple of years back now, I think it was two years ago, Jamie, we took -- the market was able to deliver on some unique liquidity events within the portfolio, and we had something just north of $200 million in realized gains. Now, our policy has been these large significant unusual items. They're one-off. There aren't events that we control. And those, as you go back about $100 million of that was excluded from FFO per share. These were individually very significant gains. But that's just one example as a historical data point, Jamie, is -- but if you look back for now, I think this would be the third year that we're into this run rate right at about $100 million, $105 million on average, I think, for the last couple of years. And that's kind of the general outlook other than having a slightly lower number for the first quarter."

The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder of Alexandria. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thank you, Paul, and welcome everybody to Alexandria's third quarter earnings call. I'm here today with Hallie, Peter, and Marc. And first of all, as I do every quarter I want to extend a profound thank you and huge congratulations to each and every member of our Alexandria\u2019s family team for bringing it this third quarter to post an impressive operating and financial performance in a continuingly stubborn economic and operating environment to the team. You're an inspiration to me each and every day in small ways and large. Thank you. The continuingly stubborn economic backdrop for commercial real estate and risk on investments, Peter and Marc will address those, but let me just give you a couple of quick comments driven by the huge and unnecessary federal deficits over the last handful of years $9 trillion plus, inflation in many areas remain sticky, stubborn and structural despite what the Labor Department is saying and reporting. Our cost of capital is also stubbornly high across much of the equity and debt capital markets again despite the delayed and rather feeble responses of the Fed to date. And Main Street is hurting in the United States, it's pretty clear. Hallie will comment more in-depth on Life Science Industry, but let me say a couple of things I've said many times in the past. This is one of the few crown remaining crown jewel industries here in the United States and is the great bastion of true and novel innovation. And the only real and effective path to solve and address over 90% of human diseases which remained unsolved today, which bear an unbearable burden on our citizens and our healthcare system is the translation of this innovation. Since the downward spiral biotech began in early 2021 and kind of hit its bottom in what appears to be October of 2023 and after almost decade of bull-run from 2014 through 2021. Unfortunately, the industry attracted and almost became drug addicted to too many and too free of capital flowing in and some of the really stupid and outrageous monies both from the Fed and investors which caused a rocket ship demand for exit of what it normally is and really not wanted and sustainable. And since then things have settled down. Here we are almost 4 years later since the XBI started to tail-off in February 2021 and we're in a really a highly, I would say and toughly disciplined funding market but one in which I personally prefer to operate. As an example of this market to [PDD] less than half the biotech IPOs from 2013 to 2019, remain standalone companies, majority of either seen successful exits which is awesome, less successful exits which is less than awesome or disappeared altogether which is not awesome. Couple of thoughts my take on the third quarter, a truly operationally excellent results both operationally and financially and the continuing strong balance sheet management with great liquidity and kudos to our team. Still in a very difficult supply and demand impacted market with a challenging cost of capital. In the third quarter, we continue to deliver increasing FFO per share and dividends per share growth despite the tough environment. And I think one of my key takes is the -- our strong year to date rental rate growth which is I think pretty exceptional. We continue with strong continued high occupancy, collections nearly 100% which is sensational. And I think what truly stands out in this Q3 is the leasing activity of almost 1.5 million rentable square feet, at a 48% increase quarter-to-quarter. Future embedded NOI growth of $510 million which Marc will talk about and our very successful self-funding capital recycling program, this year, which Peter and Marc will talk about. Going forward and finally, as the master investor Warren Buffett has said, a truly great business must have an enduring mode. And out of the depths of this bear market like I was -- like we experienced and I feel, like the 2010 era of this market. I still remain more optimistic than ever about the promise of unprecedented human health innovation from our precious industry, assuming the government doesn't screw it up and Alexandria continuing at the vanguard of this industry to build, the really building the future of life-saving and life-changing innovation. And finally, let me just say a couple more words before I turn it over to Hallie. Much as predicted, as we predicted the doubling of our revenues from 2017 to 2021, which we exceeded during an unprecedented bull market on the back of our strategic -- well our I think long developed strategy on the back of our development pipeline created during the depths of the aftermath of the great financial crisis when we really conceived of it in the 2010 to 2013 era. In five short years by the end of this decade December 2029, our revenues will be overwhelmingly driven by our unique and highly competitive mega campuses, best locations, best assets, best services, that also compete and clearly demonstrates superior return on investment, higher occupancy, higher rental rates, best talent recruitment or retention for our tenants and a multiple and very convenient path for growth. And so with that I'll turn it over to Hallie.\nHallie Kuhn: Thank you, Joel. This is Hallie Kuhn, Senior Vice President of Life Science and Capital Markets. This afternoon, we will provide an update on the life science industry, starting with FDA approvals and followed by a review of the current funding environment across our diverse life science tenant base. Taking a moment to reflect on the immense impact of the biopharma industry, since 2013 there have been 519 novel medicines approved by the FDA. Nearly half specifically 257 of these approvals have been developed or commercialized by Alexandria tenants. That's 257 approvals that have extended and improved lives, and is what inspires Alexandria's deeply held mission supporting the companies at the leading edge of life science innovation. Let's look at an example that will resonate for every person on this call who has personally experienced or supported loved ones with cancer. In the 1990s, the FDA created an approval process known as the Accelerated Approval Pathway with the goal of accelerating access to medicines for diseases with no effective medicines. Over the recent 16-year period, 69 cancer medicines were approved for the FDA's Accelerated Approval Pathway. These medicines have treated an estimated 911,000 patients, and led to 262,000 additional years of life. That is more than a quarter million years of lives saved. It's truly stunning. Now turning to life science fundamentals. Venture capital deployment to private biotech tenants which is 10% of our ARR is healthy. This year is tracking to eclipse 2023 and maybe the third highest year on record. As Joel mentioned, investors are highly disciplined, focused on rational valuations, de-risk technologies, and near-term milestones. The translation to demand on the ground is steady and conservative, transitioning to a just in time model for space. Scale and flexibility are core to this growth model and is why Alexandria's distinctive mega campus strategy is extremely well-positioned to meet this trend in demand. With respect to pre-commercial public biotech companies, 9% of our ARR, follow-on financing is robust, already clinching the second highest year on record. These financings are focused on the subset of companies with compelling clinical data, while those without clear catalyst continue to struggle to access additional capital. The IPO market has also narrowly opened, particularly for companies with meaningful assets derisked with clinical data. The number of IPOs through Q3 2024 has surpassed 2023 and over half of the companies that went public this year are trading above their issue price. Further opening of the IPO markets will be a positive indicator for future leasing demand as these companies grow and as investor and Board conservatism thaws more broadly. Commercial stage public biopharma, which makes up 16% ARR and large multinational pharma, which makes up around 20% ARR continue to commit considerable dollars to R&D, both to internal programs and externally via partnerships and M&A. Importantly, they remain very well capitalized with over $200 billion cash on hand amongst the Top 25 biopharma. Next, life science product service and device tenants, which represent 20% ARR. Notably, the BIOSECURE Act has passed the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate. If passed, the legislation will limit utilization of select Chinese contract research organizations. We view this legislation as largely positive. It includes grandfathering provisions to minimize near-term impact to biopharma, while creating an incentive for U.S.-based contract manufacturing and research organizations to onshore capabilities. Long-term, this could provide a tailwind for demand across this segment. Last, Biomedical and Government Institutions, which represent 12% ARR. Institutions continue to be the catalyst for early discoveries that form the next generation of medicines. As our sale of 1165 Eastlake to the Fred Hutch Cancer Institute in our Seattle region and their expansion into our neighboring 1201 and 1208 Eastlake buildings reflect, these institutions plant deep long-term roots focused on the right location, right ecosystem, right infrastructure, and trusted relationship with landlord partners such as Alexandria. Widening the lens on healthcare more broadly as we conclude, of the $4.5 trillion in healthcare costs annually spent in the U.S., less than 15% goes towards medicines. To put that in perspective, nearly 25% of healthcare spend is estimated to be on unnecessarily or wasted administrative spend. All to say that Novel medicines have the incredible opportunity to both have a positive impact on individuals' health and drive long-term savings to the healthcare system by preventing, managing and even curing the thousands of diseases with limited or no treatment options. With that, I will pass it over to Peter.\nPeter Moglia: Thank you, Hallie. Before I get into my update on the development pipeline, leasing, supply, and asset sales, I wanted to comment on the improving health of the office market because it's helpful to life science real estate in a couple of ways. First, a healthy -- can create competition for life science tenants as tech tenants have historically been attracted to our locations and centers of innovation, and the appeal of our floor plates, ceiling heights and amenities. Second, office offers and alternative for some of the misguided life science real estate supply that's been added since the pandemic. We are seeing it real time with the boom of the office leasing taking place in Mission Bay. OpenAI completed a 490,000 square-foot sublease at our 1455-1515 Third Street property in the fourth quarter of 2023 and last quarter added another 315,000 square feet at the neighboring 550 Terry Francois Building, which by the way was being marketed as lab space. Our understanding is that two other tenants that were competing for that building, including a tech company, and that one of them is now negotiating at Mission Rock, which was also once identified as Future Lab Supply. In the third quarter, we delivered 316,000 square feet of development, redevelopment pipeline, 100% leased with 100% of the space contained in mega campuses located in our high barrier-to-entry submarkets. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the quarter equaled $21 million bringing the year-to-date total to $63 million. The weighted average stabilized yield of the deliveries was strong at 7.7%. After a strong second quarter, development and redevelopment leasing was light at 39,121 square feet, bringing the total for the year to 480,342 square feet. We suspect the result was driven by the fact that most of the space available for lease in the pipeline won't be available for occupancy until 2026 or later. In today's market, project leasing accelerates as projects near completion as illustrated by our 2024 and 2025 deliveries being 91% leased. Projects expected to stabilize in 2026 and beyond are 35% leased, and overall activity in these projects is encouraging because most of them are in Greater Boston, and we have active proposals or touring activity at each one of them. Transitioning to leasing and supply, overall leasing volume was very robust at 1.49 million square feet, up 33% quarter-over-quarter. This leasing was significantly driven by renewals with a strong 84% retention rate, which illustrates the power of our mega campus platform, and trust in our brand built by our internal long-tenured asset services teams providing unmatched operational excellence, and know-how in the running of our mission-critical facilities. GAAP and cash rental increases were 1.5% and 5.1% respectively, influenced materially by a large non-laboratory lease renewal with a high-credit tech tenant. Although the increases were modest, we are pleased with the longer lease durations coming in at a weighted average of 9.7 years for renewed and released space. On competitive supply, as a reminder, 2024 is going to be the peak year for new deliveries and most of that has been delivered through the third quarter. Inclusive of 2026, there is approximately 8 million square feet of competitive supply remaining to be delivered in our three largest markets. In Greater Boston, approximately 200,000 square feet will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024 and it is 100% leased. In 2025, 2.4 million square feet is anticipated to be delivered and that space is 65% pre-leased. In 2026, another 900,000 square feet will be delivered in Greater Boston and it's 3.5% leased. In San Francisco Bay Region, 300,000 square feet will be delivered in the fourth quarter and it's 0% leased. In 2025, 1.7 million square feet will be delivered and it's currently 23% leased. We are not tracking anything to be delivered in the Bay Area for 2026. In San Diego, 1.3 million square feet will be delivered in the fourth quarter and it's 50% leased. 700,000 square feet is expected to deliver in 2025 and it's 23% leased. And in 2026, we expect to see 400,000 square feet of competitive supply to be delivered and it's 100% leased. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. We've commented on the past two calls that our value harvesting transactions will be heavily weighted towards the end of the year. With respect to the third quarter, we closed on just north of $300 million of asset sale transactions highlighted by the sale of 1165 Eastlake Avenue East, a core asset in the Lake Union submarket of Seattle. As you know, it's not our intent to sell core assets, but this transaction offered several constructive attributes. First, as Hallie mentioned, the sale was to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, which is one of the most prestigious clinical research institutions in the world and it afforded us an opportunity to recapitalize our neighboring 1201 and 12080 Slake Avenue East assets with them as well taking out an existing partner at a gain. This was a fantastic opportunity for us to deepen our relationship with the Hutch, who is a major driver of life science real estate demand in the region. Second, the transaction provided for early renewals at those recap properties inclusive of a 20 year lease term at 1201 East Lake, where the Hutch occupies the entire 106,000 square foot building. Third, it provides price discovery upon which analysts and investors can evaluate the NAV of our core assets. We acknowledge that this was a user sale, but any rational buyer is going to require pricing in the neighborhood of market value, so we think the 4.9% capitalization rate and 1,499 per square foot value is representative of the value of our core mega campus assets. Rounding out the third quarter transaction was the completion of the previously announced $60 million sale of 219 East 42nd Street, New York City and the sale of 14255 New Brook Drive in Northern Virginia at a 7.4% cap rate, a workhorse asset that no longer fits into our strategy, but is a testament to the enduring value of our asset base as we acquired it pre-IPO. As we look-forward, we expect to end the year strong with several value harvesting transactions on tap to close before year end. We have $577.2 million of dispositions that are subject to non-refundable deposits. Those assets include a retail development on excess land we owned in Maryland, a one-off Class B asset in our Greater Stanford submarket that will be redeveloped for another use, a one-off office building that was part of a land assemblage in the suburbs of Boston, a pair of buildings in the Research Triangle located outside of our core mega campuses and a set of buildings in the suburbs of Greater Boston, which will be sold to a user. Rounding out our fourth quarter dispositions are assets that are subject to executed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements. Approximately 48% of the 600 and $2.5 million in sales proceeds expected from these transactions come from our land bank and are expected to be developed for residential use. The balance is a pair of buildings that will be demolished for residential development and a set of non-core standalone assets in Cambridge that will require significant capital to release and no longer fit into our strategy. With that, I'll pass it over to Marc.\nMarc Binda: Thank you, Peter. This is Marc Binda, CFO. Hello, and good afternoon everyone. We reported solid operating and financial results for the second quarter. Total revenues and NOI for 3Q \u201924 were up 10.9% and 12.5% respectively over 3Q \u201923, primarily driven by solid same-property performance, and continued execution of our development and redevelopment strategy. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the quarter was $2.37, up 4.9% over 3Q '23, and is in line with consensus. Our solid operating results for the quarter were driven by our disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy, tremendous scale, longstanding tenant relationships, and operational excellence by our team. 76% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses. We have high-quality cash flows with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade and publicly traded large-cap tenants. Collections remained very high at 99.9%, and adjusted EBITDA margins continued to be strong at 70% for the quarter. An important takeaway for the quarter should be the very strong leasing volume results. Leasing volume for the quarter was 1.5 million square feet, which was up 48% over the trailing four-quarter average, and was the highest quarterly volume since 4Q '22. We continue to benefit from our tremendous scale, high-quality tenant roster, and brand loyalty with 80% of our leasing activity over the last 12-months coming from our existing deep well of approximately 800 tenant relationships. The rental rate increases for the first 9-months of 2024 were strong at 16.4% and 8.9% on a cash basis. And our outlook for rental rate growth for the full year '24 remains solid at 11% to 19%, and 5% to 13% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing the space for the quarter was 5.1% and 1.5% on a cash basis. We did highlight the renewal of an acquired lease in Texas for tech R&D space that did weigh down the numbers during the quarter. During the quarter, we also achieved very healthy lease terms on completed leases, which were almost 10 years on average. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to in place leases for our entire asset base remained solid at about 10%. Tenant improvements and leasing commissions on second generation leasing as a percentage of starting cash rent were around 8% this quarter, which is less than our historical average over the last 3 years of about 9%. Our total non-revenue enhancing expenditures, which includes tenant improvements on renewals and releasing the space is expected to be in the 10% to 11% range as a percentage of net operating income in 2024, which this amount is below our 5 year average of 15% and is lower than that of several other REIT sectors and really highlights the durable nature of our laboratory infrastructure. This is the third year in a row that we've been in the 10% to 13% range, although we do expect next year to be higher given some larger repositioning projects on the horizon. Turning to same-property results, same-property NOI growth for 3Q24 was solid at 1.5% 6.5% on a cash basis, really driven by solid rental rate increases, a pickup in occupancy and some burn-off of free rent. Our outlook for the full year 2024 same-property growth is consistent with our last update at solid growth of 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the midpoints of our guidance. We do expect some pressure on fourth quarter same-property results resulting from a lease termination that occurred at 409 Illinois Street in our Mission Bay submarket where the lease will be expiring at the beginning of 2025 and we expect little to no rent in the fourth quarter of '24. As a reminder, our same-property results do include 100% of consolidated results. So even though we only have a 25% interest in this particular property, the approximately $17 million of annual rental revenue going away related to this tenant in the fourth quarter will be fully reflected in same-property results, even though the bottom line FFO results will only pick up our 25% share. Turning to occupancy, for the quarter, occupancy was very solid at 94.7%, which is up 10 basis points over the prior quarter and continues the steady results over the last four quarters. We expect year-end occupancy to be on the low end of our guidance range of 94.6% to 95.6%. On lease expirations, our team has done a great job of addressing the 24 lease expirations with very strong leasing volume again completed in the quarter of 1.5 million square feet and the unresolved lease expirations remaining for the balance of 2024 are modest at only 134,000 rentable square feet. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2025, we highlighted a few key lease expirations spread across four projects aggregating 768,000 rentable square feet with $47 million of annual rental revenue that are expected to have 12 to 24-months of downtime on a weighted average basis. 75% to 80% of the total $47 million annual rental revenue is related to our Alexandria Technology Square and 409 Illinois Street projects, which are expected to remain as operating properties with the same-property pool following the lease expiration, even though these spaces may require some time and capital to release or reposition the buildings for multi-tenancy. The Alexandria Technology Square project primarily relates to the move out of Moderna and the expansion to their new 462,000 square foot building we delivered late last year at 325 Binney. And we are in early discussions with the tenant to lease approximately half of the 409 Illinois Street property. Please refer to footnote 4 on Page 24 of our supplemental package for additional details there. On external growth, during the quarter, we continued to execute on our development and redevelopment strategy by delivering 316,691 rentable square feet from the pipeline, which will generate $21 million of incremental annual net operating income. We have 5.5 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are 55% leased or negotiating, and are projected to generate $510 million of incremental net operating income over the next 3.5 years, including $158 million over the next five quarters. Transitioning next to the balance sheet, we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets amongst all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our corporate credit ratings are in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. We remain on track to achieve our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 5.1x on a quarterly annualized basis by year-end. We have tremendous liquidity of $5.4 billion, and our attractive debt profile highlights our commitment to long-term funding of our business with a weighted average remaining term of debt of 12.6 years and average year-end percentage of fixed-rate debt over the last 5 years of 97.7%. We continue to focus on our disciplined funding strategy to recycle capital from dispositions, and to minimize the issuance of common stock. Common stock issuances have amounted to less than 2% of our total funding sources in 2023 and 2024, and we do not expect to issue any new equity in the fourth quarter of 2024. Our disposition strategy for 2024 is focused primarily on outright dispositions of non-core assets not integral to our mega campus strategy, allowing us to enhance the quality of our asset base and include stabilized properties, non-stabilized properties with vacancy or near-term lease expirations, and land parcels. To date, we've completed $319 million of asset sales, including the sale Peter mentioned at 1165 Eastlake Avenue, which is located in our Lake Union Submarket that was sold to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute. We have another $1.2 billion of pending dispositions subject to non-refundable deposits or executed letters of intent or PSA agreements. About half of the pending dispositions represent stabilized property sales, most of which are expected to be sold to users with a blended expected capitalization rate of 8.5% and 7% on a cash basis.  The other half represents the sales of land and properties with vacancy or near-term lease expirations. The 3Q \u201824 annualized NOI associated with the $1.2 billion of pending sales is $95.8 million $91 million on a cash basis. It's important to note that the $95.8 million is a backwards-looking amount, and does not consider certain lease expirations for some of the non-stabilized properties expected to occur over the next 12-months, including a significant amount of non-laboratory space. On a forward-looking 12 months basis for these non-stabilized disposition assets, we expect that NOI will decline by $30 million to $35 million. And given that these assets no longer fit our strategy, we've elected to sell these assets and allow the buyer to invest the capital to reposition those assets. Included in the $1.2 billion pending dispositions are 2 key items aggregating nearly $700 million. First, a suburban campus with specialty non-traditional lab space in our Greater Boston market to the existing tenant for $369 million which represents a 6.3% cash cap rate, and second various sites in Sorrento Mesa and University Town Center to residential developers for $314 million which will allow us to monetize some of our future pipeline without adding to the lab supply. The aggregate total of the completed and pending dispositions is $1.5 billion which puts us right around the mid-point of our guidance and we're reasonably confident we can close all of this by the end of the year. We also expect to fund a meaningful amount of our equity needs with retaining cash flows from operating activities after dividends of $450 million at the mid-point of our guidance for 2024 and our high quality cash flows continue to support the growth in our annual common stock dividends with an average annual increase in dividends per share of 5.4% since 2020 and we continue to have a conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for 3Q\u201924. Realized gains for the venture investments, including FFO per share as adjusted for the quarter, were $23 million and $85.2 million for the nine months ended September. Quarterly realized gains since 2021 have averaged about $25 million. Through the first three quarters of 2024, we've averaged about $28 million so pretty close to the historical run rate and consistent with our guidance range for the full year of $95 million to $125 million. Turning to guidance, there were a few moving pieces in our underlying guidance, including lower straight line rent revenue and lower G&A, which we highlighted on Page 5 of our supplemental. We've updated our guidance for 2024 for EPS of $2.60 to $2.64 and we maintained the midpoint of our guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $9.47, which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share for 2024. As we look ahead beyond 3Q \u201824, we continue to have conviction to reinforce our core through our differentiated mega campus strategy, which is the driving force behind our disposition strategy. With 76% of our annual rental revenue coming from mega campuses today and aspirations to enhance this number over time with non-core dispositions of land and properties, as well as disciplined development and redevelopment on these mega campuses, we expect to continue increasing the quality and resilience of our dominant platform and asset base. With that, let me turn it over to you Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Okay. Paula, could you have the moderator open it up for questions please?\nPaula Schwartz: Yes, please do.\nOperator: Today's first question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with BofA Merrill Lynch.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hey, guys. I appreciate the time. I appreciated the comments on the Seattle asset sale to 4.9% and then the pending sales that are stabilized like a 7.5% cash cap rate. Is there any other like additional color you can provide on like what's driving the gap between those two? I know you touched a little bit on your opening remarks. Then maybe just like the second part of that would be like should we assume like the stuff that's not in the mega campus is stabilized maybe is closer to that 7.5% cash cap rate?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, I don't think that's a reasonable assumption, but Marc do you want to talk about Seattle and maybe how to think about?\nMarc Binda: Yes, sorry. Yes, Josh, I think on the stabilized cap rate, I think perhaps what you're referring to is, I think it was a 7% cash and 8.5% GAAP. The big reason for the delta there between cash and GAAP was the big chunk of that is the suburban Greater Boston market that actually had some really long lease term in place. So you had a pretty big spread there between cash and GAAP. But I think if you think about what to expect in terms of stabilized asset sales, we've given you the number for this year, and they're non-core. So we expect them to be wider than that.\nJoshua Dennerlein:\nA - Joel Marcus: Yes, So Marc, do you want to comment?\nMarc Binda: Josh, you're talking specifically about the Greater Boston asset.\nJoshua Dennerlein: No, I thought I heard you say like half the pending dispositions that $1.2 billion were going to be like sold for like a GAAP 8.5% at cash 7%. I was just trying to like contrast like that pool of assets versus that 4.9% that was sold in Seattle.\nMarc Binda: Right. Yes. So about half of the $1.2 billion is stabilized assets. That includes the one particular asset we mentioned in Greater Boston that, I think had a 6.3% cash cap rate and then a much wider GAAP cap rate given the long terms. The other half of the $1.2 billion is a mixture of land and also some non-stabilized properties. If you kind of reverse engineer the math, it's somewhere in the high-7s in terms of the GAAP NOI coming offline. But what I was trying to say in the prepared commentary is there's a fair amount of that NOI that for those particular assets that we're selling that happened to be in Boston that will be going away next year. And so the decision there was really to allow the buyer to invest that capital since those assets really just don't fit our strategy any longer.\nJoel Marcus: Peter, any further comments you have?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. I mean part of your question, I think referenced the 7.6% cap rate maybe that I mentioned of one of our workhorse assets versus the core asset 4.9% -- the 7.6% was in Northern Virginia. It is lab space, but it is more clinical lab space and not the R&D type of space that is in our core mega campuses.  But what I was trying to get across in my commentary was, we wanted to make sure that everyone was aware because a lot of what we've been selling has been non-core, almost everything is non-core unless it's been a partial interest sale. We haven't done a partial interest sale in a while. So we just sold a core asset in Lake Union and I explained why. And it was at a 4.9%. And even though it was a user sale, which certainly influences value. It has to be in the ballpark of market value, right? I mean from any rational buyer is not going to way overpay for anything no matter whether they are a user or not. So I thought it was a good example and reminder to everybody that we are on our way to making everything that we own or a good portion of what we own core mega campus assets. And once we're done with our disposition program, we are what we have left is highly valuable and that comp reflects that and that's what I was trying to get across.\nJoel Marcus: Yes, that's really good. And Josh just one other comment that you have to remember, so the company is 30 years old and so it's acquired, developed or redeveloped assets over a long period of time that now don't fit the go forward mega campus strategy. So that's pretty obvious.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Rich Anderson at Wedbush.\nRich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So in terms of the dollar value of what you can still do in terms of non-core assets, you mentioned 76% mega campuses. I just sort of did a 24% of your enterprise value and got to $9 billion. But I assume that's a bit simplistic, but is the pipeline for additional sales to meet your development obligations in that sort of $5 billion to $10 billion range, would you agree with that number or am I wrong?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Marc, do you want to respond to that?\nMarc Binda: Yes. I think it's true that some of that 24% of ARR that resides in non-mega campuses, some of that would be stuff that we would we may look to exit over time. But there are some really good assets in there that are located in good markets that maybe things we hang on to. The other thing I would say is that we do have some land on the books that is also not located in mega campuses. So that could also be another capital source that we look to go after. I think about 31% or so of the square footage in the land bank is not located in mega campuses.\nRich Anderson: Okay, great. And then just a quick sec question here, on the realized gains guidance for the full year, it's still over $100 million I think you've done $47 million as of the Q3 year to date. Does that imply another $50 million plus in the Q4 or am I again, am I missing something?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, you're missing it --\nMarc Binda: Yes, realized gains for the quarter were $23 million and I think we're $85.2 million for the nine months. So if you annualize that, that kind of puts you square in the middle or pretty close to the middle of our guidance range of $95 million to $125 million.\nRich Anderson: I thought I saw disclosure for $47 million year to date. I must have I'll have a relook at that.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Erroneous, yes.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Michael Griffin with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Michael. Maybe just first on the 5 year lease extension with the tech tenant in Texas. Just hoping to get some more color on that and kind of what your long term plans are if you still plan to convert this to lab space and kind of the considerations that went into that decision?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So we're under strict confidentiality as you probably can imagine. All big tech tenants don't want their name used. They don't allow you to put other tech tenants in the building. They're pretty strict in what they do. So we can say very little other than, we felt that, this renewal was integral to their own campus, which is actually adjacent to our site. These are highly improved buildings for their particular use. So they aren't just some kind of half-asset tech, office kind of thing. They're actually quite valuable and quite improved. I don't know where it goes over time, but clearly having the cash flow is better than in this market environment with cost of capital than trying to reposition them, but they may be an ultimate buyer here as well. So we'll see how the story plays out.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just on leasing more broadly, have you started to see larger space requirements, kind of demand pick up, or is it still more from the medium size 20,000 to 40,000 square foot tenants?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think it's pretty good in the early and steady on the revenue-generating side. I think in the middle is where it still remains challenging. And when you've got good clinical data run approval, generally you've got good news. And if not, you know, it's kind of sluggish. So I don't think that's materially changed.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: Yes. Thanks. Marc, I wanted to circle back on the valuations on some of the dispositions you provided to make sure I'm thinking about everything correctly. So I know on the $1.2 billion of pending sales. The supplement says there's $96 million of GAAP NOI associated to that, which reflects about 8.1% cap rate. Do you have the cash number for there? So how much cash NOI should we expect kind of goes away once those sales are completed?\nMarc Binda: Yes, that number is around $91 million, Michael.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. Great. And then Peter, in your comments earlier, you're saying once you're done with the non-core asset sales, the portfolio quality is going to be significantly improved. I mean, how much should we think about the timing of that. I mean is this going to be a longer-term process, or is there a line of sight when you kind of gave us that idea?\nJoel Marcus: Well, yes, let me say something before Peter answers. I don't think you could say the quality of the portfolio is going to be substantially improved. It is already first in class, best assets, best location, best services, best tenants. So I don't think how you're thinking about that is quite correct. We have a variety of assets, land, redevelopments, and developments that no longer fit the mega campus strategy, and will harvest those assets over the coming years as we deem appropriate to match sources and uses and also in light of the valuation in the marketplace. So that's kind of how we look at it, but Peter you could comment further.\nPeter Moglia: Yes, look, the best strategy for us to mitigate the supply that's gone into our core markets is our mega campus strategy. So we are going all in on it. And as Joel mentioned, we feel like all the assets we have are good assets, but we deem some of them to no longer be part of our strategy, and we're those are the ones that we're selling in order to fund our pipeline, which is increasing our percentage of mega campus assets. How long it's going to take is hard to say, but we're doing it incrementally as we build out our mega campus platform. It's good. We feel like it's good that we are able to fund this transition by selling assets that are no longer part of our strategy versus using common. So, the net effect is not we are funding the business without issuing common equity. And at the same time as those sales occur, we increase the percentage of our mega campus assets.\nJoel Marcus: And maintaining a great balance sheet in the meantime.\nMichael Carroll: Okay, great. And then just one last question for me. It does look like 99 Coolidge in the development schedule, kind of the stabilization got pushed out a year. Can you kind of provide some color, the reasoning of why that kind of got pushed out?\nJoel Marcus: Yeah. Well, it's pretty simple. This is a brand new building. It's one of the most highlighted buildings in all of the Watertown campus and submarket. And it's pretty clear that it's going to take us more time to build out space to deliver to tenants rather than having just some time space available. So as part of the development, we're doing that, but that takes time in this marketplace. But we did just sign a lease, I don't know and maybe after the end of the quarter another lease there which will be reported I think was October 13 or something like that for part of the space there. But the challenge there is to lease space and have available space that people can move into and that's what we're trying to get to. That's the point.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to follow-up on Rob's question. Marc, you mentioned the cash NOI disappearing was about is about $91 million on the $1.2 billion of sales. So I'm looking at it kind of saying that that's about a 7.5% cash yield, but developments are being done at a stabilized 6.4%. So I'm a little I'm just kind of trying to understand again selling at 7.5% to fund assets at 6.4%. Are we looking at that being something dilutive to FFO? Or should we be thinking more about because you're certainly not dealing with a bunch of recurring CapEx, it's still going to be accretive on an AFFO on a free cash flow basis?\nMarc Binda: Yes, sure. Yes, no, you're right that what we're selling is obviously has a higher cap rate than what we're developing in if you just look at a moment in time. But I think though a bunch of those assets particularly for the non-stabilized ones will absolutely need or will require significant capital to re-tenant those. So I think the choice there was really just to allow the buyer to do that, since those assets don't fit our strategy any longer and take those proceeds and redeploy them into the pipeline where a significant amount of the product in the pipeline is all concentrated in the mega campuses.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Okay, that's helpful. And then if I may ask another one, the reduction in guidance for straight line rents, again, I know part of it was just write offs of associated with some tenants and some lease terminations. I mean, when you look at the overall portfolio today and you kind of think of a watch list, if I may use those words. I mean, how does one kind of think about that and kind of as I start thinking about 2025, whether we may see a few more of these instances of straight line rent write-offs?\nMarc Binda: Yes. Maybe, Hallie, maybe, I'll put that one over to you just to talk about kind of how we look at the watch list.\nJoel Marcus: Frame it for her first.\nMarc Binda: Yes. Look, I think this was a kind of a discrete event with this particular tenant. It was a large tenant. It was actually a tenant that we inherited when we bought the asset over a decade ago. They've been in there for a very long time, close to, not quite 20 years, but pretty close to it. They've been operating in there. And we sold out of that particular campus a number of years ago in Mission Bay to reduce our exposure. But I think what I want to communicate is that these things do happen, but that was just kind of a one-off event.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And I'll maybe answer on Hallie, you can hold your fire for another question. So it's important to keep in mind, too, that this tenant who Marc said, was in there when we bought the building in 2010. It had been signed a lease with the Shorenstein team in 2006, I believe. The company, actually, when we underwrote it, I personally was involved in the underwriting in 2010, look to have one of the most promising blockbuster drugs, a replacement for Amgen's erythropoietin, but instead injectable, it was a pill. But over the course of time through a variety of development changes and just the combination of maybe strategy, science and a whole lot of other issues that come to bear it had lost that opportunity and so was faced with the prospect of continuing its business in China and winding down in the U.S. So I think we did everything prudent we could during all those years and very proud of the fact that we have one of the best track records of underwriting tenants, I think the best in the industry by far. No one has our capability. So thank you for the question.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Georgi Dinkov with Mizuho.\nGeorgi Dinkov: This is Georgi on for Vikram. What is the potential for exceeding the midpoint of the disposition guidance? And as you say, assets, what's the best use of the capital?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Marc?\nMarc Binda: Yes. Look, I think we're almost in late October. So I don't know that I would expect to do much beyond what we laid out in terms of the actual amounts that are either under contract or under -- have a hard asset. There are other things we're looking at that we're moving along that we'll continue to work on. But for now, I probably wouldn't assume much beyond that.\nJoel Marcus: And the second part of the question?\nMarc Binda: Sorry, could you repeat the second part, Georgi?\nGeorgi Dinkov: Yes, yes. What is the best use of this capital as you sell assets in your view?\nMarc Binda: Right. Yes. So look, we planned since the beginning of the year to really fund the construction of the pipeline with this capital. So that's been happening during the year. And this money will be used to pay down debt, which we borrowed to fund the construction pipeline. We do expect, just given where we are in the year, we do expect to actually have a little bit more proceeds from the sales that we won't have the ability to pay down debt. We expect a revolver should be at or close to 0. So by the end of the year. So we do expect to hold on to some of that cash that can then be redeployed next year that ought to reduce our debt needs going forward in 2025.\nJoel Marcus: But obviously, as you look at funding construction given cost of capital, given the fact that many of these projects in the pipeline were committed in past years, we're only funding new pipeline opportunities, whether they be development or redevelopment where our returns can be well above cost of capital. So that's how we're looking at.\nGeorgi Dinkov: And just one more for me. How do you see demand evolving as funding improves? And do you have any updated thoughts on AI and how that would drive lab space needs going forward?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So demand, I think, has been pretty I think the word I used was the industry is in a highly disciplined capital deployment, both capital raising and capital deployment. So we're dealing with that. But we've got 800 tenants plus, and we have high-quality tenants that need lab space. And so as I think Marc said, 80% of our tenants over the last year have come from our own tenants. So we outcompete in those opportunities if we have space available and that's good. On the AI side, I think it's very early days, although AI has been around for quite a long time, very early days for AI. Obviously, the best use of AI and the world of AI is going to have to meet the world of drug development in a moment. Language models and a lot of inhibitions remain between those two, but many companies. In fact, most companies are trying to use AI to inform them to get to better targets and outcomes. And ultimately, my own view is that AI is going to make maybe the most remarkable progress in the clinical setting, where if, over time, one could predict with greater certainty, the those who would respond positively versus no response or negative response, that could save the largest amount of money in the entire drug development process, which is clinical trials. So thanks for that question.\nHallie Kuhn: Joel, can I just layer on that. Hi, this is Hallie. I was just going to respond to your first question in terms of the demand. And just to -- as a reminder of as you think about medicine development, unfortunately, for public companies, it doesn't happen on a quarter-to-quarter basis, right? It takes 10 years easily to bring a new medicine from early research to a patient. And what we see on the ground is just incredible innovation, right? We're still continuing to see the discoveries and new forms of modalities that will continue to be developed and make their way to patients. And so while we are in a conservative environment right now, the outlook on the growth of the industry and that translating to needs over the long term is certainly positive. And so the leads we see for example in the obesity space, right? There's so much unmet need across Alzheimer's across still other forms of cancer that the industry outlook and the innovation driving that demand will continue.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Peter Abramowitz with Jefferies.\nPeter Abramowitz: I was just wondering if you could comment on sublease space, specifically in Boston and the Bay Area. Is it continuing to increase? Or does it seem like it's sort of stabilized.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Peter, do you want to address that?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. It's stabilized. It has actually not state -- good sublease space, not stayed on the market long. Anything that -- when you look at the percentage of things that are still available for sublease, that space that's for a long, long time because it's just not a good space or it's not a shelf space. But we're not seeing a lot of space being put back on the market now. So what is being absorbed is generally available vacant space and not directly big enough space and not sublease space. So that's been a positive for the market, although there is still some availabilities for sure. But tenants tend to want to go direct, if at all possible, because they have no control over the space if they're going through a tenant that's subleasing it.\nPeter Abramowitz: Okay. That's helpful. And then just to go back to Joel's comment, I think tenants generally just being more thoughtful and disciplined in terms of their capital allocation. Could you just sort of comment on length of time and deal cycles to actually get leases done sort of where that's at today versus where it's been historically? And any sense of that changing anytime soon?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, Peter?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. The cycle of leasing has definitely taken a lot longer now than it used to, certainly, Boards are scrutinizing any growth space and tenants are looking at all the options in the market before making decisions to make sure they're doing all their diligence because Boards are requiring them to get everything pretty much, at least, for the earlier-stage companies and maybe the early IPO companies. The Boards are really looking at every dollar and wanting to ensure that all the diligence was done we feel confident when we're in the mix that we're going to win the deal, but the deals are taking longer to make for sure.\nOperator: And the last question for today comes from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street.\nDylan Burzinski: Just one quick one on transaction markets. Given the commentary on the call, it seems like most of the dispositions this year, those that have been -- that happened in those that are said to close to year-end. It seems like most of the depth to bids have come from users. So just sort of curious on appetite from traditional real estate investors to put capital into work into the life science base today?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, Peter?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. Look, we've been fortunate that there have been users out there that want to take advantage of the opportunity to buy the real estate they wouldn't have otherwise had the opportunity to buy because weren't sellers in the past. Transaction velocity to investors is really highly dependent on the financing market. And although it's starting to improve, it's still not where it needs to be for a lot of money to get off the sidelines and back into acquiring mode. There are some investor sales that we're doing for sure. But we think that coming into next year, there'll be a lot more opportunity for us to do so. One, because rates hopefully will revert. We all thought they'd be going down, not up, at this point, but we do have confidence that they will, the 10 year will start to go down. And then we are seeing lenders now start to get back into the market. So that, that will be an opportunity to increase the velocity of transactions to investors and also an opportunity to do better on valuations because they'll be able to leverage them.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Jim Kammert with Evercore.\nJim Kammert: To the extent you can, where would you say are the better pockets of demand for new space, the lease-up in other words, in the development, redevelopment Is it the private biotech, is it pre-commercial biotechs, big pharma. I'm just curious if you could put any sort of hanging paper around that, where the broader or the deeper view.\nJoel Marcus: I think it's the -- yes, I think it's the earlier stage company by and large. And if you get a commercial or I mean a clinical stage company that has good news and then it's got to move immediately. Those are probably the 2 most common pockets today.\nJim Kammert: Okay. Great. And if I could just leverage last comment on gen AI, to make sure I understood in your prior response. You thought it would be really powerful AI in terms of clinical studies, Joel. But does that -- am I mistaken to think that helps or hinders demand for space then in terms of your lab portfolio?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think it's positive in the sense that it will provide way more opportunities for targets, medicines and shots on goal, if it aids in a bets in the clinical trial process, we don't lease space to hospitals or others doing clinical trial. So that doesn't hurt us, but what matters is the pipeline of products that address the 90%-plus diseases that need to be solved. So I think that would be very good news for us.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel Marcus: Okay. Thank you, everybody, and be safe and God bless.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thank you, Hallie. Before I get into my update on the development pipeline, leasing, supply, and asset sales, I wanted to comment on the improving health of the office market because it's helpful to life science real estate in a couple of ways. First, a healthy -- can create competition for life science tenants as tech tenants have historically been attracted to our locations and centers of innovation, and the appeal of our floor plates, ceiling heights and amenities. Second, office offers and alternative for some of the misguided life science real estate supply that's been added since the pandemic. We are seeing it real time with the boom of the office leasing taking place in Mission Bay. OpenAI completed a 490,000 square-foot sublease at our 1455-1515 Third Street property in the fourth quarter of 2023 and last quarter added another 315,000 square feet at the neighboring 550 Terry Francois Building, which by the way was being marketed as lab space. Our understanding is that two other tenants that were competing for that building, including a tech company, and that one of them is now negotiating at Mission Rock, which was also once identified as Future Lab Supply. In the third quarter, we delivered 316,000 square feet of development, redevelopment pipeline, 100% leased with 100% of the space contained in mega campuses located in our high barrier-to-entry submarkets. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the quarter equaled $21 million bringing the year-to-date total to $63 million. The weighted average stabilized yield of the deliveries was strong at 7.7%. After a strong second quarter, development and redevelopment leasing was light at 39,121 square feet, bringing the total for the year to 480,342 square feet. We suspect the result was driven by the fact that most of the space available for lease in the pipeline won't be available for occupancy until 2026 or later. In today's market, project leasing accelerates as projects near completion as illustrated by our 2024 and 2025 deliveries being 91% leased. Projects expected to stabilize in 2026 and beyond are 35% leased, and overall activity in these projects is encouraging because most of them are in Greater Boston, and we have active proposals or touring activity at each one of them. Transitioning to leasing and supply, overall leasing volume was very robust at 1.49 million square feet, up 33% quarter-over-quarter. This leasing was significantly driven by renewals with a strong 84% retention rate, which illustrates the power of our mega campus platform, and trust in our brand built by our internal long-tenured asset services teams providing unmatched operational excellence, and know-how in the running of our mission-critical facilities. GAAP and cash rental increases were 1.5% and 5.1% respectively, influenced materially by a large non-laboratory lease renewal with a high-credit tech tenant. Although the increases were modest, we are pleased with the longer lease durations coming in at a weighted average of 9.7 years for renewed and released space. On competitive supply, as a reminder, 2024 is going to be the peak year for new deliveries and most of that has been delivered through the third quarter. Inclusive of 2026, there is approximately 8 million square feet of competitive supply remaining to be delivered in our three largest markets. In Greater Boston, approximately 200,000 square feet will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024 and it is 100% leased. In 2025, 2.4 million square feet is anticipated to be delivered and that space is 65% pre-leased. In 2026, another 900,000 square feet will be delivered in Greater Boston and it's 3.5% leased. In San Francisco Bay Region, 300,000 square feet will be delivered in the fourth quarter and it's 0% leased. In 2025, 1.7 million square feet will be delivered and it's currently 23% leased. We are not tracking anything to be delivered in the Bay Area for 2026. In San Diego, 1.3 million square feet will be delivered in the fourth quarter and it's 50% leased. 700,000 square feet is expected to deliver in 2025 and it's 23% leased. And in 2026, we expect to see 400,000 square feet of competitive supply to be delivered and it's 100% leased. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. We've commented on the past two calls that our value harvesting transactions will be heavily weighted towards the end of the year. With respect to the third quarter, we closed on just north of $300 million of asset sale transactions highlighted by the sale of 1165 Eastlake Avenue East, a core asset in the Lake Union submarket of Seattle. As you know, it's not our intent to sell core assets, but this transaction offered several constructive attributes. First, as Hallie mentioned, the sale was to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, which is one of the most prestigious clinical research institutions in the world and it afforded us an opportunity to recapitalize our neighboring 1201 and 12080 Slake Avenue East assets with them as well taking out an existing partner at a gain. This was a fantastic opportunity for us to deepen our relationship with the Hutch, who is a major driver of life science real estate demand in the region. Second, the transaction provided for early renewals at those recap properties inclusive of a 20 year lease term at 1201 East Lake, where the Hutch occupies the entire 106,000 square foot building. Third, it provides price discovery upon which analysts and investors can evaluate the NAV of our core assets. We acknowledge that this was a user sale, but any rational buyer is going to require pricing in the neighborhood of market value, so we think the 4.9% capitalization rate and 1,499 per square foot value is representative of the value of our core mega campus assets. Rounding out the third quarter transaction was the completion of the previously announced $60 million sale of 219 East 42nd Street, New York City and the sale of 14255 New Brook Drive in Northern Virginia at a 7.4% cap rate, a workhorse asset that no longer fits into our strategy, but is a testament to the enduring value of our asset base as we acquired it pre-IPO. As we look-forward, we expect to end the year strong with several value harvesting transactions on tap to close before year end. We have $577.2 million of dispositions that are subject to non-refundable deposits. Those assets include a retail development on excess land we owned in Maryland, a one-off Class B asset in our Greater Stanford submarket that will be redeveloped for another use, a one-off office building that was part of a land assemblage in the suburbs of Boston, a pair of buildings in the Research Triangle located outside of our core mega campuses and a set of buildings in the suburbs of Greater Boston, which will be sold to a user. Rounding out our fourth quarter dispositions are assets that are subject to executed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements. Approximately 48% of the 600 and $2.5 million in sales proceeds expected from these transactions come from our land bank and are expected to be developed for residential use. The balance is a pair of buildings that will be demolished for residential development and a set of non-core standalone assets in Cambridge that will require significant capital to release and no longer fit into our strategy. With that, I'll pass it over to Marc. Yes. I mean part of your question, I think referenced the 7.6% cap rate maybe that I mentioned of one of our workhorse assets versus the core asset 4.9% -- the 7.6% was in Northern Virginia. It is lab space, but it is more clinical lab space and not the R&D type of space that is in our core mega campuses.  But what I was trying to get across in my commentary was, we wanted to make sure that everyone was aware because a lot of what we've been selling has been non-core, almost everything is non-core unless it's been a partial interest sale. We haven't done a partial interest sale in a while. So we just sold a core asset in Lake Union and I explained why. And it was at a 4.9%. And even though it was a user sale, which certainly influences value. It has to be in the ballpark of market value, right? I mean from any rational buyer is not going to way overpay for anything no matter whether they are a user or not. So I thought it was a good example and reminder to everybody that we are on our way to making everything that we own or a good portion of what we own core mega campus assets. And once we're done with our disposition program, we are what we have left is highly valuable and that comp reflects that and that's what I was trying to get across. Yes, look, the best strategy for us to mitigate the supply that's gone into our core markets is our mega campus strategy. So we are going all in on it. And as Joel mentioned, we feel like all the assets we have are good assets, but we deem some of them to no longer be part of our strategy, and we're those are the ones that we're selling in order to fund our pipeline, which is increasing our percentage of mega campus assets. How long it's going to take is hard to say, but we're doing it incrementally as we build out our mega campus platform. It's good. We feel like it's good that we are able to fund this transition by selling assets that are no longer part of our strategy versus using common.

But we're not seeing a lot of space being put back on the market now. So what is being absorbed is generally available vacant space and not directly big enough space and not sublease space. So that's been a positive for the market, although there is still some availabilities for sure. But tenants tend to want to go direct, if at all possible, because they have no control over the space if they're going through a tenant that's subleasing it. Yes. The cycle of leasing has definitely taken a lot longer now than it used to, certainly, Boards are scrutinizing any growth space and tenants are looking at all the options in the market before making decisions to make sure they're doing all their diligence because Boards are requiring them to get everything pretty much, at least, for the earlier-stage companies and maybe the early IPO companies. The Boards are really looking at every dollar and wanting to ensure that all the diligence was done we feel confident when we're in the mix that we're going to win the deal, but the deals are taking longer to make for sure.

Transaction velocity to investors is really highly dependent on the financing market. And although it's starting to improve, it's still not where it needs to be for a lot of money to get off the sidelines and back into acquiring mode. There are some investor sales that we're doing for sure. But we think that coming into next year, there'll be a lot more opportunity for us to do so. One, because rates hopefully will revert. We all thought they'd be going down, not up, at this point, but we do have confidence that they will, the 10 year will start to go down. And then we are seeing lenders now start to get back into the market. So that, that will be an opportunity to increase the velocity of transactions to investors and also an opportunity to do better on valuations because they'll be able to leverage them."

            "content": "Thank you, Paul, and welcome everybody to Alexandria's third quarter earnings call. I'm here today with Hallie, Peter, and Marc. And first of all, as I do every quarter I want to extend a profound thank you and huge congratulations to each and every member of our Alexandria\u2019s family team for bringing it this third quarter to post an impressive operating and financial performance in a continuingly stubborn economic and operating environment to the team. You're an inspiration to me each and every day in small ways and large. Thank you. The continuingly stubborn economic backdrop for commercial real estate and risk on investments, Peter and Marc will address those, but let me just give you a couple of quick comments driven by the huge and unnecessary federal deficits over the last handful of years $9 trillion plus, inflation in many areas remain sticky, stubborn and structural despite what the Labor Department is saying and reporting. Our cost of capital is also stubbornly high across much of the equity and debt capital markets again despite the delayed and rather feeble responses of the Fed to date. And Main Street is hurting in the United States, it's pretty clear. Hallie will comment more in-depth on Life Science Industry, but let me say a couple of things I've said many times in the past. This is one of the few crown remaining crown jewel industries here in the United States and is the great bastion of true and novel innovation. And the only real and effective path to solve and address over 90% of human diseases which remained unsolved today, which bear an unbearable burden on our citizens and our healthcare system is the translation of this innovation. Since the downward spiral biotech began in early 2021 and kind of hit its bottom in what appears to be October of 2023 and after almost decade of bull-run from 2014 through 2021. Unfortunately, the industry attracted and almost became drug addicted to too many and too free of capital flowing in and some of the really stupid and outrageous monies both from the Fed and investors which caused a rocket ship demand for exit of what it normally is and really not wanted and sustainable. And since then things have settled down. Here we are almost 4 years later since the XBI started to tail-off in February 2021 and we're in a really a highly, I would say and toughly disciplined funding market but one in which I personally prefer to operate. As an example of this market to [PDD] less than half the biotech IPOs from 2013 to 2019, remain standalone companies, majority of either seen successful exits which is awesome, less successful exits which is less than awesome or disappeared altogether which is not awesome. Couple of thoughts my take on the third quarter, a truly operationally excellent results both operationally and financially and the continuing strong balance sheet management with great liquidity and kudos to our team. Still in a very difficult supply and demand impacted market with a challenging cost of capital. In the third quarter, we continue to deliver increasing FFO per share and dividends per share growth despite the tough environment. And I think one of my key takes is the -- our strong year to date rental rate growth which is I think pretty exceptional. We continue with strong continued high occupancy, collections nearly 100% which is sensational. And I think what truly stands out in this Q3 is the leasing activity of almost 1.5 million rentable square feet, at a 48% increase quarter-to-quarter. Future embedded NOI growth of $510 million which Marc will talk about and our very successful self-funding capital recycling program, this year, which Peter and Marc will talk about. Going forward and finally, as the master investor Warren Buffett has said, a truly great business must have an enduring mode. And out of the depths of this bear market like I was -- like we experienced and I feel, like the 2010 era of this market. I still remain more optimistic than ever about the promise of unprecedented human health innovation from our precious industry, assuming the government doesn't screw it up and Alexandria continuing at the vanguard of this industry to build, the really building the future of life-saving and life-changing innovation. And finally, let me just say a couple more words before I turn it over to Hallie. Much as predicted, as we predicted the doubling of our revenues from 2017 to 2021, which we exceeded during an unprecedented bull market on the back of our strategic -- well our I think long developed strategy on the back of our development pipeline created during the depths of the aftermath of the great financial crisis when we really conceived of it in the 2010 to 2013 era. In five short years by the end of this decade December 2029, our revenues will be overwhelmingly driven by our unique and highly competitive mega campuses, best locations, best assets, best services, that also compete and clearly demonstrates superior return on investment, higher occupancy, higher rental rates, best talent recruitment or retention for our tenants and a multiple and very convenient path for growth. And so with that I'll turn it over to Hallie. Okay. Paula, could you have the moderator open it up for questions please? Yes, I don't think that's a reasonable assumption, but Marc do you want to talk about Seattle and maybe how to think about? Peter, any further comments you have? Yes, that's really good. And Josh just one other comment that you have to remember, so the company is 30 years old and so it's acquired, developed or redeveloped assets over a long period of time that now don't fit the go forward mega campus strategy. So that's pretty obvious. Yes. Marc, do you want to respond to that? Yes, you're missing it -- Yes. So we're under strict confidentiality as you probably can imagine. All big tech tenants don't want their name used. They don't allow you to put other tech tenants in the building. They're pretty strict in what they do. So we can say very little other than, we felt that, this renewal was integral to their own campus, which is actually adjacent to our site. These are highly improved buildings for their particular use. So they aren't just some kind of half-asset tech, office kind of thing. They're actually quite valuable and quite improved. I don't know where it goes over time, but clearly having the cash flow is better than in this market environment with cost of capital than trying to reposition them, but they may be an ultimate buyer here as well. So we'll see how the story plays out. Well, I think it's pretty good in the early and steady on the revenue-generating side. I think in the middle is where it still remains challenging. And when you've got good clinical data run approval, generally you've got good news. And if not, you know, it's kind of sluggish. So I don't think that's materially changed. Well, yes, let me say something before Peter answers. I don't think you could say the quality of the portfolio is going to be substantially improved. It is already first in class, best assets, best location, best services, best tenants. So I don't think how you're thinking about that is quite correct. We have a variety of assets, land, redevelopments, and developments that no longer fit the mega campus strategy, and will harvest those assets over the coming years as we deem appropriate to match sources and uses and also in light of the valuation in the marketplace. So that's kind of how we look at it, but Peter you could comment further. And maintaining a great balance sheet in the meantime. Yeah. Well, it's pretty simple. This is a brand new building. It's one of the most highlighted buildings in all of the Watertown campus and submarket. And it's pretty clear that it's going to take us more time to build out space to deliver to tenants rather than having just some time space available. So as part of the development, we're doing that, but that takes time in this marketplace. But we did just sign a lease, I don't know and maybe after the end of the quarter another lease there which will be reported I think was October 13 or something like that for part of the space there. But the challenge there is to lease space and have available space that people can move into and that's what we're trying to get to. That's the point. Frame it for her first. Yes. And I'll maybe answer on Hallie, you can hold your fire for another question. So it's important to keep in mind, too, that this tenant who Marc said, was in there when we bought the building in 2010. It had been signed a lease with the Shorenstein team in 2006, I believe. The company, actually, when we underwrote it, I personally was involved in the underwriting in 2010, look to have one of the most promising blockbuster drugs, a replacement for Amgen's erythropoietin, but instead injectable, it was a pill. But over the course of time through a variety of development changes and just the combination of maybe strategy, science and a whole lot of other issues that come to bear it had lost that opportunity and so was faced with the prospect of continuing its business in China and winding down in the U.S. So I think we did everything prudent we could during all those years and very proud of the fact that we have one of the best track records of underwriting tenants, I think the best in the industry by far. No one has our capability. So thank you for the question. Yes. So Marc? And the second part of the question? But obviously, as you look at funding construction given cost of capital, given the fact that many of these projects in the pipeline were committed in past years, we're only funding new pipeline opportunities, whether they be development or redevelopment where our returns can be well above cost of capital. So that's how we're looking at. Yes. So demand, I think, has been pretty I think the word I used was the industry is in a highly disciplined capital deployment, both capital raising and capital deployment. So we're dealing with that. But we've got 800 tenants plus, and we have high-quality tenants that need lab space. And so as I think Marc said, 80% of our tenants over the last year have come from our own tenants. So we outcompete in those opportunities if we have space available and that's good. On the AI side, I think it's very early days, although AI has been around for quite a long time, very early days for AI. Obviously, the best use of AI and the world of AI is going to have to meet the world of drug development in a moment. Language models and a lot of inhibitions remain between those two, but many companies. In fact, most companies are trying to use AI to inform them to get to better targets and outcomes. And ultimately, my own view is that AI is going to make maybe the most remarkable progress in the clinical setting, where if, over time, one could predict with greater certainty, the those who would respond positively versus no response or negative response, that could save the largest amount of money in the entire drug development process, which is clinical trials. So thanks for that question. Yes. Peter, do you want to address that? Yes, Peter? Yes, Peter? I think it's the -- yes, I think it's the earlier stage company by and large. And if you get a commercial or I mean a clinical stage company that has good news and then it's got to move immediately. Those are probably the 2 most common pockets today. Well, I think it's positive in the sense that it will provide way more opportunities for targets, medicines and shots on goal, if it aids in a bets in the clinical trial process, we don't lease space to hospitals or others doing clinical trial. So that doesn't hurt us, but what matters is the pipeline of products that address the 90%-plus diseases that need to be solved. So I think that would be very good news for us. Okay. Thank you, everybody, and be safe and God bless."

            "name": "Marc Binda",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. This is Marc Binda, CFO. Hello, and good afternoon everyone. We reported solid operating and financial results for the second quarter. Total revenues and NOI for 3Q \u201924 were up 10.9% and 12.5% respectively over 3Q \u201923, primarily driven by solid same-property performance, and continued execution of our development and redevelopment strategy. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the quarter was $2.37, up 4.9% over 3Q '23, and is in line with consensus. Our solid operating results for the quarter were driven by our disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy, tremendous scale, longstanding tenant relationships, and operational excellence by our team. 76% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses. We have high-quality cash flows with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade and publicly traded large-cap tenants. Collections remained very high at 99.9%, and adjusted EBITDA margins continued to be strong at 70% for the quarter. An important takeaway for the quarter should be the very strong leasing volume results. Leasing volume for the quarter was 1.5 million square feet, which was up 48% over the trailing four-quarter average, and was the highest quarterly volume since 4Q '22. We continue to benefit from our tremendous scale, high-quality tenant roster, and brand loyalty with 80% of our leasing activity over the last 12-months coming from our existing deep well of approximately 800 tenant relationships. The rental rate increases for the first 9-months of 2024 were strong at 16.4% and 8.9% on a cash basis. And our outlook for rental rate growth for the full year '24 remains solid at 11% to 19%, and 5% to 13% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing the space for the quarter was 5.1% and 1.5% on a cash basis. We did highlight the renewal of an acquired lease in Texas for tech R&D space that did weigh down the numbers during the quarter. During the quarter, we also achieved very healthy lease terms on completed leases, which were almost 10 years on average. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to in place leases for our entire asset base remained solid at about 10%. Tenant improvements and leasing commissions on second generation leasing as a percentage of starting cash rent were around 8% this quarter, which is less than our historical average over the last 3 years of about 9%. Our total non-revenue enhancing expenditures, which includes tenant improvements on renewals and releasing the space is expected to be in the 10% to 11% range as a percentage of net operating income in 2024, which this amount is below our 5 year average of 15% and is lower than that of several other REIT sectors and really highlights the durable nature of our laboratory infrastructure. This is the third year in a row that we've been in the 10% to 13% range, although we do expect next year to be higher given some larger repositioning projects on the horizon. Turning to same-property results, same-property NOI growth for 3Q24 was solid at 1.5% 6.5% on a cash basis, really driven by solid rental rate increases, a pickup in occupancy and some burn-off of free rent. Our outlook for the full year 2024 same-property growth is consistent with our last update at solid growth of 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the midpoints of our guidance. We do expect some pressure on fourth quarter same-property results resulting from a lease termination that occurred at 409 Illinois Street in our Mission Bay submarket where the lease will be expiring at the beginning of 2025 and we expect little to no rent in the fourth quarter of '24. As a reminder, our same-property results do include 100% of consolidated results. So even though we only have a 25% interest in this particular property, the approximately $17 million of annual rental revenue going away related to this tenant in the fourth quarter will be fully reflected in same-property results, even though the bottom line FFO results will only pick up our 25% share. Turning to occupancy, for the quarter, occupancy was very solid at 94.7%, which is up 10 basis points over the prior quarter and continues the steady results over the last four quarters. We expect year-end occupancy to be on the low end of our guidance range of 94.6% to 95.6%. On lease expirations, our team has done a great job of addressing the 24 lease expirations with very strong leasing volume again completed in the quarter of 1.5 million square feet and the unresolved lease expirations remaining for the balance of 2024 are modest at only 134,000 rentable square feet. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2025, we highlighted a few key lease expirations spread across four projects aggregating 768,000 rentable square feet with $47 million of annual rental revenue that are expected to have 12 to 24-months of downtime on a weighted average basis. 75% to 80% of the total $47 million annual rental revenue is related to our Alexandria Technology Square and 409 Illinois Street projects, which are expected to remain as operating properties with the same-property pool following the lease expiration, even though these spaces may require some time and capital to release or reposition the buildings for multi-tenancy. The Alexandria Technology Square project primarily relates to the move out of Moderna and the expansion to their new 462,000 square foot building we delivered late last year at 325 Binney. And we are in early discussions with the tenant to lease approximately half of the 409 Illinois Street property. Please refer to footnote 4 on Page 24 of our supplemental package for additional details there. On external growth, during the quarter, we continued to execute on our development and redevelopment strategy by delivering 316,691 rentable square feet from the pipeline, which will generate $21 million of incremental annual net operating income. We have 5.5 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are 55% leased or negotiating, and are projected to generate $510 million of incremental net operating income over the next 3.5 years, including $158 million over the next five quarters. Transitioning next to the balance sheet, we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets amongst all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our corporate credit ratings are in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. We remain on track to achieve our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 5.1x on a quarterly annualized basis by year-end. We have tremendous liquidity of $5.4 billion, and our attractive debt profile highlights our commitment to long-term funding of our business with a weighted average remaining term of debt of 12.6 years and average year-end percentage of fixed-rate debt over the last 5 years of 97.7%. We continue to focus on our disciplined funding strategy to recycle capital from dispositions, and to minimize the issuance of common stock. Common stock issuances have amounted to less than 2% of our total funding sources in 2023 and 2024, and we do not expect to issue any new equity in the fourth quarter of 2024. Our disposition strategy for 2024 is focused primarily on outright dispositions of non-core assets not integral to our mega campus strategy, allowing us to enhance the quality of our asset base and include stabilized properties, non-stabilized properties with vacancy or near-term lease expirations, and land parcels. To date, we've completed $319 million of asset sales, including the sale Peter mentioned at 1165 Eastlake Avenue, which is located in our Lake Union Submarket that was sold to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute. We have another $1.2 billion of pending dispositions subject to non-refundable deposits or executed letters of intent or PSA agreements. About half of the pending dispositions represent stabilized property sales, most of which are expected to be sold to users with a blended expected capitalization rate of 8.5% and 7% on a cash basis.  The other half represents the sales of land and properties with vacancy or near-term lease expirations. The 3Q \u201824 annualized NOI associated with the $1.2 billion of pending sales is $95.8 million $91 million on a cash basis. It's important to note that the $95.8 million is a backwards-looking amount, and does not consider certain lease expirations for some of the non-stabilized properties expected to occur over the next 12-months, including a significant amount of non-laboratory space. On a forward-looking 12 months basis for these non-stabilized disposition assets, we expect that NOI will decline by $30 million to $35 million. And given that these assets no longer fit our strategy, we've elected to sell these assets and allow the buyer to invest the capital to reposition those assets. Included in the $1.2 billion pending dispositions are 2 key items aggregating nearly $700 million. First, a suburban campus with specialty non-traditional lab space in our Greater Boston market to the existing tenant for $369 million which represents a 6.3% cash cap rate, and second various sites in Sorrento Mesa and University Town Center to residential developers for $314 million which will allow us to monetize some of our future pipeline without adding to the lab supply. The aggregate total of the completed and pending dispositions is $1.5 billion which puts us right around the mid-point of our guidance and we're reasonably confident we can close all of this by the end of the year. We also expect to fund a meaningful amount of our equity needs with retaining cash flows from operating activities after dividends of $450 million at the mid-point of our guidance for 2024 and our high quality cash flows continue to support the growth in our annual common stock dividends with an average annual increase in dividends per share of 5.4% since 2020 and we continue to have a conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for 3Q\u201924. Realized gains for the venture investments, including FFO per share as adjusted for the quarter, were $23 million and $85.2 million for the nine months ended September. Quarterly realized gains since 2021 have averaged about $25 million. Through the first three quarters of 2024, we've averaged about $28 million so pretty close to the historical run rate and consistent with our guidance range for the full year of $95 million to $125 million. Turning to guidance, there were a few moving pieces in our underlying guidance, including lower straight line rent revenue and lower G&A, which we highlighted on Page 5 of our supplemental. We've updated our guidance for 2024 for EPS of $2.60 to $2.64 and we maintained the midpoint of our guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $9.47, which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share for 2024. As we look ahead beyond 3Q \u201824, we continue to have conviction to reinforce our core through our differentiated mega campus strategy, which is the driving force behind our disposition strategy. With 76% of our annual rental revenue coming from mega campuses today and aspirations to enhance this number over time with non-core dispositions of land and properties, as well as disciplined development and redevelopment on these mega campuses, we expect to continue increasing the quality and resilience of our dominant platform and asset base. With that, let me turn it over to you Joel. Yes, sorry. Yes, Josh, I think on the stabilized cap rate, I think perhaps what you're referring to is, I think it was a 7% cash and 8.5% GAAP. The big reason for the delta there between cash and GAAP was the big chunk of that is the suburban Greater Boston market that actually had some really long lease term in place. So you had a pretty big spread there between cash and GAAP. But I think if you think about what to expect in terms of stabilized asset sales, we've given you the number for this year, and they're non-core. So we expect them to be wider than that. Josh, you're talking specifically about the Greater Boston asset. Right. Yes. So about half of the $1.2 billion is stabilized assets. That includes the one particular asset we mentioned in Greater Boston that, I think had a 6.3% cash cap rate and then a much wider GAAP cap rate given the long terms. The other half of the $1.2 billion is a mixture of land and also some non-stabilized properties. If you kind of reverse engineer the math, it's somewhere in the high-7s in terms of the GAAP NOI coming offline. But what I was trying to say in the prepared commentary is there's a fair amount of that NOI that for those particular assets that we're selling that happened to be in Boston that will be going away next year. And so the decision there was really to allow the buyer to invest that capital since those assets really just don't fit our strategy any longer. Yes. I think it's true that some of that 24% of ARR that resides in non-mega campuses, some of that would be stuff that we would we may look to exit over time. But there are some really good assets in there that are located in good markets that maybe things we hang on to. The other thing I would say is that we do have some land on the books that is also not located in mega campuses. So that could also be another capital source that we look to go after. I think about 31% or so of the square footage in the land bank is not located in mega campuses. Yes, realized gains for the quarter were $23 million and I think we're $85.2 million for the nine months. So if you annualize that, that kind of puts you square in the middle or pretty close to the middle of our guidance range of $95 million to $125 million. Yes, that number is around $91 million, Michael. Yes, sure. Yes, no, you're right that what we're selling is obviously has a higher cap rate than what we're developing in if you just look at a moment in time. But I think though a bunch of those assets particularly for the non-stabilized ones will absolutely need or will require significant capital to re-tenant those. So I think the choice there was really just to allow the buyer to do that, since those assets don't fit our strategy any longer and take those proceeds and redeploy them into the pipeline where a significant amount of the product in the pipeline is all concentrated in the mega campuses. Yes. Maybe, Hallie, maybe, I'll put that one over to you just to talk about kind of how we look at the watch list. Yes. Look, I think this was a kind of a discrete event with this particular tenant. It was a large tenant. It was actually a tenant that we inherited when we bought the asset over a decade ago. They've been in there for a very long time, close to, not quite 20 years, but pretty close to it. They've been operating in there. And we sold out of that particular campus a number of years ago in Mission Bay to reduce our exposure. But I think what I want to communicate is that these things do happen, but that was just kind of a one-off event. Yes. Look, I think we're almost in late October. So I don't know that I would expect to do much beyond what we laid out in terms of the actual amounts that are either under contract or under -- have a hard asset. There are other things we're looking at that we're moving along that we'll continue to work on. But for now, I probably wouldn't assume much beyond that. Sorry, could you repeat the second part, Georgi? Right. Yes. So look, we planned since the beginning of the year to really fund the construction of the pipeline with this capital. So that's been happening during the year. And this money will be used to pay down debt, which we borrowed to fund the construction pipeline. We do expect, just given where we are in the year, we do expect to actually have a little bit more proceeds from the sales that we won't have the ability to pay down debt. We expect a revolver should be at or close to 0. So by the end of the year. So we do expect to hold on to some of that cash that can then be redeployed next year that ought to reduce our debt needs going forward in 2025."

            "name": "Hallie Kuhn",
            "content": "Thank you, Joel. This is Hallie Kuhn, Senior Vice President of Life Science and Capital Markets. This afternoon, we will provide an update on the life science industry, starting with FDA approvals and followed by a review of the current funding environment across our diverse life science tenant base. Taking a moment to reflect on the immense impact of the biopharma industry, since 2013 there have been 519 novel medicines approved by the FDA. Nearly half specifically 257 of these approvals have been developed or commercialized by Alexandria tenants. That's 257 approvals that have extended and improved lives, and is what inspires Alexandria's deeply held mission supporting the companies at the leading edge of life science innovation. Let's look at an example that will resonate for every person on this call who has personally experienced or supported loved ones with cancer. In the 1990s, the FDA created an approval process known as the Accelerated Approval Pathway with the goal of accelerating access to medicines for diseases with no effective medicines. Over the recent 16-year period, 69 cancer medicines were approved for the FDA's Accelerated Approval Pathway. These medicines have treated an estimated 911,000 patients, and led to 262,000 additional years of life. That is more than a quarter million years of lives saved. It's truly stunning. Now turning to life science fundamentals. Venture capital deployment to private biotech tenants which is 10% of our ARR is healthy. This year is tracking to eclipse 2023 and maybe the third highest year on record. As Joel mentioned, investors are highly disciplined, focused on rational valuations, de-risk technologies, and near-term milestones. The translation to demand on the ground is steady and conservative, transitioning to a just in time model for space. Scale and flexibility are core to this growth model and is why Alexandria's distinctive mega campus strategy is extremely well-positioned to meet this trend in demand. With respect to pre-commercial public biotech companies, 9% of our ARR, follow-on financing is robust, already clinching the second highest year on record. These financings are focused on the subset of companies with compelling clinical data, while those without clear catalyst continue to struggle to access additional capital. The IPO market has also narrowly opened, particularly for companies with meaningful assets derisked with clinical data. The number of IPOs through Q3 2024 has surpassed 2023 and over half of the companies that went public this year are trading above their issue price. Further opening of the IPO markets will be a positive indicator for future leasing demand as these companies grow and as investor and Board conservatism thaws more broadly. Commercial stage public biopharma, which makes up 16% ARR and large multinational pharma, which makes up around 20% ARR continue to commit considerable dollars to R&D, both to internal programs and externally via partnerships and M&A. Importantly, they remain very well capitalized with over $200 billion cash on hand amongst the Top 25 biopharma. Next, life science product service and device tenants, which represent 20% ARR. Notably, the BIOSECURE Act has passed the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate. If passed, the legislation will limit utilization of select Chinese contract research organizations. We view this legislation as largely positive. It includes grandfathering provisions to minimize near-term impact to biopharma, while creating an incentive for U.S.-based contract manufacturing and research organizations to onshore capabilities. Long-term, this could provide a tailwind for demand across this segment. Last, Biomedical and Government Institutions, which represent 12% ARR. Institutions continue to be the catalyst for early discoveries that form the next generation of medicines. As our sale of 1165 Eastlake to the Fred Hutch Cancer Institute in our Seattle region and their expansion into our neighboring 1201 and 1208 Eastlake buildings reflect, these institutions plant deep long-term roots focused on the right location, right ecosystem, right infrastructure, and trusted relationship with landlord partners such as Alexandria. Widening the lens on healthcare more broadly as we conclude, of the $4.5 trillion in healthcare costs annually spent in the U.S., less than 15% goes towards medicines. To put that in perspective, nearly 25% of healthcare spend is estimated to be on unnecessarily or wasted administrative spend. All to say that Novel medicines have the incredible opportunity to both have a positive impact on individuals' health and drive long-term savings to the healthcare system by preventing, managing and even curing the thousands of diseases with limited or no treatment options. With that, I will pass it over to Peter. Joel, can I just layer on that. Hi, this is Hallie. I was just going to respond to your first question in terms of the demand. And just to -- as a reminder of as you think about medicine development, unfortunately, for public companies, it doesn't happen on a quarter-to-quarter basis, right? It takes 10 years easily to bring a new medicine from early research to a patient. And what we see on the ground is just incredible innovation, right? We're still continuing to see the discoveries and new forms of modalities that will continue to be developed and make their way to patients. And so while we are in a conservative environment right now, the outlook on the growth of the industry and that translating to needs over the long term is certainly positive. And so the leads we see for example in the obesity space, right? There's so much unmet need across Alzheimer's across still other forms of cancer that the industry outlook and the innovation driving that demand will continue."

And now, I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel S. Marcus: Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody. With me today are Hallie, Peter and Marc, and we welcome you to our second quarter earnings call. And, thank you and congratulations to the Alexandria family team for another very solid second quarter operating and financial performance given the continuing uncertainty of the backdrop as soaring U.S. debt and government spending problems continue pretty much unabated. And, in thinking about our daily efforts, we all think about the Navy SEAL credo, The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday. Also, huge congrats to our team on the June 2024 release of our corporate responsibility report, which reinforces our longstanding operational excellence across our one of a kind Labspace platform and to the team for securing 100% of the electricity needs with renewable energy for 100% of our Alexandria paid accounts in our Greater Boston cluster market, a phenomenal achievement. Thank you, team. And, thinking about long-term strategic thinking since the bull market of the life science industry turned in February of 2021, I would say the market moved from a historical long bull run to a bear market in, as I said, February of 2021 and we\u2019ve worked every single day to re-engineer and fine tune our long-term competitive advantages of this one of a kind leading Labspace platform. Our goal is much like it was, but very different given the facts of course, after the 2008, 2009 great financial crisis and the bear market aftermath to position ourselves to come out of this sector bear market with the acumen and business strategy really to enable our life science industry and tenant growth much as we led the long historical bull market 2014 to 2021 with record breaking earnings growth for our sector. So, in thinking about our competitive advantages, and what we choose to really emphasize. I think most importantly, our first mover advantage in the top life science clusters, we continue to refine and refocus our footprint, and you see that by our actions quarterly. Our high quality assets aggregated in desirable and well-amenitized mega campuses, we continue this monumental effort really driven to and by our re-development and development efforts in each of our massive mega campuses and our attempt to reduce and hopefully successful strategy our non-mega campus pipeline, future pipeline and obviously the sale of most of our non-core assets over time. That\u2019s going to be critical to our go-forward business plan. High quality cash flows and substantial embedded future net operating income will be even more secure, given that platform focus. Our longstanding tenant relationships that demonstrate stellar brand loyalty continue. Lilly is a great example with multiple strategic relationships there. We continue to be backed by our fortress balance sheet with significant liquidity, unique and deep life science expertise which is a hallmark of this company from day one, and we\u2019re very proud of our long tenured and highly experienced management team. And, as I move from kind of our strategic thinking about what we need to do to be at the vanguard of the next bull market for life science, the life science industry, I want to take a reflection on my take of the second quarter and our future planning. It goes without saying that we had a very solid FFO per share growth in this quarter, this past quarter, second quarter of course of 5.3% and 6.3% for the six months this year and especially I think positive given the backdrop. An astounding 74% of our ARR comes from the mega campuses and we hope to push that over 90% in a short handful of years as our major moat, as the major moat of our business. 53% of our ARR is from investment grade or big cap companies, the strong quality of cash flows and the 96% of our leases having contractual rental rate increases gives us great future protection. We\u2019ve maintained stable occupancy with a very solid leasing quarter with solid economics and we continue to have very solid cash same store NOI growth. Our EBITDA margins are best-in-class and we\u2019re also working hard to reduce our go-forward CapEx and G&A. We are anchored by our fortress balance sheet, as I\u2019ve said, with strong liquidity and almost one-third of our debt expires after 2049 with an average term of 13 years. Over the next few months, we are laser focused on leasing the remaining 1 million approximately square foot rolling this year and getting a strong jump on the significant 2025 rollovers. Also over the next few months, we are laser focused on our \u201824 and \u201825 deliveries and continue to increase our leasing on those well beyond the current 87% to drive NOI growth. We\u2019re making significant progress on our recycling of capital for 2024 and beyond. And finally, the life science industry, which Hallie will comment on in-depth here, is the crown jewel and the cherished industry of our country and truly the world\u2019s leader in innovation in the discovery of new medicines. It is virtually the only industry which fundamentally enables better health, well-being and longer and happier lives. We have built this one of a kind company to be at the vanguard of this cherished life science industry as it recovers from the aftermath of the COVID rocket ship. And, without further ado, let me turn it over to Hallie.\nHallie Kuhn: Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Life Science and Capital Markets. Today, I\u2019m going to review 2Q24 life science industry performance, demand across our strong and diverse tenant base and the incredible innovation that is propelling the growth of the life science sector. As I walk through the details, there are two main points I want to underscore. First, the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry continues to command robust levels of capital from diverse funding sources. And second, the life science that life science innovation is advancing at a historic pace yielding new medicines that extend and save lives. Starting at the beginning of the lifecycle of innovation, biomedical and government institutions which account for 10% of our ARR catalyzed discoveries that fuel deeper understanding of disease biology and early development of new medicines. In addition to the NIH budget of $49 billion in 2024, $57 billion was contributed to biomedical research last year through non-profit organization While institutions maybe the engine for early innovation, private biotech companies which represent another 10% of our ARR are the fuel advancing research discoveries into potential new medicines. Private life science venture funding was robust this quarter exceeding $12 billion. While down from the peak in 2022, this year is on-track to be the third highest year in life science venture dollars ever deployed. Next are pre-commercial public biotech companies representing 9% ARR. Remarkably, follow-on financings and private placements are at historic highs eclipsing $10 billion in the second quarter with 2024 financings already exceeding full-year 2023 levels. This activity is juxtaposed against limited IPO volume and the XBI, which is up moderately for the year, but lags the broader markets. We caution that the XBI is an imperfect barometer for public biotech. The reality is a picture of have and have nots. Biotechs that meet clinical milestones have ample access to liquidity and see positive stock performance, while those that lack meaningful inflection points are faced with a challenging market reality. Next, our commercial stage biopharma and large multinational pharmaceutical companies representing 17% and 20% of ARR respectively. Biopharma continues to commit historic levels of capital to internal R&D and external innovation. 2023 R&D spend neared $300 billion and the industry set records for M&A driven by an estimated $200 billion to $300 billion dollars of revenue at risk in the next five years due to patent expirations. In 2022, this pace has continued with over $60 billion in M&A announced. On the ground, leasing from this cohort is driven by the need to recruit and retain scientific talent critical to developing new medicines essential to meeting near and long term growth targets. This is illustrated by the 127,000 square foot lease we announced this quarter with a large multinational pharmaceutical company on our SD Tech by Alexandria mega campus in San Diego. Spanning the entire lifecycle of innovation is the life science product, service and device tenant segment, which represents 21% ARR. Relevant to this segment is the BioSecure Act, which if passed will limit utilization of select Chinese contract manufacturing and research organizations. We view this legislation as largely positive. It includes grandfathering provisions to minimize near-term impact to biotech companies, while creating an incentive for U.S. based contract manufacturing and research organizations to onshore capabilities. The output of the entire innovation cycle are novel medicines that make it into the hands of patients. Through June, the FDA approved 21 novel small molecule and biologic therapies and separately approved 5 novel gene and cell therapies. Of approximately 500 novel FDA therapies approved since 2013, 50% were developed by Alexandria tenant. Highlighting one recent approval, this month the FDA approved Alexandria Tenant Eli Lilly\u2019s novel antibody for treatment of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As many listening today have experienced firsthand, Alzheimer\u2019s is devastating affecting one out of every nine individuals over 65 in the U.S. While recently approved Alzheimer\u2019s medicines can slow disease, they are still not a cure and there remains much work to be done. In the same way that 10 years ago obesity was considered too complex to treat with medicines and now has been transformed by GLP-1 therapies developed by Alexandria tenant, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, 10 years in the future we may have medicines that completely alter the paradigm of diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, rendering them treatable or even preventable conditions. Coming full circle, the life science industry continues to demonstrate sustained strength, energized by this incredible pace of innovation and reinforced by diverse sources of funding. As the trusted partner to the world\u2019s leading life science companies that expand the entire lifecycle of innovation, our mission remains steadfast to create and grow life science ecosystems and clusters that ignite and accelerate the world\u2019s leading innovators in their noble pursuit to advance human health and cure disease. With that, I will pass it over to, Peter.\nPeter M. Moglia: Thank you, Hallie. A respected economist recently made the case that pent-up demand from the pandemic has continued to be a key source of inflation which is one of the reasons the raising of short-term rates has been ineffective and that sectors of the economy with pent-up demand will continue powering the economy going forward in 2024 regardless of rates or who wins the election. Healthcare was one of the sectors mentioned. Patients returning to doctors\u2019 offices and hospitals are releasing pent-up demand for therapies and medicines, which should send a strong signal to the industry to grow. We look forward to enabling that growth. I\u2019m going to discuss our development pipeline, leasing, supply and asset sales and then hand it over to Marc. In the second quarter, we delivered 284,982 square feet, 100% leased with 92% of the space contained in mega campuses located in our high barrier to entry submarkets. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the quarter equaled $16 million bringing the year-to date total to $42 million. Development and re-development leasing of approximately 341,000 square feet was more than three times the volume of last quarter led by strong credit tenant leasing. The ability to execute on our development and re-development pipeline when others are clearly struggling is mainly attributed to our strong brand built on operational excellence and the attractiveness of our mega campus platform which houses 69% of our current pipeline. Projects to be delivered in 2024 and 2025 are 87% leased and projects expected to stabilize in 2026 and beyond are 40% leased or under negotiation because of our continuing strong execution during the quarter. Our development and re-development pipeline is expected to deliver very significant incremental NOI of approximately $480 million in the near-to-medium term. $187 million of this NOI is expected to be delivered through the fourth quarter of 2025 and the remaining $293 million will be delivered from the first quarter of \u201826 through the Q1 of \u201828. To execute on this, we will only need to average approximately 61% of the leasing per quarter through the first quarter of \u201828 and we executed this quarter. Transitioning to leasing and supply, the leasing market is in a flight to quality. Failed projects are often in tertiary markets and operated by inexperienced entities with little to no know how or capital to fund tenant improvements. The majority of fully vacant buildings in our markets are recently delivered buildings from these entities who majorly underestimated the skill sets needed to be successful in life science real estate and pick sites as if they were investing in office. High-quality locations in the core areas of innovation and high-quality sponsorship matters. Many of these new entrants are learning that the hard way. Alexandria sets the standard for sponsorship in life science real estate and our consistent occupancy, tenant retentions and strong tenant relationships which accounted for 83% of our leasing during the quarter. Our reflections are reflections of that moat we have created with our high-quality mega campus model residing in AAA locations, our operational excellence and our fortress balance sheet. Although the search rings of the tenant bases have expanded with the delivery of new supply, the strike rings have tightened as quality tenants leery of inexperienced and undercapitalized developers choose the trusted brand. We leased 1,114,001 square feet during the second quarter highlighted by the strong leasing in a development and re-development pipeline, I noted earlier. GAAP and cash rental rate increases were 7.4% and 3.7% respectively. Over 90% of our renewals were either neutral or had a positive mark-to-market. On competitive supply, 2024 is going to be the peak year for new deliveries and then it will begin to dissipate in 2025 to about half of what we will deliver in 2024. We are likely to see little-to-no new deliveries from pretenders after 2025 unless projects currently under construction are delayed. I\u2019ll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. As mentioned on the last call, our value harvesting transactions will be heavily weighted towards the third and fourth quarters but significant progress continues to be made. During the quarter, we closed on the $60 million non-income producing asset in New York and increased our pending transactions subject to letters of intent or purchase and sale agreement negotiations by approximately $549 million to a total of $806.7 million. This combined with our $77.2 million in closed sales and $27 million of forward equity sales agreements expected to be settled in 2024 brings our pending and closed transactions to $884 million approximately 59% of the midpoint of guidance for dispositions, partial interest sales and equity. Interest in our non-core asset sales remains consistent and we believe the anticipated rate cuts and thawing of the financial markets will bring more buyers and have a positive effect on values. The lack of financing available to investors has been the driver of the widely reported lack of capital markets activity in the broad market. Capital flows have a major impact on valuations and commercial real estate debt has trended downward as a percentage of GDP for the last two years prior to the first quarter of \u201824. However, this appears to be reversing as new CMBS issuance for the first half of 2024 is up nearly threefold from the same period last year, which should provide positive momentum for our current and future efforts. With that, I will pass it over to Marc.\nMarc E. Binda: Thank you, Peter. This is Marc Binda, CFO. Hello and good afternoon everyone. We reported solid operating and financial results for the second quarter. Total revenues and NOI for 2Q \u201824 were up 7.4% and 9.4% respectively over 2Q 2023, primarily driven by solid same property performance and continued execution of our development and re-development strategy. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the quarter was $2.36 up 5.4% over 2Q 2023 and was ahead of consensus. We reiterated the midpoint of our full-year 2024 guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $9.47 which is up 5.6% over the prior year. The key assumptions to FFO as adjusted generally remain within our prior guidance ranges and so they remain unchanged with the one exception being the change to our sources and uses to the Tech Square ground lease amendment, which I\u2019ll get to later. I\u2019ll start with internal growth. Our solid operating results for the quarter were driven by our disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy, tremendous scale, longstanding tenant relationships and operational excellence by our team. 74% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses. We have high-quality cash flows with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade and publicly traded large cap tenants. Collections remain very high at 99.9% and adjusted EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 72% for the quarter. Turning to leasing, leasing volume was strong for the quarter in the first half of 2024 at 1.1 million and 2.3 million square feet respectively. The second quarter is up 27% over the average of the back half of 2023 and is consistent with our historical quarterly average for the period from 2013 to 2020. We continue to benefit from our tremendous scale, high-quality tenant roster and brand loyalty with 79% of our leasing activity over the last 12 months coming from our existing deep well of approximately 800 tenant relationships, including the 127,000 square foot development lease that was executed this quarter with a multinational pharma company at our mega campus development in Sorrento Mesa. The rental rate increases for the first half of \u201824 were strong at 26.2% and 15% on a cash basis and our outlook for rental rate growth for the full year \u201824 remains solid at 11% to 19% and 5% to 13% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing of space for the quarter was 7.4% and 3.7% on a cash basis. As we\u2019ve noted in the past, the rental rate increases can vary from quarter-to-quarter based upon a particular mix of lease expirations. Lease terms on new leases completed in the first half of 2024 were 7.7 years, which is consistent with five out of the last 10 years, which had lease terms in the seven to eight year range. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to in place leases for our entire asset base remains solid at 12%. TIs on renewals and releasing of space for the quarter of $31.83 were consistent with our historical per square foot average since 2020 of $31.07 and the year-to-date amount is significantly below our historical average at $25.32. Our total non-revenue enhancing expenditures including TIs on renewals and leasing of space are expected to be in the 12% to 13% range as a percentage of net operating income in 2024, which is below our five year average of about 15% and highlights the durable nature of our laboratory infrastructure. Same property NOI growth for 2Q24 was solid at 1.5% and 3.9% on a cash basis, driven by solid rental rate growth and leasing volume. Our outlook for full year same property growth consistent with our last update at 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the midpoints. Our capacity for the quarter was solid at 94.6% which is consistent with the prior two quarters. Turning to lease expirations, our team has done a great job of addressing 2024 leasing expirations. Unresolved lease expirations remaining for the balance of 2024 are pretty modest up 637,192 square feet to resolve excluding the 350,000 square foot lease expiration related to the New York asset we disposed of in July. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2025, we highlighted a few key lease expirations aggregating 600,000 square feet with $37 million of annual rental revenue that are expected to have 12 months to 24 months of downtime on a weighted average basis with more than half of that coming from a lease expiration with Moderna at Tech Square, which as a reminder recently expanded into 462,000 square feet at the recently completed 325 Binney project. These spaces may require some time to release and or reposition the assets and are likely to remain as operating assets. Please refer to footnote number 5 in Page 23 of our supplemental package for additional details there. Turning next to external growth. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our development and redevelopment strategy by delivering 284,982 square feet from the pipeline, which will generate $16 million of incremental annual net operating income. We also expect to see significant future growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $80 million from executed leases as the initial free rent from recent deliveries burns off over the next seven months on a weighted average basis. As a reminder, this $80 million is for previously delivered projects and is not part of the projected go forward $480 million net operating income associated with current projects. We have $5.4 million of rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are 61% leased or negotiating and those projects are expected to generate $480 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next four years, including $187 million over the next six quarters. In July, we completed an extension of our ground lease at Alexandria Technology Square. This will require a prepayment of rent of $2,135 million amounts in 4Q \u201824 and 1Q \u201825 and will be amortized into non recoverable ground rent expense starting in 3Q \u201824 through 2088 on a straight line basis. We increased our guidance range for disposition sales partial interest and common equity to reflect the funding for the first ground lease payment due in 4Q \u201824. A few key items to note. First, we view this asset, Tech Square as a generational asset located adjacent to MIT in Cambridge at the centre of Maine and Maine with several important relationships located on the campus. Second, since we acquired this mega campus in 2006, NOI has nearly quadrupled over our ownership period. And third, even with the expected prepayment of rent, we believe this adjusts to a very attractive annual ground rent cost relative to market over the next 65 years. And ultimately, we believe that this extension enhances the long-term value of the campus. For all these reasons, we are very pleased with the outcome. I\u2019ll turn next to cap interest. We continue to focus on the completion of committed and or under construction projects which are expected to generate $480 million of incremental NOI through 1Q \u201928 as well as important pre construction activities adding value and focused on reducing the time from lease execution to delivery. Capitalized interest has declined three quarters in a row primarily due to the delivery of projects from the pipeline, which generated $187 million of incremental annual net operating income over that time and a decline in average real estate base is subject to capitalization of $1.9 billion from a peak in 3Q \u201823 to 2Q \u201824. Our outlook for capitalized interest for \u201824 is consistent with our previous guidance and continues to assume around a 10% decline in average basis subject to capitalization for the full year \u201824 compared to \u201823. Transitioning next to the balance sheet, we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets amongst all publicly traded U.S. REITs and we look for opportunities to continue enhancing our fortress balance sheet. Our corporate credit ratings are in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our leverage continues to remain low at 5.4 times for net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly annualized basis. We have an attractive debt profile with fixed rate debt comprising 97.3% of our total debt and a weighted average remaining term of debt of 13 years. We also have tremendous liquidity of $5.6 billion supported by our $5 billion revolving credit facility. We\u2019re very pleased with the recent agreement to extend our credit facility through January 2030 and we thank our banking relationships for the tremendous support to help us continue our mission. We remain disciplined with our strategy for long-term funding of our business and recycling capital from dispositions and partial interest sales to minimize the issuance of common stock. Our disposition strategy is heavily weighted towards outright dispositions of assets not integral to our mega campus strategy allowing us to enhance the quality of our asset base. We may also consider reducing the size of our future pipeline through asset recycling in the current pipeline and into our mega campuses. July \u201824 we completed the sale of our vacant non-laboratory building located in Manhattan for $60 million. This building was designated as held for sale in 4Q \u201823 and was sold following the lease expiration for the full building in July of \u201824. The aggregate total of completed and pending dispositions under negotiation plus a small amount of equity we raised on the ATM aggregates $912 million or 59% of the midpoint of our guidance of $1.55 billion. While the macro environment remains challenging, we are reasonably optimistic that we can execute on our disposition plan in 2024 at values representing a reasonable cost of capital. Based upon our outlook as of today, we plan to pause on future issuances under the ATM program at least for the next quarter. We also expect to fund a meaningful amount of our equities with retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends of $450 million at the midpoint of our guidance for \u201824. Our high-quality cash flows continue to support the growth in our annual common stock dividends with an average annual increase in dividends per share of 5% since 2020 and we continue to have a conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for 2Q \u201824. Realized gains from venture investments including FFO per share as adjusted were $33.4 million in the quarter and $62.2 million for the six months ended June. On an annualized basis based upon the first six months of \u201824 that would take realized gains towards the high end of our guidance range for the full year of $95 million to $125 million. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of 2Q \u201824 were $284 million on a cost basis of $1.2 billion. We\u2019ve updated our guidance for 2024 for EPS of $2.98 to $3.10 and we maintained our guidance range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted with no change to midpoint of $9.47 which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share for 2024. With that, let me turn it back to Joel.\nJoel S. Marcus: Thank you, Marc. And operator, we\u2019ll go to questions, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s first question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nFarrell Granath: Hi. This is Farrell Granath on behalf of Josh. I quickly wanted to ask about, as you\u2019re mentioning, the Alexandria Technology Square mega campus, kind of that repositioning going from multi-tenant or going to multi tenancy from single tenancy. I was wondering if you could discuss the driver of this change and if you\u2019re seeing any shift in demand of the market for single tenants?\nJoel S. Marcus: Well, I think there is no fundamental change. As I think Marc mentioned, Moderna has essentially or is moving out of that space in Tech Square 200 and moving to their new R&D and HQ headquarters at 325 Binney. So, they leave behind laboratory assets in that space or spaces. And our plan is to release those generally as a multi-tenant situation. So, it\u2019s not really any change. We clearly knew for a long period of time that Moderna was leaving and this is just part of their growth and something we\u2019ve done time and time again. Just remember, Alexandria Technology Square sits right across the street from MIT\u2019s main science campus and you\u2019ve got the best location in the world when it comes to laboratory space.\nFarrell Granath: Great. Thank you. And also I noticed in between the 1Q, 2Q letters of intent and pending along with closed acquisitions that there was a slight kind of, I don\u2019t know, dropping off of the LOIs. So, I wonder if you could comment on that either, if things are coming out of the pipeline due to different circumstances, pricing negotiations?\nJoel S. Marcus: Peter, do you want to comment on that?\nPeter M. Moglia: Yes, I mean --\nJoel S. Marcus: Go ahead, Marc.\nMarc E. Binda: Yes, I was just going to say, yes, I think what you\u2019re referring to is the lease percentage on the development pipeline. It wasn\u2019t that leases were leased and then weren\u2019t leased. What happened there was we actually added a little bit more square feet into one of the assets at 311 Arsenal. That was a project that has been coming back to us in phases. And so the project just got larger this quarter and as a result the lease percentage went down. So, I don\u2019t know that there was any type of surprise there.\nFarrell Granath: I think what I was referring to was the on the acquisition page within the supplemental, the pending acquisition signed letters of intent. I guess just when adding them together and taking out what was completed in 2Q \u201824, I think there is a slight difference just quarter-over-quarter. Is that what you\u2019re referring to for the purchase price for I think what is this Page 5 of the supplemental?\nMarc E. Binda: Yes. No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s yes, look, if you look at last quarter the pending items that we were looking at, I think that number has come down a little bit. But I think that number came down by a pretty small amount if I recall correctly. So, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything shocking or surprising from our end. I think we\u2019re focused on conserving capital and putting our capital into the active pipeline and focus on dispositions at the moment.\nFarrell Granath: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Yes. Thank you. Can you talk a bit about just cap rates on the pending $806 million of sales or stake sales? And just maybe even more broadly, any updates across your markets as it relates to property values or cap rates?\nPeter M. Moglia: Yes. Hey, Tony, it\u2019s Peter. Yes, look, the things that we\u2019ll have cap rates published, I think you\u2019ll find to be in line with our commentary of good quality assets are still in demand. I don\u2019t want to spoil any thunder for next quarter, but we do have a couple of things that are going that are pretty good. Noncore assets though can certainly not necessarily be representative of our prime assets that we plan on holding in perpetuity. But GAAP rates are a tough thing to figure out these days what people\u2019s returns, what they are looking for largely depends on their cost of capital which has been varied throughout the last few quarters. But I\u2019m going to go ahead and wait till I think next quarter we\u2019ll have something to publish and you\u2019ll see the numbers.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just you mentioned a couple of times in the prepared remarks about just the increased leaning into the mega campus strategy and even shedding more noncore. Is there like a percentage of the portfolio you\u2019d characterize as kind of not fitting the long-term strategy at this point that you can provide?\nJoel S. Marcus: Well, I think if you look at the percentage of ARR coming from the mega campuses and that\u2019s not you have a series of assets. Remember, this company was built over decades on individual acquisitions and then individual redevelopments and developments. And then the first mega campus that we bought was Tech Square, in fact, in 2006, and that really kind of launched that strategy, followed by Campus Point in 2010, and then the New York campus, which was our first mega development campus. So, I think you just have to think of it in terms these are still really very, very good assets, and we\u2019ve moved in many cases and shed many of our more core assets in the suburbs, and we still have quite a number of standalone assets, not really in the outer suburbs that we\u2019ve transacted over the last handful of years, and I think we\u2019re looking at that. So, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s easy to give you exact percentages, but as I said, our main goal is to move our mega campus annual rental revenue into the high 80s or low 90s over the next short handful of years, Tony, if that\u2019s helpful.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Griffin at Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Griffin: Great, thanks. My first question was just on the leasing environment. I noticed for the renewals there was a decline in weighted average lease term relative to last quarter. Can you maybe give some insights? Was it specific to the renewals that were coming up? Is it more indicative of tenants maybe being unsure of their footprint? I realize that one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but any commentary around that would be helpful.\nJoel S. Marcus: Yes. So, I\u2019ll ask Peter to comment from his perspective. But I think if you think about again, you said it, individual leases that come up quarter-to-quarter certainly drive those stats. I think it\u2019s fair to say and Hallie has commented on this on a number of occasions, We\u2019re seeing more demand from the earlier stage companies and the revenue generating companies, it\u2019s the in between the biotechs that are in the clinic waiting for clinical milestone achievement that I think has caused some of the disruption in the normal leasing transactions that have gone on. And I think this quarter there was just more at the earlier stage, and those people can\u2019t commit to 10 or 15 year leases because they\u2019re likely to grow, and that\u2019s the reason to have them on a mega campus because we can provide them 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 whatever they want and we can double and triple their footprint on a mega campus, whereas an individual building, oftentimes, you can\u2019t really do that.\nPeter M. Moglia: Yes. Hey, Michael, it\u2019s Peter. Great observation. It\u2019s one of the first things that I noticed when I started looking at the numbers and Joel is absolutely spot on. It\u2019s serendipitous. We had just a large portion of the leasing was for early-stage companies. And as Joel mentioned, those companies tend to sign shorter term leases because they expect to be much bigger in the future. And Joel is exactly right. It\u2019s one of the reasons that we adopted a mega campus strategy because we have these types of tenants that will grow within the mega campus. So, but yes, no trend other than just serendipity.\nMichael Griffin: And Peter, do those smaller tenants I guess require the larger TI packages? I noticed that free rent was stable quarter-over-quarter, but it seemed like TIs and LCs went up. So, what\u2019s that just a one off maybe driven by one lease or what was driving that?\nPeter M. Moglia: Yes, well, Mark mentioned in his comments that although it was higher than maybe the last couple of handful of quarters that TI/LC number was about our average since 2020. These are renewals, so it\u2019s going to -- the numbers will vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the work that needs to be done on the suite. Mark mentioned in his comments the recycling, the durability of our spaces. We don\u2019t have to put a lot of CapEx to continue the lease and to continue to leverage off previous investment. But in certain cases you have a tenant that might need to do some reconfiguration or you might have a lease that\u2019s in a space that\u2019s 15 years old or so, so you got to put more money into it. So, it\u2019s again, it\u2019s not a trend, it\u2019s not a market trend like it would be. We\u2019ve talked about things from shell, the TIs have gone up considerably, because tenants don\u2019t want to invest in the space like they used to have to. But in the case of renewals, it\u2019s just lease-by-lease. What is the space look like? What is the tenant need? But it\u2019s still if you consider the inflation that has happened in construction costs $30 is still not a lot of money to be averaging on renewals.\nMichael Griffin: And then maybe just one more if I could just on the development pipeline. I noticed that the 651 Gateway project was pushed to \u201826. Is this just a function of maybe more tepid demand in South San Francisco and at what point would you have to stop capitalizing costs on this project and start having it flow into the income statement?\nPeter M. Moglia: Yes, that\u2019s exactly correct. Of all the markets submarkets, South San Francisco certainly as we\u2019ve highlighted and Peter has talked about that for quite a number of quarters, has one of the most outsized supply issues. Remember too, this is an old building that we inherited in a joint venture. So, the time and effort to get this redeveloped is just what it is. The good news is we have several transactions going on that weren\u2019t alive last quarter. So, I think that\u2019s good news. Marc can comment on the termination of capitalization.\nMarc E. Binda: Yes. Hi, Michael. Yes, there\u2019s not a magic number there in terms of when it would turn off. There\u2019s continuing activities today on doing work on those floors that remain to be leased and delivered. But yes, if there was a situation where those activities ceased, where the demand just couldn\u2019t catch up with the supply there then we would have to shut down those portions of the project that no longer have activity. So, we\u2019ll continue to watch that very carefully.\nMichael Griffin: Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for the time.\nPeter M. Moglia: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Rich Anderson at Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nRichard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning out there or good afternoon, excuse me. So, on the leasing front, you had the mix issue this past quarter. But if you sort of look at what you did in the first half and compare that to what you\u2019re guiding to which didn\u2019t change, that would imply like a GAAP number of 8%, average 8% up in the second half and a cash average of about 5%. Is that right? Am I thinking about that correctly if I just do a sum product of the math or am I missing something?\nJoel S. Marcus: Yes, I can take that one. Hi, Rich. Yes, it\u2019s not a perfect analysis, right, because volume can vary from quarter-to-quarter, particularly in that release and renewal bucket, right. That\u2019s only a fraction of the total leasing. So, it\u2019s not a perfect analysis. But yes, I mean, I think you\u2019re right that the first half of the year was very strong. It\u2019s the numbers are actually above the high end of our midpoint. But we feel comfortable with our guidance we\u2019ve got out there, which we still think is very strong in this environment. And that it does imply on average slightly lower numbers than the first half, but I think we\u2019re still very pleased with where we expect to come out for the year.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. And Peter, I\u2019m going to see if I can ask a cap rate question at a different angle, see if you shut me down as well. But do you have a differential between core and noncore assets in terms of cap rates? Is there a spread that you guys think about in terms of what you think is a long-term hold and what\u2019s not?\nPeter M. Moglia: Yes, I mean, I think about it in a way as long-term holds are going to be mega campuses in the prime core locations and you\u2019ve seen us put up really strong numbers there. And then we\u2019ve got some good assets. We own them because they were good assets, but they are not mega campuses. They are typically not within the core mark, core centres of innovation, but they were areas that supported research for different reasons and might be 100 to 200 basis point spread between something prime and something not so prime.\nRichard Anderson: Okay, great. Last question, you\u2019re funding a lot of your development or most of it with dispositions. And I\u2019m curious if you think by doing so, you, I guess, expose yourself to impairments in this market. Do you kind of view this in some ways as a cleansing event that and I suppose you do, like you wouldn\u2019t necessarily be using dispositions if your stock was at $200 a share, but you are. Is that the silver lining to this long-term in your opinion or is that not the way to look at it?\nJoel S. Marcus: Yeah. Well, I\u2019ll comment and then Peter can. I think the answer is yes in the sense that we feel that the industry has been on a tear for, as I said, the 2014 to 2021 and then the rocketship and then kind of the drop off from that. And it\u2019s pretty clear that in today\u2019s fairly, way more disciplined allocation of capital from the life science industry, more and more, it\u2019s clear to us, it\u2019s been clear for a long time, but even more so today, that the best prospects for leasing and either keeping a tenant or attracting a new tenant is to give them great optionality on a mega campus, great amenities and that\u2019s where we want to refocus or double down our efforts and we\u2019ve gone a long way to bring that to reality. But we think that\u2019s where we want to be out a period of time where we have fewer and fewer noncore assets, because I think they don\u2019t give us the optionality to attract or grow with tenants the way we want to grow, not that the buildings aren\u2019t leasable because some of them are absolutely great buildings and have great tenants.\nPeter M. Moglia: Yes. Look, I think it is a bit of a silver lining but I would say that it would have happened anyway because of our observation that the mega campus model was where we needed to be headed. So, ultimately those assets maybe it would have been at a slower pace, but we would have, been selling those noncore, non-mega campus assets over time anyway.\nJoel S. Marcus: Yes. And we really have done that if you look at Greater Boston. I mean, we didn\u2019t have the money to get into Cambridge or even Waltham in the early days, so we started out in Worcester. And so are the evolution of how we\u2019ve looked at each of the submarkets is we have gone from kind of outer burbs to kind of the inner core, just as the company has grown and now we just want to refine and hone that strategy. And we feel like we started that back as early as 2006 and now we\u2019re doubling down on it.\nRichard Anderson: Okay, great color. Thanks folks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.\nWesley Golladay: Hi, everyone. Just looking at the dispositions, it looks like you have about 10 million square feet of non-mega campus development potential. How much of that would you like to I guess be part of your disposition program?\nPeter M. Moglia: Yes, look, I think Joel mentioned it earlier that our development pipeline may shrink in the future and something that\u2019s non income producing like land is very accretive to sell and to use to fund our current pipeline or in our future in place pipeline. So, of course, we would like to if we for certain in certain areas if we have land that we can market and sell, we will. So, it will certainly be part of our strategy.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then looking at the ground lease purchase, you did mention it was a generational asset, did have a lot of term on it already before you extended it. Is there any other ground leases you\u2019re looking to extend actively at the moment?\nJoel S. Marcus: One thing I would point out, I think Marc you absolutely can answer this. But one thing I want to point out is, I think it was a really astute move for us to do that today because this was a situation where we had more leverage today than we would have in better times. So, sometimes you have to make moves even if it\u2019s a tough environment because long-term it\u2019s going to really set you up well. Marc, if you want to answer the other part of the question?\nMarc E. Binda: Yes, sure. Hi, Wes. I was just going to say Tech Square, if you look at the ARR subject to ground lease was far and away the largest ground lease that we have. It was about a third of the ARR subject to ground leases. The balance of that is spread across I think 29 different properties. And then if you think about where the lease terms are kind of on a pro form basis once the amendment or now that the amendment is done. It\u2019s a little bit more of 60 plus years. So, I think we\u2019ve got pretty good term on in terms of the remainder of our ground leases.\nWesley Golladay: Great. Thanks for the time everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Carroll at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Yes, thanks. Peter, I wanted to follow-up on Mike\u2019s question earlier in the call. I mean, is there a reason why most of the leasing activity is coming from early-stage biotech companies? Is that a trend we should expect to continue over the next few quarters? Is that just kind of unique towards the activity this specific quarter?\nPeter M. Moglia: Well, look it is consistent with the way we\u2019ve characterized demand. By and large across our regions there has been a barbell of early-stage companies being very active and large pharma being very active and not as much in the middle due to a lack or not necessarily a lack of wanting to grow, but lack of confidence to grow. So, we do expect that the middle will fill in over-time especially considering the metrics that Hallie started to or had presented but it\u2019s not a trend it just happened to be we had a number of earlier stage company leases rolling and it just was a coincidence.\nHallie Kuhn: Hi, this is Hallie. I was just going to reiterate that certainly we see funding being strong across multiple data points. Venture certainly looks great this year, follow on financings have been very strong, and we continue to see demand across the diversity of our tenant portfolio, if you look at our tenant pie chart broken out by ARR. So, while certainly demand may look different from quarter-to-quarter from any given segment, I don\u2019t think there is one specific trend that is driving demand from only one of these tenant segments. That\u2019s the beauty of the life science industry is the diversity of the types of companies we have in our portfolio.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then can you guys provide an update on your supply outlook. I know in prior calls you provided some stats given the scheduled deliveries in \u201924 and in 2025 as a percentage of inventory in the top three cluster markets. I mean, have those stats changed at all? Or can you provide us an update on how you\u2019re viewing that?\nJoel S. Marcus: Yes, look we didn\u2019t want to bore you all with the same numbers over and over and over again. I would say the only real material change was there was a lot of deliveries in San Francisco this past quarter, but it\u2019s progressing like we thought. We are in the under 5% of total inventory left to deliver in this year and the next year about half of that amount will deliver next year. So, from the amount that is left to deliver in \u201824 is roughly half of what it was at the beginning of the year and so it\u2019s progressing like we thought. It\u2019s the same amount of space. We don\u2019t see a material amount of supply dissipating. We also don\u2019t see a material amount of supply being added.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. And then just last one for me, I know you already talked about the Gateway project, but I know you had two developments that were 100% leased at Winter Street and Harriet Tubman Way that got pushed out, it looks like roughly a quarter or so. Is that just delays in the construction or is there any reasons why those stabilizations were pushed out a few quarters?\nJoel S. Marcus: Yes, I can take that one, Michael. Yes, I mean, you\u2019re right. The project at 230 Harriet Tubman was pushed out I think a quarter, that projects 100% leased, same with 840 Winter actually it\u2019s a similar story on both of them that they\u2019re 100% leased in the tenant programming just ends up making the construction a little bit longer. So, that just happens sometimes.\nMichael Carroll: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Joel, maybe bigger picture, you laid out a pretty compelling longer-term scenario for life sciences in the portfolio. And just want you to if you could help us marry that with the near-term. It sounded like there\u2019s still some challenges, but also were inflecting from a supply delivery standpoint. So, just help us like what should we be watching for near-term inflection, it sounded like a little more tepid near-term than the long-term?\nJoel S. Marcus: Yes. Thank you for the question. And I think it\u2019s a good one. I think you have to remember that we\u2019ve seen the internet bubble crash in 2000 the GFC in 2008, 2009, and then kind of the blow up of the rocket ship of COVID as it kind of came down to earth, and each one is kind of different. I think this time, we don\u2019t have financial institution problems, we don\u2019t have lots of companies that had kind of fake business plans failing, like back in 2000, not so much biotech, but certainly in the dot com bubble era. I think this time, we\u2019ve never seen supply in our particular niche. Supply has always been there, but it\u2019s never been oversupplied in a sense. And so when you combine that oversupply with more muted demand coming off just rocketship demand of 2021, I mean, our leasing quadrupled during some of those quarters and years, which you just know can\u2019t be sustained. I think that\u2019s the overarching issue and the industry and Hallie did a great job of articulating the segments is mission critical. It\u2019s the crown jewel of this country, its critical to the health of our citizen and beyond. And I think that, and the funding factors and diversity is very, very strong. How that translates into is the big question everybody wants answered, but there\u2019s no algorithm to do it. How that translates into a more consistent and robust demand. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re all kind of working through. And every cycle is just different. And so we\u2019re very optimistic about the future. Obviously, we wouldn\u2019t be in this business if we weren\u2019t. But we know that we have to make adjustments to our assets, our capital plan and make sure that we have we\u2019re best positioning the company to help our 800 tenants grow and attract a whole lot more. And we think by selling more of the noncore assets, slimming down the future pipeline a bit and doubling down on the mega campus is the right strategy till the market really turns. And I think whether the election, whether it\u2019s the executive branch or each of the houses, helps reinforce a more robust economic environment. It\u2019s hard to say, as I said in my prepared remarks, debt service and the overall health of that, of the economy, given debt to GDP and so forth. A lot of really smart people have opined on that issue and we want to make sure that if there\u2019s a bigger shock out there to the system, we\u2019re extremely well protected. So sorry for the long answer.\nVikram Malhotra: No, that\u2019s helpful. And just maybe one more, I guess maybe Marc you can or Peter. You\u2019ve done a bunch of repositionings or at least put properties into repositioning. I\u2019m just trying to understand like bigger picture what the opportunity set is or how to split it between like this was office, we always intended it to reposition the lab versus where we got to just redevelop. So like, for example, the Apple repositioning where Apple was, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I thought that was going to be a renewal originally, but now you\u2019re repositioning it. So, I\u2019m just trying to think about the opportunity set down the road and like what the impact to numbers is.\nMarc E. Binda: Yes, I can take that one, Vikram. Yes, so on the Apple one that you mentioned or really in Austin, we\u2019re renewing some of that space. If you look at the lease expirations, some of that\u2019s being negotiated. The balance of that the spaces we\u2019re getting back are warehouse and R&D spaces. So, those are that space we\u2019re marketing, we\u2019ve got folks looking at that. It\u2019s possible that some of those one or two of those buildings gets converted, but we\u2019ll have to stay tuned. When you talk about repositioning, that\u2019s more in the lines of what I think Joel or Peter talked about earlier for the Tech Square 200 where it\u2019s an existing laboratory building, but it\u2019s been single tenant for a while and it\u2019s an opportunity to be able to market that space to multi-tenant. So, that\u2019s in terms of when we talk about repositioning that\u2019s we\u2019re thinking of that is in the bad CapEx bucket. But again, if you look back over a long period of time that the amount of CapEx has been relatively small.\nPeter M. Moglia: Yeah. And just maybe a footnote on that. So, Apple is in the process of negotiating a renewal on the majority of the buildings, but they\u2019re giving back two of the buildings, which Marc highlighted. I think the good news is, one is, I think imminently releasable as R&D and the other is warehouse, which we do have a client who\u2019s actually very interested in that. And based on what we\u2019ve seen in the market, there also could be some demand for data centre activity there. So we\u2019re not necessarily we had in our forward model, we had assumed this scenario that we would get back two buildings that weren\u2019t adjacent to their campus where their other buildings are and that they would take those forward and that\u2019s exactly how it played out.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Kammert with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJames Kammert: Thank you. Apologies for a bit of a pedestrian math question, but you speak to 341,000 square feet or so of leasing activity and the development and redevelopment pipeline. But help me, where am I missing? If I go to page 37 of the supplemental and I kind of reconcile the net change in lease square footage percentages from the prior quarter to the second quarter, coming up a little shy of $340,000 So I\u2019m just trying to where am I missing or where else should I look? Thank you.\nMarc E. Binda: Hey, Jim. This is Marc. Yeah, you\u2019re right. There was actually one project that was already leased where the tenant actually came back to us to actually add on additional term. That project has not been finished yet, hasn\u2019t been completed. So, a bit of a conundrum where you put that, but given that that project hasn\u2019t delivered, it\u2019s in the development pipeline. That\u2019s a project in San Diego and we were happy to see that happen because we got an extra term out of it. So, that\u2019s the reason for that. That doesn\u2019t happen very often.\nJames Kammert: I see. So, it\u2019s basically almost a give back, but then they came back with a longer requirement. So, we just can\u2019t see that and it must be in the order of 100,000 square feet plus. Does that sound right?\nMarc E. Binda: That\u2019s right.\nJames Kammert: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Abramowitz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nPeter Abramowitz: Thank you. Yes, most of my questions have been answered, but just one other on the mix in leasing this quarter. Could you just comment on the leasing spreads? Was there anything kind of notable that stood out that dragged them down a little bit this quarter. I know you talked about how it can be lumpy, but just wondering if there\u2019s anything to call out there?\nJoel S. Marcus: Yes, the answer is no. And the mix of the different segments, whether it be product and device, multinational pharma, private biotech, all were actually pretty strong and a mixture of those, public biotech was probably among the lowest. That\u2019s just how it works, given what we\u2019ve said about the barbell, but nothing don\u2019t read anything into if you look at first quarter was extremely strong, this quarter\u2019s more muted, but still pretty solid. And I think it kind of just is kind of down the middle of the fairway as we see it at this juncture.\nPeter Abramowitz: Got it. Thanks, Joel. And then one other for me. I think you\u2019ve talked about there\u2019s been a fair amount of activity and an increase in activity this year sort of in that small to midsize tenant group. I guess as you look out into the market and the funding environment and the macro backdrop, any idea or a sense of what you think it would take for kind of larger those 100,000 square foot and up tenants to start to get more active?\nJoel S. Marcus: Yes, I\u2019ll ask Hallie to answer, but my kind of the one thing that would make a huge difference would be the true opening of the IPO market, which signals that you\u2019ve got long term investors, crossover investors and even earlier stage investors participating. The IPOs that have happened to date are kind of few and far between and they\u2019ve traded down on an average pretty substantially. So, that\u2019s one thing that would be very recognizable and has been something that has led some of the other bull markets. But Hallie, you could comment more in-depth.\nHallie Kuhn: Yes. I would say taking a step back, generally those requirements, particularly from the public biotechnology tenants, are very milestone based, and that is irrespective of the macro environment, whether or not a clinical trial has positive or negative data, it doesn\u2019t matter what the interest rates are. So, I would say historically, as we look at those types of requirements, it\u2019s just really dependent on companies hitting those inflection points. And we certainly have some of those types of requirements in the pipeline as data comes to fruition. And there\u2019s been some other examples of well, backside is a good example in our St. Carlos campus. They\u2019ve continued to expand off positive data. So, I would kind of shift the focus more towards as these companies continue to show that they have value in their pipelines that is really where the demand is driven from.\nPeter Abramowitz: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDylan Burzinski: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just sort of wanting to touch on retention here. I know historically your guys\u2019 retention has typically been in cost of 75% to 80% range. But over the last six quarters that started to trend down, I guess just curious as we sort of look out over the next year or so as the supply pipeline continues to deliver, should we expect that to continue to have an impact on your guys\u2019 retention? And I guess just looking at the last six quarters, I mean, is there something else besides supply that is sort of driving that lower retention rate?\nJoel S. Marcus: Yes. So, Marc, do you have the steps on that?\nMarc E. Binda: Yes. Dylan, I think if you\u2019re just looking at renewals as a percentage of expirations, it\u2019s really hard to get the full picture. Case in point, you\u2019ve got as an example, you\u2019ve got Moderna and Tech Square that we talked about right where large space that they will not be renewing, right. But what\u2019s missing is, right, they signed 462,000 square foot lease at a new development. So, it\u2019s difficult just to take the retention rates right off the face of the leasing page. I mean, the way we look at it, when we normalize for those sorts of things, we really haven\u2019t seen a drop off in retention.\nDylan Burzinski: Got it. And so I guess given the mission critical nature of life science facilities, it seems like for those tenants new supply like simply upgrading your facility may not be worth it given the downtime and the risk associated with moving landlords, is that fair to say?\nJoel S. Marcus: Well, I think it\u2019s way more complicated than that. People in this industry don\u2019t move for a buck a foot difference, that\u2019s just not relevant. And also the sponsorship of who they lease from is critical because there have been a number over the last year of significant failures of others in this industry where labs have been shut down and major damages happen to the science or the people in the laboratories. So, operating with the best of breed in the industry makes a big difference. We don\u2019t see anybody that\u2019s just going to move to a place for some small difference that just doesn\u2019t happen. And if the tenants are decent, our mega campus strategy is aimed at always having inventory to allow these companies to grow and to retain them. So, that\u2019s the big issue. Supply isn\u2019t really the big issue now. Supply does impact leasing in the sense that when somebody is looking at space, they could cite other locations. But if the locations aren\u2019t really dead centre comparable then those comps don\u2019t really make a big difference and people aren\u2019t going to pick up and leave for as I say a few bucks cheaper rent, it just doesn\u2019t happen in this industry.\nDylan Burzinski: That\u2019s helpful detail. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question today comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I just wanted to focus on Boston a little bit. You do have a fair amount of leases that will be expiring in that market in the back half of this year and also in 2025. Trying to understand what\u2019s happening with market rents in those markets relative to you in place rents as we kind of try to estimate, guesstimate what mark-to-market could look like on a going forward basis?\nJoel S. Marcus: Yes. So, Marc, you could comment on overall mark-to-market and Peter, you could give some observations if you want.\nMarc E. Binda: Sure. Yes. I mean, we talk about the in-place mark-to-market for our entire portfolio being about 12%. We typically don\u2019t break that down kind of market by market. But you\u2019re right, we do have a fair amount of space that\u2019s rolling. The good news is a lot of that\u2019s in Cambridge, which that\u2019s where you\u2019re getting space back. It\u2019s still a place where market rents have done pretty well. But Peter, maybe I\u2019ll let you comment specifically if you want on market rents there.\nPeter M. Moglia: We\u2019ve been looking at a lot of data around where face rates are and Boston is and the rest of our large markets are pretty consistent where rents have come off the peaks of 2021, 2022, but they\u2019re still well above the pre pandemic rates. Of course, you still have more concessions today in the form of TIs for the newly built space. But we\u2019re pretty happy considering the supply dynamic that rents are still above the pre pandemic levels.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.\nJoel S. Marcus: Just want to wish everybody a safe and healthy summer and we\u2019ll look forward to talking on our third quarter call. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Marc E. Binda",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. This is Marc Binda, CFO. Hello and good afternoon everyone. We reported solid operating and financial results for the second quarter. Total revenues and NOI for 2Q \u201824 were up 7.4% and 9.4% respectively over 2Q 2023, primarily driven by solid same property performance and continued execution of our development and re-development strategy. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the quarter was $2.36 up 5.4% over 2Q 2023 and was ahead of consensus. We reiterated the midpoint of our full-year 2024 guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $9.47 which is up 5.6% over the prior year. The key assumptions to FFO as adjusted generally remain within our prior guidance ranges and so they remain unchanged with the one exception being the change to our sources and uses to the Tech Square ground lease amendment, which I\u2019ll get to later. I\u2019ll start with internal growth. Our solid operating results for the quarter were driven by our disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy, tremendous scale, longstanding tenant relationships and operational excellence by our team. 74% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses. We have high-quality cash flows with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade and publicly traded large cap tenants. Collections remain very high at 99.9% and adjusted EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 72% for the quarter. Turning to leasing, leasing volume was strong for the quarter in the first half of 2024 at 1.1 million and 2.3 million square feet respectively. The second quarter is up 27% over the average of the back half of 2023 and is consistent with our historical quarterly average for the period from 2013 to 2020. We continue to benefit from our tremendous scale, high-quality tenant roster and brand loyalty with 79% of our leasing activity over the last 12 months coming from our existing deep well of approximately 800 tenant relationships, including the 127,000 square foot development lease that was executed this quarter with a multinational pharma company at our mega campus development in Sorrento Mesa. The rental rate increases for the first half of \u201824 were strong at 26.2% and 15% on a cash basis and our outlook for rental rate growth for the full year \u201824 remains solid at 11% to 19% and 5% to 13% on a cash basis. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing of space for the quarter was 7.4% and 3.7% on a cash basis. As we\u2019ve noted in the past, the rental rate increases can vary from quarter-to-quarter based upon a particular mix of lease expirations. Lease terms on new leases completed in the first half of 2024 were 7.7 years, which is consistent with five out of the last 10 years, which had lease terms in the seven to eight year range. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates related to in place leases for our entire asset base remains solid at 12%. TIs on renewals and releasing of space for the quarter of $31.83 were consistent with our historical per square foot average since 2020 of $31.07 and the year-to-date amount is significantly below our historical average at $25.32. Our total non-revenue enhancing expenditures including TIs on renewals and leasing of space are expected to be in the 12% to 13% range as a percentage of net operating income in 2024, which is below our five year average of about 15% and highlights the durable nature of our laboratory infrastructure. Same property NOI growth for 2Q24 was solid at 1.5% and 3.9% on a cash basis, driven by solid rental rate growth and leasing volume. Our outlook for full year same property growth consistent with our last update at 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the midpoints. Our capacity for the quarter was solid at 94.6% which is consistent with the prior two quarters. Turning to lease expirations, our team has done a great job of addressing 2024 leasing expirations. Unresolved lease expirations remaining for the balance of 2024 are pretty modest up 637,192 square feet to resolve excluding the 350,000 square foot lease expiration related to the New York asset we disposed of in July. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2025, we highlighted a few key lease expirations aggregating 600,000 square feet with $37 million of annual rental revenue that are expected to have 12 months to 24 months of downtime on a weighted average basis with more than half of that coming from a lease expiration with Moderna at Tech Square, which as a reminder recently expanded into 462,000 square feet at the recently completed 325 Binney project. These spaces may require some time to release and or reposition the assets and are likely to remain as operating assets. Please refer to footnote number 5 in Page 23 of our supplemental package for additional details there. Turning next to external growth. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our development and redevelopment strategy by delivering 284,982 square feet from the pipeline, which will generate $16 million of incremental annual net operating income. We also expect to see significant future growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $80 million from executed leases as the initial free rent from recent deliveries burns off over the next seven months on a weighted average basis. As a reminder, this $80 million is for previously delivered projects and is not part of the projected go forward $480 million net operating income associated with current projects. We have $5.4 million of rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are 61% leased or negotiating and those projects are expected to generate $480 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next four years, including $187 million over the next six quarters. In July, we completed an extension of our ground lease at Alexandria Technology Square. This will require a prepayment of rent of $2,135 million amounts in 4Q \u201824 and 1Q \u201825 and will be amortized into non recoverable ground rent expense starting in 3Q \u201824 through 2088 on a straight line basis. We increased our guidance range for disposition sales partial interest and common equity to reflect the funding for the first ground lease payment due in 4Q \u201824. A few key items to note. First, we view this asset, Tech Square as a generational asset located adjacent to MIT in Cambridge at the centre of Maine and Maine with several important relationships located on the campus. Second, since we acquired this mega campus in 2006, NOI has nearly quadrupled over our ownership period. And third, even with the expected prepayment of rent, we believe this adjusts to a very attractive annual ground rent cost relative to market over the next 65 years. And ultimately, we believe that this extension enhances the long-term value of the campus. For all these reasons, we are very pleased with the outcome. I\u2019ll turn next to cap interest. We continue to focus on the completion of committed and or under construction projects which are expected to generate $480 million of incremental NOI through 1Q \u201928 as well as important pre construction activities adding value and focused on reducing the time from lease execution to delivery. Capitalized interest has declined three quarters in a row primarily due to the delivery of projects from the pipeline, which generated $187 million of incremental annual net operating income over that time and a decline in average real estate base is subject to capitalization of $1.9 billion from a peak in 3Q \u201823 to 2Q \u201824. Our outlook for capitalized interest for \u201824 is consistent with our previous guidance and continues to assume around a 10% decline in average basis subject to capitalization for the full year \u201824 compared to \u201823. Transitioning next to the balance sheet, we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets amongst all publicly traded U.S. REITs and we look for opportunities to continue enhancing our fortress balance sheet. Our corporate credit ratings are in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our leverage continues to remain low at 5.4 times for net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly annualized basis. We have an attractive debt profile with fixed rate debt comprising 97.3% of our total debt and a weighted average remaining term of debt of 13 years. We also have tremendous liquidity of $5.6 billion supported by our $5 billion revolving credit facility. We\u2019re very pleased with the recent agreement to extend our credit facility through January 2030 and we thank our banking relationships for the tremendous support to help us continue our mission. We remain disciplined with our strategy for long-term funding of our business and recycling capital from dispositions and partial interest sales to minimize the issuance of common stock. Our disposition strategy is heavily weighted towards outright dispositions of assets not integral to our mega campus strategy allowing us to enhance the quality of our asset base. We may also consider reducing the size of our future pipeline through asset recycling in the current pipeline and into our mega campuses. July \u201824 we completed the sale of our vacant non-laboratory building located in Manhattan for $60 million. This building was designated as held for sale in 4Q \u201823 and was sold following the lease expiration for the full building in July of \u201824. The aggregate total of completed and pending dispositions under negotiation plus a small amount of equity we raised on the ATM aggregates $912 million or 59% of the midpoint of our guidance of $1.55 billion. While the macro environment remains challenging, we are reasonably optimistic that we can execute on our disposition plan in 2024 at values representing a reasonable cost of capital. Based upon our outlook as of today, we plan to pause on future issuances under the ATM program at least for the next quarter. We also expect to fund a meaningful amount of our equities with retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends of $450 million at the midpoint of our guidance for \u201824. Our high-quality cash flows continue to support the growth in our annual common stock dividends with an average annual increase in dividends per share of 5% since 2020 and we continue to have a conservative FFO payout ratio of 55% for 2Q \u201824. Realized gains from venture investments including FFO per share as adjusted were $33.4 million in the quarter and $62.2 million for the six months ended June. On an annualized basis based upon the first six months of \u201824 that would take realized gains towards the high end of our guidance range for the full year of $95 million to $125 million. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of 2Q \u201824 were $284 million on a cost basis of $1.2 billion. We\u2019ve updated our guidance for 2024 for EPS of $2.98 to $3.10 and we maintained our guidance range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted with no change to midpoint of $9.47 which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share for 2024. With that, let me turn it back to Joel. Yes, I was just going to say, yes, I think what you\u2019re referring to is the lease percentage on the development pipeline. It wasn\u2019t that leases were leased and then weren\u2019t leased. What happened there was we actually added a little bit more square feet into one of the assets at 311 Arsenal. That was a project that has been coming back to us in phases. And so the project just got larger this quarter and as a result the lease percentage went down. So, I don\u2019t know that there was any type of surprise there. Yes. No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s yes, look, if you look at last quarter the pending items that we were looking at, I think that number has come down a little bit. But I think that number came down by a pretty small amount if I recall correctly. So, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything shocking or surprising from our end. I think we\u2019re focused on conserving capital and putting our capital into the active pipeline and focus on dispositions at the moment. Yes. Hi, Michael. Yes, there\u2019s not a magic number there in terms of when it would turn off. There\u2019s continuing activities today on doing work on those floors that remain to be leased and delivered. But yes, if there was a situation where those activities ceased, where the demand just couldn\u2019t catch up with the supply there then we would have to shut down those portions of the project that no longer have activity. So, we\u2019ll continue to watch that very carefully. Yes, sure. Hi, Wes. I was just going to say Tech Square, if you look at the ARR subject to ground lease was far and away the largest ground lease that we have. It was about a third of the ARR subject to ground leases. The balance of that is spread across I think 29 different properties. And then if you think about where the lease terms are kind of on a pro form basis once the amendment or now that the amendment is done. It\u2019s a little bit more of 60 plus years. So, I think we\u2019ve got pretty good term on in terms of the remainder of our ground leases. Yes, I can take that one, Vikram. Yes, so on the Apple one that you mentioned or really in Austin, we\u2019re renewing some of that space. If you look at the lease expirations, some of that\u2019s being negotiated. The balance of that the spaces we\u2019re getting back are warehouse and R&D spaces. So, those are that space we\u2019re marketing, we\u2019ve got folks looking at that. It\u2019s possible that some of those one or two of those buildings gets converted, but we\u2019ll have to stay tuned. When you talk about repositioning, that\u2019s more in the lines of what I think Joel or Peter talked about earlier for the Tech Square 200 where it\u2019s an existing laboratory building, but it\u2019s been single tenant for a while and it\u2019s an opportunity to be able to market that space to multi-tenant. So, that\u2019s in terms of when we talk about repositioning that\u2019s we\u2019re thinking of that is in the bad CapEx bucket. But again, if you look back over a long period of time that the amount of CapEx has been relatively small. Hey, Jim. This is Marc. Yeah, you\u2019re right. There was actually one project that was already leased where the tenant actually came back to us to actually add on additional term. That project has not been finished yet, hasn\u2019t been completed. So, a bit of a conundrum where you put that, but given that that project hasn\u2019t delivered, it\u2019s in the development pipeline. That\u2019s a project in San Diego and we were happy to see that happen because we got an extra term out of it. So, that\u2019s the reason for that. That doesn\u2019t happen very often. That\u2019s right. Yes. Dylan, I think if you\u2019re just looking at renewals as a percentage of expirations, it\u2019s really hard to get the full picture. Case in point, you\u2019ve got as an example, you\u2019ve got Moderna and Tech Square that we talked about right where large space that they will not be renewing, right. But what\u2019s missing is, right, they signed 462,000 square foot lease at a new development. So, it\u2019s difficult just to take the retention rates right off the face of the leasing page. I mean, the way we look at it, when we normalize for those sorts of things, we really haven\u2019t seen a drop off in retention. Sure. Yes. I mean, we talk about the in-place mark-to-market for our entire portfolio being about 12%. We typically don\u2019t break that down kind of market by market. But you\u2019re right, we do have a fair amount of space that\u2019s rolling. The good news is a lot of that\u2019s in Cambridge, which that\u2019s where you\u2019re getting space back. It\u2019s still a place where market rents have done pretty well. But Peter, maybe I\u2019ll let you comment specifically if you want on market rents there."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Peter M. Moglia",
            "content": "Thank you, Hallie. A respected economist recently made the case that pent-up demand from the pandemic has continued to be a key source of inflation which is one of the reasons the raising of short-term rates has been ineffective and that sectors of the economy with pent-up demand will continue powering the economy going forward in 2024 regardless of rates or who wins the election. Healthcare was one of the sectors mentioned. Patients returning to doctors\u2019 offices and hospitals are releasing pent-up demand for therapies and medicines, which should send a strong signal to the industry to grow. We look forward to enabling that growth. I\u2019m going to discuss our development pipeline, leasing, supply and asset sales and then hand it over to Marc. In the second quarter, we delivered 284,982 square feet, 100% leased with 92% of the space contained in mega campuses located in our high barrier to entry submarkets. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the quarter equaled $16 million bringing the year-to date total to $42 million. Development and re-development leasing of approximately 341,000 square feet was more than three times the volume of last quarter led by strong credit tenant leasing. The ability to execute on our development and re-development pipeline when others are clearly struggling is mainly attributed to our strong brand built on operational excellence and the attractiveness of our mega campus platform which houses 69% of our current pipeline. Projects to be delivered in 2024 and 2025 are 87% leased and projects expected to stabilize in 2026 and beyond are 40% leased or under negotiation because of our continuing strong execution during the quarter. Our development and re-development pipeline is expected to deliver very significant incremental NOI of approximately $480 million in the near-to-medium term. $187 million of this NOI is expected to be delivered through the fourth quarter of 2025 and the remaining $293 million will be delivered from the first quarter of \u201826 through the Q1 of \u201828. To execute on this, we will only need to average approximately 61% of the leasing per quarter through the first quarter of \u201828 and we executed this quarter. Transitioning to leasing and supply, the leasing market is in a flight to quality. Failed projects are often in tertiary markets and operated by inexperienced entities with little to no know how or capital to fund tenant improvements. The majority of fully vacant buildings in our markets are recently delivered buildings from these entities who majorly underestimated the skill sets needed to be successful in life science real estate and pick sites as if they were investing in office. High-quality locations in the core areas of innovation and high-quality sponsorship matters. Many of these new entrants are learning that the hard way. Alexandria sets the standard for sponsorship in life science real estate and our consistent occupancy, tenant retentions and strong tenant relationships which accounted for 83% of our leasing during the quarter. Our reflections are reflections of that moat we have created with our high-quality mega campus model residing in AAA locations, our operational excellence and our fortress balance sheet. Although the search rings of the tenant bases have expanded with the delivery of new supply, the strike rings have tightened as quality tenants leery of inexperienced and undercapitalized developers choose the trusted brand. We leased 1,114,001 square feet during the second quarter highlighted by the strong leasing in a development and re-development pipeline, I noted earlier. GAAP and cash rental rate increases were 7.4% and 3.7% respectively. Over 90% of our renewals were either neutral or had a positive mark-to-market. On competitive supply, 2024 is going to be the peak year for new deliveries and then it will begin to dissipate in 2025 to about half of what we will deliver in 2024. We are likely to see little-to-no new deliveries from pretenders after 2025 unless projects currently under construction are delayed. I\u2019ll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. As mentioned on the last call, our value harvesting transactions will be heavily weighted towards the third and fourth quarters but significant progress continues to be made. During the quarter, we closed on the $60 million non-income producing asset in New York and increased our pending transactions subject to letters of intent or purchase and sale agreement negotiations by approximately $549 million to a total of $806.7 million. This combined with our $77.2 million in closed sales and $27 million of forward equity sales agreements expected to be settled in 2024 brings our pending and closed transactions to $884 million approximately 59% of the midpoint of guidance for dispositions, partial interest sales and equity. Interest in our non-core asset sales remains consistent and we believe the anticipated rate cuts and thawing of the financial markets will bring more buyers and have a positive effect on values. The lack of financing available to investors has been the driver of the widely reported lack of capital markets activity in the broad market. Capital flows have a major impact on valuations and commercial real estate debt has trended downward as a percentage of GDP for the last two years prior to the first quarter of \u201824. However, this appears to be reversing as new CMBS issuance for the first half of 2024 is up nearly threefold from the same period last year, which should provide positive momentum for our current and future efforts. With that, I will pass it over to Marc. Yes, I mean -- Yes. Hey, Tony, it\u2019s Peter. Yes, look, the things that we\u2019ll have cap rates published, I think you\u2019ll find to be in line with our commentary of good quality assets are still in demand. I don\u2019t want to spoil any thunder for next quarter, but we do have a couple of things that are going that are pretty good. Noncore assets though can certainly not necessarily be representative of our prime assets that we plan on holding in perpetuity. But GAAP rates are a tough thing to figure out these days what people\u2019s returns, what they are looking for largely depends on their cost of capital which has been varied throughout the last few quarters. But I\u2019m going to go ahead and wait till I think next quarter we\u2019ll have something to publish and you\u2019ll see the numbers. Yes. Hey, Michael, it\u2019s Peter. Great observation. It\u2019s one of the first things that I noticed when I started looking at the numbers and Joel is absolutely spot on. It\u2019s serendipitous. We had just a large portion of the leasing was for early-stage companies. And as Joel mentioned, those companies tend to sign shorter term leases because they expect to be much bigger in the future. And Joel is exactly right. It\u2019s one of the reasons that we adopted a mega campus strategy because we have these types of tenants that will grow within the mega campus. So, but yes, no trend other than just serendipity. Yes, well, Mark mentioned in his comments that although it was higher than maybe the last couple of handful of quarters that TI/LC number was about our average since 2020. These are renewals, so it\u2019s going to -- the numbers will vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the work that needs to be done on the suite. Mark mentioned in his comments the recycling, the durability of our spaces. We don\u2019t have to put a lot of CapEx to continue the lease and to continue to leverage off previous investment. But in certain cases you have a tenant that might need to do some reconfiguration or you might have a lease that\u2019s in a space that\u2019s 15 years old or so, so you got to put more money into it. So, it\u2019s again, it\u2019s not a trend, it\u2019s not a market trend like it would be. We\u2019ve talked about things from shell, the TIs have gone up considerably, because tenants don\u2019t want to invest in the space like they used to have to. But in the case of renewals, it\u2019s just lease-by-lease. What is the space look like? What is the tenant need? But it\u2019s still if you consider the inflation that has happened in construction costs $30 is still not a lot of money to be averaging on renewals. Yes, that\u2019s exactly correct. Of all the markets submarkets, South San Francisco certainly as we\u2019ve highlighted and Peter has talked about that for quite a number of quarters, has one of the most outsized supply issues. Remember too, this is an old building that we inherited in a joint venture. So, the time and effort to get this redeveloped is just what it is. The good news is we have several transactions going on that weren\u2019t alive last quarter. So, I think that\u2019s good news. Marc can comment on the termination of capitalization. Thank you. Yes, I mean, I think about it in a way as long-term holds are going to be mega campuses in the prime core locations and you\u2019ve seen us put up really strong numbers there. And then we\u2019ve got some good assets. We own them because they were good assets, but they are not mega campuses. They are typically not within the core mark, core centres of innovation, but they were areas that supported research for different reasons and might be 100 to 200 basis point spread between something prime and something not so prime. Yes. Look, I think it is a bit of a silver lining but I would say that it would have happened anyway because of our observation that the mega campus model was where we needed to be headed. So, ultimately those assets maybe it would have been at a slower pace, but we would have, been selling those noncore, non-mega campus assets over time anyway. Yes, look, I think Joel mentioned it earlier that our development pipeline may shrink in the future and something that\u2019s non income producing like land is very accretive to sell and to use to fund our current pipeline or in our future in place pipeline. So, of course, we would like to if we for certain in certain areas if we have land that we can market and sell, we will. So, it will certainly be part of our strategy. Well, look it is consistent with the way we\u2019ve characterized demand. By and large across our regions there has been a barbell of early-stage companies being very active and large pharma being very active and not as much in the middle due to a lack or not necessarily a lack of wanting to grow, but lack of confidence to grow. So, we do expect that the middle will fill in over-time especially considering the metrics that Hallie started to or had presented but it\u2019s not a trend it just happened to be we had a number of earlier stage company leases rolling and it just was a coincidence. Yeah. And just maybe a footnote on that. So, Apple is in the process of negotiating a renewal on the majority of the buildings, but they\u2019re giving back two of the buildings, which Marc highlighted. I think the good news is, one is, I think imminently releasable as R&D and the other is warehouse, which we do have a client who\u2019s actually very interested in that. And based on what we\u2019ve seen in the market, there also could be some demand for data centre activity there. So we\u2019re not necessarily we had in our forward model, we had assumed this scenario that we would get back two buildings that weren\u2019t adjacent to their campus where their other buildings are and that they would take those forward and that\u2019s exactly how it played out. We\u2019ve been looking at a lot of data around where face rates are and Boston is and the rest of our large markets are pretty consistent where rents have come off the peaks of 2021, 2022, but they\u2019re still well above the pre pandemic rates. Of course, you still have more concessions today in the form of TIs for the newly built space. But we\u2019re pretty happy considering the supply dynamic that rents are still above the pre pandemic levels."

            "content": "Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody. With me today are Hallie, Peter and Marc, and we welcome you to our second quarter earnings call. And, thank you and congratulations to the Alexandria family team for another very solid second quarter operating and financial performance given the continuing uncertainty of the backdrop as soaring U.S. debt and government spending problems continue pretty much unabated. And, in thinking about our daily efforts, we all think about the Navy SEAL credo, The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday. Also, huge congrats to our team on the June 2024 release of our corporate responsibility report, which reinforces our longstanding operational excellence across our one of a kind Labspace platform and to the team for securing 100% of the electricity needs with renewable energy for 100% of our Alexandria paid accounts in our Greater Boston cluster market, a phenomenal achievement. Thank you, team. And, thinking about long-term strategic thinking since the bull market of the life science industry turned in February of 2021, I would say the market moved from a historical long bull run to a bear market in, as I said, February of 2021 and we\u2019ve worked every single day to re-engineer and fine tune our long-term competitive advantages of this one of a kind leading Labspace platform. Our goal is much like it was, but very different given the facts of course, after the 2008, 2009 great financial crisis and the bear market aftermath to position ourselves to come out of this sector bear market with the acumen and business strategy really to enable our life science industry and tenant growth much as we led the long historical bull market 2014 to 2021 with record breaking earnings growth for our sector. So, in thinking about our competitive advantages, and what we choose to really emphasize. I think most importantly, our first mover advantage in the top life science clusters, we continue to refine and refocus our footprint, and you see that by our actions quarterly. Our high quality assets aggregated in desirable and well-amenitized mega campuses, we continue this monumental effort really driven to and by our re-development and development efforts in each of our massive mega campuses and our attempt to reduce and hopefully successful strategy our non-mega campus pipeline, future pipeline and obviously the sale of most of our non-core assets over time. That\u2019s going to be critical to our go-forward business plan. High quality cash flows and substantial embedded future net operating income will be even more secure, given that platform focus. Our longstanding tenant relationships that demonstrate stellar brand loyalty continue. Lilly is a great example with multiple strategic relationships there. We continue to be backed by our fortress balance sheet with significant liquidity, unique and deep life science expertise which is a hallmark of this company from day one, and we\u2019re very proud of our long tenured and highly experienced management team. And, as I move from kind of our strategic thinking about what we need to do to be at the vanguard of the next bull market for life science, the life science industry, I want to take a reflection on my take of the second quarter and our future planning. It goes without saying that we had a very solid FFO per share growth in this quarter, this past quarter, second quarter of course of 5.3% and 6.3% for the six months this year and especially I think positive given the backdrop. An astounding 74% of our ARR comes from the mega campuses and we hope to push that over 90% in a short handful of years as our major moat, as the major moat of our business. 53% of our ARR is from investment grade or big cap companies, the strong quality of cash flows and the 96% of our leases having contractual rental rate increases gives us great future protection. We\u2019ve maintained stable occupancy with a very solid leasing quarter with solid economics and we continue to have very solid cash same store NOI growth. Our EBITDA margins are best-in-class and we\u2019re also working hard to reduce our go-forward CapEx and G&A. We are anchored by our fortress balance sheet, as I\u2019ve said, with strong liquidity and almost one-third of our debt expires after 2049 with an average term of 13 years. Over the next few months, we are laser focused on leasing the remaining 1 million approximately square foot rolling this year and getting a strong jump on the significant 2025 rollovers. Also over the next few months, we are laser focused on our \u201824 and \u201825 deliveries and continue to increase our leasing on those well beyond the current 87% to drive NOI growth. We\u2019re making significant progress on our recycling of capital for 2024 and beyond. And finally, the life science industry, which Hallie will comment on in-depth here, is the crown jewel and the cherished industry of our country and truly the world\u2019s leader in innovation in the discovery of new medicines. It is virtually the only industry which fundamentally enables better health, well-being and longer and happier lives. We have built this one of a kind company to be at the vanguard of this cherished life science industry as it recovers from the aftermath of the COVID rocket ship. And, without further ado, let me turn it over to Hallie. Thank you, Marc. And operator, we\u2019ll go to questions, please. Well, I think there is no fundamental change. As I think Marc mentioned, Moderna has essentially or is moving out of that space in Tech Square 200 and moving to their new R&D and HQ headquarters at 325 Binney. So, they leave behind laboratory assets in that space or spaces. And our plan is to release those generally as a multi-tenant situation. So, it\u2019s not really any change. We clearly knew for a long period of time that Moderna was leaving and this is just part of their growth and something we\u2019ve done time and time again. Just remember, Alexandria Technology Square sits right across the street from MIT\u2019s main science campus and you\u2019ve got the best location in the world when it comes to laboratory space. Peter, do you want to comment on that? Go ahead, Marc. Well, I think if you look at the percentage of ARR coming from the mega campuses and that\u2019s not you have a series of assets. Remember, this company was built over decades on individual acquisitions and then individual redevelopments and developments. And then the first mega campus that we bought was Tech Square, in fact, in 2006, and that really kind of launched that strategy, followed by Campus Point in 2010, and then the New York campus, which was our first mega development campus. So, I think you just have to think of it in terms these are still really very, very good assets, and we\u2019ve moved in many cases and shed many of our more core assets in the suburbs, and we still have quite a number of standalone assets, not really in the outer suburbs that we\u2019ve transacted over the last handful of years, and I think we\u2019re looking at that. So, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s easy to give you exact percentages, but as I said, our main goal is to move our mega campus annual rental revenue into the high 80s or low 90s over the next short handful of years, Tony, if that\u2019s helpful. Yes. So, I\u2019ll ask Peter to comment from his perspective. But I think if you think about again, you said it, individual leases that come up quarter-to-quarter certainly drive those stats. I think it\u2019s fair to say and Hallie has commented on this on a number of occasions, We\u2019re seeing more demand from the earlier stage companies and the revenue generating companies, it\u2019s the in between the biotechs that are in the clinic waiting for clinical milestone achievement that I think has caused some of the disruption in the normal leasing transactions that have gone on. And I think this quarter there was just more at the earlier stage, and those people can\u2019t commit to 10 or 15 year leases because they\u2019re likely to grow, and that\u2019s the reason to have them on a mega campus because we can provide them 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 whatever they want and we can double and triple their footprint on a mega campus, whereas an individual building, oftentimes, you can\u2019t really do that. Yes, I can take that one. Hi, Rich. Yes, it\u2019s not a perfect analysis, right, because volume can vary from quarter-to-quarter, particularly in that release and renewal bucket, right. That\u2019s only a fraction of the total leasing. So, it\u2019s not a perfect analysis. But yes, I mean, I think you\u2019re right that the first half of the year was very strong. It\u2019s the numbers are actually above the high end of our midpoint. But we feel comfortable with our guidance we\u2019ve got out there, which we still think is very strong in this environment. And that it does imply on average slightly lower numbers than the first half, but I think we\u2019re still very pleased with where we expect to come out for the year. Yeah. Well, I\u2019ll comment and then Peter can. I think the answer is yes in the sense that we feel that the industry has been on a tear for, as I said, the 2014 to 2021 and then the rocketship and then kind of the drop off from that. And it\u2019s pretty clear that in today\u2019s fairly, way more disciplined allocation of capital from the life science industry, more and more, it\u2019s clear to us, it\u2019s been clear for a long time, but even more so today, that the best prospects for leasing and either keeping a tenant or attracting a new tenant is to give them great optionality on a mega campus, great amenities and that\u2019s where we want to refocus or double down our efforts and we\u2019ve gone a long way to bring that to reality. But we think that\u2019s where we want to be out a period of time where we have fewer and fewer noncore assets, because I think they don\u2019t give us the optionality to attract or grow with tenants the way we want to grow, not that the buildings aren\u2019t leasable because some of them are absolutely great buildings and have great tenants. Yes. And we really have done that if you look at Greater Boston. I mean, we didn\u2019t have the money to get into Cambridge or even Waltham in the early days, so we started out in Worcester. And so are the evolution of how we\u2019ve looked at each of the submarkets is we have gone from kind of outer burbs to kind of the inner core, just as the company has grown and now we just want to refine and hone that strategy. And we feel like we started that back as early as 2006 and now we\u2019re doubling down on it. One thing I would point out, I think Marc you absolutely can answer this. But one thing I want to point out is, I think it was a really astute move for us to do that today because this was a situation where we had more leverage today than we would have in better times. So, sometimes you have to make moves even if it\u2019s a tough environment because long-term it\u2019s going to really set you up well. Marc, if you want to answer the other part of the question? Yes, look we didn\u2019t want to bore you all with the same numbers over and over and over again. I would say the only real material change was there was a lot of deliveries in San Francisco this past quarter, but it\u2019s progressing like we thought. We are in the under 5% of total inventory left to deliver in this year and the next year about half of that amount will deliver next year. So, from the amount that is left to deliver in \u201824 is roughly half of what it was at the beginning of the year and so it\u2019s progressing like we thought. It\u2019s the same amount of space. We don\u2019t see a material amount of supply dissipating. We also don\u2019t see a material amount of supply being added. Yes, I can take that one, Michael. Yes, I mean, you\u2019re right. The project at 230 Harriet Tubman was pushed out I think a quarter, that projects 100% leased, same with 840 Winter actually it\u2019s a similar story on both of them that they\u2019re 100% leased in the tenant programming just ends up making the construction a little bit longer. So, that just happens sometimes. Yes. Thank you for the question. And I think it\u2019s a good one. I think you have to remember that we\u2019ve seen the internet bubble crash in 2000 the GFC in 2008, 2009, and then kind of the blow up of the rocket ship of COVID as it kind of came down to earth, and each one is kind of different. I think this time, we don\u2019t have financial institution problems, we don\u2019t have lots of companies that had kind of fake business plans failing, like back in 2000, not so much biotech, but certainly in the dot com bubble era. I think this time, we\u2019ve never seen supply in our particular niche. Supply has always been there, but it\u2019s never been oversupplied in a sense. And so when you combine that oversupply with more muted demand coming off just rocketship demand of 2021, I mean, our leasing quadrupled during some of those quarters and years, which you just know can\u2019t be sustained. I think that\u2019s the overarching issue and the industry and Hallie did a great job of articulating the segments is mission critical. It\u2019s the crown jewel of this country, its critical to the health of our citizen and beyond. And I think that, and the funding factors and diversity is very, very strong. How that translates into is the big question everybody wants answered, but there\u2019s no algorithm to do it. How that translates into a more consistent and robust demand. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re all kind of working through. And every cycle is just different. And so we\u2019re very optimistic about the future. Obviously, we wouldn\u2019t be in this business if we weren\u2019t. But we know that we have to make adjustments to our assets, our capital plan and make sure that we have we\u2019re best positioning the company to help our 800 tenants grow and attract a whole lot more. And we think by selling more of the noncore assets, slimming down the future pipeline a bit and doubling down on the mega campus is the right strategy till the market really turns. And I think whether the election, whether it\u2019s the executive branch or each of the houses, helps reinforce a more robust economic environment. It\u2019s hard to say, as I said in my prepared remarks, debt service and the overall health of that, of the economy, given debt to GDP and so forth. A lot of really smart people have opined on that issue and we want to make sure that if there\u2019s a bigger shock out there to the system, we\u2019re extremely well protected. So sorry for the long answer. Yes, the answer is no. And the mix of the different segments, whether it be product and device, multinational pharma, private biotech, all were actually pretty strong and a mixture of those, public biotech was probably among the lowest. That\u2019s just how it works, given what we\u2019ve said about the barbell, but nothing don\u2019t read anything into if you look at first quarter was extremely strong, this quarter\u2019s more muted, but still pretty solid. And I think it kind of just is kind of down the middle of the fairway as we see it at this juncture. Yes, I\u2019ll ask Hallie to answer, but my kind of the one thing that would make a huge difference would be the true opening of the IPO market, which signals that you\u2019ve got long term investors, crossover investors and even earlier stage investors participating. The IPOs that have happened to date are kind of few and far between and they\u2019ve traded down on an average pretty substantially. So, that\u2019s one thing that would be very recognizable and has been something that has led some of the other bull markets. But Hallie, you could comment more in-depth. Yes. So, Marc, do you have the steps on that? Well, I think it\u2019s way more complicated than that. People in this industry don\u2019t move for a buck a foot difference, that\u2019s just not relevant. And also the sponsorship of who they lease from is critical because there have been a number over the last year of significant failures of others in this industry where labs have been shut down and major damages happen to the science or the people in the laboratories. So, operating with the best of breed in the industry makes a big difference. We don\u2019t see anybody that\u2019s just going to move to a place for some small difference that just doesn\u2019t happen. And if the tenants are decent, our mega campus strategy is aimed at always having inventory to allow these companies to grow and to retain them. So, that\u2019s the big issue. Supply isn\u2019t really the big issue now. Supply does impact leasing in the sense that when somebody is looking at space, they could cite other locations. But if the locations aren\u2019t really dead centre comparable then those comps don\u2019t really make a big difference and people aren\u2019t going to pick up and leave for as I say a few bucks cheaper rent, it just doesn\u2019t happen in this industry. Yes. So, Marc, you could comment on overall mark-to-market and Peter, you could give some observations if you want. Just want to wish everybody a safe and healthy summer and we\u2019ll look forward to talking on our third quarter call. Thank you, everybody."

            "name": "Hallie Kuhn",
            "content": "Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Life Science and Capital Markets. Today, I\u2019m going to review 2Q24 life science industry performance, demand across our strong and diverse tenant base and the incredible innovation that is propelling the growth of the life science sector. As I walk through the details, there are two main points I want to underscore. First, the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry continues to command robust levels of capital from diverse funding sources. And second, the life science that life science innovation is advancing at a historic pace yielding new medicines that extend and save lives. Starting at the beginning of the lifecycle of innovation, biomedical and government institutions which account for 10% of our ARR catalyzed discoveries that fuel deeper understanding of disease biology and early development of new medicines. In addition to the NIH budget of $49 billion in 2024, $57 billion was contributed to biomedical research last year through non-profit organization While institutions maybe the engine for early innovation, private biotech companies which represent another 10% of our ARR are the fuel advancing research discoveries into potential new medicines. Private life science venture funding was robust this quarter exceeding $12 billion. While down from the peak in 2022, this year is on-track to be the third highest year in life science venture dollars ever deployed. Next are pre-commercial public biotech companies representing 9% ARR. Remarkably, follow-on financings and private placements are at historic highs eclipsing $10 billion in the second quarter with 2024 financings already exceeding full-year 2023 levels. This activity is juxtaposed against limited IPO volume and the XBI, which is up moderately for the year, but lags the broader markets. We caution that the XBI is an imperfect barometer for public biotech. The reality is a picture of have and have nots. Biotechs that meet clinical milestones have ample access to liquidity and see positive stock performance, while those that lack meaningful inflection points are faced with a challenging market reality. Next, our commercial stage biopharma and large multinational pharmaceutical companies representing 17% and 20% of ARR respectively. Biopharma continues to commit historic levels of capital to internal R&D and external innovation. 2023 R&D spend neared $300 billion and the industry set records for M&A driven by an estimated $200 billion to $300 billion dollars of revenue at risk in the next five years due to patent expirations. In 2022, this pace has continued with over $60 billion in M&A announced. On the ground, leasing from this cohort is driven by the need to recruit and retain scientific talent critical to developing new medicines essential to meeting near and long term growth targets. This is illustrated by the 127,000 square foot lease we announced this quarter with a large multinational pharmaceutical company on our SD Tech by Alexandria mega campus in San Diego. Spanning the entire lifecycle of innovation is the life science product, service and device tenant segment, which represents 21% ARR. Relevant to this segment is the BioSecure Act, which if passed will limit utilization of select Chinese contract manufacturing and research organizations. We view this legislation as largely positive. It includes grandfathering provisions to minimize near-term impact to biotech companies, while creating an incentive for U.S. based contract manufacturing and research organizations to onshore capabilities. The output of the entire innovation cycle are novel medicines that make it into the hands of patients. Through June, the FDA approved 21 novel small molecule and biologic therapies and separately approved 5 novel gene and cell therapies. Of approximately 500 novel FDA therapies approved since 2013, 50% were developed by Alexandria tenant. Highlighting one recent approval, this month the FDA approved Alexandria Tenant Eli Lilly\u2019s novel antibody for treatment of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As many listening today have experienced firsthand, Alzheimer\u2019s is devastating affecting one out of every nine individuals over 65 in the U.S. While recently approved Alzheimer\u2019s medicines can slow disease, they are still not a cure and there remains much work to be done. In the same way that 10 years ago obesity was considered too complex to treat with medicines and now has been transformed by GLP-1 therapies developed by Alexandria tenant, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, 10 years in the future we may have medicines that completely alter the paradigm of diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, rendering them treatable or even preventable conditions. Coming full circle, the life science industry continues to demonstrate sustained strength, energized by this incredible pace of innovation and reinforced by diverse sources of funding. As the trusted partner to the world\u2019s leading life science companies that expand the entire lifecycle of innovation, our mission remains steadfast to create and grow life science ecosystems and clusters that ignite and accelerate the world\u2019s leading innovators in their noble pursuit to advance human health and cure disease. With that, I will pass it over to, Peter. Hi, this is Hallie. I was just going to reiterate that certainly we see funding being strong across multiple data points. Venture certainly looks great this year, follow on financings have been very strong, and we continue to see demand across the diversity of our tenant portfolio, if you look at our tenant pie chart broken out by ARR. So, while certainly demand may look different from quarter-to-quarter from any given segment, I don\u2019t think there is one specific trend that is driving demand from only one of these tenant segments. That\u2019s the beauty of the life science industry is the diversity of the types of companies we have in our portfolio. Yes. I would say taking a step back, generally those requirements, particularly from the public biotechnology tenants, are very milestone based, and that is irrespective of the macro environment, whether or not a clinical trial has positive or negative data, it doesn\u2019t matter what the interest rates are. So, I would say historically, as we look at those types of requirements, it\u2019s just really dependent on companies hitting those inflection points. And we certainly have some of those types of requirements in the pipeline as data comes to fruition. And there\u2019s been some other examples of well, backside is a good example in our St. Carlos campus. They\u2019ve continued to expand off positive data. So, I would kind of shift the focus more towards as these companies continue to show that they have value in their pipelines that is really where the demand is driven from."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nPaula Schwartz: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\nJoel Marcus: Thanks, Paul, and welcome, everybody to Alexandria's first quarter '24. With me today are Hallie, Peter and Marc. First of all, a thank you and congratulations to our ARE's family team for a very solid first quarter against a continuing tough macro with stubbornly high interest rates and continuing non-transitory inflation instigated by the federal governments really uncontrolled spending. In fact, our annual debt service now is greater than our defense budget crazy. Also huge congratulations to the entire team as Alexander has once again been named one of the most trustworthy companies in America by Newsweek, and nominated as such by our 3 constituencies, our customers, our investors and our employees. Guided by Alexandria's core values of integrity, mutual respect, egoless leadership, humility, transparency, teamwork and trust, we have established ourselves at the Vanguard in the heart of the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry. We're very honored that Newsweek has again recognized us with this important award, which is a testament to company's values and to the trust that our tenants, investors and employees have in our one of a kind brand. And as we said before, as Jim Collins has said, Alexandria has achieved the 3 outputs that define a great company, superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. We remain unwavering in our efforts to build upon these outputs and to continue to maintain our stellar reputation and the most trusted brand for life science real estate providing essential infrastructure enabling the development of new safe and effective medicines. Remember over 90% of diseases have yet to have addressable therapies or cures. Remember 2, the top causes of death in the United States remain cancer, heart disease and the third fentanyl and methamphetamine and that is a profoundly sad statement of fact. So my quick take on the first quarter, Alexandria is a one of a kind company with a great brand as I said, scale, dominance and our unique cluster strategy together with the fortress balance sheet. We've posted 7.6% year-over-year NOI growth which is I think very solid in this environment, 7.3% year-over-year FFO growth, 5% dividend growth and our collections 99.9%. We had a strong leasing quarter with solid leasing spreads and we continue strong occupancy despite recently acquired vacancy. We also posted very solid same store growth and also very solid guidance. We are particularly laser focused on leasing for the 2025 pipeline as well as redevelopment space to be delivered in 2025 and of course the leasing of vacant space in 2025, which is the fastest space to deliver to our growing tenants. And much like we did during the great financial crisis, we're pushing forward our pipeline because of the need for Alexandria's Labspace coupled with solid indicators of positive rebound for life sciences in 2024 which Hallie will address. Lease expirations for 2024 and 2025 on a combined basis are down as well as unresolved expirations for both 2024 and 2025 on a combined basis being down as well. Peter will talk about capital recycling, but for the quarter so far, we've had approximately $275 million of noncore assets sold or pending and we're about so that means we're about 20% through our targeted $1.4 billion of recycling of capital for our business for 2024, and we feel very comfortable where we are today. And then finally before I turn it over to Hallie, I mentioned in our last earnings call our decision to sell 219 East 42nd Street, New York City, the former Pfizer headquarters building ultimately for residential use. A very good decision reinforced by the continuing. My own view and competence of the State of New York and the City of New York in continuing to incentivize and foster empty one-off buildings for so called life science use while turning their backs on fundraising of startup companies, which is the heart and soul of the New York City life science ecosystem and which is so badly needed. There has been of all the regions no lab leasing in New York City in the first quarter whatsoever and yet the state and the city are proposing fostering more and encouraging more people to deliver space. We sit in a very good position with our campus, but nonetheless when you have local and state governments who are not mindful of using funding better spent on funding startups and also the health, welfare and safety of the citizens, that's very disconcerting. So with that I'm going to turn it over to Hallie for a number of important comments. Hallie?\nHallie Kuhn : Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Life Science and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to review the fundamentals of the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry, what these fundamentals mean for the health of our diverse life science base, and how our tenant science dictates the need for Alexandria's Labspace infrastructure. In 2008, on the heels of the great financial crisis, the size of the public biopharma industry was around $2.5 trillion and approximately $11 billion in venture capital was invested in private life science companies. There was no cure for hepatitis C, obesity was considered too complex to ever treat with an effective therapy and gene and cell therapies were a hope not a reality. Today, the industry is valued at over $5 trillion venture capital is on pace to reach 4x the levels deployed in 2008. 600 additional novel therapies have been approved by the FDA and countless lives have been improved, extended and saved. Coming out of this bear cycle, albeit with stops and starts along the way, the life science industry is in a profoundly different place compared to previous cycles with a fundamentally strong framework to accelerate long-term growth of the industry and demand for Alexandria Labspace. With the long-term perspective as a backdrop, let's step through first quarter trends in the life science industry. First, with respect to life science venture investment, nearly $11 billion of deployed capital was announced in the first quarter and $100 million plus mega rounds accounted for 34 deals, the highest number in the last 8 quarters and any quarter prior to 2021. These trends bode well for demand from new and existing private biotechnology tenants, which account for 10% of our ARR. Moving on to our pre-commercial and commercial public biotech tenants, which represent 9% and 16% of our ARR respectively. Follow-on and PIPE financings achieved one of the highest quarters on record, totaling $15.5 billion of which one in every $4 was raised by an Alexandria tenant. This past week, long time Alexandria Tenant Intracellular Therapies announced clinical data for their first-in-class therapy lumateperone, for treatment of depression and went on to raise $500 million. The story here is that demand is milestone based and for companies that achieve their target milestones, typically clinical data, they have access to meaningful capital to accelerate their science and expand. Third, are our multinational our multinational pharmaceutical companies, which represent 20% ARR. M&A is a key headline for this segment. 2023 was a record for acquisitions and first quarter continued at a strong pace, eclipsing $40 billion in announced deals. This activity reflects large pharma strong balance sheets and pressure to expand their pipelines with innovative therapies to counter the over $200 billion in revenue at risk from patent expirations through 2030. M&A is a robust sign of the health of the industry and as capital is recycled back to investors and entrepreneurs, it will be redeployed into the next generation of life science companies. Last our life science products, service and device tenants, which represent 21% ARR. A trend we are watching closely is pressure from Congress to limit utilization of Chinese CDMOs under the proposed BIOSECURE Act. Whether or not the legislation passes, this is positive for our U.S. based CDMO tenants, which analysts expect to see a substantial increase in demand and will help ensure we maintain our national competitive edge in such a critical industry. Switching gears, let's put on our lab coats and examine how our tenants research dictates their lab requirements. Illustrating with a real world example, consider a private biotech Company developing precision oncology medicines that is expanding into 20,000 square feet. Working directly with Alexandria's in-house lab operations team, they placed 328 pieces of equipment in the lab ranging from bench top centrifuges to freezers, cryo tanks, DNA sequencers and advanced microscopes. 10 pieces of equipment, including negative 80 degree freezers, require emergency power as it is critical this equipment operates 24x7 to ensure hundreds of thousands of dollars of experimental samples are safeguarded. Now where this equipment is placed is not based simply on the square footage required, but the process flow of their experiments. A single cell biologist utilizes equipment spanning multiple benches, chemical fume hoods, tissue culture suites and microscopy rooms. Beyond that, she moves back and forth through the lab and adjacent non-technical space, conference rooms and communal kitchen throughout the day. Labspace cannot be equated to traditional office steps dictated solely by the number of workers, but is more tend to a data center where the space needs are driven by the physical equipment. While highly trained scientific talent is required to oversee the science, it's the scientific workflow and instrumentation used that dictates the lab footprint. On a related topic, given the immense volume and complexity a data require to inform AI algorithm. Many AI centric tenants have heavy equipment needs that require significant laboratory footprint. A great example is South San Francisco based tenant, insitro with whom we announced a significant early extension this quarter. AI is an amazing tool, but the laboratory is still the workbench. So circling back to where we began, in the past 15 years the Life Science industry has doubled in size, along the way improving countless lives. Projecting 15 years into the future, the growth trajectory of this industry is massive as companies work to cure diseases such as Alzheimer's, autoimmune disease, and the nearly 7,000 rare diseases that affect 1 in 10 Americans. As a trusted partner to the world's leading life science companies, our job is to safeguard our tenants' mission critical research and support and catalyze discoveries that will shape the future of medicine. With that, I will pass it to Peter.\nPeter Moglia : Thanks, Hallie. I know myself, family and friends benefited from innovation that has occurred since 2008. So appreciate the context you just gave us. I'm going to go ahead and discuss our development pipeline leasing supply and asset sales, and then I'll hand it over to Marc. In the first quarter, we delivered 343,445 square feet into our high barrier to entry submarkets covering 5 projects. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the quarter aggregated to $26 million. Development and redevelopment leasing during the quarter was approximately 100,000 square feet. In addition to the executed leases, we signed 162,000 square feet of LOIs during the quarter which will see future development and redevelopment pipeline leasing. Base leased or under negotiation in our current and near-term projects under construction increased by 3% over last quarter to 63% and projects delivering in 2024 and 2025 are 80% leased. From the second quarter of 2024 through the end of 2027, we expect to deliver approximately $480 million of stabilized NOI from the current pipeline. Transitioning to leasing and supply, as we noted last quarter, the bottom of demand was reached during the first half of 2023 and it continues to incrementally recover in our core markets. We expect that the lack of funding activity in early 2023 will continue to be an overhang to full recovery for a quarter or two, but we have strong conviction that a recovery will be achieved in the near-term given the key fundamentals Hallie outlined. Alexandria is well-positioned to weather these storms given the moat enduring competitive advantages we continue to widen and build. We leased 1,142,857 square feet during the first quarter, consistent with our pre-pandemic velocity. GAAP and cash rental rate increases were extraordinarily strong at 33% and 19% respectively and the related tenant improvements and leasing commissions trended down 16% compared to our 2023 leasing costs. Our teams continue to closely track competitive supply building by building in our proprietary databases. As noted in last quarter's call, we expect 2024 to be the peak year for new deliveries and then begin to dissipate in 2025. In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 decreased significantly from 7% of market inventory in the fourth quarter to 1.6% due to 3.3 million square feet of competitive projects delivering in the first quarter. Approximately 1.17 million square feet of those projects were moved from an estimated 2023 delivery to a 2024 delivery last quarter. The unreleased delivered space is reflected in the direct vacancy numbers I'm going to present. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply in Greater Boston will increase market inventory by another 2% which is an expected slowdown from the 2024 levels. In San Francisco Bay, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 9.6% of market inventory which is a 1.1% decrease driven mostly by reclassifying a 0.5 million square foot project from a 2024 to 2025 delivery due to a temporary delay in construction. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply in San Francisco will increase market inventory by 3.7%, a 1.5% increase over last quarter due to that reclassification. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 5.1% of market inventory, a 1.6% decrease from last quarter due to moving 2 projects from an estimated 24 delivery to 2025. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by another 3.8%, a 1.1% increase due to that reclassification, but offset somewhat due to first quarter leasing at those projects. To update you on direct and sublease vacancy, direct vacancy in Greater Boston is up 593 basis points to 12.98% due to the previously mentioned 1Q '24 deliveries. It has climbed more moderately in San Francisco up 175 basis points to 14.11% propelled by 147,000 square foot spec delivery in San Carlos. In San Diego, direct vacancy increased by 244 basis points to 10.41% driven primarily by the inclusion of space not vacant today, but now known will be vacant soon. Sublease vacancy decreased in Greater Boston by about 3 quarters of a percent to 5.17% increased in San Francisco Bay by 0.5% to 6.28% and increased by a third of a percent in San Diego to 5.7%. Again, 2024 is the peak year of disruption from supply. Alexandria is studying 94.6% occupancy is another data point supporting the effectiveness of our wide moat and enduring competitive advantages. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. After a busy quarter four 2023 schedule where we closed on $439 million in asset sales marketed and negotiated throughout the year, we spent the first quarter priming our disposition and partial interest sales pipeline for what will likely be a closing schedule heavily weighted towards the third and four quarters. Early progress is reflected in pending transactions subject to letters of intent or purchase and sale agreement negotiations of $258.1 million and there are a number of other ongoing active sales efforts. Buyers of noncore assets are generally private equity, family office, local operators and institutionally backed real estate partnerships looking to diversify their asset mix with life science real estate. During the quarter, we closed on assets totaling $17.2 million inclusive of 99 A Street in the Seaport, which executive management deemed to no longer be strategic due to its one off profile and our pivot to 285, 299, 307, 347 Dorchester Avenue acquired during the quarter, which is nearby with similar red line access, but has the scale to be a future mega campus. We remain committed to our self-funding strategy and our offerings remain attractive to investors looking for exposure to life science real estate given the promising outlook for the industry how we presented despite near-term supply challenges. With that, I'll pass it over to Marc.\nMarc Binda : Thank you, Peter. This is Marc Binda, CFO. Hello, and good afternoon, everyone. We reported very strong operating and financial results for the first quarter and our team is off to a great start to 2024. Total revenues and NOI for 1Q 2024 was up 9.7% and 11.5% respectively over 1Q '23, primarily driven by solid same property performance and continued execution of our development and redevelopment strategy. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the quarter was $2.35 up 7.3% over 1Q '23 and was ahead of consensus. We also reiterated the midpoint of our full year 2024 guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $9.47 which is up 5.6% over 2023. Our solid operating results for the quarter were driven by our disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy, tremendous scale and our differentiated business. Our tenants continue to appreciate our brand, collaborative mega campuses and operational excellence by our team. 74% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses. We have high quality cash flows from 52% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade or publicly traded large cap tenants. Collections remain very high at 99.9% and adjusted EBITDA margins were very strong at 72%. Leasing volume in the first quarter was strong at 1.1 million square feet for the quarter, which is up 30% over the average of the last two quarters and consistent with our historical quarterly average period from 2013 to 2020. We continue to benefit from our tremendous scale, high quality tenant roster and brand loyalty with 77% of our leasing activity over the last 12 months coming from existing deep tenant relationships. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing space in 1Q '24 was strong at 33% and 19% on a cash basis. Our outlook for rental rate growth for the full year 2024 remains solid at 11% to 19% and 5% to 13% on a cash basis. And reflects our view that given the relatively small amount included the renewals of releasing from any particular quarter compared to the full year and the mix of lease expirations in any particular quarter, we do expect some variation in rental rate growth from quarter to quarter. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates for our entire portfolio remains very solid at 14%, which is unchanged from the prior quarter, which is impressive given the strong realized rental rate growth experienced in the first quarter. Our nonrevenue enhancing expenditures, including TIs on second generation space, have averaged 15% of net operating income over the last 5 years and are expected to be below that in the 12% to 13% range in 2024, which really highlights the durable nature of our laboratory infrastructure. Same property NOI growth for 1Q 2024 was solid at 1% and 4.2% on a cash basis, driven by strong rental rate growth and leasing volume. Our outlook for full year same property growth was unchanged since our last update at 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the midpoint. Occupancy for the quarter was solid at 94.6%, which is consistent with the prior quarter. And during the quarter, we continued to execute on our development and redevelopment strategy by delivering 343,445 square feet from the pipeline, which will generate $26 million of incremental annual net operating income. We also expect to see significant future growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $101 million from executed leases as the initial free rent from recent deliveries burns off over the next 7 months on a weighted average basis. As a reminder, this contractual increase in cash flows will have a significant positive impact on NAV as these projects were previously delivered and no longer sit in CIP at the end of 1Q '24. As Peter highlighted, we have $5.5 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are projected to generate $480 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next 4 years, including 2.1 million square feet delivering through 2025 that are 81% leased negotiating and are expected to generate $229 million of additional net operating income. With projects committed and/or under construction and expected to generate significant NOI over the next few years, coupled with our future pipeline projects in preconstruction, we have the ability to grow our already large operating base of 42 million square feet by 78% over time. With significant construction activities as well as important pre construction activities adding value and focused on reducing the time from lease execution to delivery, we're required to capitalize a significant portion of our gross interest cost. Last year, we saw a peak in capitalized interest in the quarter preceding our record deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2023, which generated $265 million of incremental annual net operating income. These record deliveries have driven a decline in the average real estate basis subject to capitalization of $1.3 billion or 14% from all of 2023 on average to 1Q '24. Capitalized interest as a percentage of gross interest has similarly declined from 83% for the entire year of 2023 to 67% for 1Q '24. In addition, capitalized interest has had an overall decline for 2 consecutive quarters coming off the peak of 3Q '22. Our outlook for capitalized interest for 2024 is consistent with our previous guidance and continues to assume a double-digit decline in average basis subject to capitalization for the full year ended 2024 compared to 2023. Transitioning to the balance sheet, we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets amongst all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our corporate credit ratings rank in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our leverage continues to remain low at 5.2 times for net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly annualized basis. We have tremendous liquidity of $6 billion fixed rate debt comprising 98.9% of our total debt and a weighted average remaining debt term of 13.4 years. In addition, nearly a third of our total debt has at least 25 years remaining to maturity with a very advantageous blended rate of 3.86%. We remain disciplined with our strategy for long-term funding of our business with a focus on maximizing bottom-line growth, maintaining our fortress balance sheet and recycling capital from dispositions and partial interest sales to minimize the issuance of common stock. We're very pleased with the execution of our bond deal, which we completed during the quarter aggregating $1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.48% and a weighted average maturity of 23.1 years. Similar to the self-funding strategy that we executed in 2023, we expect to recycle capital into our highly leased development and redevelopment pipeline through outright dispositions and partial interest sales primarily focused on assets not integral to our mega campus strategy allowing us to enhance the quality of our asset base. As Peter mentioned, we completed $17 million dispositions during the quarter. We have $258 million of pending transactions at various levels of negotiation and we have a significant amount of additional target dispositions and partial interest sales that we're working on beyond that. Based on our current outlook, we expect our asset recycling program to be more heavily weighted towards outright dispositions of noncore assets rather than partial interest sales. I'll turn to the dividends. We also expect to continue to fund a meaningful amount of our equity needs with retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends of $450 million at the midpoint for 2024 or an estimated $2.1 billion for the 5-year period through 2024. And our high quality cash flows continue to support the growth in our annual common stock dividends with an average annual increase in dividends per share of 5% since 2020 and we continue to have a very conservative FFO payout ratio of 54% in the first quarter. Realized gains from the venture investments included in FFO per share as adjusted for the quarter were $28.8 million relatively consistent with our historical average of $24 million per quarter going back to 2021. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investment portfolio as of 1Q '24 were $320 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. We have updated our guidance as I mentioned for '24 for EPS of $3.60 to $3.72 and we tightened the range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted to $9.41 to $9.53 with no change to the midpoint of $9.47 which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share for 2024. With that, let me turn it back to Joel.\nJoel Marcus : So operator, let's go to Q&A kindly.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJosh Dennerlein: Peter, just wanted to follow-up on your question or your comments on asset recycling. Could you just kind of provide more color on it sounds like you're pausing or relooking at what you're selling, so maybe there's a little bit slowing activity near-term? I guess just what's driving that and how is the potential pool changing?\nPeter Moglia: Yes, I think you misinterpreted my comments. There's no pause. I was just trying to point out that, we tend to close a lot of our sales in the latter half of the year like we did last year. And because we spend a lot of time in the first quarter teeing up things after a busy fourth quarter. So, yes, no pause, activity remains brisk.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. Because I think if I'm not mistaken it looks like what you had pending versus 4Q or under like letter of intent versus like today, it looks like it fell a bit. Is that just is there anything fallout?\nPeter Moglia: It's about 20% of our goal which again given how we're heavily weighted towards 3Q and 4Q I think is on target.\nJosh Dennerlein : Then Marc just wanted to follow-up on your comment on leasing spreads in 1Q and just it sounds like there's a slowing for the rest of the year on rental rate increases. Just kind of curious how we should think about the cadence through the rest of the year?\nMarc Binda: Yes. I mean, it really depends market by market, lease by lease that we renew in each particular quarter. So there can definitely be some variation to quarter-to-quarter. Q1 was very strong. We're really pleased with that. And I think the year is strong. We still feel good about the guidance we gave for both GAAP and cash rental rate increases for the year.\nOperator: The next question will come from Michael Griffin with Citi.\nMichael Griffin: Peter, I want to go back to your comments just around the competitive supply set. You've noted that a number of properties I think have been pushed out a couple of years in the development pipeline. I guess what gives you confidence that we're nearing the peak of this supply picture and we're not sitting here a year from now and seeing a lot of those projects get the can kicked down the road and spy picture is still pretty challenged?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, so this is Joel. I'll let Peter answer that. But I think the words you used are pretty inaccurate. One project in San Diego was moved to the following year, not kicked down several years of the can because there is a very substantial credit tenant lease they're working on that makes it more complex to deliver the space as we originally intended. So I think your thinking is not like the federal government not getting a budget and just kicking it down that's not what's going on here. Peter?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. I think Michael was also referring just to the general market data that I was talking about. There were probably I think 3 to 4 projects within the 3 markets that I comment on that got moved and that is something fairly normal because of course, what Joel mentioned was one of our own projects that got moved, but we're tracking all projects that we believe is are competitive. And as the data comes in from the brokerage community and from our own observations at times something that was supposed to or we thought would deliver in 1 year gets kicked quarter or 2 and puts it into the next year. So that's just the nature of data. But yes, we do, we are fairly confident that we're not going to see too much more after 2025 frankly because we're not seeing anything else start right now or limited I think maybe one project started in San Diego in the third quarter of 2023, but nothing of material that's material that we've noticed has started since then. So that would put us in a pretty good position after '25 to get to a very normalized delivery run.\nMichael Griffin: That makes sense and appreciate the clarification there, Joel. And then just on the leasing environment, specifically as it pertains to the development pipeline. Would you have to give up more in concessions in order for tenants to sign leases or would you rather leave some vacancy in those developments with a go at or after stabilization in order to potentially get better rents if the environment improves?\nJoel Marcus: Yes, it doesn't quite work that way. That's kind of how it works in the rest of real estate. But as Hallie said, demand in this sector as you can see over many years is event driven. So it's not so much a rental rate or a concession per se. It's the key location for recruitment of talent, the ability to grow or need space immediately based on a major clinical milestone that's either made financing possible or just scale up possible. So those are the things that tend to be the most important, which is space for delivery. And the market will be the market, but that's not the concessions or things like that are not driving people's decisions. It doesn't work that way.\nOperator: The next question will come from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho.\nVikram Malhotra: I guess just you sort of painted a picture where things are on track, spreads better etcetera. So I guess, Marc, I'm just wondering why adjust the guide, the FFO guide early on especially the top end of the guide given what you just outlined as likely a good start?\nMarc Binda: Yes, I mean, I think we're on track. It's not unusual for us as we get out as we kind of get through the year to shrink the range as we get more and more comfortable. So we shrunk the top end and the bottom end with no change to the midpoint of our guidance. So I think we still feel good about very solid growth this year of 5.6% over 2023.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. And that's been pretty consistent as Vikram, how we've done it year-by-year, year-over-year.\nVikram Malhotra: Okay, fair enough.\nJoel Marcus: And remember, this is one of those years where you've got macro at home, you've got geopolitical issues and then you've got an election. So we wanted to be conservative about what we're doing here.\nVikram Malhotra: Makes sense. I think there were a bunch of shorter term renewals or I guess extensions into '25, because we did see the '25 overall move up. And I'm just wondering like what sort of what was the nature of those discussions? Is it kind of tenants are uncertain about space needs or what drove those relatively higher volume of short-term renewals?\nJoel Marcus: Well, short-term renewals often happen. Remember what I just said to Michael, in this industry people are waiting for data that Hallie said and if you've got a clinical trial data or some important catalyst that's going to drive the business hopefully positively, but could be negatively. And that's coming up. You want to ensure that you're kind of preserving your strategic optionality as much as possible and that's why people want to kind of keep where they are until they know what do we need and where are we going. So that's very typical of this industry over many years.\nVikram Malhotra: And just one more I can just slip in. I think there was a comment about '24 being sort of the bottom or at least your trajectory seems to be in recovery from here on into '25. I'm wondering if you can just elaborate on that. Is it demand? Is it what parameters or factors are you seeing that give you confidence in this demand recovery into 2025?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So, Hallie, do you want to maybe just comment again?\nHallie Kuhn: As I walked through in the data across our different segments, just remember that we have a very diverse set of different tenant demands ranging from small private biotechs, public biotechs, large pharma institutions, life science tools product devices. So each of those you have to look at differently. But across each one of those, we are seeing strength. And again, we are coming down off 2021, but still quite strong compared to any year previously. So, venture capital continues to be at a very robust pace. Mega rounds, which are a great indicator of what will be near-term demand drivers, oftentimes just in time space, have really picked up with 34, just this quarter. On the public biotech side, follow on financing, very strong historic quarter, but also IPOs, the window is opening slightly. We'll see how that trend continues over the rest of the year. And then pharma demand, we continue to see a number of very large requirements across our regions, very much driven by the need to be able to recruit the best talent and ensure that they can innovate for years to come. So I think across each of our segments, we're seeing continued strength in the backdrop of, of course some challenging macro markets.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Rich Anderson with Wedbush.\nRich Anderson: Peter, what's the tail of supply? And by that I mean, okay, let's say we peak in deliveries this year, but there's that doesn't just shut off the light switch and you're off to the races or shut up turn on the light switch. There's a period of time where there's free rent to burn from your competition and that impacts your ability to operate nearby facilities perhaps. I'm wondering is it a year lag where you could really start to see cash flow rolling again for Alexandria or is it shorter or is it longer? I'm just curious, yes, maybe we're getting to a point where we're peaking on deliveries, but then when do we start peaking or get back up and running on a cash flow basis for the company?\nPeter Moglia: Yes, I mean, it's a great question, Rich. It's a crystal ball question, but I mean the way I think about it.\nRich Anderson : You got a crystal ball.\nPeter Moglia: The way I think about it is, I look at what Hallie is talking about with demand and to kind of add on to what her last comments were, we saw a decrease relative decrease in funding during 2023 and there's a lag effect for that to take place and that's one of the reasons why we think 2024 is going to be the kind of the bottom to use the crystal ball and it's going to accelerate from here because of all the investment that Hallie pointed out that's going on today is going to create demand. So the tail of the supply is going to be a direct correlation to how much demand there is to take it up and we think that that demand is going to be strong therefore the tail won't be that long. But we'll see, as I said, we're going to see some significant additions to the market in 2024 and then roughly half of what we're seeing in 2024 and 2025 and then virtually hopefully 0 to very little in 2026 probably just things that get delayed in 2025 bleed into '26. But we'll be, that'll be coming into a market that is strengthening as more demand appears because of the funding.\nRich Anderson: Yes, fair enough. And then as it relates to you guys using that those observations that you just made, would we expect you to continue on your kind of existing pace of development starts funded primarily through dispositions? Or do you feel the need to maybe slow it down a little bit on the view that disposition funding is not a forever strategy? Assuming the stock stays where it is, hopefully not, but let's say everything I'll hold everything else constant or starts down next year up to meet the demand. What do you think from Alexandria's lens?\nJoel Marcus : Yes. So maybe, Rich, let me just say this. I think you've seen us kind of like we did in the great financial crisis once the rocket ship of COVID started to come back to earth rather rapidly, February of '21 is when it started. Certainly over the last couple of years and certainly into this year, we've been I think profoundly disciplined in thinking about, we've certainly stopped a number of projects. We've restarted 1 or 2 here or there based on leasing volume, but we've been very, very disciplined about what we would start. So there is not a volume throughput or some kind of a need to do that. We have right now, as you know, a pretty decent pipeline that's relatively well leased and our goal is to meet the needs of growing tenants and that's what really dictates our decision to start projects or convert space or try to move people into vacant space that's available and quickly operational. So those are the things that we're really focused on and it's really judged by demand and then against the backdrop of cost of capital and yield and things like that which Peter has given pretty over many quarters pretty great detail on.\nOperator: The next question will come from Wes Golladay with Baird.\nWes Golladay: Hey everyone. Looks like the first quarter is off to a good start with same store NOI growth. I believe the expectation was for the growth to be back half weighted. Is that still the case?\nMarc Binda: Yes. Hi, Wes. This is Marc. Yes, I think last quarter, we did believe that the second half of the year would have some acceleration. I think our view is that the second half will be strong to in line with guidance right now. And I think to be fair, I think the first quarter came in pretty strong. So I think second half, we expect to be strong.\nWes Golladay: Okay. And then you mentioned potential demand drivers, CDMO, AI, is this going to move the needle this year, is it more of a \u201825, \u201826, \u201827 type driver?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Hallie, you could kind of comment on that. I think that's ongoing frankly, but.\nHallie Kuhn: Sure. Yes. I think these are really popular topics, right? We don't go more than half an hour without getting a question on AI and the BIOSECURE Act and certainly on the regulatory front has been front and center. Yes, I think these are pieces of a kind of large pool of different types of demand that we see across our spectrum of tenants. But certainly, we have a number of tenants insitro we mentioned, and a number of others in our portfolio that do have significant lab requirements given the large data generation. And then for CDMOs and how that relates to demand going forward, these things happen in the order of years, not months. But certainly, I think it's a positive trend for the industry overall with respect to ensuring that this industry remains certainly what we would consider a national, really important for our national security for development of drugs. So two things that we're watching closely, but I wouldn't say are going to be the things that are pushing the industry overall, just two pieces of it.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Tom Catherwood with BTIG.\nTom Catherwood: Peter, maybe moving over to leasing activity this quarter, costs were down pretty materially, yet obviously the unleased new supply continues to deliver as you detailed. How is this new supply competing with the expiring leases in your operating portfolio?\nPeter Moglia: I don't think it's competing very well at all. And that's illustrated by our occupancy and the cash and GAAP rent spreads that we reported today. I mean, we've been saying for a long time that our brand and platform of mega campuses means a lot to our tenants and I think it's just proving out. Remember a lot of the supply is one off in tertiary markets and it's the type of profile that things get super tight in areas like Cambridge or Torrey Pines or South Lake Union, in Seattle, they might catch a bid just like tertiary markets and office would when there'd be spikes in office demand. But for now nothing is really moving outside handful of leases here and there outside of what we're doing. Because as we say all the time, if Alexandria has space available that fits what the tenants need are 90%+ of time, they're going to come to us because we know what we're doing. We can scale them. We have operational excellence, and I say this all the time, no one's going to get fired, for picking an Alexandria building. You might get fired for picking a building from someone who has no idea what they're doing.\nTom Catherwood: Actually that kind of feeds into the next question which is and this is probably another crystal ball question here, but if we take a step back and think more broadly on the unleased competitive supply and your comments on secondary markets and secondary operators. How do you think distress could play out in the life science real estate market, if at all and does that present a potential opportunity for Alexandria?\nPeter Moglia : Yes, it's a great question. We get asked, my first reaction is always well, gosh, if we weren't there by now, it wasn't a priority. I believe they'll probably be some opportunities that we will look at in the future. If we put our brand on the building and people know we're operating it even if it's in a newer market, it can be successful. A great illustration of that is what we did in the Fenway. We came in there, it was an unproven market. The 201 Brookline asset that we bought was about 17% leased. We come in, put our brand on it, put our knowhow into it and within I think 3 quarters it was fully stabilized. That said that was a submarket that we knew was going to be had a lot of the fundamentals that make a good submarkets. Some of these areas that the supply is in today, I don't see the same profile. So probably a tougher decision down the road. But what happens to those buildings, I think a lot of them will become office buildings. Frankly, offices certainly not dead, probably office that was built in the \u201860s and \u201870s and even the \u201880s might have to go away because it's functional obsolete. But if you built a new lab building and you couldn't lease it as lab, it's probably going to be a pretty good office building. But again crystal ball, that's just my opinion.\nOperator: The next question will come from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone: I guess first question is your development yields seem to have been around 7% for a number of years at this point. And Joel, you mentioned interest rates being stubbornly high. But if this is the rate environment on a go forward basis. Is that 7% is that an appropriate level for you all to continue with the program or and maybe you've just been over earning on spread in prior years or does that number have to go up? Like how do you think about that?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So, Peter, thoughts?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. Look, Tony, I think you really have to look Joel laid out what creates opportunities that we may capitalize on, but we are going to be looking obviously at cost of capital. We can't make decisions though on what we think or what the cost of capital is today. We absolutely take a longer look. So as an analyst, you would look at the internal rate of return that you will get on a development because you know that if you believe that fundamentals are going to improve over time, you could do something with a 6 yield today, a 7 yield today. But as cap rates adjust, as rental growth adjust, you look out 10 years and you get an IRR that's above your weighted average cost of capital today. And then you have confidence to go forward. So I know it's real easy to just look at initial yield and we publish that because it's an interesting topic to everybody and rightly so. But in challenging times like this, you really have to take a longer view because you don't want to miss on opportunity that would be very strategic and excellent for your shareholders over the long run. And that's what we're trying to do.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just on the funding side of that then, you talked about just the preference for dispositions versus stake sales. But just what about your comment at this point? I mean is that completely off the table or similar type discussion where it could make sense depending on what's teed up.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. So Tony, as we've said, our guidance assumes no equity, same was true in 2023 to remind everybody. And our focus is on as sources of capital to fund our business on the noncore assets outside of the mega campus. But obviously you reevaluate that on an ongoing basis just like we have in past practice.\nAnthony Paolone: And then if I could just sneak one more in for Peter since you got your crystal ball out. If you kind of look forward to, I guess, maybe next year when you're past this whole wave of supply that you outlined. What do you think happens to market rents between now and then, and not just base, but just totality of lease economics?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. Like we're anticipating a very flat environment. Opportunities that Alexandria can provide in a mega campus are likely going to perform much better, materially better than some of the supply that's going to be delivered. But certainly supply is going to weigh on rents and, but we don't necessarily see a retrenchment outside of certainly levels that were hit in 2021 and 2022 are going to be back we're going to back off from that. But the area the rental areas of '17, '18, '19 that our submarkets were in, I'm certain will be the bottom and it'll grow from there.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jim Kammert with Evercore.\nJim Kammert : Joel, certainly appreciate your comments that demand can be more event driven for the lab business, which is understandable. But is it possible for the team to provide just a little bit more context or quantification regarding your tenant interest in your development and redevelopment pipeline today, say, versus 90 to 180 days ago? And when I say context, I'm thinking the number of tenants you're holding discussions with, the range of space requirements they might be seeking and maybe the timetables for making decisions, just trying to get some more comfort into the visibility of the lease up?\nJoel Marcus: I don't think we would want to be that transparent given the competitive nature of what we're doing these days. I'm not sure that would serve our interest or even our tenants interest. In fact, they may not want us to be talking about something like that in advance. So I'd be pretty wary of that kind of thing. I think that what is happening is and Peter I think has talked about this, we kind of hit a low in '23 certainly after the Silicon Valley Bank episode and some of the market shutters and so forth. But I think as Hallie has presented, the market since October is really solidified and more money was flowing or is flowing into the sector. And I think that's really a better benchmark and certainly as companies hit milestones as Hallie mentioned intracellular hitting a critical, critical very high quality milestone and was able to do. I think their last financing and then they turned profitable. So that's kind of how we look at it. I think anything more of a NORAD early warning system probably wouldn't be in our best interest. I apologize for that.\nOperator: The next question will come from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street.\nDylan Burzinski: Hi, guys. Just going back to sort of the development yields coming down versus historical levels, I guess just given as you guys think about things from a holistic capital allocation approach, how do you weigh sort of starting in development at a low 6% cap rate versus sort of going out and buying in the open market or buying assets, I guess, I should say. Is it simply maybe you guys are willing to sort of accept that lower yield today because a lot of these developments are sort of an extension of the Mega Canvas strategy or is there something else?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. No, I think that's a really I'll ask Peter to comment, but I think that the last point you raised is really the point. The mega campuses provide, I mean we were first mover, we have by and large in almost every market, I can't think of any market where we don't have really best locations. And if somebody wants to grow and grow on your campus that's going to be a lot better for the long-term growth and health of the campus and the company as opposed to somebody who wants to go into a one off building somewhere. That's just even if the yield is potentially higher, I don't think so. And remember too with 3% plus bumps each year, the ending rental value on certainly development 10, 15, 20 year leases is pretty substantial. But Peter?\nPeter Moglia: Yes. Hey, John. I just I'm not just me, but the team is not necessarily seeing anything we'd want to buy. Again, as I make the commentary about supply, most of what probably will be available to buy is not in the areas that we're interested in today. I'm not saying we're not never say never that an area might not become interesting in the future. And as I said, we could put our brand on it and make it work. But the opportunities that we will be talking about in the future and I'd say the near future are going to be on our mega campuses because of all the things that we talk about with the scale and the vibrancy our tenants and tenants that are not ours but want to be ours notice and understand the value. And so it's going to make the, it's just going to make more sense long-term for us to put them on these campuses rather than buy a one off building and put someone in there and end up wondering in the future why we did that because it doesn't really match our model.\nOperator: The next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: I wanted to circle back on overall leasing activity. It sounds like trends are improving over the past few quarters. But does the recent push out in interest rate cuts, does that impact, I guess, tenants' ability to raise capital at all or does that delay their decisions or ability to make these types of decisions?\nJoel Marcus: No. And you can just look at what's happened as Hallie outlined in the first quarter, Michael, again event driven, it's not a direct correlation to economic environment or interest rates that just how this sector in industry kind of walks the walk. And it's not totally shielded by that, because if there was to be some, I mean imagine if China decided to invade Taiwan, the market seized and rates spiked in some crazy fashion or something obviously that would have an immediate impact on everybody. But I think no not the deferral isn't going to change if somebody hits a great milestone they're going to be able to finance. Now maybe there might be a higher concession on the underwriting or the overnight or whatever method they choose. But that's a rather infinitesimal cost to capital issue for companies.\nMichael Carroll: Okay. I mean do tenants make decisions on expanding into 2 new areas of research based off of their ability to raise capital so like they\u2019re and I think correct me if I am wrong\u2026\nJoel Marcus: Of course. And most of that is done at the venture level. And so when somebody is pioneering a new area venture and not so much the publicly traded markets. But once you get into the clinic then if you are fortunate enough to get public then the public markets kind of take hold of that.\nHallie Kuhn: Yes. And just to this is Hallie, just one addition. Recall that with venture firms, they're sitting on a lot of dry powder, that is already committed capital that they can call on and there's a number of larger funds that we're talking to that are raising, closing multibillion dollar funds. So they are sitting on capital that's ready to deploy. They are not dependent in the same way that a public company is on the interest rate.\nMichael Carroll: And then just last one for me. I know there has been discussions where, the Board as some of these tenants have been making like veto decisions if companies can lease space or not. I mean is that are the boards loosening up? Are they willing to make these decisions now?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think historically, boards have had very careful oversight. I think unfortunately, when the markets become very frothy, boards get a little bit lazy and not as astute or disciplined in what they do. But I think you can be certain today, boards are very disciplined and it's been that way now for a handful of years. So I don't think anything's changing in that regard. I mean the answer is, if somebody needs space to scale and grow because they hit a key milestone or they've turned profitable or whatever it happens to be, those are high quality decisions, because the cost of space for most of these companies is a fairly nominal amount of their overall cost of doing business.\nOperator: Next question will come from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank.\nOmotayo Okusanya: I appreciate all the comments around supply and also development. If you could go back to this crystal ball type scenario, curious if you'd be willing to offer up when you think you might be able to start a new development? And then what potential market could that be given the demand supply dynamics you see in each of your key major markets and on your mega campuses?\nJoel Marcus: Yes. I don't think we would announce such a thing on an earnings call willy-nilly. It's based on tenant demand, of course.\nOmotayo Okusanya: But are markets getting better? Are you seeing like more demand suggests that could happen sooner rather than later?\nJoel Marcus: Well, I think based on the questions that have been raised on the call right now and Hallie's commentary, I think we've said since October, the market certainly have gotten better, yes.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Joel Marcus for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nJoel Marcus: Yes. Thank you, everybody. Just remember May is Mental Health Month and we'll be very focused on that with our efforts on a number of corporate social fronts. So be safe. Take care. God bless. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Moglia",
            "content": "Thanks, Hallie. I know myself, family and friends benefited from innovation that has occurred since 2008. So appreciate the context you just gave us. I'm going to go ahead and discuss our development pipeline leasing supply and asset sales, and then I'll hand it over to Marc. In the first quarter, we delivered 343,445 square feet into our high barrier to entry submarkets covering 5 projects. The annual incremental NOI delivered during the quarter aggregated to $26 million. Development and redevelopment leasing during the quarter was approximately 100,000 square feet. In addition to the executed leases, we signed 162,000 square feet of LOIs during the quarter which will see future development and redevelopment pipeline leasing. Base leased or under negotiation in our current and near-term projects under construction increased by 3% over last quarter to 63% and projects delivering in 2024 and 2025 are 80% leased. From the second quarter of 2024 through the end of 2027, we expect to deliver approximately $480 million of stabilized NOI from the current pipeline. Transitioning to leasing and supply, as we noted last quarter, the bottom of demand was reached during the first half of 2023 and it continues to incrementally recover in our core markets. We expect that the lack of funding activity in early 2023 will continue to be an overhang to full recovery for a quarter or two, but we have strong conviction that a recovery will be achieved in the near-term given the key fundamentals Hallie outlined. Alexandria is well-positioned to weather these storms given the moat enduring competitive advantages we continue to widen and build. We leased 1,142,857 square feet during the first quarter, consistent with our pre-pandemic velocity. GAAP and cash rental rate increases were extraordinarily strong at 33% and 19% respectively and the related tenant improvements and leasing commissions trended down 16% compared to our 2023 leasing costs. Our teams continue to closely track competitive supply building by building in our proprietary databases. As noted in last quarter's call, we expect 2024 to be the peak year for new deliveries and then begin to dissipate in 2025. In Greater Boston, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 decreased significantly from 7% of market inventory in the fourth quarter to 1.6% due to 3.3 million square feet of competitive projects delivering in the first quarter. Approximately 1.17 million square feet of those projects were moved from an estimated 2023 delivery to a 2024 delivery last quarter. The unreleased delivered space is reflected in the direct vacancy numbers I'm going to present. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply in Greater Boston will increase market inventory by another 2% which is an expected slowdown from the 2024 levels. In San Francisco Bay, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 9.6% of market inventory which is a 1.1% decrease driven mostly by reclassifying a 0.5 million square foot project from a 2024 to 2025 delivery due to a temporary delay in construction. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply in San Francisco will increase market inventory by 3.7%, a 1.5% increase over last quarter due to that reclassification. In San Diego, unleased competitive supply estimated to be delivered in 2024 is 5.1% of market inventory, a 1.6% decrease from last quarter due to moving 2 projects from an estimated 24 delivery to 2025. In 2025, the unleased competitive supply will increase market inventory by another 3.8%, a 1.1% increase due to that reclassification, but offset somewhat due to first quarter leasing at those projects. To update you on direct and sublease vacancy, direct vacancy in Greater Boston is up 593 basis points to 12.98% due to the previously mentioned 1Q '24 deliveries. It has climbed more moderately in San Francisco up 175 basis points to 14.11% propelled by 147,000 square foot spec delivery in San Carlos. In San Diego, direct vacancy increased by 244 basis points to 10.41% driven primarily by the inclusion of space not vacant today, but now known will be vacant soon. Sublease vacancy decreased in Greater Boston by about 3 quarters of a percent to 5.17% increased in San Francisco Bay by 0.5% to 6.28% and increased by a third of a percent in San Diego to 5.7%. Again, 2024 is the peak year of disruption from supply. Alexandria is studying 94.6% occupancy is another data point supporting the effectiveness of our wide moat and enduring competitive advantages. I'll conclude with an update on our value harvesting asset recycling program. After a busy quarter four 2023 schedule where we closed on $439 million in asset sales marketed and negotiated throughout the year, we spent the first quarter priming our disposition and partial interest sales pipeline for what will likely be a closing schedule heavily weighted towards the third and four quarters. Early progress is reflected in pending transactions subject to letters of intent or purchase and sale agreement negotiations of $258.1 million and there are a number of other ongoing active sales efforts. Buyers of noncore assets are generally private equity, family office, local operators and institutionally backed real estate partnerships looking to diversify their asset mix with life science real estate. During the quarter, we closed on assets totaling $17.2 million inclusive of 99 A Street in the Seaport, which executive management deemed to no longer be strategic due to its one off profile and our pivot to 285, 299, 307, 347 Dorchester Avenue acquired during the quarter, which is nearby with similar red line access, but has the scale to be a future mega campus. We remain committed to our self-funding strategy and our offerings remain attractive to investors looking for exposure to life science real estate given the promising outlook for the industry how we presented despite near-term supply challenges. With that, I'll pass it over to Marc. Yes, I think you misinterpreted my comments. There's no pause. I was just trying to point out that, we tend to close a lot of our sales in the latter half of the year like we did last year. And because we spend a lot of time in the first quarter teeing up things after a busy fourth quarter. So, yes, no pause, activity remains brisk. It's about 20% of our goal which again given how we're heavily weighted towards 3Q and 4Q I think is on target. Yes. I think Michael was also referring just to the general market data that I was talking about. There were probably I think 3 to 4 projects within the 3 markets that I comment on that got moved and that is something fairly normal because of course, what Joel mentioned was one of our own projects that got moved, but we're tracking all projects that we believe is are competitive. And as the data comes in from the brokerage community and from our own observations at times something that was supposed to or we thought would deliver in 1 year gets kicked quarter or 2 and puts it into the next year. So that's just the nature of data. But yes, we do, we are fairly confident that we're not going to see too much more after 2025 frankly because we're not seeing anything else start right now or limited I think maybe one project started in San Diego in the third quarter of 2023, but nothing of material that's material that we've noticed has started since then. So that would put us in a pretty good position after '25 to get to a very normalized delivery run. Yes, I mean, it's a great question, Rich. It's a crystal ball question, but I mean the way I think about it. The way I think about it is, I look at what Hallie is talking about with demand and to kind of add on to what her last comments were, we saw a decrease relative decrease in funding during 2023 and there's a lag effect for that to take place and that's one of the reasons why we think 2024 is going to be the kind of the bottom to use the crystal ball and it's going to accelerate from here because of all the investment that Hallie pointed out that's going on today is going to create demand. So the tail of the supply is going to be a direct correlation to how much demand there is to take it up and we think that that demand is going to be strong therefore the tail won't be that long. But we'll see, as I said, we're going to see some significant additions to the market in 2024 and then roughly half of what we're seeing in 2024 and 2025 and then virtually hopefully 0 to very little in 2026 probably just things that get delayed in 2025 bleed into '26. But we'll be, that'll be coming into a market that is strengthening as more demand appears because of the funding. I don't think it's competing very well at all. And that's illustrated by our occupancy and the cash and GAAP rent spreads that we reported today. I mean, we've been saying for a long time that our brand and platform of mega campuses means a lot to our tenants and I think it's just proving out. Remember a lot of the supply is one off in tertiary markets and it's the type of profile that things get super tight in areas like Cambridge or Torrey Pines or South Lake Union, in Seattle, they might catch a bid just like tertiary markets and office would when there'd be spikes in office demand. But for now nothing is really moving outside handful of leases here and there outside of what we're doing. Because as we say all the time, if Alexandria has space available that fits what the tenants need are 90%+ of time, they're going to come to us because we know what we're doing. We can scale them. We have operational excellence, and I say this all the time, no one's going to get fired, for picking an Alexandria building. You might get fired for picking a building from someone who has no idea what they're doing. Yes, it's a great question. We get asked, my first reaction is always well, gosh, if we weren't there by now, it wasn't a priority. I believe they'll probably be some opportunities that we will look at in the future. If we put our brand on the building and people know we're operating it even if it's in a newer market, it can be successful. A great illustration of that is what we did in the Fenway. We came in there, it was an unproven market. The 201 Brookline asset that we bought was about 17% leased. We come in, put our brand on it, put our knowhow into it and within I think 3 quarters it was fully stabilized. That said that was a submarket that we knew was going to be had a lot of the fundamentals that make a good submarkets. Some of these areas that the supply is in today, I don't see the same profile. So probably a tougher decision down the road. But what happens to those buildings, I think a lot of them will become office buildings. Frankly, offices certainly not dead, probably office that was built in the \u201860s and \u201870s and even the \u201880s might have to go away because it's functional obsolete. But if you built a new lab building and you couldn't lease it as lab, it's probably going to be a pretty good office building. But again crystal ball, that's just my opinion. Yes. Look, Tony, I think you really have to look Joel laid out what creates opportunities that we may capitalize on, but we are going to be looking obviously at cost of capital. We can't make decisions though on what we think or what the cost of capital is today. We absolutely take a longer look. So as an analyst, you would look at the internal rate of return that you will get on a development because you know that if you believe that fundamentals are going to improve over time, you could do something with a 6 yield today, a 7 yield today. But as cap rates adjust, as rental growth adjust, you look out 10 years and you get an IRR that's above your weighted average cost of capital today. And then you have confidence to go forward. So I know it's real easy to just look at initial yield and we publish that because it's an interesting topic to everybody and rightly so. But in challenging times like this, you really have to take a longer view because you don't want to miss on opportunity that would be very strategic and excellent for your shareholders over the long run. And that's what we're trying to do. Yes. Like we're anticipating a very flat environment.

But certainly supply is going to weigh on rents and, but we don't necessarily see a retrenchment outside of certainly levels that were hit in 2021 and 2022 are going to be back we're going to back off from that. But the area the rental areas of '17, '18, '19 that our submarkets were in, I'm certain will be the bottom and it'll grow from there. Yes. Hey, John. I just I'm not just me, but the team is not necessarily seeing anything we'd want to buy. Again, as I make the commentary about supply, most of what probably will be available to buy is not in the areas that we're interested in today.

            "name": "Joel Marcus",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul, and welcome, everybody to Alexandria's first quarter '24. With me today are Hallie, Peter and Marc. First of all, a thank you and congratulations to our ARE's family team for a very solid first quarter against a continuing tough macro with stubbornly high interest rates and continuing non-transitory inflation instigated by the federal governments really uncontrolled spending. In fact, our annual debt service now is greater than our defense budget crazy. Also huge congratulations to the entire team as Alexander has once again been named one of the most trustworthy companies in America by Newsweek, and nominated as such by our 3 constituencies, our customers, our investors and our employees. Guided by Alexandria's core values of integrity, mutual respect, egoless leadership, humility, transparency, teamwork and trust, we have established ourselves at the Vanguard in the heart of the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry. We're very honored that Newsweek has again recognized us with this important award, which is a testament to company's values and to the trust that our tenants, investors and employees have in our one of a kind brand. And as we said before, as Jim Collins has said, Alexandria has achieved the 3 outputs that define a great company, superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. We remain unwavering in our efforts to build upon these outputs and to continue to maintain our stellar reputation and the most trusted brand for life science real estate providing essential infrastructure enabling the development of new safe and effective medicines. Remember over 90% of diseases have yet to have addressable therapies or cures. Remember 2, the top causes of death in the United States remain cancer, heart disease and the third fentanyl and methamphetamine and that is a profoundly sad statement of fact. So my quick take on the first quarter, Alexandria is a one of a kind company with a great brand as I said, scale, dominance and our unique cluster strategy together with the fortress balance sheet. We've posted 7.6% year-over-year NOI growth which is I think very solid in this environment, 7.3% year-over-year FFO growth, 5% dividend growth and our collections 99.9%. We had a strong leasing quarter with solid leasing spreads and we continue strong occupancy despite recently acquired vacancy. We also posted very solid same store growth and also very solid guidance. We are particularly laser focused on leasing for the 2025 pipeline as well as redevelopment space to be delivered in 2025 and of course the leasing of vacant space in 2025, which is the fastest space to deliver to our growing tenants. And much like we did during the great financial crisis, we're pushing forward our pipeline because of the need for Alexandria's Labspace coupled with solid indicators of positive rebound for life sciences in 2024 which Hallie will address. Lease expirations for 2024 and 2025 on a combined basis are down as well as unresolved expirations for both 2024 and 2025 on a combined basis being down as well. Peter will talk about capital recycling, but for the quarter so far, we've had approximately $275 million of noncore assets sold or pending and we're about so that means we're about 20% through our targeted $1.4 billion of recycling of capital for our business for 2024, and we feel very comfortable where we are today. And then finally before I turn it over to Hallie, I mentioned in our last earnings call our decision to sell 219 East 42nd Street, New York City, the former Pfizer headquarters building ultimately for residential use. A very good decision reinforced by the continuing. My own view and competence of the State of New York and the City of New York in continuing to incentivize and foster empty one-off buildings for so called life science use while turning their backs on fundraising of startup companies, which is the heart and soul of the New York City life science ecosystem and which is so badly needed. There has been of all the regions no lab leasing in New York City in the first quarter whatsoever and yet the state and the city are proposing fostering more and encouraging more people to deliver space. We sit in a very good position with our campus, but nonetheless when you have local and state governments who are not mindful of using funding better spent on funding startups and also the health, welfare and safety of the citizens, that's very disconcerting. So with that I'm going to turn it over to Hallie for a number of important comments. Hallie? So operator, let's go to Q&A kindly. Yes, so this is Joel. I'll let Peter answer that. But I think the words you used are pretty inaccurate. One project in San Diego was moved to the following year, not kicked down several years of the can because there is a very substantial credit tenant lease they're working on that makes it more complex to deliver the space as we originally intended. So I think your thinking is not like the federal government not getting a budget and just kicking it down that's not what's going on here. Peter? Yes, it doesn't quite work that way. That's kind of how it works in the rest of real estate. But as Hallie said, demand in this sector as you can see over many years is event driven. So it's not so much a rental rate or a concession per se. It's the key location for recruitment of talent, the ability to grow or need space immediately based on a major clinical milestone that's either made financing possible or just scale up possible. So those are the things that tend to be the most important, which is space for delivery. And the market will be the market, but that's not the concessions or things like that are not driving people's decisions. It doesn't work that way. Yes. And that's been pretty consistent as Vikram, how we've done it year-by-year, year-over-year. And remember, this is one of those years where you've got macro at home, you've got geopolitical issues and then you've got an election. So we wanted to be conservative about what we're doing here. Well, short-term renewals often happen. Remember what I just said to Michael, in this industry people are waiting for data that Hallie said and if you've got a clinical trial data or some important catalyst that's going to drive the business hopefully positively, but could be negatively. And that's coming up. You want to ensure that you're kind of preserving your strategic optionality as much as possible and that's why people want to kind of keep where they are until they know what do we need and where are we going. So that's very typical of this industry over many years. Yes. So, Hallie, do you want to maybe just comment again? Yes. So maybe, Rich, let me just say this. I think you've seen us kind of like we did in the great financial crisis once the rocket ship of COVID started to come back to earth rather rapidly, February of '21 is when it started. Certainly over the last couple of years and certainly into this year, we've been I think profoundly disciplined in thinking about, we've certainly stopped a number of projects. We've restarted 1 or 2 here or there based on leasing volume, but we've been very, very disciplined about what we would start. So there is not a volume throughput or some kind of a need to do that. We have right now, as you know, a pretty decent pipeline that's relatively well leased and our goal is to meet the needs of growing tenants and that's what really dictates our decision to start projects or convert space or try to move people into vacant space that's available and quickly operational. So those are the things that we're really focused on and it's really judged by demand and then against the backdrop of cost of capital and yield and things like that which Peter has given pretty over many quarters pretty great detail on. Yes. So Hallie, you could kind of comment on that. I think that's ongoing frankly, but. Yes. So, Peter, thoughts? Yes. So Tony, as we've said, our guidance assumes no equity, same was true in 2023 to remind everybody. And our focus is on as sources of capital to fund our business on the noncore assets outside of the mega campus. But obviously you reevaluate that on an ongoing basis just like we have in past practice. I don't think we would want to be that transparent given the competitive nature of what we're doing these days. I'm not sure that would serve our interest or even our tenants interest. In fact, they may not want us to be talking about something like that in advance. So I'd be pretty wary of that kind of thing. I think that what is happening is and Peter I think has talked about this, we kind of hit a low in '23 certainly after the Silicon Valley Bank episode and some of the market shutters and so forth. But I think as Hallie has presented, the market since October is really solidified and more money was flowing or is flowing into the sector. And I think that's really a better benchmark and certainly as companies hit milestones as Hallie mentioned intracellular hitting a critical, critical very high quality milestone and was able to do. I think their last financing and then they turned profitable. So that's kind of how we look at it. I think anything more of a NORAD early warning system probably wouldn't be in our best interest. I apologize for that. Yes. No, I think that's a really I'll ask Peter to comment, but I think that the last point you raised is really the point. The mega campuses provide, I mean we were first mover, we have by and large in almost every market, I can't think of any market where we don't have really best locations. And if somebody wants to grow and grow on your campus that's going to be a lot better for the long-term growth and health of the campus and the company as opposed to somebody who wants to go into a one off building somewhere. That's just even if the yield is potentially higher, I don't think so. And remember too with 3% plus bumps each year, the ending rental value on certainly development 10, 15, 20 year leases is pretty substantial. But Peter? No. And you can just look at what's happened as Hallie outlined in the first quarter, Michael, again event driven, it's not a direct correlation to economic environment or interest rates that just how this sector in industry kind of walks the walk. And it's not totally shielded by that, because if there was to be some, I mean imagine if China decided to invade Taiwan, the market seized and rates spiked in some crazy fashion or something obviously that would have an immediate impact on everybody. But I think no not the deferral isn't going to change if somebody hits a great milestone they're going to be able to finance. Now maybe there might be a higher concession on the underwriting or the overnight or whatever method they choose. But that's a rather infinitesimal cost to capital issue for companies. Of course. And most of that is done at the venture level. And so when somebody is pioneering a new area venture and not so much the publicly traded markets. But once you get into the clinic then if you are fortunate enough to get public then the public markets kind of take hold of that. Well, I think historically, boards have had very careful oversight. I think unfortunately, when the markets become very frothy, boards get a little bit lazy and not as astute or disciplined in what they do. But I think you can be certain today, boards are very disciplined and it's been that way now for a handful of years. So I don't think anything's changing in that regard. I mean the answer is, if somebody needs space to scale and grow because they hit a key milestone or they've turned profitable or whatever it happens to be, those are high quality decisions, because the cost of space for most of these companies is a fairly nominal amount of their overall cost of doing business. Yes. I don't think we would announce such a thing on an earnings call willy-nilly. It's based on tenant demand, of course. Well, I think based on the questions that have been raised on the call right now and Hallie's commentary, I think we've said since October, the market certainly have gotten better, yes. Yes. Thank you, everybody. Just remember May is Mental Health Month and we'll be very focused on that with our efforts on a number of corporate social fronts. So be safe. Take care. God bless. Thank you."

            "name": "Marc Binda",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. This is Marc Binda, CFO. Hello, and good afternoon, everyone. We reported very strong operating and financial results for the first quarter and our team is off to a great start to 2024. Total revenues and NOI for 1Q 2024 was up 9.7% and 11.5% respectively over 1Q '23, primarily driven by solid same property performance and continued execution of our development and redevelopment strategy. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the quarter was $2.35 up 7.3% over 1Q '23 and was ahead of consensus. We also reiterated the midpoint of our full year 2024 guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $9.47 which is up 5.6% over 2023. Our solid operating results for the quarter were driven by our disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy, tremendous scale and our differentiated business. Our tenants continue to appreciate our brand, collaborative mega campuses and operational excellence by our team. 74% of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses. We have high quality cash flows from 52% of our annual rental revenue from investment grade or publicly traded large cap tenants. Collections remain very high at 99.9% and adjusted EBITDA margins were very strong at 72%. Leasing volume in the first quarter was strong at 1.1 million square feet for the quarter, which is up 30% over the average of the last two quarters and consistent with our historical quarterly average period from 2013 to 2020. We continue to benefit from our tremendous scale, high quality tenant roster and brand loyalty with 77% of our leasing activity over the last 12 months coming from existing deep tenant relationships. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and releasing space in 1Q '24 was strong at 33% and 19% on a cash basis. Our outlook for rental rate growth for the full year 2024 remains solid at 11% to 19% and 5% to 13% on a cash basis. And reflects our view that given the relatively small amount included the renewals of releasing from any particular quarter compared to the full year and the mix of lease expirations in any particular quarter, we do expect some variation in rental rate growth from quarter to quarter. The overall mark-to-market for cash rental rates for our entire portfolio remains very solid at 14%, which is unchanged from the prior quarter, which is impressive given the strong realized rental rate growth experienced in the first quarter. Our nonrevenue enhancing expenditures, including TIs on second generation space, have averaged 15% of net operating income over the last 5 years and are expected to be below that in the 12% to 13% range in 2024, which really highlights the durable nature of our laboratory infrastructure. Same property NOI growth for 1Q 2024 was solid at 1% and 4.2% on a cash basis, driven by strong rental rate growth and leasing volume. Our outlook for full year same property growth was unchanged since our last update at 1.5% and 4% on a cash basis at the midpoint. Occupancy for the quarter was solid at 94.6%, which is consistent with the prior quarter. And during the quarter, we continued to execute on our development and redevelopment strategy by delivering 343,445 square feet from the pipeline, which will generate $26 million of incremental annual net operating income. We also expect to see significant future growth in incremental annual net operating income on a cash basis of $101 million from executed leases as the initial free rent from recent deliveries burns off over the next 7 months on a weighted average basis. As a reminder, this contractual increase in cash flows will have a significant positive impact on NAV as these projects were previously delivered and no longer sit in CIP at the end of 1Q '24. As Peter highlighted, we have $5.5 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are projected to generate $480 million of incremental annual net operating income over the next 4 years, including 2.1 million square feet delivering through 2025 that are 81% leased negotiating and are expected to generate $229 million of additional net operating income. With projects committed and/or under construction and expected to generate significant NOI over the next few years, coupled with our future pipeline projects in preconstruction, we have the ability to grow our already large operating base of 42 million square feet by 78% over time. With significant construction activities as well as important pre construction activities adding value and focused on reducing the time from lease execution to delivery, we're required to capitalize a significant portion of our gross interest cost. Last year, we saw a peak in capitalized interest in the quarter preceding our record deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2023, which generated $265 million of incremental annual net operating income. These record deliveries have driven a decline in the average real estate basis subject to capitalization of $1.3 billion or 14% from all of 2023 on average to 1Q '24. Capitalized interest as a percentage of gross interest has similarly declined from 83% for the entire year of 2023 to 67% for 1Q '24. In addition, capitalized interest has had an overall decline for 2 consecutive quarters coming off the peak of 3Q '22. Our outlook for capitalized interest for 2024 is consistent with our previous guidance and continues to assume a double-digit decline in average basis subject to capitalization for the full year ended 2024 compared to 2023. Transitioning to the balance sheet, we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets amongst all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our corporate credit ratings rank in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. Our leverage continues to remain low at 5.2 times for net debt to adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly annualized basis. We have tremendous liquidity of $6 billion fixed rate debt comprising 98.9% of our total debt and a weighted average remaining debt term of 13.4 years. In addition, nearly a third of our total debt has at least 25 years remaining to maturity with a very advantageous blended rate of 3.86%. We remain disciplined with our strategy for long-term funding of our business with a focus on maximizing bottom-line growth, maintaining our fortress balance sheet and recycling capital from dispositions and partial interest sales to minimize the issuance of common stock. We're very pleased with the execution of our bond deal, which we completed during the quarter aggregating $1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.48% and a weighted average maturity of 23.1 years. Similar to the self-funding strategy that we executed in 2023, we expect to recycle capital into our highly leased development and redevelopment pipeline through outright dispositions and partial interest sales primarily focused on assets not integral to our mega campus strategy allowing us to enhance the quality of our asset base. As Peter mentioned, we completed $17 million dispositions during the quarter. We have $258 million of pending transactions at various levels of negotiation and we have a significant amount of additional target dispositions and partial interest sales that we're working on beyond that. Based on our current outlook, we expect our asset recycling program to be more heavily weighted towards outright dispositions of noncore assets rather than partial interest sales. I'll turn to the dividends. We also expect to continue to fund a meaningful amount of our equity needs with retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends of $450 million at the midpoint for 2024 or an estimated $2.1 billion for the 5-year period through 2024. And our high quality cash flows continue to support the growth in our annual common stock dividends with an average annual increase in dividends per share of 5% since 2020 and we continue to have a very conservative FFO payout ratio of 54% in the first quarter. Realized gains from the venture investments included in FFO per share as adjusted for the quarter were $28.8 million relatively consistent with our historical average of $24 million per quarter going back to 2021. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investment portfolio as of 1Q '24 were $320 million on a cost basis of just under $1.2 billion. We have updated our guidance as I mentioned for '24 for EPS of $3.60 to $3.72 and we tightened the range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted to $9.41 to $9.53 with no change to the midpoint of $9.47 which represents a solid 5.6% growth in FFO per share for 2024. With that, let me turn it back to Joel. Yes. I mean, it really depends market by market, lease by lease that we renew in each particular quarter. So there can definitely be some variation to quarter-to-quarter. Q1 was very strong. We're really pleased with that. And I think the year is strong. We still feel good about the guidance we gave for both GAAP and cash rental rate increases for the year. Yes, I mean, I think we're on track. It's not unusual for us as we get out as we kind of get through the year to shrink the range as we get more and more comfortable. So we shrunk the top end and the bottom end with no change to the midpoint of our guidance. So I think we still feel good about very solid growth this year of 5.6% over 2023. Yes. Hi, Wes. This is Marc. Yes, I think last quarter, we did believe that the second half of the year would have some acceleration. I think our view is that the second half will be strong to in line with guidance right now. And I think to be fair, I think the first quarter came in pretty strong. So I think second half, we expect to be strong."

            "name": "Hallie Kuhn",
            "content": "Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Life Science and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to review the fundamentals of the $5 trillion secularly growing life science industry, what these fundamentals mean for the health of our diverse life science base, and how our tenant science dictates the need for Alexandria's Labspace infrastructure. In 2008, on the heels of the great financial crisis, the size of the public biopharma industry was around $2.5 trillion and approximately $11 billion in venture capital was invested in private life science companies. There was no cure for hepatitis C, obesity was considered too complex to ever treat with an effective therapy and gene and cell therapies were a hope not a reality. Today, the industry is valued at over $5 trillion venture capital is on pace to reach 4x the levels deployed in 2008. 600 additional novel therapies have been approved by the FDA and countless lives have been improved, extended and saved. Coming out of this bear cycle, albeit with stops and starts along the way, the life science industry is in a profoundly different place compared to previous cycles with a fundamentally strong framework to accelerate long-term growth of the industry and demand for Alexandria Labspace. With the long-term perspective as a backdrop, let's step through first quarter trends in the life science industry. First, with respect to life science venture investment, nearly $11 billion of deployed capital was announced in the first quarter and $100 million plus mega rounds accounted for 34 deals, the highest number in the last 8 quarters and any quarter prior to 2021. These trends bode well for demand from new and existing private biotechnology tenants, which account for 10% of our ARR. Moving on to our pre-commercial and commercial public biotech tenants, which represent 9% and 16% of our ARR respectively. Follow-on and PIPE financings achieved one of the highest quarters on record, totaling $15.5 billion of which one in every $4 was raised by an Alexandria tenant. This past week, long time Alexandria Tenant Intracellular Therapies announced clinical data for their first-in-class therapy lumateperone, for treatment of depression and went on to raise $500 million. The story here is that demand is milestone based and for companies that achieve their target milestones, typically clinical data, they have access to meaningful capital to accelerate their science and expand. Third, are our multinational our multinational pharmaceutical companies, which represent 20% ARR. M&A is a key headline for this segment. 2023 was a record for acquisitions and first quarter continued at a strong pace, eclipsing $40 billion in announced deals. This activity reflects large pharma strong balance sheets and pressure to expand their pipelines with innovative therapies to counter the over $200 billion in revenue at risk from patent expirations through 2030. M&A is a robust sign of the health of the industry and as capital is recycled back to investors and entrepreneurs, it will be redeployed into the next generation of life science companies. Last our life science products, service and device tenants, which represent 21% ARR. A trend we are watching closely is pressure from Congress to limit utilization of Chinese CDMOs under the proposed BIOSECURE Act. Whether or not the legislation passes, this is positive for our U.S. based CDMO tenants, which analysts expect to see a substantial increase in demand and will help ensure we maintain our national competitive edge in such a critical industry. Switching gears, let's put on our lab coats and examine how our tenants research dictates their lab requirements. Illustrating with a real world example, consider a private biotech Company developing precision oncology medicines that is expanding into 20,000 square feet. Working directly with Alexandria's in-house lab operations team, they placed 328 pieces of equipment in the lab ranging from bench top centrifuges to freezers, cryo tanks, DNA sequencers and advanced microscopes. 10 pieces of equipment, including negative 80 degree freezers, require emergency power as it is critical this equipment operates 24x7 to ensure hundreds of thousands of dollars of experimental samples are safeguarded. Now where this equipment is placed is not based simply on the square footage required, but the process flow of their experiments. A single cell biologist utilizes equipment spanning multiple benches, chemical fume hoods, tissue culture suites and microscopy rooms. Beyond that, she moves back and forth through the lab and adjacent non-technical space, conference rooms and communal kitchen throughout the day. Labspace cannot be equated to traditional office steps dictated solely by the number of workers, but is more tend to a data center where the space needs are driven by the physical equipment. While highly trained scientific talent is required to oversee the science, it's the scientific workflow and instrumentation used that dictates the lab footprint. On a related topic, given the immense volume and complexity a data require to inform AI algorithm. Many AI centric tenants have heavy equipment needs that require significant laboratory footprint. A great example is South San Francisco based tenant, insitro with whom we announced a significant early extension this quarter. AI is an amazing tool, but the laboratory is still the workbench. So circling back to where we began, in the past 15 years the Life Science industry has doubled in size, along the way improving countless lives. Projecting 15 years into the future, the growth trajectory of this industry is massive as companies work to cure diseases such as Alzheimer's, autoimmune disease, and the nearly 7,000 rare diseases that affect 1 in 10 Americans. As a trusted partner to the world's leading life science companies, our job is to safeguard our tenants' mission critical research and support and catalyze discoveries that will shape the future of medicine. With that, I will pass it to Peter. As I walked through in the data across our different segments, just remember that we have a very diverse set of different tenant demands ranging from small private biotechs, public biotechs, large pharma institutions, life science tools product devices. So each of those you have to look at differently. But across each one of those, we are seeing strength. And again, we are coming down off 2021, but still quite strong compared to any year previously. So, venture capital continues to be at a very robust pace. Mega rounds, which are a great indicator of what will be near-term demand drivers, oftentimes just in time space, have really picked up with 34, just this quarter. On the public biotech side, follow on financing, very strong historic quarter, but also IPOs, the window is opening slightly. We'll see how that trend continues over the rest of the year. And then pharma demand, we continue to see a number of very large requirements across our regions, very much driven by the need to be able to recruit the best talent and ensure that they can innovate for years to come. So I think across each of our segments, we're seeing continued strength in the backdrop of, of course some challenging macro markets. Sure. Yes. I think these are really popular topics, right? We don't go more than half an hour without getting a question on AI and the BIOSECURE Act and certainly on the regulatory front has been front and center. Yes, I think these are pieces of a kind of large pool of different types of demand that we see across our spectrum of tenants. But certainly, we have a number of tenants insitro we mentioned, and a number of others in our portfolio that do have significant lab requirements given the large data generation. And then for CDMOs and how that relates to demand going forward, these things happen in the order of years, not months. But certainly, I think it's a positive trend for the industry overall with respect to ensuring that this industry remains certainly what we would consider a national, really important for our national security for development of drugs. So two things that we're watching closely, but I wouldn't say are going to be the things that are pushing the industry overall, just two pieces of it. Yes. And just to this is Hallie, just one addition. Recall that with venture firms, they're sitting on a lot of dry powder, that is already committed capital that they can call on and there's a number of larger funds that we're talking to that are raising, closing multibillion dollar funds. So they are sitting on capital that's ready to deploy. They are not dependent in the same way that a public company is on the interest rate."
