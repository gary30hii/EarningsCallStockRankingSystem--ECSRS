Dheeraj? \nDheeraj Pandey: Thank you, Tonya, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. I appreciate you joining us today on such short notice. I realize that we had a scheduled call next week, but with all the news we had to share, we thought it best to connect with you as soon as possible.\n As I speak with you today, I'm filled with a deep sense of gratitude and fulfillment about the year and the decade at large. Earlier this afternoon, in addition to our earnings release, we issued a press release announcing a succession plan around my role, along with news of a significant investment in our business by Bain Capital Private Equity. Before we talk in detail about our results, I'd like to offer some perspective on these announcements.\n 2020 has been, for lack of a better word, an extraordinary year. For Nutanix, this has been a year marked by continued progress in our journey to become a pioneer in hybrid cloud infrastructure, a self-fulfilling prophecy for a market category best known as HCI. We've also shown deep resilience in a business and an expanded value that our services provide to customers in a rapidly changing and uncertain world. With a focus on innovation and collaboration, we've expanded our customer base, launched a suite in bare metal with AWS and successfully continued towards our transformation to a subscription-based business model. While our progress this year has not always come in a straight line due to the global pandemic, we're extremely humbled by the execution and effort put forth by our more than 6,000 employees around the world to deliver a strong performance in our fiscal fourth quarter.\n As the end of our fiscal year approached, I also had the opportunity to step back and consider all that we have achieved. When my cofounders and I started this company 11 years ago, Apple iOS, virtualization beyond test and development workloads and web scale infrastructure using commodity hardware were novel concepts in the enterprise. Thanks to the hard work of so many, both inside and outside the company, that vision to bring an Apple-like simplicity and consumer cloud-like scale to enterprise computing has become a reality. Nutanix has grown from a scrappy start-up to a company with $1.6 billion in annual software and support billings.\n With our strong fourth quarter financial results, our future-proof business model in subscription and a meaningful seeding of our hybrid cloud strategy, Nutanix is well positioned as a cloud software company in the era of invisible computing. In addition, the recent $750 million investment by Bain Capital ensures a strong financial foundation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities ahead. I'm confident, therefore, that there's no better time for a CEO succession plan than now to really shepherd this company through its next decade of growth and success.\n I'm proud of all that we've accomplished at Nutanix. It's really been a labor of love. At the same time, getting to this point has meant putting everything else in life on the back burner. In recent months through the lockdown that we've all experienced, I've had the time to reflect and had many conversations with my wife as well as my fellow Board members. And what I have come to conclude is that I need to spend more time with my family and allow myself the space and flexibility to read and write and learn new domains. It simply hasn't been possible while I have been devoted 110% to this company.\n That being said, I will continue to lead Nutanix while the Board conducts the search for our next CEO. We'll take the time to find the right leader with a strategic vision, a track record of customer success and all the personal qualities we value at Nutanix. Given our robust people foundation and very loyal customer base, we expect this succession plan to be a natural process of the company's evolution and therefore seamless for both Main Street and Wall Street. \n Among other things, a strong balance sheet also ensures that we can cast a wide-enough net to search for a CEO who can maximize long-term value. That is why I'm so excited to announce a meaningfully large $750 million investment from Bain Capital. This investment will provide us robustness to support and even accelerate our subscription transition, help us compete better and help us remain at the forefront of design and innovation in our industry. As part of this investment, David Humphrey and Max de Groen, Managing Directors of Bain, will join the Nutanix Board upon closing, and we look forward to this newly forged partnership.\n Founding Nutanix and being subservient to our customers from day one has been my passion and the highlight of my professional career, and I want to thank all the employees, past and present, for helping me bring this idea to life this last decade. I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to my wife and my fellow cofounders for giving me the courage to imagine and help create something out of nothing. As many of you know, Nutanix is coming second only to my family, and I'm extremely proud of what we have built with this monomaniacal focus on commodity-powered innovation, from consolidating proprietary hardware with one-click HCI to consolidating data centers with one-click private cloud to now consolidating a myriad cloud with one-click hybrid cloud.\n I was telling Max and Dave from Bain Capital these last several weeks of our financing discussions. We have a tremendous \"payload\" to deliver in the next 1 to 3 years, owing to both the subscription transition with its efficiency payoff and our product portfolio transition with its platform payoff. That payload over the next 1 to 3 years and Bain's extensive market due diligence is what drove their conviction for such a large investment. The new capital will give Nutanix the staying power to build on our success of hyperconverged infrastructure and extended to build a new HCI category, hybrid cloud infrastructure.\n As we reflect back on the year, our narrative has 3 distinct and recurring pillars: Growth, scale and cash. First, the global pandemic reaffirmed our premise that a lift and shift to cloud, both private and public, is more strategic than ever to businesses around the world. And this, in turn, will continue to drive growth for as long as we keep adding new customers to our flywheel. Second, our subscription transition at scale with our loyal customer base, as proven by our industry-leading customer retention, is helping us grow meaningfully, as evidenced in our run rate or book of business ACV. And finally, our execution on OpEx during COVID, both in marketing, sales and in overall expenses, has helped us with both operating margins and free cash flow. Between this OpEx discipline and the Bain investment, we feel very comfortable about cash for the future.\n Speaking of the quarter, Q4 ACV billings grew 13% year-over-year to $140 million. Non-GAAP gross margin reached an all-time high at 83%, up 3 points from a year ago. For fiscal 2020 on a year-over-year basis, ACV billings grew 18% to $505 million, run rate ACV or book of business grew 29% to $1.22 billion and deferred revenue grew 30% to $1.2 billion. This is a humbling and gratifying end to the fiscal year in a very difficult macro environment.\n In Q4, we also closed a record high of 68 deals worth over $1 million of TCV, up 19% year-over-year. 13 of these customers also spent at least $1 million with us last quarter. We now have a total number of 17,360 customers worldwide, 920 of which are Global 2000 customers. For Global 2000 customers who have been with us for at least 18 months, their repeat purchase multiple has expanded to nearly 14x. We also have 1,207 customers with a lifetime spend of at least $1 million, up from 921 a year ago.\n A highlight of the quarter, our largest deal with a subscription contract worth nearly $8 million with a global financial services organization headquartered in Australia. This organization selected Nutanix over the competition in their data center modernization journey off of legacy 3-tier hardware several years ago. They're now running all of their critical and client-facing apps on Nutanix HCI. They love us because of our reliability and ease of use and because our software helps them ensure regulatory compliance around disaster recovery.\n Another great example is a company selecting Nutanix for its strategic IT initiative is an existing public sector customer in EMEA. This local government district authority in the U.K., a long-time customer, purchased nearly $2 million of our software and services in Q4 to run all of their core applications and use our disaster recovery as a service, Xi Leap, to power their hybrid cloud infrastructure.\n Speaking of software and services, let me underscore our product portfolio and the role it continues to play in the infrastructure market. This month, Forrester once again recognized us as being a leader in the hyperconverged infrastructure wave, notably ahead of other players in the segment. Our customers vouch for us in such analyst research because we work the whole body of delivery, a reliable core product that is simple to use, a phenomenal customer service and an innovation engine that they can subscribe to as they consume a well-integrated platform.\n Because of this platform-driven, solutions-focused approach, we continue to see momentum behind adoption of our entire product portfolio in Q4. Specifically, DR-as-a-service, Leap; desktop-as-a-service, Frame; and database-as-a-service, Era products, all had record quarters. In fact, our attach rate for data center, DevOps and desktop services, i.e., products beyond the HCI core, increased to 33% in Q4 from 26% a year ago and now account for 15% of new ACV, up from 12% a year ago.\n A great example of a customer repurchasing solutions on top of our core software this quarter is a state and local government organization in the United States that selected $1.5 million of our software in Q4 in a deal that included our core software, our invisible hypervisor AHV as well as Frame, Files, Flow and Era. This customer has a lifetime spend with us of $12.5 million and has grown the Nutanix footprint from 3 nodes in 2014 to over 400 nodes.\n This quarter, we also reached significant milestones with our solutions, including our Xi Government Cloud solution achieving FedRAMP authorization, providing our customers with a uniform approach to risk-based security management. We announced new capability for Xi Frame, providing strength in security, increased flexibility and broader regional availability for our multi-cloud desktop service. We also launched new solutions that allow IT teams to deploy, upgrade and troubleshoot their cloud infrastructure while working from anywhere, whether at home or from a central office location. It's something that is even more important now. And finally, we announced a milestone for our Files solution, having reached 2,500 customers globally.\n During the quarter, we also reached a significant milestone in our journey to morph HCI from hyperconverged infrastructure to hybrid cloud infrastructure. A few weeks ago, we announced the general availability of Nutanix Clusters on AWS, which extends the simplicity and ease with use of our software to the public cloud. This is a significant step in realizing our vision to make computing invisible anywhere by delivering a singular experience across multiple clouds, public or private. This portability eliminates the complexity of multi-cloud environments with unified operations and seamless app mobility across locations, addressing the key technical and operational challenges of hybrid cloud computing. Nutanix Clusters' ease of use, license portability and networking and data locality architecture are its key differentiators. It allows organizations to build a hybrid cloud in under an hour, including disaster recovery sites, [ legacy ] applications and data-intensive workloads. This architecture and design simplicity make lift and shift of the enterprise's most mission-critical workloads, for example, databases, latency-sensitive applications and DR sites, imminently one-click. Nutanix Clusters provide customers with the flexibility to deploy any application in any cloud with the added benefit of license portability across public and private locations, which meaningfully protects our customers' investment in software infrastructure.\n Our subscription journey at scale is another important area that I'd like to highlight. In Q4, 88% of our billings were from term-based subscription contracts. Starting Q1 this new fiscal, we began to align our sales forces' incentives to ACV goals, similar to what we had done with TCV goals when we moved from hardware appliances to software. I'm very excited about the possibilities this new phase of our transition brings to our business model and our go-to-market efficiency. More on this from Duston later.\n Another factor that drove our results for the quarter and throughout the year was continued focus on all things digital to help our OpEx. Like many technology companies, our global employee base is still largely sheltered in place due to the pandemic. As I mentioned last quarter, we have moved the marketing and sales efforts to be predominantly digital. We doubled down on Test Drive, a seminal digital initiative within the company to enable our prospects to experience our entire solution portfolio with a zero-touch, self-service, Google Cloud-powered platform.\n The same low- to no-touch digital experience is showing in our ability to prospect and sell with virtual meetings throughout the world. The ability to pull off an entirely virtual mega marketing event will be put to test between September 8 through the 11 when we'll have the biggest customer event of the year, our .NEXT event. I encourage all of you to join us remotely. A link to register for free can be found in our earnings press release. .NEXT have been completely reinvented to provide an online interactive experience that includes the visionary keynotes our customers and partners have come to expect as well as hands-on technology sessions and the ability for attendees to interact and learn with us.\n Before I turn over to Duston, I'd like to say that it's been an honor to lead this insurgent company over the past decade. Our people have built a unique company that is obsessed with our customers and demonstrated that operating system software can be built from scratch even in the presence of large, well-funded incumbents. It's come to be known as one of the most customer-centric, design-oriented, empathy-driven cloud software companies in the world. I know that my legacy will continue as I pass the baton in the coming quarters. There's a mark of pride I feel in having led the team from $0 to $1.5-plus billion in annual billings in 10-plus years, and I'm very confident that we'll continue to build on this success this coming decade. With an envious customer loyalty scorecard, a delightful platform that will make hybrid clouds elegant and a strong balance sheet to fund our transition and navigate this upcoming economic recovery, Nutanix is a company to watch for this decade.\n Now I'd like to turn this over to Duston for him to elaborate on how we plan to cautiously navigate this ACV transition during a highly uncertain macro environment, albeit as a fully capitalized company for the future. Duston? \nDuston Williams: Thank you, Dheeraj.\n Despite Q4 being another quarter that was impacted by significant macro uncertainties, the Nutanix team delivered a very solid quarter that included all-time highs for ACV billings, gross margin, a number of $1 million deals, along with improved free cash flow usage related to a continued focus on operating expense controls. Although we did not provide guidance for Q4, all operating metrics significantly exceeded the current street consensus based on 18 sell-side analyst estimates.\n Almost all of the business is now subscription-based. Subscription billings now account for 88% of total billings, up from 84% in Q3; and subscription revenue now accounts for 87% of total revenue, up from 82% in Q3. On a billings basis, the average dollar-weighted term length in Q4 '20, including renewals, was 3.8 years, same as in Q3 '20 and down from 3.9 years in the same quarter a year ago.\n Now a few things on our ACV-based focus going forward. As we enter our new fiscal year, as we have previously communicated, we will fully shift our goals and objectives from a TCV-based focus to an ACV-based focus in order to reduce average contract durations across our book of business. Our experience over the last few years has clearly shown that reduced contract durations enable us to achieve more attractive customer economics and reduced discounting without materially harmful effects in terms of churn.\n As I'll discuss in more detail, there are some short-term trade-offs that we are going to have to make in order to achieve this ACV-based focus. But ultimately, we believe these will be justified in the long term in terms of growth and operating leverage. A few of the biggest changes associated with this ACV-based focus will be changing our top line guidance metrics from TCV to ACV billings; a renewed focus on run rate ACV, representing our total book of business; and moving to an ACV-based sales comp plan, reducing the incentive for our salespeople to sell long-term contracts that oftentimes come at the expense of higher discounts.\n We have spoken for quite some time that ACV billings as a metric is not impacted by change in term durations and therefore, along with run rate ACV, are the 2 most appropriate growth metrics to use to analyze the fundamental health of the business. Starting in Q1, we will only provide top line guidance based on ACV billed in the quarter. At some point in the future, it may be more appropriate to shift the focus of the guide to run rate ACV.\n For definitional purposes, run rate ACV, which would be analogous to ARR or annual recurring revenue metric if we were a completely ratable business, projects the book of business that would be realized in any upcoming 12-month period, assuming no new business, no upsell and no churn. In a subscription business with low churn like ours, run rate ACV is a book of business that grows with additional new business and compounds over time with strong upsell. Now that our subscription-related billings have become almost all of our billings, we will renew our focus on run rate ACV.\n The shift to ACV billings guidance is very analogous to when we shifted from guiding to total billings and total revenue to guiding to TCV billings and TCV revenue. Total revenue in billings lost significance and became excessively volatile as we were eliminating hardware from our revenue stream. Similarly, now TCV billings and TCV revenue have lost significance and become excessively volatile as we intentionally look to reduce term duration across our book of business. TCV is impacted by term compression. ACV is not. Therefore, ACV billings is the appropriate guidance metric going forward.\n And lastly, we are very excited about our move to ACV-based sales compensation. On August 1, the start of our new fiscal year, we officially moved to an ACV versus TCV-based sales compensation plan where sales commissions are now tied to ACV amounts regardless of the length of the initial deal. We believe this is a very important milestone for the company based on the following factors.\n ACV-based comp will enable the sales reps and the company to share similar objectives, maximizing ACV billings and minimizing discounts with no regard for contract duration. Under the prior TCV-based compensation plan, which was appropriate for our previous non-subscription business model, the company wanted to minimize discounting while the reps were focused on maximizing TCV billings, often through longer-term contract durations achieved through higher discounting and lower ACV billings. Going forward, under the ACV comp model, the reps will be incentivized to maximize ACV billings and minimize discounts, exactly what the company wants to do.\n The move to ACV-based sales comp should improve discounting as a result of better deal terms on shorter-term lengths, all of which maximizes ACV billings going forward. In addition, the gradual shift to shorter-term 1- and 3-year deals will also put us in a better position to reap the efficiency benefits from the lower sales costs associated with renewals. Since we pay more commission rate on renewals versus new ACV billings, we should benefit as a percentage of business coming from renewals increases significantly over time.\n And lastly, we believe the move to ACV-based sales comp will create a renewed focus on the sales of our new products. Many of our new products have shorter-term lengths, and we're naturally disadvantaged in an environment that favored maximizing TCV. In an ACV world, new products should become a sales rep's new best friend.\n There are clearly significant benefits associated with the shift to ACV-based comp plans and with our overall ACV focus. We believe that ACV billings growth will accelerate, discounting will improve and the efficiencies of renewals will happen sooner and more often, all eventually lead to increased sales and marketing leverage in the future. This is clearly the right business decision for the company.\n Now as I've previously communicated, this focus on ACV will compress deal terms over time. During this period of term compression, investors should expect and model for negative impacts to billings and revenue, operating profit and free cash flow in the short term with the benefit being maximizing ACV billings and strengthening the operating model in the future. From a modeling perspective, for every 1/10 of a year decrease in average term duration, you should expect about a $40 million annual decrease in billings and free cash flow in the year that follows.\n To help fund our move to an ACV-first-based focus as well as significantly bolstering our overall liquidity position, we are thrilled to welcome Bain Capital as a significant new investor. We have discussed this model shift to ACV with Bain in great detail, and they are fully supportive of this approach and are excited to help support us in this transition.\n Now a few specific Q4 financial highlights. ACV build in the quarter was $140 million, up 13% from the year ago quarter; run rate ACV as of July 31, 2020 was $1.22 billion, up 29% from the year ago quarter; TCV revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $326 million, up 14% from year ago quarter; and TCV billings were $387 million, up 8% from the year ago quarter.\n We added to backlog during the quarter. New customer bookings, which continue to be impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, represented 19% of TCV bookings in the quarter versus a similar amount in Q3 '20.\n TCV bookings from our international regions represented 48% of total bookings versus 45% in Q4 '19. It is important to note that the Americas region is now experiencing more negative impacts from COVID than our other regions. APAC and EMEA were hit hard by COVID earlier on and have progressed through the pandemic a bit quicker as of the end of July than what we are currently experiencing in the Americas region.\n Our non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 was 83%. Operating expenses were $346 million. The downward trend in expenses are a result of an ongoing hiring pause, reduced travel, 1 week of furlough as well as overall expense management. Our non-GAAP net loss was $79 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.39 per share.\n For fiscal 2020, on a year-over-year basis, ACV billings were $505 million, up 18%; TCV billings were $1.56 billion, up 10%; and TCV revenue was $1.28 billion, up 14%.\n A few balance sheet highlights. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $720 million versus $732 million in Q3 '20, DSOs in Q4 were 67 days versus 67 days in Q3 '20 and free cash flow during the quarter was negative $14 million. This performance was positively impacted by $10 million of ESPP inflow in the quarter.\n Now turning to our Q1 '21 guidance. It is important to note that our Q1 guidance, like many companies, is clearly impacted by the uncertain macro environment due to the ongoing pandemic. Additionally, this is our first quarter operating under ACV-based sales compensation and ACV-based sales quotas. It is also the first quarter that our sales personnel have provided their outlook on an ACV basis versus a TCV basis, which are 2 fundamentally different processes. Therefore, there are some sources of conservativeness built into our ACV billings guidance for the quarter.\n The specific guidance for Q1 is as follows: ACV billings to be between $118 million and $121 million, gross margin of approximately 81%, operating expenses between $350 million and $360 million and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 204 million. The ACV billings guidance shown above, when converted to total billings and combined with the gross margin and operating expense guidance, should result in an operating loss, which is meaningfully lower, i.e., better, than the current street consensus estimates of $125 million.\n Additionally, as mentioned previously, the run rate ACV grew 29% year-over-year in Q4 '20. We would expect run rate ACV to grow in excess of 20% year-over-year in Q1 '21. Due to the uncertain macro environment, we will not provide annual guidance at this time.\n And lastly, to help you with your modeling efforts, included in our earnings presentation on our IR website are historical trends for ACV build in the quarter, run rate ACV, billings term length and a bridge on how to model and convert our current and future ACV billings guidance to total billings.\n With that, operator, you can now open the call up for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jack Andrews with Needham. \nJon Andrews: Great. Congratulations on all the news today.\n I wanted to zero in on the opportunity around Xi Clusters on AWS, if I could. Just maybe a 2-part question around that. First, is this a move towards more of an elastic consumption model, perhaps for more of your offerings over time? And secondly, could you discuss what types of workloads you're targeting with this? Would this be Tier 1 workloads or perhaps things that are more ephemeral in nature? \nDheeraj Pandey: Great question. Yes. So on the first one, the idea is to really make our licenses portable. Just like we did on-prem, we said we could move licenses from one server to another, one hypervisor to another, so it could be cross-platform. And we're trying to apply the same concepts between on-prem and off-prem. So people can build like DR sites in less than an hour, can spill over the desktops, burst over their desktops into the other side.\n And it's not a separate silo of a spend. If they have gone from licenses that are, let's say, a year or 2 or 3 years, and they still have some terms left in that, they can just take that over to the public cloud as well. So that's very unique about the concept of portable licensing, which we think is one of the biggest differentiators of what we think hybrid cloud should be.\n And to your second question, we are really focused on enterprise-grade workloads, low latency, IO-intensive, things that IT ops have built over time in the last 10, 15, 20 years that shouldn't really be refactored or rewritten. Go back 15 years, the very value of virtualization was no change to the app, no change to the operating system. And that's what really made virtualization so successful. We want to be able to do the exact same thing, no change to the app, no change to the operating system. And many of these were really low-latency, very high IO-intensive workloads. \nJon Andrews: Great. Really appreciate the clarity around that. Just as a quick follow-up. Can I ask if there's any update you could share regarding the progression of your partnership with HP? \nDheeraj Pandey: Yes, quite a bit. I mean, last year, 1.5 years, I think we've done a really good job with them. There is a lot of progress that we have made in terms of diversifying our platform, not just Supermicro and Dell and Lenovo, but also HPE. And I think in the last 3 months, we've been really going deeper on the GreenLake side where we would use the GreenLake offering for our disaster recovery as a service as well, which is our Leap offering.\n So I think all in all, everything looking really good with them, quality of them. And equally with Dell, actually, I think what we're doing with them on the OEM side have been very future-proof and future-looking. And finally, Lenovo has done a tremendous job with VDI and the desktop offering as well. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SFG. \nNicholas Ghattas: This is Nick on for Mehdi. So just looking at the industry over the last quarter, I'm curious to hear about how conversations with customers focused in terms of thinking about business continuity issues versus the long-term digital transformation. I assume that business continuity continues to be a much more urgent topic of conversation, but also curious to see whether conversations have shifted to more long-term transition. And I have a follow-up. \nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. If I were to understand your question correctly, business continuity is the end. Digital transformation is the means to that end, like disaster recovery. If you can quickly spin it up in, let's say, AWS, now you don't need to really own a site on the other side, which is hardware, facility floor, all that stuff that people used to have, which was underutilized. Now if you want to just spin up a DR site, you can do this in AWS. And it's highly unpredictable workload. So why would you actually own that if you could rent it? So there's some great use cases to emerge from what we're doing with hybrid cloud infrastructure, the new HCI. And business continuity of end users is around desktops. Desktop-as-a-service is a huge promise over the next 3 to 5 years.\n And enterprises woke up. They were not well-prepared for business continuity of the digital workload. There's business continuity issues on the factory side, too. I mean, there's a ton of work that we're doing with so many companies at the edge with SAP HANA and Rockwell, Honeywell, all sorts of Siemens, many different kinds of application and without doing the edge as well. We're really trying to make a cloud-in-a-box possible with zero intervention, hands-free IT, everything being done centrally. And most importantly, if there's a thing to stream to a public cloud, like, for example, disaster recovery sites, you can do that as well. \nNicholas Ghattas: Right. Maybe just to rephrase the question or to shift a little bit. Last quarter, VDI utilization made up about 27% of bookings. And obviously, due to the pandemic and everyone shifting to work-from-home, your set of solutions catering to work-from-home has become a lot more necessary for business continuity. Maybe an update on VDI and what business continuity looks like in the -- in terms of work-from-home and from COVID. \nDheeraj Pandey: Yes, absolutely. I think as I mentioned in the latter half of my answer, desktop-as-a-service is a big deal. Virtual desktop infrastructure, what we're doing with Citrix as well, I think has become very important because people just want to plug and play and burst out their existing seats. I mean, the enterprise is only 30% penetrated before COVID when it came to virtual desktops. Virtual desktop before COVID used to be 18%, 19% of our business. Between last quarter and this, it's between 23% and 27% of our business. So it's definitely grown, and we feel like that's a great workload to go after, especially with new customers. Even in the commercial space, we are looking for business continuity as a competitive advantage. \nNicholas Ghattas: Okay. Just to clarify, that is 23% of bookings in the quarter? \nDheeraj Pandey: Duston, can you please confirm? \nDuston Williams: Yes. Yes, 23%. Historically, it's run 18% to 22%. Last quarter, 27%. So it's come down a little bit, but within kind of historical ranges. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. \nRajagopal Kamesh: This is RK on behalf of Rod. Nice job on the results. And Dheeraj, congrats on building the company to relevance over the years.\n I wanted to ask about the Bain Capital investment. Could you talk about why now and why structure it in this particular way? \nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. First of all, great question. The way we look at it is that this ACV transition is a pretty big deal for the company in the next 2 years. And we definitely need to look at what does it mean to not borrow money from the customer, which is what long-term contracts, collecting all that sort from the customers upfront would mean. And also, at the same time, see if we could switch the renewals sooner because renewal's cost of sales is much, much lower. So we were going after the ACV transition. We were going after shortening term lengths. We would have collected less from our customers. And we needed to raise capital just for that alone.\n So with that, I would also like Duston to probably add some more to this, and we'll come back to the question of why it's structured like this. \nDuston Williams: Yes. So I've been very vocal over the last, I think, couple of months as far as the power of this ACV focus and what it's going to do to cash and things like that and that we highly likely go in some type of financing vehicle in the next several months or somewhere around there. So that's exactly what we've done.\n And we had effectively 2 choices here. The conventional route would have been a convertible -- public convertible in the market today. And we could have done that very quickly and raised a lot of money, but from our perspective, that would have been a bunch of effectively faceless investors that bought at instruments, but we really didn't have any contact or interaction with. And going through this type of transition, I just think having somebody like Bain Capital involved in this, that obviously has been through an immense amount of detail of our business model, they understand the power of the model that we've done for subscription, the $2.2 billion that we've sold in subscriptions over the last 2 years that basically hasn't renewed yet and what that business model looks like and the power of the efficiencies and things like that. And so now we have a partner that's going to help us through this transition and help us think through the transition and play that role. And I think we're very fortunate to have somebody step up with $750 million, putting their name down and believing in what we've done from a product perspective and what the business model can do.\n Now one of the obvious questions is, \"This is so expensive, right? Why didn't you just do the public convert?\" And the reality is that the $27.75 conversion rate, compared to a competitive public convertible with 100% call spread, so double the premium, this transaction at $27.75 is roughly 3.5%, 4% more dilutive. And I think what we're getting with this investment, the folks at Bain Capital, which have come up on our model very quickly, they understand it inside and out, I think when it's all done, we'll be happy, very happy to take that additional dilution. And don't forget, they don't make money unless the stock goes up, and so we're all in this together. And I think, again, we're just fortunate to have the partnership. \nDheeraj Pandey: And I think the only last thing I'll add to this is that it also provides a great platform for searching for a great talent, great CEO, great leader for this company going forward. \nRajagopal Kamesh: That's very helpful color. And as a follow-up, Duston, I wanted to ask about ACV. I mean, it makes a lot of sense that you announced switching your focus to ACV. But just from a guidance point of view, could you give us some color on the term length so that we could use that to get into revenues for our models? And then along with that, could you also talk about -- could you give an update on what's the difference in margin structure for a new sale versus an upsell or a renewal contract? \nDuston Williams: Yes. So on the modeling question, I would -- I think it's actually Slide 11 in our earnings investor deck. I would highly suggest that you go take a look at that, all investors take a look at that. We've done kind of a onetime example that we've kind of opened up exactly with the terms, and we bucket it by TCV dollars and how do you go from TCV to ACV. All the terms are there, 1 year or less, through 7 years, the conversion ratio. So it gives you a great starting point now that you can aid -- not only understand the current quarter, but now you can kind of play with those buckets of terms and say, \"Jeez, how -- what do I think terms are going to go down? What's going to be the impact of TCV?\" and things like that. So I think that will be very, very helpful. So I think it's Page 11. It's 11 or 12 or something.\n On the cost, I think the real question is what's the cost of a renewal. And again, today, we don't have much because we've had 4-year terms, as you'll see in that slide deck. We do, do 1-year terms. So the $2.2 billion that we've sold over the last 2 years has effectively not renewed. And so the question there is what does that renew at? What's the cost factor that renews at? And we believe -- and we need to work through this a little bit, and Chris is setting up a small structure of internal folks to go help sales reps and whatever look at this -- it should be 85%, 90% more efficient certainly than new business. And don't forget today, so vast majority of our business since day 1 has always been new and upsell. And new and upsell, it's high cost and it's high risk. And over time, as these renewals start flowing in, the dependency on growth goes from that high-risk, high-cost new and upsell to low-risk, low-cost renewals. And that's the whole thesis here that we've been talking about, and those should come in at a pretty good efficiency factor. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. \nSimon Leopold: Great. You talked a little bit about the Bain deal so far, but I wanted to see if maybe you could dig into some of the history of this arrangement. Did you approach them? Or did they approach you? And maybe some of the background or backstory of what led up to this particular arrangement other than your respect for them as a private equity firm. \nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. I can take this, and Duston, you should please take it from me as well. So Duston and I talked about this -- started talking about this publicly, probably a quarter or 2 ago, about how we'd go and raise some money and we need to do this because we have to fund the transition. We are kind of 2/3 of the way, but we still have another 1/3 to go with the sales comp chain itself, and shortening terms is an important piece of that.\n So as part of that -- and we know people know the value of Bain Capital, too, because they're a full-service organization, from venture capital and COA to all the way to private equity. And we felt comfortable when they reached out. Hey, they understand growth just as much. Max and Dave are phenomenal people. The more we got to know them, the more we gained their respect, that they're going to look at the thesis, and they embraced this quickly that we're going to take this from hyperconverged infrastructure to hybrid cloud infrastructure. I think there was a meeting of the minds that happened over a matter of 2 months of just back and forth in Zoom. And obviously, we never shook hands ever. We haven't met in person, but what has come about virtually in this last 2 months has just been phenomenal.\n So we look forward to them as they look at their own spectrum of investment, all the way from COA investments and the value. Enrique is somebody that I've known for a while. So I have a ton of respect for Enrique. But meeting Max and Dave recently has just given me another level of expect for that firm as well. \nSimon Leopold: And just as a follow-up, perhaps if you could talk to how the sales force compensation, I understand it's changed. But as a salesperson, are they now making more money, making less money? Trying to get an appreciation for how your sales force is reacting to this change. \nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. I think -- sorry, go ahead. Yes, please. Go ahead now. \nDuston Williams: Yes. You can chime in, too. Sorry. Effectively, they make the same more -- they'll make more if they sell more, obviously. But I mean, right out of the chute, we've just converted as far as what they've been doing on TCV terms and converting that to ACV. So the objective there was to keep everybody whole with this conversion from TCV to ACV.\n Now again, on the renewal flow, those will be comped at 90% more efficient than the initial transaction from a commission perspective, but it was set up so there would be no penalty from a comp perspective just because of this change. And I think there's probably more upside certainly than there is downside because now they've got more tools to play with. And again, a rep should be completely indifferent from selling a 1-year deal now as opposed to what they were trying to do to sell maximum TCV and term lengths. So now they can focus on 1-year deals if they want, they've got a good 3-year deal, et cetera. So I think there's a bunch more flexibility there from a selling approach.\n Dheeraj, maybe you want to add something? \nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. Yes, I mean, I guess we've gone through this when we went from hardware to software almost 2.5, 3 years ago when the sales comp changed. And if anything, the other thing is that the market force is upon us. People have stopped doing 5-year cloud deals. Most good cloud deals are 3-year deals. So they are seeing this from their customers as well. So I think we couldn't have had this artificial thing about go sell -- take TCV for 5 years or 7 years if the market is moving to 3 years. \nDuston Williams: And just one follow-up on the Bain question, stuff like that. I just want to make sure there's a clear understanding here. This is not a cost-cutting exercise. This is how do we partner up and scale the business in an efficient manner. That's what it is. It's not a cost-cutting. We'll keep the same focus on products and the customers and partners and things like that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. \nDan Bergstrom: Yes. This is Dan Bergstrom in for Matt Hedberg. You touched a little bit on this in the prepared remarks with the Americas lagging. But anything to note from a geography, customer size, vertical perspective as states and countries go through their various stages of lockdown and reopenings here? \nDuston Williams: You want to take that, Dheeraj? \nDheeraj Pandey: Yes, Duston. Go ahead, and I'll chime in later. \nDuston Williams: Yes. So Americas is just -- as you -- as we all know here, it's a tough environment. And APAC was kind of first to go through this, and things have gotten certainly better there. There's some interesting potential deals brewing in APAC. We'll have to see how that goes. EMEA had a good quarter for us. Americas is doing fine, but again, it's mostly certainly around new customers. It's very difficult because, again, on existing customers, they know the product. They usually love the product. You've got established relationships. So that, in a virtual environment, is much easier than trying to establish relationships and knocking down new business.\n So -- and probably some of the bigger deals, maybe they get cut down a little bit and things like that, but Americas is still a little tough, I think. From what you see now, it looks like cases are starting to come down and things like that, and people are getting a little smarter. So I think that opens up eventually here. But it's 60%, 65% of our business in a given quarter, so that puts a little constraint on things. But the product is doing well. It's not a product thing. It's not a sales execution thing at all. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. \nJason Ader: Yes. And Dheeraj, I'm sure this is bittersweet for you. I know you've always said you'd walk away at the right time. So kudos to you for keeping your word, and you should be proud of what you've built. \nDheeraj Pandey: Thank you. Thank you, Jason. I remember this question coming from you almost a year ago, and I'd given you some answer there. Thank you. Thank you for the praise, Jason. \nJason Ader: Yes. You kept your word. Duston, some fun guidance questions for you. Number one, will you be providing revenue guidance or just ACV billings? \nDuston Williams: Just ACV billings because, again, revenue, you want to call it billings revenue, whatever you want to call it, it depends on terms, right? And ACV, again, doesn't care about terms. That we can go figure out easily, but I can't -- I put it in the remarks there, I just can't tell you if terms are going to come down 2/10 this quarter, are they going to go up 1/10 or whatever. They're going to go down over time. I guarantee you that, but I can't give you an exact precision. I think, at some point, what we owe investors is a little bit longer-term view of what we believe terms will do when that flushes and when it comes back and then the renewal flows and things like that because it's a very powerful story. It really is. So we need to think through that at some point in time, but now we're just going to stick. And again, I've shown you on that -- in the earnings deck there how it works, and I think you guys can put a model together pretty easily. \nJason Ader: So the 3.8, as where it is today, do you think that gets down to like, what, 3? I mean, like by the end of fiscal '21, can you give us some ballpark? \nDuston Williams: Personally, we'll see because we're only 1 month into the comp here. But I think the important thing to understand here, and I'll round maybe by the 10th or so, but effectively, new customers and existing customers in aggregate have about the same term structure, okay? So that's one data point.\n And the other data point is, as you know, existing customers make up, call it, 80% of the total business. New customers make up 20% of the total business. So I can see -- and we've done this in a matrix. I can see the new customer, potentially, those terms coming down faster than the 80% of an existing customer because, again, from an existing customer perspective, we can't go to an existing customer and say, \"Hey, would you like to do a 3-year term for the same price?\" It doesn't work that way. So we have to go have a discussion with the reps, \"Jeez, maybe you want to do 3-year deals. Maybe you'd want to commit to 5 years. Maybe you'd only want it to take it for 3 years instead of 5 years and make that commitment. But oh, by the way, with that 3-year term comes an uplift or uplift in your price and reduced discounting.\" So I don't -- I think there's some natural governor there because of that structure.\n But again, we're 1 month into this. I do think, and we'll have to see how this plays out, newer products, whether it's Era, Flow, Calm, whatever, Files, tendency to have shorter terms. So can that drag terms down a little bit, the new product? I don't know. But I would be personally very surprised if they ended at 3 by the end of the year. \nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. I just want to say that... \nJason Ader: Yes. Sorry, Dheeraj. After you. \nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. I think definitely, it's not going to come to 3 years, as Duston said. There's enough push and pull from the market forces, too. I mean, there's large customers who have a CapEx appetite. They want to flush their budgets to the end of the year or infrastructure is probably the first layer of software above hardware. They want to sweat it out a little bit. So I think there's going to be a yin yang here where we believe that it won't really just go rock-bottom with 3 years, something right away. Gradually, this is going to happen. I think this is true for hardware to software. It's going to be true for -- went from 5 years to 3 years as well. And none of our salespeople want to just go do negotiation every year with a longer contract. It's just horrible for them. I think they need a lot more of that trust commitment from our customers, which is why the cloud has landed at 3-year commits as opposed to monthly billing and 1 year kind of stocking. \nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital. \nAlexander Kurtz: And likewise, to what Jason just said, Dheeraj, it's been quite a run. I remember when I first met with you in your original office and literally busted into the room, it's been quite an accomplishment. And I'm sure we'll talk more as the months go on here.\n Duston, yes, Duston, just on the dollar-based expansion rate that we see in the slide deck here, how much is that -- the 133% to the 125% move has to do with the current macro? Are there other factors here which you're thinking about? And then I have another follow-up question. \nDuston Williams: No. I mean, it's -- I don't think many companies are even at 125%. That's the first thing. So 125% is really, really good. And there's no really other factors in there. Our churn, the way we calculate churn now with kind of a hybrid ACV subscription base, it's 96% or so and things like that. So there's nothing else significantly going on in there. \nAlexander Kurtz: Okay. So just the prior year as a whole, but I mean, yes, 125% is a great number. So the prior year is elevated for whatever reason. \nDuston Williams: Yes, yes, yes. \nAlexander Kurtz: You mentioned the $0.1 million to $40 million conversion, right, on the billings hit from the reduction in duration. Is that -- can I back into that somewhere in the deck that you provided? Or what are the underlying assumptions on that? There's a little more... \nDuston Williams: Yes. It's pretty easy. It's just in the following year. So that would be the full year impact. I can bring you through the math. It's relatively simple from that perspective. You got a top line and just play with the terms and things like that. So I think once you set up that model, based on our structure, it becomes crazy, but I'll be glad to spend some more time with you. \nOperator: Management, we'd like to thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dheeraj Pandey",
            "content": "Thank you, Tonya, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. I appreciate you joining us today on such short notice. I realize that we had a scheduled call next week, but with all the news we had to share, we thought it best to connect with you as soon as possible.\n As I speak with you today, I'm filled with a deep sense of gratitude and fulfillment about the year and the decade at large. Earlier this afternoon, in addition to our earnings release, we issued a press release announcing a succession plan around my role, along with news of a significant investment in our business by Bain Capital Private Equity. Before we talk in detail about our results, I'd like to offer some perspective on these announcements.\n 2020 has been, for lack of a better word, an extraordinary year. For Nutanix, this has been a year marked by continued progress in our journey to become a pioneer in hybrid cloud infrastructure, a self-fulfilling prophecy for a market category best known as HCI. We've also shown deep resilience in a business and an expanded value that our services provide to customers in a rapidly changing and uncertain world. With a focus on innovation and collaboration, we've expanded our customer base, launched a suite in bare metal with AWS and successfully continued towards our transformation to a subscription-based business model. While our progress this year has not always come in a straight line due to the global pandemic, we're extremely humbled by the execution and effort put forth by our more than 6,000 employees around the world to deliver a strong performance in our fiscal fourth quarter.\n As the end of our fiscal year approached, I also had the opportunity to step back and consider all that we have achieved. When my cofounders and I started this company 11 years ago, Apple iOS, virtualization beyond test and development workloads and web scale infrastructure using commodity hardware were novel concepts in the enterprise. Thanks to the hard work of so many, both inside and outside the company, that vision to bring an Apple-like simplicity and consumer cloud-like scale to enterprise computing has become a reality. Nutanix has grown from a scrappy start-up to a company with $1.6 billion in annual software and support billings.\n With our strong fourth quarter financial results, our future-proof business model in subscription and a meaningful seeding of our hybrid cloud strategy, Nutanix is well positioned as a cloud software company in the era of invisible computing. In addition, the recent $750 million investment by Bain Capital ensures a strong financial foundation to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities ahead. I'm confident, therefore, that there's no better time for a CEO succession plan than now to really shepherd this company through its next decade of growth and success.\n I'm proud of all that we've accomplished at Nutanix. It's really been a labor of love. At the same time, getting to this point has meant putting everything else in life on the back burner. In recent months through the lockdown that we've all experienced, I've had the time to reflect and had many conversations with my wife as well as my fellow Board members. And what I have come to conclude is that I need to spend more time with my family and allow myself the space and flexibility to read and write and learn new domains. It simply hasn't been possible while I have been devoted 110% to this company.\n That being said, I will continue to lead Nutanix while the Board conducts the search for our next CEO. We'll take the time to find the right leader with a strategic vision, a track record of customer success and all the personal qualities we value at Nutanix. Given our robust people foundation and very loyal customer base, we expect this succession plan to be a natural process of the company's evolution and therefore seamless for both Main Street and Wall Street. \n Among other things, a strong balance sheet also ensures that we can cast a wide-enough net to search for a CEO who can maximize long-term value. That is why I'm so excited to announce a meaningfully large $750 million investment from Bain Capital. This investment will provide us robustness to support and even accelerate our subscription transition, help us compete better and help us remain at the forefront of design and innovation in our industry. As part of this investment, David Humphrey and Max de Groen, Managing Directors of Bain, will join the Nutanix Board upon closing, and we look forward to this newly forged partnership.\n Founding Nutanix and being subservient to our customers from day one has been my passion and the highlight of my professional career, and I want to thank all the employees, past and present, for helping me bring this idea to life this last decade. I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to my wife and my fellow cofounders for giving me the courage to imagine and help create something out of nothing. As many of you know, Nutanix is coming second only to my family, and I'm extremely proud of what we have built with this monomaniacal focus on commodity-powered innovation, from consolidating proprietary hardware with one-click HCI to consolidating data centers with one-click private cloud to now consolidating a myriad cloud with one-click hybrid cloud.\n I was telling Max and Dave from Bain Capital these last several weeks of our financing discussions. We have a tremendous \"payload\" to deliver in the next 1 to 3 years, owing to both the subscription transition with its efficiency payoff and our product portfolio transition with its platform payoff. That payload over the next 1 to 3 years and Bain's extensive market due diligence is what drove their conviction for such a large investment. The new capital will give Nutanix the staying power to build on our success of hyperconverged infrastructure and extended to build a new HCI category, hybrid cloud infrastructure.\n As we reflect back on the year, our narrative has 3 distinct and recurring pillars: Growth, scale and cash. First, the global pandemic reaffirmed our premise that a lift and shift to cloud, both private and public, is more strategic than ever to businesses around the world. And this, in turn, will continue to drive growth for as long as we keep adding new customers to our flywheel. Second, our subscription transition at scale with our loyal customer base, as proven by our industry-leading customer retention, is helping us grow meaningfully, as evidenced in our run rate or book of business ACV. And finally, our execution on OpEx during COVID, both in marketing, sales and in overall expenses, has helped us with both operating margins and free cash flow. Between this OpEx discipline and the Bain investment, we feel very comfortable about cash for the future.\n Speaking of the quarter, Q4 ACV billings grew 13% year-over-year to $140 million. Non-GAAP gross margin reached an all-time high at 83%, up 3 points from a year ago. For fiscal 2020 on a year-over-year basis, ACV billings grew 18% to $505 million, run rate ACV or book of business grew 29% to $1.22 billion and deferred revenue grew 30% to $1.2 billion. This is a humbling and gratifying end to the fiscal year in a very difficult macro environment.\n In Q4, we also closed a record high of 68 deals worth over $1 million of TCV, up 19% year-over-year. 13 of these customers also spent at least $1 million with us last quarter. We now have a total number of 17,360 customers worldwide, 920 of which are Global 2000 customers. For Global 2000 customers who have been with us for at least 18 months, their repeat purchase multiple has expanded to nearly 14x. We also have 1,207 customers with a lifetime spend of at least $1 million, up from 921 a year ago.\n A highlight of the quarter, our largest deal with a subscription contract worth nearly $8 million with a global financial services organization headquartered in Australia. This organization selected Nutanix over the competition in their data center modernization journey off of legacy 3-tier hardware several years ago. They're now running all of their critical and client-facing apps on Nutanix HCI. They love us because of our reliability and ease of use and because our software helps them ensure regulatory compliance around disaster recovery.\n Another great example is a company selecting Nutanix for its strategic IT initiative is an existing public sector customer in EMEA. This local government district authority in the U.K., a long-time customer, purchased nearly $2 million of our software and services in Q4 to run all of their core applications and use our disaster recovery as a service, Xi Leap, to power their hybrid cloud infrastructure.\n Speaking of software and services, let me underscore our product portfolio and the role it continues to play in the infrastructure market. This month, Forrester once again recognized us as being a leader in the hyperconverged infrastructure wave, notably ahead of other players in the segment. Our customers vouch for us in such analyst research because we work the whole body of delivery, a reliable core product that is simple to use, a phenomenal customer service and an innovation engine that they can subscribe to as they consume a well-integrated platform.\n Because of this platform-driven, solutions-focused approach, we continue to see momentum behind adoption of our entire product portfolio in Q4. Specifically, DR-as-a-service, Leap; desktop-as-a-service, Frame; and database-as-a-service, Era products, all had record quarters. In fact, our attach rate for data center, DevOps and desktop services, i.e., products beyond the HCI core, increased to 33% in Q4 from 26% a year ago and now account for 15% of new ACV, up from 12% a year ago.\n A great example of a customer repurchasing solutions on top of our core software this quarter is a state and local government organization in the United States that selected $1.5 million of our software in Q4 in a deal that included our core software, our invisible hypervisor AHV as well as Frame, Files, Flow and Era. This customer has a lifetime spend with us of $12.5 million and has grown the Nutanix footprint from 3 nodes in 2014 to over 400 nodes.\n This quarter, we also reached significant milestones with our solutions, including our Xi Government Cloud solution achieving FedRAMP authorization, providing our customers with a uniform approach to risk-based security management. We announced new capability for Xi Frame, providing strength in security, increased flexibility and broader regional availability for our multi-cloud desktop service. We also launched new solutions that allow IT teams to deploy, upgrade and troubleshoot their cloud infrastructure while working from anywhere, whether at home or from a central office location. It's something that is even more important now. And finally, we announced a milestone for our Files solution, having reached 2,500 customers globally.\n During the quarter, we also reached a significant milestone in our journey to morph HCI from hyperconverged infrastructure to hybrid cloud infrastructure. A few weeks ago, we announced the general availability of Nutanix Clusters on AWS, which extends the simplicity and ease with use of our software to the public cloud. This is a significant step in realizing our vision to make computing invisible anywhere by delivering a singular experience across multiple clouds, public or private. This portability eliminates the complexity of multi-cloud environments with unified operations and seamless app mobility across locations, addressing the key technical and operational challenges of hybrid cloud computing. Nutanix Clusters' ease of use, license portability and networking and data locality architecture are its key differentiators. It allows organizations to build a hybrid cloud in under an hour, including disaster recovery sites, [ legacy ] applications and data-intensive workloads. This architecture and design simplicity make lift and shift of the enterprise's most mission-critical workloads, for example, databases, latency-sensitive applications and DR sites, imminently one-click. Nutanix Clusters provide customers with the flexibility to deploy any application in any cloud with the added benefit of license portability across public and private locations, which meaningfully protects our customers' investment in software infrastructure.\n Our subscription journey at scale is another important area that I'd like to highlight. In Q4, 88% of our billings were from term-based subscription contracts. Starting Q1 this new fiscal, we began to align our sales forces' incentives to ACV goals, similar to what we had done with TCV goals when we moved from hardware appliances to software. I'm very excited about the possibilities this new phase of our transition brings to our business model and our go-to-market efficiency. More on this from Duston later.\n Another factor that drove our results for the quarter and throughout the year was continued focus on all things digital to help our OpEx. Like many technology companies, our global employee base is still largely sheltered in place due to the pandemic. As I mentioned last quarter, we have moved the marketing and sales efforts to be predominantly digital. We doubled down on Test Drive, a seminal digital initiative within the company to enable our prospects to experience our entire solution portfolio with a zero-touch, self-service, Google Cloud-powered platform.\n The same low- to no-touch digital experience is showing in our ability to prospect and sell with virtual meetings throughout the world. The ability to pull off an entirely virtual mega marketing event will be put to test between September 8 through the 11 when we'll have the biggest customer event of the year, our .NEXT event. I encourage all of you to join us remotely. A link to register for free can be found in our earnings press release. .NEXT have been completely reinvented to provide an online interactive experience that includes the visionary keynotes our customers and partners have come to expect as well as hands-on technology sessions and the ability for attendees to interact and learn with us.\n Before I turn over to Duston, I'd like to say that it's been an honor to lead this insurgent company over the past decade. Our people have built a unique company that is obsessed with our customers and demonstrated that operating system software can be built from scratch even in the presence of large, well-funded incumbents. It's come to be known as one of the most customer-centric, design-oriented, empathy-driven cloud software companies in the world. I know that my legacy will continue as I pass the baton in the coming quarters. There's a mark of pride I feel in having led the team from $0 to $1.5-plus billion in annual billings in 10-plus years, and I'm very confident that we'll continue to build on this success this coming decade. With an envious customer loyalty scorecard, a delightful platform that will make hybrid clouds elegant and a strong balance sheet to fund our transition and navigate this upcoming economic recovery, Nutanix is a company to watch for this decade.\n Now I'd like to turn this over to Duston for him to elaborate on how we plan to cautiously navigate this ACV transition during a highly uncertain macro environment, albeit as a fully capitalized company for the future. Duston? Great question. Yes. So on the first one, the idea is to really make our licenses portable. Just like we did on-prem, we said we could move licenses from one server to another, one hypervisor to another, so it could be cross-platform. And we're trying to apply the same concepts between on-prem and off-prem. So people can build like DR sites in less than an hour, can spill over the desktops, burst over their desktops into the other side.\n And it's not a separate silo of a spend. If they have gone from licenses that are, let's say, a year or 2 or 3 years, and they still have some terms left in that, they can just take that over to the public cloud as well. So that's very unique about the concept of portable licensing, which we think is one of the biggest differentiators of what we think hybrid cloud should be.\n And to your second question, we are really focused on enterprise-grade workloads, low latency, IO-intensive, things that IT ops have built over time in the last 10, 15, 20 years that shouldn't really be refactored or rewritten. Go back 15 years, the very value of virtualization was no change to the app, no change to the operating system. And that's what really made virtualization so successful. We want to be able to do the exact same thing, no change to the app, no change to the operating system. And many of these were really low-latency, very high IO-intensive workloads. Yes, quite a bit. I mean, last year, 1.5 years, I think we've done a really good job with them. There is a lot of progress that we have made in terms of diversifying our platform, not just Supermicro and Dell and Lenovo, but also HPE. And I think in the last 3 months, we've been really going deeper on the GreenLake side where we would use the GreenLake offering for our disaster recovery as a service as well, which is our Leap offering.\n So I think all in all, everything looking really good with them, quality of them. And equally with Dell, actually, I think what we're doing with them on the OEM side have been very future-proof and future-looking. And finally, Lenovo has done a tremendous job with VDI and the desktop offering as well. Yes. If I were to understand your question correctly, business continuity is the end. Digital transformation is the means to that end, like disaster recovery. If you can quickly spin it up in, let's say, AWS, now you don't need to really own a site on the other side, which is hardware, facility floor, all that stuff that people used to have, which was underutilized. Now if you want to just spin up a DR site, you can do this in AWS. And it's highly unpredictable workload. So why would you actually own that if you could rent it? So there's some great use cases to emerge from what we're doing with hybrid cloud infrastructure, the new HCI. And business continuity of end users is around desktops. Desktop-as-a-service is a huge promise over the next 3 to 5 years.\n And enterprises woke up. They were not well-prepared for business continuity of the digital workload. There's business continuity issues on the factory side, too. I mean, there's a ton of work that we're doing with so many companies at the edge with SAP HANA and Rockwell, Honeywell, all sorts of Siemens, many different kinds of application and without doing the edge as well. We're really trying to make a cloud-in-a-box possible with zero intervention, hands-free IT, everything being done centrally. And most importantly, if there's a thing to stream to a public cloud, like, for example, disaster recovery sites, you can do that as well. Yes, absolutely. I think as I mentioned in the latter half of my answer, desktop-as-a-service is a big deal. Virtual desktop infrastructure, what we're doing with Citrix as well, I think has become very important because people just want to plug and play and burst out their existing seats. I mean, the enterprise is only 30% penetrated before COVID when it came to virtual desktops. Virtual desktop before COVID used to be 18%, 19% of our business. Between last quarter and this, it's between 23% and 27% of our business. So it's definitely grown, and we feel like that's a great workload to go after, especially with new customers. Even in the commercial space, we are looking for business continuity as a competitive advantage. Duston, can you please confirm? Yes. First of all, great question. The way we look at it is that this ACV transition is a pretty big deal for the company in the next 2 years. And we definitely need to look at what does it mean to not borrow money from the customer, which is what long-term contracts, collecting all that sort from the customers upfront would mean. And also, at the same time, see if we could switch the renewals sooner because renewal's cost of sales is much, much lower. So we were going after the ACV transition. We were going after shortening term lengths. We would have collected less from our customers. And we needed to raise capital just for that alone.\n So with that, I would also like Duston to probably add some more to this, and we'll come back to the question of why it's structured like this. And I think the only last thing I'll add to this is that it also provides a great platform for searching for a great talent, great CEO, great leader for this company going forward. Yes. I can take this, and Duston, you should please take it from me as well. So Duston and I talked about this -- started talking about this publicly, probably a quarter or 2 ago, about how we'd go and raise some money and we need to do this because we have to fund the transition. We are kind of 2/3 of the way, but we still have another 1/3 to go with the sales comp chain itself, and shortening terms is an important piece of that.\n So as part of that -- and we know people know the value of Bain Capital, too, because they're a full-service organization, from venture capital and COA to all the way to private equity. And we felt comfortable when they reached out. Hey, they understand growth just as much. Max and Dave are phenomenal people. The more we got to know them, the more we gained their respect, that they're going to look at the thesis, and they embraced this quickly that we're going to take this from hyperconverged infrastructure to hybrid cloud infrastructure. I think there was a meeting of the minds that happened over a matter of 2 months of just back and forth in Zoom. And obviously, we never shook hands ever. We haven't met in person, but what has come about virtually in this last 2 months has just been phenomenal.\n So we look forward to them as they look at their own spectrum of investment, all the way from COA investments and the value. Enrique is somebody that I've known for a while. So I have a ton of respect for Enrique. But meeting Max and Dave recently has just given me another level of expect for that firm as well. Yes. I think -- sorry, go ahead. Yes, please. Go ahead now. Yes. Yes, I mean, I guess we've gone through this when we went from hardware to software almost 2.5, 3 years ago when the sales comp changed. And if anything, the other thing is that the market force is upon us. People have stopped doing 5-year cloud deals. Most good cloud deals are 3-year deals. So they are seeing this from their customers as well. So I think we couldn't have had this artificial thing about go sell -- take TCV for 5 years or 7 years if the market is moving to 3 years. Yes, Duston. Go ahead, and I'll chime in later. Thank you. Thank you, Jason. I remember this question coming from you almost a year ago, and I'd given you some answer there. Thank you. Thank you for the praise, Jason. Yes. I just want to say that... Yes. I think definitely, it's not going to come to 3 years, as Duston said. There's enough push and pull from the market forces, too. I mean, there's large customers who have a CapEx appetite. They want to flush their budgets to the end of the year or infrastructure is probably the first layer of software above hardware. They want to sweat it out a little bit. So I think there's going to be a yin yang here where we believe that it won't really just go rock-bottom with 3 years, something right away. Gradually, this is going to happen. I think this is true for hardware to software. It's going to be true for -- went from 5 years to 3 years as well. And none of our salespeople want to just go do negotiation every year with a longer contract. It's just horrible for them. I think they need a lot more of that trust commitment from our customers, which is why the cloud has landed at 3-year commits as opposed to monthly billing and 1 year kind of stocking."

            "name": "Duston Williams",
            "content": "Thank you, Dheeraj.\n Despite Q4 being another quarter that was impacted by significant macro uncertainties, the Nutanix team delivered a very solid quarter that included all-time highs for ACV billings, gross margin, a number of $1 million deals, along with improved free cash flow usage related to a continued focus on operating expense controls. Although we did not provide guidance for Q4, all operating metrics significantly exceeded the current street consensus based on 18 sell-side analyst estimates.\n Almost all of the business is now subscription-based. Subscription billings now account for 88% of total billings, up from 84% in Q3; and subscription revenue now accounts for 87% of total revenue, up from 82% in Q3. On a billings basis, the average dollar-weighted term length in Q4 '20, including renewals, was 3.8 years, same as in Q3 '20 and down from 3.9 years in the same quarter a year ago.\n Now a few things on our ACV-based focus going forward. As we enter our new fiscal year, as we have previously communicated, we will fully shift our goals and objectives from a TCV-based focus to an ACV-based focus in order to reduce average contract durations across our book of business. Our experience over the last few years has clearly shown that reduced contract durations enable us to achieve more attractive customer economics and reduced discounting without materially harmful effects in terms of churn.\n As I'll discuss in more detail, there are some short-term trade-offs that we are going to have to make in order to achieve this ACV-based focus. But ultimately, we believe these will be justified in the long term in terms of growth and operating leverage. A few of the biggest changes associated with this ACV-based focus will be changing our top line guidance metrics from TCV to ACV billings; a renewed focus on run rate ACV, representing our total book of business; and moving to an ACV-based sales comp plan, reducing the incentive for our salespeople to sell long-term contracts that oftentimes come at the expense of higher discounts.\n We have spoken for quite some time that ACV billings as a metric is not impacted by change in term durations and therefore, along with run rate ACV, are the 2 most appropriate growth metrics to use to analyze the fundamental health of the business. Starting in Q1, we will only provide top line guidance based on ACV billed in the quarter. At some point in the future, it may be more appropriate to shift the focus of the guide to run rate ACV.\n For definitional purposes, run rate ACV, which would be analogous to ARR or annual recurring revenue metric if we were a completely ratable business, projects the book of business that would be realized in any upcoming 12-month period, assuming no new business, no upsell and no churn. In a subscription business with low churn like ours, run rate ACV is a book of business that grows with additional new business and compounds over time with strong upsell. Now that our subscription-related billings have become almost all of our billings, we will renew our focus on run rate ACV.\n The shift to ACV billings guidance is very analogous to when we shifted from guiding to total billings and total revenue to guiding to TCV billings and TCV revenue. Total revenue in billings lost significance and became excessively volatile as we were eliminating hardware from our revenue stream. Similarly, now TCV billings and TCV revenue have lost significance and become excessively volatile as we intentionally look to reduce term duration across our book of business. TCV is impacted by term compression. ACV is not. Therefore, ACV billings is the appropriate guidance metric going forward.\n And lastly, we are very excited about our move to ACV-based sales compensation. On August 1, the start of our new fiscal year, we officially moved to an ACV versus TCV-based sales compensation plan where sales commissions are now tied to ACV amounts regardless of the length of the initial deal. We believe this is a very important milestone for the company based on the following factors.\n ACV-based comp will enable the sales reps and the company to share similar objectives, maximizing ACV billings and minimizing discounts with no regard for contract duration. Under the prior TCV-based compensation plan, which was appropriate for our previous non-subscription business model, the company wanted to minimize discounting while the reps were focused on maximizing TCV billings, often through longer-term contract durations achieved through higher discounting and lower ACV billings. Going forward, under the ACV comp model, the reps will be incentivized to maximize ACV billings and minimize discounts, exactly what the company wants to do.\n The move to ACV-based sales comp should improve discounting as a result of better deal terms on shorter-term lengths, all of which maximizes ACV billings going forward. In addition, the gradual shift to shorter-term 1- and 3-year deals will also put us in a better position to reap the efficiency benefits from the lower sales costs associated with renewals. Since we pay more commission rate on renewals versus new ACV billings, we should benefit as a percentage of business coming from renewals increases significantly over time.\n And lastly, we believe the move to ACV-based sales comp will create a renewed focus on the sales of our new products. Many of our new products have shorter-term lengths, and we're naturally disadvantaged in an environment that favored maximizing TCV. In an ACV world, new products should become a sales rep's new best friend.\n There are clearly significant benefits associated with the shift to ACV-based comp plans and with our overall ACV focus. We believe that ACV billings growth will accelerate, discounting will improve and the efficiencies of renewals will happen sooner and more often, all eventually lead to increased sales and marketing leverage in the future. This is clearly the right business decision for the company.\n Now as I've previously communicated, this focus on ACV will compress deal terms over time. During this period of term compression, investors should expect and model for negative impacts to billings and revenue, operating profit and free cash flow in the short term with the benefit being maximizing ACV billings and strengthening the operating model in the future. From a modeling perspective, for every 1/10 of a year decrease in average term duration, you should expect about a $40 million annual decrease in billings and free cash flow in the year that follows.\n To help fund our move to an ACV-first-based focus as well as significantly bolstering our overall liquidity position, we are thrilled to welcome Bain Capital as a significant new investor. We have discussed this model shift to ACV with Bain in great detail, and they are fully supportive of this approach and are excited to help support us in this transition.\n Now a few specific Q4 financial highlights. ACV build in the quarter was $140 million, up 13% from the year ago quarter; run rate ACV as of July 31, 2020 was $1.22 billion, up 29% from the year ago quarter; TCV revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $326 million, up 14% from year ago quarter; and TCV billings were $387 million, up 8% from the year ago quarter.\n We added to backlog during the quarter. New customer bookings, which continue to be impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, represented 19% of TCV bookings in the quarter versus a similar amount in Q3 '20.\n TCV bookings from our international regions represented 48% of total bookings versus 45% in Q4 '19. It is important to note that the Americas region is now experiencing more negative impacts from COVID than our other regions. APAC and EMEA were hit hard by COVID earlier on and have progressed through the pandemic a bit quicker as of the end of July than what we are currently experiencing in the Americas region.\n Our non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 was 83%. Operating expenses were $346 million. The downward trend in expenses are a result of an ongoing hiring pause, reduced travel, 1 week of furlough as well as overall expense management. Our non-GAAP net loss was $79 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.39 per share.\n For fiscal 2020, on a year-over-year basis, ACV billings were $505 million, up 18%; TCV billings were $1.56 billion, up 10%; and TCV revenue was $1.28 billion, up 14%.\n A few balance sheet highlights. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $720 million versus $732 million in Q3 '20, DSOs in Q4 were 67 days versus 67 days in Q3 '20 and free cash flow during the quarter was negative $14 million. This performance was positively impacted by $10 million of ESPP inflow in the quarter.\n Now turning to our Q1 '21 guidance. It is important to note that our Q1 guidance, like many companies, is clearly impacted by the uncertain macro environment due to the ongoing pandemic. Additionally, this is our first quarter operating under ACV-based sales compensation and ACV-based sales quotas. It is also the first quarter that our sales personnel have provided their outlook on an ACV basis versus a TCV basis, which are 2 fundamentally different processes. Therefore, there are some sources of conservativeness built into our ACV billings guidance for the quarter.\n The specific guidance for Q1 is as follows: ACV billings to be between $118 million and $121 million, gross margin of approximately 81%, operating expenses between $350 million and $360 million and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 204 million. The ACV billings guidance shown above, when converted to total billings and combined with the gross margin and operating expense guidance, should result in an operating loss, which is meaningfully lower, i.e., better, than the current street consensus estimates of $125 million.\n Additionally, as mentioned previously, the run rate ACV grew 29% year-over-year in Q4 '20. We would expect run rate ACV to grow in excess of 20% year-over-year in Q1 '21. Due to the uncertain macro environment, we will not provide annual guidance at this time.\n And lastly, to help you with your modeling efforts, included in our earnings presentation on our IR website are historical trends for ACV build in the quarter, run rate ACV, billings term length and a bridge on how to model and convert our current and future ACV billings guidance to total billings.\n With that, operator, you can now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Yes. Yes, 23%. Historically, it's run 18% to 22%. Last quarter, 27%. So it's come down a little bit, but within kind of historical ranges. Yes. So I've been very vocal over the last, I think, couple of months as far as the power of this ACV focus and what it's going to do to cash and things like that and that we highly likely go in some type of financing vehicle in the next several months or somewhere around there. So that's exactly what we've done.\n And we had effectively 2 choices here. The conventional route would have been a convertible -- public convertible in the market today. And we could have done that very quickly and raised a lot of money, but from our perspective, that would have been a bunch of effectively faceless investors that bought at instruments, but we really didn't have any contact or interaction with. And going through this type of transition, I just think having somebody like Bain Capital involved in this, that obviously has been through an immense amount of detail of our business model, they understand the power of the model that we've done for subscription, the $2.2 billion that we've sold in subscriptions over the last 2 years that basically hasn't renewed yet and what that business model looks like and the power of the efficiencies and things like that. And so now we have a partner that's going to help us through this transition and help us think through the transition and play that role. And I think we're very fortunate to have somebody step up with $750 million, putting their name down and believing in what we've done from a product perspective and what the business model can do.\n Now one of the obvious questions is, \"This is so expensive, right? Why didn't you just do the public convert?\" And the reality is that the $27.75 conversion rate, compared to a competitive public convertible with 100% call spread, so double the premium, this transaction at $27.75 is roughly 3.5%, 4% more dilutive. And I think what we're getting with this investment, the folks at Bain Capital, which have come up on our model very quickly, they understand it inside and out, I think when it's all done, we'll be happy, very happy to take that additional dilution. And don't forget, they don't make money unless the stock goes up, and so we're all in this together. And I think, again, we're just fortunate to have the partnership. Yes. So on the modeling question, I would -- I think it's actually Slide 11 in our earnings investor deck. I would highly suggest that you go take a look at that, all investors take a look at that. We've done kind of a onetime example that we've kind of opened up exactly with the terms, and we bucket it by TCV dollars and how do you go from TCV to ACV. All the terms are there, 1 year or less, through 7 years, the conversion ratio. So it gives you a great starting point now that you can aid -- not only understand the current quarter, but now you can kind of play with those buckets of terms and say, \"Jeez, how -- what do I think terms are going to go down? What's going to be the impact of TCV?\" and things like that. So I think that will be very, very helpful. So I think it's Page 11. It's 11 or 12 or something.\n On the cost, I think the real question is what's the cost of a renewal. And again, today, we don't have much because we've had 4-year terms, as you'll see in that slide deck. We do, do 1-year terms. So the $2.2 billion that we've sold over the last 2 years has effectively not renewed. And so the question there is what does that renew at? What's the cost factor that renews at? And we believe -- and we need to work through this a little bit, and Chris is setting up a small structure of internal folks to go help sales reps and whatever look at this -- it should be 85%, 90% more efficient certainly than new business. And don't forget today, so vast majority of our business since day 1 has always been new and upsell. And new and upsell, it's high cost and it's high risk. And over time, as these renewals start flowing in, the dependency on growth goes from that high-risk, high-cost new and upsell to low-risk, low-cost renewals. And that's the whole thesis here that we've been talking about, and those should come in at a pretty good efficiency factor. Yes. You can chime in, too. Sorry. Effectively, they make the same more -- they'll make more if they sell more, obviously. But I mean, right out of the chute, we've just converted as far as what they've been doing on TCV terms and converting that to ACV. So the objective there was to keep everybody whole with this conversion from TCV to ACV.\n Now again, on the renewal flow, those will be comped at 90% more efficient than the initial transaction from a commission perspective, but it was set up so there would be no penalty from a comp perspective just because of this change. And I think there's probably more upside certainly than there is downside because now they've got more tools to play with. And again, a rep should be completely indifferent from selling a 1-year deal now as opposed to what they were trying to do to sell maximum TCV and term lengths. So now they can focus on 1-year deals if they want, they've got a good 3-year deal, et cetera. So I think there's a bunch more flexibility there from a selling approach.\n Dheeraj, maybe you want to add something? And just one follow-up on the Bain question, stuff like that. I just want to make sure there's a clear understanding here. This is not a cost-cutting exercise. This is how do we partner up and scale the business in an efficient manner. That's what it is. It's not a cost-cutting. We'll keep the same focus on products and the customers and partners and things like that. You want to take that, Dheeraj? Yes. So Americas is just -- as you -- as we all know here, it's a tough environment. And APAC was kind of first to go through this, and things have gotten certainly better there. There's some interesting potential deals brewing in APAC. We'll have to see how that goes. EMEA had a good quarter for us. Americas is doing fine, but again, it's mostly certainly around new customers. It's very difficult because, again, on existing customers, they know the product. They usually love the product. You've got established relationships. So that, in a virtual environment, is much easier than trying to establish relationships and knocking down new business.\n So -- and probably some of the bigger deals, maybe they get cut down a little bit and things like that, but Americas is still a little tough, I think. From what you see now, it looks like cases are starting to come down and things like that, and people are getting a little smarter. So I think that opens up eventually here. But it's 60%, 65% of our business in a given quarter, so that puts a little constraint on things. But the product is doing well. It's not a product thing. It's not a sales execution thing at all. Just ACV billings because, again, revenue, you want to call it billings revenue, whatever you want to call it, it depends on terms, right? And ACV, again, doesn't care about terms. That we can go figure out easily, but I can't -- I put it in the remarks there, I just can't tell you if terms are going to come down 2/10 this quarter, are they going to go up 1/10 or whatever. They're going to go down over time. I guarantee you that, but I can't give you an exact precision. I think, at some point, what we owe investors is a little bit longer-term view of what we believe terms will do when that flushes and when it comes back and then the renewal flows and things like that because it's a very powerful story. It really is. So we need to think through that at some point in time, but now we're just going to stick. And again, I've shown you on that -- in the earnings deck there how it works, and I think you guys can put a model together pretty easily. Personally, we'll see because we're only 1 month into the comp here. But I think the important thing to understand here, and I'll round maybe by the 10th or so, but effectively, new customers and existing customers in aggregate have about the same term structure, okay? So that's one data point.\n And the other data point is, as you know, existing customers make up, call it, 80% of the total business. New customers make up 20% of the total business. So I can see -- and we've done this in a matrix. I can see the new customer, potentially, those terms coming down faster than the 80% of an existing customer because, again, from an existing customer perspective, we can't go to an existing customer and say, \"Hey, would you like to do a 3-year term for the same price?\" It doesn't work that way. So we have to go have a discussion with the reps, \"Jeez, maybe you want to do 3-year deals. Maybe you'd want to commit to 5 years. Maybe you'd only want it to take it for 3 years instead of 5 years and make that commitment. But oh, by the way, with that 3-year term comes an uplift or uplift in your price and reduced discounting.\" So I don't -- I think there's some natural governor there because of that structure.\n But again, we're 1 month into this. I do think, and we'll have to see how this plays out, newer products, whether it's Era, Flow, Calm, whatever, Files, tendency to have shorter terms. So can that drag terms down a little bit, the new product? I don't know. But I would be personally very surprised if they ended at 3 by the end of the year. No. I mean, it's -- I don't think many companies are even at 125%. That's the first thing. So 125% is really, really good. And there's no really other factors in there. Our churn, the way we calculate churn now with kind of a hybrid ACV subscription base, it's 96% or so and things like that. So there's nothing else significantly going on in there. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. It's pretty easy. It's just in the following year. So that would be the full year impact. I can bring you through the math. It's relatively simple from that perspective. You got a top line and just play with the terms and things like that. So I think once you set up that model, based on our structure, it becomes crazy, but I'll be glad to spend some more time with you."

Since we have spoke during our second quarter earnings call in late February, the way we live has undoubtedly changed. At that time we were just beginning to see the impact of the coronavirus, which was largely isolated to just Asia. As we try to estimate the potential impact of the virus, we provided Q3 guidance that reflected the worsening business conditions in Asia.  Noting, we couldn't then predict what would happen in the rest of the world. Today just 90 days later, we find ourselves nearly two months into a global pandemic.  Today I'll start by covering our response to COVID-19, including the trends we are seeing across our customers and end markets. I\u2019ll also talk about where we are finding opportunities to better serve our customers, as the pandemic meaningfully alters the future of work, and I hope makes us a stronger company as we come out on the other side of this. I\u2019ll then turn to talk about the quarter and discuss how the steps we have taken recently enabled us to deliver a strong Q3 performance.  And finally, I'll provide an update on the progress we have made in our subscription business model transformation before turning the call over to Duston to discuss our results in more detail.  Starting with COVID-19, in February it was business as usual and by the end of the month we anticipated there could be a demand issue in APJ as we noted on our Q2 earnings call. Beginning in March and continuing through April, we saw an increase in demand for our end-user computing offerings, which include both VDI and Desktop as a Service Solutions. While in the rest of our business, we saw some modernization project spillover into future quarters as customers\u2019 face rapidly changing financial circumstances.  While this is a time of broader uncertainty, it is also a time of greater opportunity. Most long lasting companies that went past their first decade, went through an annealing process during a recession and came out stronger. We have been able to quickly assess the situation and make informed real-time changes to how we operate our business.  To that end, Nutanix has been focused on the wellness are for employees, customers and core products, while revisiting productivity and cash efficiency.  Well, starting with employees, COVID began impacting EMEA and the U.S., our global employee base began working from home. While we had never envisioned such an abrupt change to our working environment, this was an extremely smooth transition, because we were ready to enable our workforce to work remotely, thanks to our own technology. Within a two-week period, we moved from having employees working remotely and 70% working in our offices to near 100% working remotely, with no service interruptions.  With our work-from-home systems firmly in place, our employee productivity has held steady and even improved in some cases. Employee engagement has also seen a slight positive uptick.  Some of our productivity advantages are due in part to \u201cdrinking our own champagne\u201d as our CIO likes to say. Nutanix [ph] VDI and Autonomous AOS and AHV powered infrastructure with zero touch operations, Xi Leap disaster recovery as a service. Nutanix files for application data and Frame, Desktop as a Service are the necessary pillars of our company\u2019s IT strategy that has being in the works for several years before this pandemic. In many ways, this digital infrastructure is now the biggest reason why we found this discontinuity to be so much less painful than many other businesses.  Turning to our customers. During this time we also put to the test our ability to provide the exemplary service that our customers and partners have come to expect from Nutanix, even as our entire team works from home. In early March we communicated out intent to continue to provide 24/7 support remotely. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we've been able to achieve numerous unsolicited positive responses from our customers.  Thankful for our attention to the needs, our industry leading customer support NPS Score has actually increased, with our third quarter scores reaching the highest level they have been in the past four years.  As we our focusing on the health of our employees and customers, we are also focusing on health of our business. While financial strength and flexibility are taking proactive steps to manage operating expenses and cash use to better position the business as we navigate through the pandemic and beyond.  Duston will provide more detail, but in summary we have implemented two non-consecutive single week of unpaid time off for many of our employees around the world, one week in each of our Q4, FY\u201920 and Q1 FY \u201921. We have carefully coordinated these actions to minimize the impact on our customers, and our employees, while prioritizing temporary measures such as furloughs instead of permanent changes such as layoffs.  We also believe in sharing the burden across all levels of the organization and as such our executive team took a 10% reduction in salary starting in April. Our efforts are not stopping there as we continue to look for areas to save on operating expenses more broadly.  Other areas where we are driving smart savings are within our marketing organization by pivoting to innovative and engaging virtual solutions. We have been encouraged by the early returns on our shift to virtual events from traditional in-person events, to the regional .NEXT and tours and technology boot camps. We have gone completely virtual and are seeing comparable yield in terms of qualified leads and virtual meetings for our sales organization at less than half the cost.  Another key digital initiative to further improve our ease of use in doing business is our test drive product and offer. We\u2019ve truly doubled down on this particular demand generation initiative, which is designed to enable our prospects to experience Nutanix products via a zero touch, self-service, Google Cloud powered platform.  With that, let me turn to the quarter. We were pleased with our Q3 performance, and in fact, despite challenging market conditions, our final results came in modestly ahead off the preliminary ranges we pre-announced several weeks ago. TCV billings were $380 million, up 17% year-over-year and TCV revenue was $314 million, up 18% year-over-year. Both metrics also came in about the mid-point of our guidance we provided on our last earnings call.  Total revenue of $318 million has returned to double digits year-over-year growth of 11%. Despite revenue compression resulting from our continued subscription model transaction and hardware elimination, we also delivered a strong performance on EPS.  Customers who have a lifetime spent with us more than $10 million have once again grown more than 60% year-over-year, both in number of total accounts and in an aggregate dollars spent. There are 64 customers in this category, and they now account for more than $1.2 billion of lifetime spend with us. Our customer cohorts with a minimum lifetime spend of $3 million grew 37% year-over-year to 329 accounts and they have collectively spent more than $2.5 billion in lifetime spend, growing 43% year-over-year.  And the number of customers who have spent more than $1 million with us in lifetime spend has increased to 1,122 up to 32% year-over-year. Moreover, once again these customers grew nearly 40% year-over-year in total lifetime spend.  In Q3 we closed 59 deals worth over $1 million, growing 31% year-over-year in TCV bookings. 11 of these 59 accounts also spend at least $1 million with us last quarter and the aggregate purchase of notes increased over 40% from last quarter.  We now count nearly 910 of the Global 2000 as customers and these customers have collectively spent 37% more in Q3 than in the same quarter a year ago. Global 2000 customers continue to be approximately 30% of our business. We are now privileged to serve a total of 16,580 customers in over 140 countries.  While we were ensuring our employees could effectively and productively work from home, we also launched programs aimed at helping our customers to quickly set up remote work environments for their employees. I'm proud to report that many of the big-pharma companies, both in the U.S. and Europe are using Nutanix infrastructure to make progress on medical research to fight this virus.  We also launched FastTrack for End User Computing or EUC, a special program to help companies quickly expand capacity or set up a new VDI or Desktop as a Service environment to support remote work.  Over the past decade we've delivered millions of desktops reliably to enterprises large and small. We believe that the future work has been meaningfully altered due to this pandemic as has the future of healthcare and education Our work in healthcare and education get delivered in the coming years will depend largely on computing environments that get delivered via a Cloud, but without the burden of rewriting older applications.  Hyperconverged infrastructure, now serving as a multi cloud Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS, plays a critical role in the lift and shift to the Cloud, both private and public as virtualization did more than a decade ago, by providing a new operating model without any change to legacy apps or operating systems.  In fact, while many of our deals in the quarter were a continuation of longstanding data center modernization projects, we did see demand for our end user computing solutions increase significantly during the quarter. EUC related sales increased to 27% of TCV bookings, up from 20% last quarter and up from 18% a year ago. EUC deals also brought in 20% of our new customers during the quarter.  Xi Frame, our Desktop as a Service offering or DaaS, demonstrated solid momentum and had a record quarter. In some cases, thanks to extraordinary efforts put forth by our customer service and sales teams, we were able to get some customers set up with remote work solutions in record time. Our customers\u2019 expectations include having remote work as a necessary component of their own digital transmission.  This focus on end-user computing is bringing us back to our roots, when a much larger piece of our business was supporting virtual desktop workloads, primarily the U.S. based government organizations. 10 years ago we took a contrarian approach to bet on VDI as the killer app for our scale of architecture within the data center. It was contrarian because pundits thought windows was dead in the era of mobile computing, while we had a long lived windows mantra for the enterprise. VDI was also mission critical as the entire front office would not even have a browser if we suffered a downtime.  Over time as we grew our portfolio, VDI remained important, though a smaller percentage of our business. When we acquired Frame in 2018, we broadened our end-user coverage to as a service and last year we combined our VDI and DaaS groups under one organization. Looking back, this pandemic has made us realize how critical that reconciliation has been between our digital HCI platform, supporting Citrix and VMware VDI and our SaaS based desktop service. In our largest deal of this quarter, totaling over $7 million, one of the largest financial services holding companies in the U.S. came to us for a highly agile digital infrastructure to build a private cloud.  Due to a recent merger, this Global 2000 Company needed to share desktop seamlessly between their two large entities. The ease of deployment of our software significantly reduced the bottleneck of storage and compute in time sensitive workload deployments. Because our software is so early to use, the EUC team has been able to take ownership of the entire stack.  We have a similar story to share about the large American financial services company that purchased nearly $5 million of our software this quarter, bringing their lifetime spend with us to over $18 million. Now they are using the Nutanix core software and our AHV hypervisor for all employees working from home, as well as using us for three large business critical applications. Both of these large financial institutions have immense respect for customer service, and have mentioned that our support organization is the key factor in the decision to go all-in with Nutanix. We are grateful to our SRE team for obsessing with the customer and frontline.  On the topic of going all-in, we saw robustness in our overall product portfolio this quarter. But before I talk about our portfolio, let me attempt to describe our portfolio to you one more time. You should think of Core HCI with our AHV, AOS and Prism products as the digital infrastructure that assumes the role of portable IAS in a multi-cloud world. As I mentioned before, we\u2019ll make a strong case in the next two to five years for how HCI becomes a killer apps for all things lift and shift, with no change to applications to our operating systems, similar to virtualization 15 years ago.  What sits on top of this horizontal foundation is DDD\u2019s; Data Center Services which includes unified storage, disaster recovery, operations management, networking and security services; DevOps Services, which includes multi-cloud automation, database services, containers and the like; and desktop services which include cloud based SaaS and overall end user computing solutions for the future digital workspace.  In summary, our portfolio is simply DDDD\u2019s. Our core digital HCI platform on top of which sits datacenter, DevOps and desktops, which are akin to apps running on top of the platform. Together the platform in the apps fuel each other\u2019s adoption as Windows and Office did in their symbiosis.  Speaking of moment with our DDD\u2019s, in a rolling four quarter basis the attach rate of these products in Q3 was 32%, up from 23% in the year ago quarter. On a rolling full quarter basis, the transaction volume of these 3D products in Q3 increased 16% year-over-year and 35% quarter-over-quarter. At the end of Q3, 28% of our customers have bought at least one of these non-core products, up from 20% in the year ago quarter.  Q3 lifetime bookings of non-core products grew 116% year-over-year and now make up 13% of new ACV and 15% of overall ACV. We also saw a good momentum with our DevOps offering, Nutanix Era, which is our database-as-a-service solution.  One of the largest automobile insurers in the United States spent nearly $1.5 million with us during this quarter. Primarily for Era they had been having performance and scalability problems with Oracle, which is their most critical workload. During a proof-of-concept we were able to show them a significant performance increases and the ability to make database operations invisible with Era.  Nutanix Era is to database, is what Nutanix Calm is to VMs, containers and all modern Mode 2 apps, i.e., one click sales service orchestration, multi cloud automation and autonomous operations.  One of the largest professional services firms in the world spend $5 million with us to continue their build out of a private cloud infrastructure, based on our software and native AHV hypervisor. This purchase brought their lifetime spend up to nearly $17 million as part of the digital infrastructure initiative. We believe that this trend of zero touch IT, self service delivery and streaming cloud based infrastructure will hasten in the post-COVID world.  Our customer base continues to be highly diversified, the biggest vertical in Q3 was financial services, which represented less than 25% of our business, consistent with historical levels. This sector is pretty global for us as well. One of the largest financial institutions in Europe made the decision two years ago to use Nutanix for their strategic data center platform for all new and existing workloads and applications. This Global 2000 company is an existing customer with $18 million of lifetime spend with us, with $3.5 million of that in Q3 alone.  Because our digital HCI foundation provides them true agility and because they had capacity ready for a disaster scenario, they were able to scale up to get all of their 7000 employees working from home in about a week, and even provide database services like a public cloud provider. The Board of Directors was extremely appreciative of this preparedness.  Regarding capital allocation in other industries, our exposure to energy and hospitality verticals remains small, even though we are ready for them as they rebuild their operations post COVID.  While the retail industry as a whole has been impacted by COVID-19, we have some retail customers who have seen such a significant increase in online purchases that they've had to fortify their IT infrastructure to support the load.  An existing customer and large retailer in the U.S. came to us because of a major shift to online sales and curbside pickup, which put added pressure on their IT infrastructure. They said that the pandemic was making \u201cevery day like Black Friday.\u201d They purchased an additional $1.5 million of our software and we were able to quickly get them set up with a solution to support this additional load. This customer has a lifetime spent of more than $24 million with us.  In healthcare we have supported customers who have had to quickly make the transition to telehealth or to enable their non-frontline workers to work remotely. An existing customer who is a large healthcare provider in hospital system on the east coast, tripled their deployment with us, so that they could set up a solution for their non-essential employees who work from home.  In addition, a non-profit healthcare system in the East Coast purchased our core software and Prism Pro Management Console in a subscription deal worth $1.3 million. They're running VDI workloads, as well as the healthcare industry's Epic operational database, which we announced certification for in Q2 of this year.  This crisis will shape not just the future work and future of healthcare with telemedicine, but also the future of education with remote learning. A statewide school district in the East Coast needed to quickly set up a solution for their students to be setup to learn remotely due to COVID-19. This new customer needed an IT infrastructure solution that could be set up quickly and were unsure of the capacity they needed, and it all needed to be set up remotely due to shelter-in-place orders.  Their challenge was to scale the remote learners from 200,000 to 2.8 million. They purchased 1 million of our cloud software, as well as our DevOps and data center services, such as Calm, Files, Flow, and Prism Pro and had it deploy in weeks enabling millions of students to embrace digital learning. Speaking of digital, let me now spend some time on our ongoing transformation to a subscription-based business model, along with our customers. During this time of uncertainty, we are even more resolved in our move to this model. Not only will it give us more recurring revenue or time, it also provides our customers with the flexibility they may require to purchase a software on an OpEx versus CapEx basis.  We are seeing large deals and large customers move to subscription. A U.S. based financial services company continued their digital journey with us by purchasing nearly $4 million of additional software from last year\u2019s subscription, bringing their lifetime spend up to over $11 million. Similar story with a large utility company on the U.S. West Coast. It was one of our top-25 lifetime customers with total spend with us at $18 million, purchased nearly $4 million with us in Q3 as part of their ongoing digital transformation.  Some of our largest and most tenured customers are also embracing subscription earlier than we had imagined. One of the largest automobile manufacturers in the U.S. who has spent more than $37 million with us over the years, purchased another $3.5 million in software from us in Q3 and switched from life of device to subscription. This new entitlement of our software has made this organization nearly 100% Nutanix, with only a small amount of the infrastructure residing in mainframe.  Subscription is also being embraced by U.S. federal agencies in the earnest. A federal entity in the U.S. has been working with us to modernize their datacenter and added more product in their order for this quarter to total nearly $2 million worth of software on a subscription basis over a lifetime spend of nearly $40 million. Nutanix is their on-prem private cloud solution for mission-critical workloads using HPE servers.  Another one of our large subscription deals in the quarter was with one of the leading operators of general acute care hospitals in the U.S. who has been a customer since 2016 and has a lifetime spend with us of over $15 million. In Q3 we sold them an additional $2 million of our software to help them in their lift and shift to private cloud. They are working toward a zero touch provisioning model and both our core HCI software and Nutanix Calm for orchestration and automation are critical to that strategy.  As customers look to the future, we expect that corporate initiatives around remote work, hands free IT automation, disaster recovery, and lift and shift to private and public cloud infrastructure will be some of the pillars of digital transformation, and we believe we will be at the center of these conversations. As we contemplate the future of work, our developers are deeply grasping the meaning of subscription economics, cloud engineering and container-based micro services. Our newer products like Life Cycle Manager, Objects and Prism Pro are completely based on Kubernetes containers as an agile delivery model. Most importantly, our Xi cloud services are designed to be 24/7/365. That is a huge shift towards a DevOps mindset as we try to bring our signature NPS of 90 to cloud SLA\u2019s of security, availability and performance.  As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, our core engineering is working closely with AWS and Azure on Nutanix Clusters, so that our entire portfolio can be delivered in our customers\u2019 virtual private cloud in the public cloud datacenters, integrated seamlessly with their cloud commits and critters.  In conclusion, we\u2019ve been focused in the collective health of our employees, customers and partners and overall business. We\u2019ve quickly and efficiently shifted our business to match the changing times. Our business has proven resilient and we have seen bright spots in EUC as well as our core business.  We do not see this shift as temporary, and in fact, we see the future of work changing permanently. In a report this month from industry analysts from Gartner, we predict that by 2024 in-person enterprise meetings will drop from 60% to 25%, driven by remote work and changing work force demographics.  In a separate report, Forrester stated that even after a vaccine is available, firms will never return to the pre-pandemic normal as knowledge workers demand these new found highly flexible, commute-free, productivity improvements to become permanent. We believe our product portfolio and our customer-centric culture keeps us well-positioned to navigate this crisis and evolve with this dislocation to our stakeholders advantage; i.e., customers, employees and investors. Speaking of the crisis and our imminent opportunities around efficiencies and prudence, over to Duston. Duston?\nDuston Williams: Thank you, Dheeraj. With all the disruption and uncertainty that COVID-19 has caused, we were pleased to be able to deliver solid Q3 results in-line with or in the case of EPS, better than our expectations heading into the quarter.  As you may recall, when we issued our Q3 guidance in late February, we saw early indications that COVID-19 would cause a demand issue for our APJ operations and we adjusted our guidance accordingly. We did not adjust our outlook for our Americans or EMEA operations as the virus\u2019s impact on these regions was uncertain at that time. The virus clearly ended up affecting all three regions and despite this our teams did an excellent job executing in a very turbulent environment.  We also mentioned that we are starting to prudently manage our operating expenses during our Q2 earnings call. This proactive and timely approach was based on our view that it was possible that the current demand environment could deteriorate due to the impact of COVID-19. Once our initial premise of a weakening demand environment began to play out, we immediately took even further actions to reduce expenses, which I will return to a bit later.  Our subscription journey continues to move forward as selling term based subscriptions have clearly become the norm. Subscriptions billings now account for 84% of total billings, up from 79% in Q2, and subscription revenue now accounts for 82% of total revenue, up from 77% in Q2. The average dollar weighted term length in Q3 \u201820 including renewals was 3.9 years, flat with the 3.9 years we reported in Q2 \u201820. As with last quarter, this calculation assumes life of device licenses of five-year terms.  Now I\u2019ll move on to some specific Q3 financial highlights. TCV revenue or our software and support revenue for the third quarter came within our initial guidance range of $300 million to $320 million and above our May 5 estimated preliminary results range of $307 million to $312 million, coming in at $314 million, up 18% from the year ago quarter. TCV billings or software and support billings also came within our initial guidance range of $365 million to $385 million and above our May 5 estimated preliminary results range of $371 million to $376 million, coming in at $380 million, up 17% from the year ago quarter.  ACV booked in the quarter exceeding our expectations was $130 million and was up 22% from the year ago quarter. Additionally, total revenue also exceeded our May 5 estimated preliminary results range of $312 million to $317 million, coming in at $318 million, up 11% from the year ago quarter.  We used a modest amount of backlog during the quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter that we've experienced year-over-year growth in total revenue. The revenue growth rates are starting to reflect more meaningful comparisons as the revenue impacting hardware elimination has been effectively complete for the last six months. The ACV of our HPE DX related business increased 16% in the quarter versus Q2.  We exceeded our pipeline generation goal for Q3 that was set before the quarter started. As expected, new customer bookings lagged a bit in the quarter, representing 19% of total TCV versus 24% in Q3 \u201919 and down from 24% in Q2 \u201820. The America's and EMEA regions performed well. As expected, the APJ regional performance reflected more pronounced impact from the COVID-19 related issues.  TCV bookings or software support bookings from our international regions represented 44% of total bookings versus 45% in Q3 \u201819. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 80.7% above our guidance of 80%.  Operating expenses were $390 million, significantly below our guidance range of $420 million to $430 million. The lower than expected expense number for the quarter was mostly due to the hiring pause implemented early in the quarter, reduced travel, as well as overall expense management. And our non-GAAP net loss was $135 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.69 per share versus our guidance of a loss of $0.89 per share.  Now a few balance sheet highlights. We closed the quarter with cash and short term investments of $732 million. DSO\u2019s in Q3 were 67 days versus 76 days in Q3 \u201919, and 65 days in Q2 \u201820. Free cash flow during the quarter was negative $117 million. This performance was negatively impacted by $23 million of ESPP outflow in the quarter, higher than we expected due to the lower Nutanix stock price.  Free cash flow was also negatively impacted based on a somewhat higher than expected accounts receivable balance and higher capital expenditures. Our Q4 capital expenditures should be substantially less than the Q3 total of $33 million.  Now, a few comments turning to the future. As we have mentioned a few times, despite all the economic uncertainty that most companies are dealing with in today's environment, we were generally pleased with our Q3 results. As we look forward to Q4 and beyond, we remain very excited of what the future holds for Nutanix.  We are a much stronger and better company today than we were just 12 months ago. We continue to aggressively move forward with our subscription journey, our non-core products are starting to get serious traction in some of our largest accounts and our sales leadership continues to improve, all with the backdrop of a pipeline that is significantly larger than just one year ago.  Although the future clearly looks encouraging, the short term comes with a high degree of uncertainty. We are still in an unprecedented, volatile time period and importantly, we are still in the early innings of transforming our business to a subscription model fueled by low cost renewables.  While we're making great progress on the transformation, we have not yet reached the point where the predictable renewal business makes up a substantial portion of our quarterly results. We are getting there, but for now, new business and up sell business, areas with greater inherent uncertainty still account for a vast majority of our quarterly billings. Accordingly, we do not believe it's prudent to provide guidance for Q4.  But as I said, we're encouraged with the progress we're making. We spent the last year and a half building a subscription business that will ultimately lead to a much more predictable business. With 84% of our billings in the quarter now coming from subscriptions, combined with a customer retention metric of 97%, at this point we believe it's largely a matter of time until the business matures to a new level of predictability.  As such, at this time we plan to issue annual guidance for FY \u201821 during our Q4 conference call, with any top line guidance most likely focused on ACV and with growth rates appropriately correlated to the current macro environment. What we do know about FY \u201821 is that our teams will be ready, our product will be ready and our subscription model will be ready to take full advantage of any economic recovery that might take place.  In the meantime, in lieu of specific guidance for Q4, I'll provide a few thoughts around specific areas that we are focusing on and in which investors frequently show interest.  Expense management: As Dheeraj noted, we have been aggressively managing the expense structure since mid Q2 and will continue to do so moving forward. Hiring has been extremely limited; merit increases and bonuses have been paused; executive salaries have been reduced; and we've implemented two non-consecutive single weeks of unpaid time off for most of our employees worldwide, one week in Q4 and one week in Q1.  Major events such as .NEXT and our worldwide sales meetings will go virtual, along with many other cost savings initiatives. This early and aggressive action to control expenses in the near term, all while keeping relentless focus on the customer, have clearly paid off base on the Q3 operating expenses coming in $40 million lower than the high end of our range of previous guidance.  Going forward, we will continue to actively manage the expense structure as the macro environment dictates. For the immediate future, we would expect operating expenses to hover at somewhere around $375 million to $400 million per quarter.  Cash management and free cash flow: Again, our early and aggressive expense management has put us in a pretty good position to control the cash burn over the next several quarters. Our hiring has been very limited and whatever hiring that will take place will involve around highly critical roles, as well as some hiring around customer facing roles such as sales teams, professional services and support. Going forward we would expect the cash usage to decrease significantly from Q3 and we will continue to do what is required to minimize cash usage in the future.  A few comments on sales compensation: You know we continue to move aggressively to align our sales compensation plans to support a subscription based model, and starting in the first half of FY \u201821 we will move to either a partial or full ACV sales comp model. This is the first step in setting up a comp structure to take advantage of the natural leverage a subscription model affords.  Renewals: Renewals have become a major focus area for the company, and will be the foundation to build a profitable business going forward. We're in the process of setting up roles and responsibilities within the various organizations to make sure renewals are efficiently transacted. The available to renew pool of subscription transactions is just starting to come into play. In Q3 we transacted about $5 million in non-support related subscription renewals and the pool available to renew will grow to approximately $10 million in Q4.  A few thoughts on operating leverage: The subscription business model and operating leverage go hand-in-hand. Many investors routinely ask us, why our sales and marketing cost structure does not line up closely with other subscription businesses? Before we answer this question, some context is needed.  As you recall, we started our subscription journey back in the first half of FY \u201819 when the company was approaching a billings run rate of $1.5 billion. Since then we have transitioned a substantial portion of our business to a term based subscription model with average term duration of less than four years.  Subscription based businesses derive considerable operating leverage from their renewal base and most mature subscription companies probably have a renewal base that comes close to 50% of their total billings. Today all of our subscription renewals account for less than 10% of Nutanix\u2019s total billings, or to put it another way, more than 90% of our business today is still composed of new and upsell business; business that is costly to transact.  Compare this to renewals which are transacted at a low cost, much lower than new business or upsell business. As such, it is reasonable to expect a wide gap in operating leverage profiles from two different subscription companies. One, with less than 10% of their total business derived from renewals and the other with 50% of their total business coming from renewals.  As our subscription business matures and our renewals also become a substantial percentage of our total business, we believe it is realistic to assume that Nutanix over time will begin to display somewhat similar operating leverage characteristics as other mature subscription companies. To-date only the negative aspects of our subscription transition, mostly around topline compression related to terms and pricing, have been well documented and have carried the headlines. We refer to these negative aspects as the investments into our subscription transition.  Much of the financial content for our previously postponed Investor Day was aimed to focus on the future positive aspects of our subscription transition, mostly around why the renewal inflow will naturally provide significant operating leverage over time, just like every other subscription company. We refer to these positive aspects of the transition as the return on our subscription investments and the aforementioned move to ACV based compensation for our sales force will ultimately position us to garner this leverage from the renewal inflow. After all, every substantial investment requires a substantial return on that investment.  We look forward to sharing a more detailed view of our go-forward operational plan and corresponding financial targets at an appropriate time in the future. With that operator, you can now open the call up to questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Dheeraj, as you mentioned, what we're seeing in the current environment is accelerating adoption of public cloud. So I was wondering if you can just walk through what you have in the pipeline and on the product roadmap in terms of any solutions that will be distributed on the Amazon and Microsoft platform, and whether you see that as incremental revenue opportunities or is that just new features layered on top of the current product portfolio. \nDheeraj Pandey: Thank you Katy for the question. Yeah, in fact just to take a step back, you know our idea of really blurring the lines between on-prem and off-prem is to take all our products and run them in the public cloud as is, and that we believe is going to be the biggest differentiation when it comes to lift and shift; just like what virtualization did 15 years ago. But you know probably public cloud also has some elasticity capabilities that we are now putting as part of our product. So things like auto scale-in, auto scale-out, more autonomous infrastructure that is policy based and somewhat intentful as we call it in product terms.  Also commerce, I think you know doing it in the market place and having people go buy something for three months or one year as opposed to really needing a salesperson to do things. There\u2019s a lot of good things that we can actually go and avail there as well. And finally this idea of hybrid, you know where you want part of your infrastructure to run off-prem in a public cloud with parts that actually run on-prem.  I think it's very powerful for our customers, because they're going to make some decisions about public versus private based on you know data sovereignty and data gravity and economics reasons, which is laws of physics and laws of the land and laws of economics. So we really are looking forward to the next three to six months based on big sort of announcements coming, but we want to make sure we do it in a differentiated way as opposed to just being the first to market, being the best to market is very important to us. \nKaty Huberty: Thank you for that. And Duston, just as a follow-up, the new customer count accelerated in the quarter to $970. How would you characterize the deal pipeline heading into July versus for instance a year ago? \nDheeraj Pandey: Yeah Katie, to make sure I understood you, new customers you were referencing? \nKaty Huberty: Yeah, I mean the April quarter of new customers of 970 was an acceleration from the prior quarter, so clearly good performance. Just curious what the old pipeline for new business looks like going into July versus this time last year? \nA - Dheeraj Pandey: Yeah, just on that, new customer is around 700 in the quarter. So we'll have to sync up with you one and those two numbers. But yeah, the pipeline \u2013 and I guess maybe your question is more kind of Q4 in general and where we haven't given any specific guidance it's probably a question that will come up sooner or later. So you know why haven\u2019t I kind of answered your question and maybe a little bit of a bigger question. Now Q4; again you know in my comments I mentioned pipeline, a Q3 generation exceeded our target and it was the biggest in-quarter pipe that we generated in our history. So you know that's clearly encouraging. And if you look at Q4, now we're only you know roughly three weeks into the quarter, so you know take that for what it's worth. But, you know on the surface there's not many things that look terribly out of line. Now you know the results won\u2019t be as good as we thought they would be pre-COVID, but if you go down and look at conversion rates, you now where we should be three plus weeks into the quarter; where we are from you know what's converted from pipeline, that looks okay; the loss rates are actually a little bit lower, the sales cost or a one-to-one linearity is within the bounds of what we would expect historically in months to cumulative, the same thing. We closed several million dollar deals. I think at least three this week and a couple of those were spillovers that we thought was going to close in Q3, actually closed this week; two fed deals you know that pushed from Q3.  You know if you look at EMEA, there\u2019s some good stuff going on there with new customers and partners starting to get engaged there with some public sector activity that looks really encouraging, and you know AHV not surprisingly is getting I think some renewed attention from a cost savings perspective, because [inaudible] you know we clearly got something there for them with AHV. And APAC you know was first impacted and that's starting to open up and there's some reasonable news within some countries there. I think India and China are still obviously struggling, but you know not too bad, and you know to get to your question on pipe \u2013 the pipeline is there, there's no doubt about it. The sales capacity is there, there's no doubt about that, but deals are volatile and they are still volatile. So you know us not giving Q4 guidance, we mentioned that we wouldn't be doing this May 5, so there\u2019s really no surprise there. And then, you know the comment was that again, it\u2019s just a little tougher in a volatile period for us to given specific guidance, just because you know again less than 10% of our business is truly no business at this point. But when you go all through the metrics and stuff, you know there's some really good stuff happening. The product is performing really well, sales teams are executing all that; it's just the very, very volatile period. \nKaty Huberty: That's great color, thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. .\nRaghunathan Kamesh: Hi! This is RK on behalf of Rod, thanks for taking my question. Your OpEx came in nicely lower than expectations and you\u2019ve talked about cost cuts and furloughs and slower hiring. So I wanted to ask if you could just give us some confidence that these OpEx that your making don't effect the revenue growth looking out in the future. \nDuston Williams: Yeah, why not? I can start on that one. You know you can\u2019t do this work without worrying about not FY \u201921, but FY \u201822 also to your point, because you know the easiest thing for us to do again would be you know to completely stop everything and not worry about the future growth, but we can't do that. So you know we've done a lot of scenario planning downside base case, best case, and within that environment you have to have a view on FY \u201822 or those scenarios don't work well. So I think the other comment there is don't ignore the fact that we have excess sales capacity coming into this downturn also, so it's not like you know we were razor thin on capacity. So we've clearly got more capacity, so you know it's a fine line we walk and that's why I think we've done some pretty prudent things that you know again, kind of affect everybody and not you know singling you know folks out, because everybody's going to take part in the growth going forward. So I think we've done this thoughtfully, and we'll adjust it every week, every month, every quarter as we need to based on what's happening. \nDheeraj Pandey: Yes, yes, well said Duston, and I just wanted to add just the fact that you know I mentioned this in my script as well. About 10 years later we have a recession. This is our first recession as a company and I used the word very deliberately, annealing you know, its a process of re-crystallization and gaining more strength.  You know when we went public we had 1,800 employees, which is 3.5 years ago, may be close to four years, and now we have more than 6,000 employees. So about 70% of our workforce has never seen a private Nutanix and I think it behooves us to actually look back and think about every dollar that we used to spend four or five years ago. How do we go back to the basics and become a start-up again. So we\u2019re using this opportunity to really go do that as well. \nRaghunathan Kamesh: Thank you. I also wanted to ask about your cash flow and liquidity position. Is there a minimum amount of cash that you have in mind to run the business and what you're thinking about potentially accessing the capital markets again?\nDuston Williams: Yeah. Again, this is something that we look at all the time with scenarios, and they say this downside base case, best case, and based on our view of those scenarios top-line potential and what we have done with expenses and the levers that we can pull with expenses. We feel really good about our cash balance throughout FY \u201921, based on what we\u2019ve scenario out in those three cases there.  The markets are reasonably open. The terms in some of these - the terms are reasonably good, but again, what we\u2019ve looked at we feel pretty good going forward. I think if we were at some point to raise cash in the future, it would be more around tilted to giving us some optionality with our continued subscription transition. It would be more tilted to that rather than day-to-day stuff. And this would be more potentially around, do we want to have average terms shrink down a little bit further from where they are today, about 3.9.  Because we know two things happen, that makes the business much more profitable with some a little bit lower terms, and that\u2019s lower discounting because the lower the term, the lower the discounting. That\u2019s highly leverageable from a business model perspective. And the shorter the term, the quicker that deal comes up for renewal and with a 97% retention rate, the quicker that deal comes up for renewal, the quicker we get an efficient deal levered into the business coming at a much, much lower cost.  So if we were going to do something, it would be more around, again, that optionality to make the business much more profitable and you know we\u2019ve got the current debenture out there, but that\u2019s January \u201923 timeframe. So there\u2019s lots of optionality around that, too.\nRaghunathan Kamesh: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks and hope everyone is safe and healthy over there. Duston, just to revisit your earlier comment about the pipeline. I think you said it\u2019s like the largest in third quarter pipeline growth in company history, something along those lines. I guess the both of you, what are the workloads that are driving that? Is it just a continuation of the EUC, VDI trends that you saw in the last quarter or are you kind of going back to a heavier mix of big digital transformation projects? So I guess what\u2019s driving that and is it sort of a continuation of last quarter?\nDheeraj Pandey: You want to take that, Dheeraj?\nDheeraj Pandey: Yeah, let me at least make an attempt at it. I think a lot of the pipeline in Q3 that got converted to EUC deals, which we reported as 27% of our TCV bookings, a lot of that got created and closed in the same quarter and the numbers that Duston talked about was overall creation in the quarter, which is helpful for Q4 and Q1.  I think the mix is very similar. I mean, as I said in my call script as well, that EUC used to be a much larger percentage of our business five years ago. It has come down to 18% a year ago and was 20% a quarter ago and it became 27% this quarter. So, I think our pipeline is in the same range as our bookings in Q3.\nAlex Kurtz: Alright. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. My first question is just on the guidance. I\u2019m sure this has been hotly debated internally, but why not just give a range, you know that\u2019s what most companies are doing. To completely pull your guidance after some of the comments that you made on the month of May and the metrics being reasonable and the pipeline growth that you saw in Q3, it\u2019s a bit odd to me that you did not give any Q4 guidance. So, just walk us through the thought process there.\nDuston Williams: Yeah. Again, some things are volatile and we\u2019re early into Q4, you know 3.5 weeks or so into our Q4 and again a lot of companies with a subscription-based business are giving that guidance with a substantial portion of their business coming up for renewals that they know is going to renew. I mean we\u2019re dealing with a chunk less than 10% of our business in that category.  So, it\u2019s kind of apples and oranges comparison there, and I gave you some pretty good thoughts about Q4, but for us to go put a range in there now with only less than 10% of the business coming in naturally, we just thought we\u2019d pause for a quarter, and then let things play out macro-wise a little bit and then come back with a fresh view of FY \u201921.\nJason Ader: Okay, yeah, but I mean like companies like Cisco, that don\u2019t have a lot of subscription, provided a range. I mean I guess, you\u2019re comparing yourself against some of the pure ratable-type models and renewal models, so I guess..\nDuston Williams: Jason, even for conventional businesses, if you look at, let\u2019s say VMware, 60% of the business is renewals. For us it\u2019s much less than 10%. So, it\u2019s not just about subscription companies. It\u2019s about most companies that actually have a renewal business.\nJason Ader: Right, but don\u2019t you have around 30% that\u2019s recurring support?\nDuston Williams: No, not of the quarterly bookings, no. No, in its entirety Jason, that percentage of recurring, whether you want to call it quarter or now subscription renewals is less than 10%, so substantially different. I mean that\u2019s what we\u2019re building up, that\u2019s the whole story here which we\u2019re talking about, is that we know those renewals as a percentage of the total business, those renewals are going to increase and they\u2019re going to increase over time, we\u2019ve done close to $5 million last quarter.  We\u2019ve got a pool of $10 million for this quarter, that\u2019s going continue to accelerate. But today, because we started this only a year and a half ago, these renewals just haven\u2019t timed out. That\u2019s why a little lower term is probably a good thing ultimately, because those renewals flow in quicker than they normally would have.\nDheeraj Pandey: Also, I know we have a big international exposure, making things a bit more unpredictable as to when governments and economies and businesses are going to open compared to many of the companies actually who are younger, maybe 10 years old, but don\u2019t have as much international business.  And at the same time, I think you know to Katy\u2019s question, Duston provided a lot of color about what we think Q4 is looking like right now. So I mean, it\u2019s a fine balance Jason and there is no right or wrong answer. We could have provided a pretty wide range while we said, look, it\u2019s a matter of a quarter and given the fact that we announced this already on May 5, there should be a way to really go and reconcile this with all of you.\nJason Ader: Okay, and then one quick follow-up on the billings coming from renewals. That was helpful to get that magnitude that we have in Q3 and Q4. Could you give us some sense of what the percentage of billings that will come from renewals in fiscal \u201921 and \u201922 - sorry fiscal \u201921 and \u201922 might look like? Just kind of ballpark numbers there?\nDuston Williams: Yeah, I mean, we have that all laid out for Investor Day. We\u2019ll do that probably when we give \u201921 guidance. Actually, it\u2019s very simple for folks to go model, because you know our average deal length and you know what we\u2019ve done from a subscription perspective. So, it\u2019s pretty easy. That\u2019s kind of the exciting thing. I think it\u2019s pretty easy to go and see this and touch it and feel it, because it does by definition become a pretty substantial piece of the business going forward and again, those renewals, just like every other subscription-based company, come in with a very high efficiency factor.  So that\u2019s kind of the exciting stuff going forward. Just getting back to the Q4 guide, I wouldn\u2019t read anything specific into us not providing this. We just think that there\u2019s some volatility that you know we prudently, probably, shouldn\u2019t guide, but things look reasonably okay right now. But it\u2019s early and it\u2019s a period that\u2019s never happened before. I\u2019ve certainly never seen it, so that\u2019s the view, but I wouldn\u2019t read anything specifically into that.\nJason Ader: Okay, thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jack Andrews with Needham. Your line is open.\nJack Andrews: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I just had a two-part question. I was wondering first of all, if you could just talk about the significance of your partnership with Wipro to launch digital database services and then how big could that be over time. And then the related question is just broadening it out, more generally speaking, should we expect other practice areas to be built with global SI\u2019s around some of your other emerging subscription products?\nDheeraj Pandey: Thank you for the question. Yeah, in fact we did announce two products with Wipro in the last six months; one around end user computing and one around databases, both of which are powered by either our infrastructure with Citrix or with our controlled plain [ph] on database side which is Era.  These are two massively large workloads, databases and desktops, and we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of both of these. They probably are equal sized businesses. If you exclude things like Splunk and other such things that we actually do and more to apps like no-sequel databases and Hadoop and so on, excluding all of that, I think it\u2019s a pretty big business for us. We foresee that many of these will actually have a trouble in the lift and shift to the public cloud and that\u2019s where a lot of our value comes in, because data and compute sit next to \u2013 need to sit next to each other for databases and virtual desktops need to be delivered anywhere and everywhere where people are.  So I think both these workloads, including what Wipro is doing with their products. Driving our products will be very important part of our GSI strategy. We are working very closely with Capgemini, Arthos, HCL and Infosys as well. In fact, currently they\u2019re a very large customer of Nutanix, so as they think through the OpEx model for themselves, because many of these are also acting as service providers to their Global 2000 customers and we become the infrastructure below that as well.  So we\u2019re very excited about our GSI opportunities and we feel like we\u2019ve barely begun to scratch the surface of this.\nJack Andrews: Great! Thanks for your perspective.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nVictor Chiu: Hi! This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. You mentioned that all three regions were impacted incrementally relative to your expectations. So can you just help us understand what\u2019s the offset that kind of helped provide some upside relative to your previous guidance expectations?\nDheeraj Pandey: Yeah, globally I think it was.[Cross Talk] Alright, go ahead, Duston.\nDuston Williams: No, I\u2019m sorry, Dheeraj. Go ahead, sorry.\nDheeraj Pandey: Globally, the yin-yang and we call it the puts and the takes. The takes from our side were end user computing. The fact that we were able to do this globally, not just in the U.S. and federal, but also in EMEA and APJ was actually a good tailwind for us. And I think obviously the puts from our side were more on the large deals that we were obviously tracking for the last six months that people have come to postpone or revisit for now. But we do believe that EUC alone have provided a big tailwind.\nVictor Chiu: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SFG. Your line is open.\nNick Ghattas: Hey guys, this is Nick on for Mehdi, and thanks for squeezing me in at the end here. I just wanted to kind of key in on VDI for a second. Just when we looked forward, is there a more incremental upside with your VDI solution? As in, are there still \u2013 are you still hearing from customers like that they need to be, they need assistance getting online and going through this work-from-home set up or is that opportunity pretty much closed at this point? And I have a follow-up.\nDheeraj Pandey: Oh! I think we are early in this, thanks for the question. We are relatively early in this. Obviously the Global 2000, maybe the Global 5000 had tested this, but even there the penetration is still 30%. Even if you look at Citrix\u2019s data, the enterprise seats is not the same as the number of employees in these large enterprises, and I think large accounts are probably one-third penetrated right now, but the mid-market is yet another very large market and outside the U.S. I think there is a lot more that will get digital.  So I believe that this end user computing digital workspace will actually get redefined and it\u2019s probably in its early innings, maybe the second innings more so than the fifth or sixth actually, and it\u2019s not just the future of work, it\u2019s also future of healthcare and future of education.  Today there was a really good piece on CNN about universities. They have basically grown their fee structure like 1,400%, 14,000% or 1,400%, I can\u2019t remember the exact number, but over the last 40 years nothing has changed in terms of their courseware and the way they impart education. So there\u2019s a lot of things that are up here for grabs in higher education, state and local, as well as middle school and high school education plus in healthcare and work as well.\nNick Ghattas: Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. If I could just squeeze in one more here, the 97[inaudible], obviously that was not in an era, the kind of era that we live in now, so can you just provide a little bit more color about what you\u2019re thinking about churn or the retention rates going forward, especially as renewals start coming online?\nDheeraj Pandey: Duston, you want to take that?\nDuston Williams: Sure. I wouldn\u2019t expect all that much difference quite honestly. The product is very compelling; the value-add is compelling. I mentioned about how AHV becomes even more compelling in a cost conscious environment, which we\u2019re starting to see there. We\u2019ve run those numbers through Q3, the quarter just ended, and there was probably still rounds to around 47 or 97 I\u2019m sorry. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see too much change there over the next several quarters, but you know we\u2019ll see.\nNick Ghattas: Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Pinjalim Bora with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nPinjalim Bora: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Dheeraj, we have heard a lot of comments, positive comments about your HPE partnership this Q3. Could you tell us how did you perform maybe versus your expectation and then did the pay as you consume construct for GreenLake helped in this current environment. And then lastly, do you see any value and providing a pay as you consume kind of a model yourself, that\u2019s all I have. \nDheeraj Pandey: Yeah, thanks for the question. HPE, very good partnership. It\u2019s been about 2.5 quarters, I would say since it began. They definitely have a global presence and our sellers are working together hand-in-hand managing these accounts. The PC [ph] goals a little early I would say, simply because we haven\u2019t put all our products in there, but some of the large customer, especially after COVID we\u2019ve started to see questions emerge, a lot more questions emerge about, can we take entire Nutanix portfolio and have it transfer through GreenLake.  I think it\u2019s a pretty novel concept and there\u2019s some interesting partnership opportunities with HP and us, especially in the world of Xi you know. They are talking about Telcos and many of these service providers who currently buy hardware with CapEx. I think GreenLake needs a killer app and Nutanix can be the killer app on top of GreenLake and especially as we take this to GSI\u2019s and Telcos and service providers, all of whom actually, would be very willing to look at hardware in an OpEx model rather than CapEx. \nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for participating.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dheeraj Pandey",
            "content": "Thank you, Tonya, and good afternoon everyone. I appreciate you joining us today and are healthy during this time.  Since we have spoke during our second quarter earnings call in late February, the way we live has undoubtedly changed. At that time we were just beginning to see the impact of the coronavirus, which was largely isolated to just Asia. As we try to estimate the potential impact of the virus, we provided Q3 guidance that reflected the worsening business conditions in Asia.  Noting, we couldn't then predict what would happen in the rest of the world. Today just 90 days later, we find ourselves nearly two months into a global pandemic.  Today I'll start by covering our response to COVID-19, including the trends we are seeing across our customers and end markets. I'll also talk about where we are finding opportunities to better serve our customers, as the pandemic meaningfully alters the future of work, and I hope makes us a stronger company as we come out on the other side of this. I'll then turn to talk about the quarter and discuss how the steps we have taken recently enabled us to deliver a strong Q3 performance.  And finally, I'll provide an update on the progress we have made in our subscription business model transformation before turning the call over to Duston to discuss our results in more detail.  Starting with COVID-19, in February it was business as usual and by the end of the month we anticipated there could be a demand issue in APJ as we noted on our Q2 earnings call. Beginning in March and continuing through April, we saw an increase in demand for our end-user computing offerings, which include both VDI and Desktop as a Service Solutions. While in the rest of our business, we saw some modernization project spillover into future quarters as customers' face rapidly changing financial circumstances.  While this is a time of broader uncertainty, it is also a time of greater opportunity. Most long lasting companies that went past their first decade, went through an annealing process during a recession and came out stronger. We have been able to quickly assess the situation and make informed real-time changes to how we operate our business.  To that end, Nutanix has been focused on the wellness are for employees, customers and core products, while revisiting productivity and cash efficiency.  Well, starting with employees, COVID began impacting EMEA and the U.S., our global employee base began working from home. While we had never envisioned such an abrupt change to our working environment, this was an extremely smooth transition, because we were ready to enable our workforce to work remotely, thanks to our own technology. Within a two-week period, we moved from having employees working remotely and 70% working in our offices to near 100% working remotely, with no service interruptions.  With our work-from-home systems firmly in place, our employee productivity has held steady and even improved in some cases. Employee engagement has also seen a slight positive uptick.  Some of our productivity advantages are due in part to \u201cdrinking our own champagne\u201d as our CIO likes to say. Nutanix [ph] VDI and Autonomous AOS and AHV powered infrastructure with zero touch operations, Xi Leap disaster recovery as a service. Nutanix files for application data and Frame, Desktop as a Service are the necessary pillars of our company's IT strategy that has being in the works for several years before this pandemic. In many ways, this digital infrastructure is now the biggest reason why we found this discontinuity to be so much less painful than many other businesses.  Turning to our customers. During this time we also put to the test our ability to provide the exemplary service that our customers and partners have come to expect from Nutanix, even as our entire team works from home. In early March we communicated out intent to continue to provide 24/7 support remotely. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we've been able to achieve numerous unsolicited positive responses from our customers.  Thankful for our attention to the needs, our industry leading customer support NPS Score has actually increased, with our third quarter scores reaching the highest level they have been in the past four years.  As we our focusing on the health of our employees and customers, we are also focusing on health of our business. While financial strength and flexibility are taking proactive steps to manage operating expenses and cash use to better position the business as we navigate through the pandemic and beyond.  Duston will provide more detail, but in summary we have implemented two non-consecutive single week of unpaid time off for many of our employees around the world, one week in each of our Q4, FY'20 and Q1 FY '21. We have carefully coordinated these actions to minimize the impact on our customers, and our employees, while prioritizing temporary measures such as furloughs instead of permanent changes such as layoffs.  We also believe in sharing the burden across all levels of the organization and as such our executive team took a 10% reduction in salary starting in April. Our efforts are not stopping there as we continue to look for areas to save on operating expenses more broadly.  Other areas where we are driving smart savings are within our marketing organization by pivoting to innovative and engaging virtual solutions. We have been encouraged by the early returns on our shift to virtual events from traditional in-person events, to the regional .NEXT and tours and technology boot camps. We have gone completely virtual and are seeing comparable yield in terms of qualified leads and virtual meetings for our sales organization at less than half the cost.  Another key digital initiative to further improve our ease of use in doing business is our test drive product and offer. We've truly doubled down on this particular demand generation initiative, which is designed to enable our prospects to experience Nutanix products via a zero touch, self-service, Google Cloud powered platform.  With that, let me turn to the quarter. We were pleased with our Q3 performance, and in fact, despite challenging market conditions, our final results came in modestly ahead off the preliminary ranges we pre-announced several weeks ago. TCV billings were $380 million, up 17% year-over-year and TCV revenue was $314 million, up 18% year-over-year. Both metrics also came in about the mid-point of our guidance we provided on our last earnings call.  Total revenue of $318 million has returned to double digits year-over-year growth of 11%. Despite revenue compression resulting from our continued subscription model transaction and hardware elimination, we also delivered a strong performance on EPS.  Customers who have a lifetime spent with us more than $10 million have once again grown more than 60% year-over-year, both in number of total accounts and in an aggregate dollars spent. There are 64 customers in this category, and they now account for more than $1.2 billion of lifetime spend with us. Our customer cohorts with a minimum lifetime spend of $3 million grew 37% year-over-year to 329 accounts and they have collectively spent more than $2.5 billion in lifetime spend, growing 43% year-over-year.  And the number of customers who have spent more than $1 million with us in lifetime spend has increased to 1,122 up to 32% year-over-year. Moreover, once again these customers grew nearly 40% year-over-year in total lifetime spend.  In Q3 we closed 59 deals worth over $1 million, growing 31% year-over-year in TCV bookings. 11 of these 59 accounts also spend at least $1 million with us last quarter and the aggregate purchase of notes increased over 40% from last quarter.  We now count nearly 910 of the Global 2000 as customers and these customers have collectively spent 37% more in Q3 than in the same quarter a year ago. Global 2000 customers continue to be approximately 30% of our business. We are now privileged to serve a total of 16,580 customers in over 140 countries.  While we were ensuring our employees could effectively and productively work from home, we also launched programs aimed at helping our customers to quickly set up remote work environments for their employees. I'm proud to report that many of the big-pharma companies, both in the U.S. and Europe are using Nutanix infrastructure to make progress on medical research to fight this virus.  We also launched FastTrack for End User Computing or EUC, a special program to help companies quickly expand capacity or set up a new VDI or Desktop as a Service environment to support remote work.  Over the past decade we've delivered millions of desktops reliably to enterprises large and small. We believe that the future work has been meaningfully altered due to this pandemic as has the future of healthcare and education Our work in healthcare and education get delivered in the coming years will depend largely on computing environments that get delivered via a Cloud, but without the burden of rewriting older applications.  Hyperconverged infrastructure, now serving as a multi cloud Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS, plays a critical role in the lift and shift to the Cloud, both private and public as virtualization did more than a decade ago, by providing a new operating model without any change to legacy apps or operating systems.  In fact, while many of our deals in the quarter were a continuation of longstanding data center modernization projects, we did see demand for our end user computing solutions increase significantly during the quarter. EUC related sales increased to 27% of TCV bookings, up from 20% last quarter and up from 18% a year ago. EUC deals also brought in 20% of our new customers during the quarter.  Xi Frame, our Desktop as a Service offering or DaaS, demonstrated solid momentum and had a record quarter. In some cases, thanks to extraordinary efforts put forth by our customer service and sales teams, we were able to get some customers set up with remote work solutions in record time. Our customers' expectations include having remote work as a necessary component of their own digital transmission.  This focus on end-user computing is bringing us back to our roots, when a much larger piece of our business was supporting virtual desktop workloads, primarily the U.S. based government organizations. 10 years ago we took a contrarian approach to bet on VDI as the killer app for our scale of architecture within the data center. It was contrarian because pundits thought windows was dead in the era of mobile computing, while we had a long lived windows mantra for the enterprise. VDI was also mission critical as the entire front office would not even have a browser if we suffered a downtime.  Over time as we grew our portfolio, VDI remained important, though a smaller percentage of our business. When we acquired Frame in 2018, we broadened our end-user coverage to as a service and last year we combined our VDI and DaaS groups under one organization. Looking back, this pandemic has made us realize how critical that reconciliation has been between our digital HCI platform, supporting Citrix and VMware VDI and our SaaS based desktop service. In our largest deal of this quarter, totaling over $7 million, one of the largest financial services holding companies in the U.S. came to us for a highly agile digital infrastructure to build a private cloud.  Due to a recent merger, this Global 2000 Company needed to share desktop seamlessly between their two large entities. The ease of deployment of our software significantly reduced the bottleneck of storage and compute in time sensitive workload deployments. Because our software is so early to use, the EUC team has been able to take ownership of the entire stack.  We have a similar story to share about the large American financial services company that purchased nearly $5 million of our software this quarter, bringing their lifetime spend with us to over $18 million. Now they are using the Nutanix core software and our AHV hypervisor for all employees working from home, as well as using us for three large business critical applications. Both of these large financial institutions have immense respect for customer service, and have mentioned that our support organization is the key factor in the decision to go all-in with Nutanix. We are grateful to our SRE team for obsessing with the customer and frontline.  On the topic of going all-in, we saw robustness in our overall product portfolio this quarter. But before I talk about our portfolio, let me attempt to describe our portfolio to you one more time. You should think of Core HCI with our AHV, AOS and Prism products as the digital infrastructure that assumes the role of portable IAS in a multi-cloud world. As I mentioned before, we'll make a strong case in the next two to five years for how HCI becomes a killer apps for all things lift and shift, with no change to applications to our operating systems, similar to virtualization 15 years ago.  What sits on top of this horizontal foundation is DDD's; Data Center Services which includes unified storage, disaster recovery, operations management, networking and security services; DevOps Services, which includes multi-cloud automation, database services, containers and the like; and desktop services which include cloud based SaaS and overall end user computing solutions for the future digital workspace.  In summary, our portfolio is simply DDDD's. Our core digital HCI platform on top of which sits datacenter, DevOps and desktops, which are akin to apps running on top of the platform. Together the platform in the apps fuel each other's adoption as Windows and Office did in their symbiosis.  Speaking of moment with our DDD's, in a rolling four quarter basis the attach rate of these products in Q3 was 32%, up from 23% in the year ago quarter. On a rolling full quarter basis, the transaction volume of these 3D products in Q3 increased 16% year-over-year and 35% quarter-over-quarter. At the end of Q3, 28% of our customers have bought at least one of these non-core products, up from 20% in the year ago quarter.  Q3 lifetime bookings of non-core products grew 116% year-over-year and now make up 13% of new ACV and 15% of overall ACV. We also saw a good momentum with our DevOps offering, Nutanix Era, which is our database-as-a-service solution.  One of the largest automobile insurers in the United States spent nearly $1.5 million with us during this quarter. Primarily for Era they had been having performance and scalability problems with Oracle, which is their most critical workload. During a proof-of-concept we were able to show them a significant performance increases and the ability to make database operations invisible with Era.  Nutanix Era is to database, is what Nutanix Calm is to VMs, containers and all modern Mode 2 apps, i.e., one click sales service orchestration, multi cloud automation and autonomous operations.  One of the largest professional services firms in the world spend $5 million with us to continue their build out of a private cloud infrastructure, based on our software and native AHV hypervisor. This purchase brought their lifetime spend up to nearly $17 million as part of the digital infrastructure initiative. We believe that this trend of zero touch IT, self service delivery and streaming cloud based infrastructure will hasten in the post-COVID world.  Our customer base continues to be highly diversified, the biggest vertical in Q3 was financial services, which represented less than 25% of our business, consistent with historical levels. This sector is pretty global for us as well. One of the largest financial institutions in Europe made the decision two years ago to use Nutanix for their strategic data center platform for all new and existing workloads and applications. This Global 2000 company is an existing customer with $18 million of lifetime spend with us, with $3.5 million of that in Q3 alone.  Because our digital HCI foundation provides them true agility and because they had capacity ready for a disaster scenario, they were able to scale up to get all of their 7000 employees working from home in about a week, and even provide database services like a public cloud provider. The Board of Directors was extremely appreciative of this preparedness.  Regarding capital allocation in other industries, our exposure to energy and hospitality verticals remains small, even though we are ready for them as they rebuild their operations post COVID.  While the retail industry as a whole has been impacted by COVID-19, we have some retail customers who have seen such a significant increase in online purchases that they've had to fortify their IT infrastructure to support the load.  An existing customer and large retailer in the U.S. came to us because of a major shift to online sales and curbside pickup, which put added pressure on their IT infrastructure. They said that the pandemic was making \u201cevery day like Black Friday.\u201d They purchased an additional $1.5 million of our software and we were able to quickly get them set up with a solution to support this additional load. This customer has a lifetime spent of more than $24 million with us.  In healthcare we have supported customers who have had to quickly make the transition to telehealth or to enable their non-frontline workers to work remotely. An existing customer who is a large healthcare provider in hospital system on the east coast, tripled their deployment with us, so that they could set up a solution for their non-essential employees who work from home.  In addition, a non-profit healthcare system in the East Coast purchased our core software and Prism Pro Management Console in a subscription deal worth $1.3 million. They're running VDI workloads, as well as the healthcare industry's Epic operational database, which we announced certification for in Q2 of this year.  This crisis will shape not just the future work and future of healthcare with telemedicine, but also the future of education with remote learning. A statewide school district in the East Coast needed to quickly set up a solution for their students to be setup to learn remotely due to COVID-19. This new customer needed an IT infrastructure solution that could be set up quickly and were unsure of the capacity they needed, and it all needed to be set up remotely due to shelter-in-place orders.  Their challenge was to scale the remote learners from 200,000 to 2.8 million. They purchased 1 million of our cloud software, as well as our DevOps and data center services, such as Calm, Files, Flow, and Prism Pro and had it deploy in weeks enabling millions of students to embrace digital learning. Speaking of digital, let me now spend some time on our ongoing transformation to a subscription-based business model, along with our customers. During this time of uncertainty, we are even more resolved in our move to this model. Not only will it give us more recurring revenue or time, it also provides our customers with the flexibility they may require to purchase a software on an OpEx versus CapEx basis.  We are seeing large deals and large customers move to subscription. A U.S. based financial services company continued their digital journey with us by purchasing nearly $4 million of additional software from last year's subscription, bringing their lifetime spend up to over $11 million. Similar story with a large utility company on the U.S. West Coast. It was one of our top-25 lifetime customers with total spend with us at $18 million, purchased nearly $4 million with us in Q3 as part of their ongoing digital transformation.  Some of our largest and most tenured customers are also embracing subscription earlier than we had imagined. One of the largest automobile manufacturers in the U.S. who has spent more than $37 million with us over the years, purchased another $3.5 million in software from us in Q3 and switched from life of device to subscription. This new entitlement of our software has made this organization nearly 100% Nutanix, with only a small amount of the infrastructure residing in mainframe.  Subscription is also being embraced by U.S. federal agencies in the earnest. A federal entity in the U.S. has been working with us to modernize their datacenter and added more product in their order for this quarter to total nearly $2 million worth of software on a subscription basis over a lifetime spend of nearly $40 million. Nutanix is their on-prem private cloud solution for mission-critical workloads using HPE servers.  Another one of our large subscription deals in the quarter was with one of the leading operators of general acute care hospitals in the U.S. who has been a customer since 2016 and has a lifetime spend with us of over $15 million. In Q3 we sold them an additional $2 million of our software to help them in their lift and shift to private cloud. They are working toward a zero touch provisioning model and both our core HCI software and Nutanix Calm for orchestration and automation are critical to that strategy.  As customers look to the future, we expect that corporate initiatives around remote work, hands free IT automation, disaster recovery, and lift and shift to private and public cloud infrastructure will be some of the pillars of digital transformation, and we believe we will be at the center of these conversations. As we contemplate the future of work, our developers are deeply grasping the meaning of subscription economics, cloud engineering and container-based micro services. Our newer products like Life Cycle Manager, Objects and Prism Pro are completely based on Kubernetes containers as an agile delivery model. Most importantly, our Xi cloud services are designed to be 24/7/365. That is a huge shift towards a DevOps mindset as we try to bring our signature NPS of 90 to cloud SLA's of security, availability and performance.  As we've discussed in the past, our core engineering is working closely with AWS and Azure on Nutanix Clusters, so that our entire portfolio can be delivered in our customers' virtual private cloud in the public cloud datacenters, integrated seamlessly with their cloud commits and critters.  In conclusion, we've been focused in the collective health of our employees, customers and partners and overall business. We've quickly and efficiently shifted our business to match the changing times. Our business has proven resilient and we have seen bright spots in EUC as well as our core business.  We do not see this shift as temporary, and in fact, we see the future of work changing permanently. In a report this month from industry analysts from Gartner, we predict that by 2024 in-person enterprise meetings will drop from 60% to 25%, driven by remote work and changing work force demographics.  In a separate report, Forrester stated that even after a vaccine is available, firms will never return to the pre-pandemic normal as knowledge workers demand these new found highly flexible, commute-free, productivity improvements to become permanent. We believe our product portfolio and our customer-centric culture keeps us well-positioned to navigate this crisis and evolve with this dislocation to our stakeholders advantage; i.e., customers, employees and investors. Speaking of the crisis and our imminent opportunities around efficiencies and prudence, over to Duston. Duston? Thank you Katy for the question. Yeah, in fact just to take a step back, you know our idea of really blurring the lines between on-prem and off-prem is to take all our products and run them in the public cloud as is, and that we believe is going to be the biggest differentiation when it comes to lift and shift; just like what virtualization did 15 years ago. But you know probably public cloud also has some elasticity capabilities that we are now putting as part of our product. So things like auto scale-in, auto scale-out, more autonomous infrastructure that is policy based and somewhat intentful as we call it in product terms.  Also commerce, I think you know doing it in the market place and having people go buy something for three months or one year as opposed to really needing a salesperson to do things. There's a lot of good things that we can actually go and avail there as well. And finally this idea of hybrid, you know where you want part of your infrastructure to run off-prem in a public cloud with parts that actually run on-prem.  I think it's very powerful for our customers, because they're going to make some decisions about public versus private based on you know data sovereignty and data gravity and economics reasons, which is laws of physics and laws of the land and laws of economics. So we really are looking forward to the next three to six months based on big sort of announcements coming, but we want to make sure we do it in a differentiated way as opposed to just being the first to market, being the best to market is very important to us. Yeah Katie, to make sure I understood you, new customers you were referencing? Yes, yes, well said Duston, and I just wanted to add just the fact that you know I mentioned this in my script as well. About 10 years later we have a recession. This is our first recession as a company and I used the word very deliberately, annealing you know, its a process of re-crystallization and gaining more strength.  You know when we went public we had 1,800 employees, which is 3.5 years ago, may be close to four years, and now we have more than 6,000 employees. So about 70% of our workforce has never seen a private Nutanix and I think it behooves us to actually look back and think about every dollar that we used to spend four or five years ago. How do we go back to the basics and become a start-up again. So we're using this opportunity to really go do that as well. You want to take that, Dheeraj? Yeah, let me at least make an attempt at it. I think a lot of the pipeline in Q3 that got converted to EUC deals, which we reported as 27% of our TCV bookings, a lot of that got created and closed in the same quarter and the numbers that Duston talked about was overall creation in the quarter, which is helpful for Q4 and Q1.  I think the mix is very similar. I mean, as I said in my call script as well, that EUC used to be a much larger percentage of our business five years ago. It has come down to 18% a year ago and was 20% a quarter ago and it became 27% this quarter. So, I think our pipeline is in the same range as our bookings in Q3. Also, I know we have a big international exposure, making things a bit more unpredictable as to when governments and economies and businesses are going to open compared to many of the companies actually who are younger, maybe 10 years old, but don't have as much international business.  And at the same time, I think you know to Katy's question, Duston provided a lot of color about what we think Q4 is looking like right now. So I mean, it's a fine balance Jason and there is no right or wrong answer. We could have provided a pretty wide range while we said, look, it's a matter of a quarter and given the fact that we announced this already on May 5, there should be a way to really go and reconcile this with all of you. Thank you for the question. Yeah, in fact we did announce two products with Wipro in the last six months; one around end user computing and one around databases, both of which are powered by either our infrastructure with Citrix or with our controlled plain [ph] on database side which is Era.  These are two massively large workloads, databases and desktops, and we've done a pretty good job of both of these. They probably are equal sized businesses. If you exclude things like Splunk and other such things that we actually do and more to apps like no-sequel databases and Hadoop and so on, excluding all of that, I think it's a pretty big business for us. We foresee that many of these will actually have a trouble in the lift and shift to the public cloud and that's where a lot of our value comes in, because data and compute sit next to \u2013 need to sit next to each other for databases and virtual desktops need to be delivered anywhere and everywhere where people are.  So I think both these workloads, including what Wipro is doing with their products. Driving our products will be very important part of our GSI strategy. We are working very closely with Capgemini, Arthos, HCL and Infosys as well. In fact, currently they're a very large customer of Nutanix, so as they think through the OpEx model for themselves, because many of these are also acting as service providers to their Global 2000 customers and we become the infrastructure below that as well.  So we're very excited about our GSI opportunities and we feel like we've barely begun to scratch the surface of this. Yeah, globally I think it was.[Cross Talk] Alright, go ahead, Duston. Globally, the yin-yang and we call it the puts and the takes. The takes from our side were end user computing. The fact that we were able to do this globally, not just in the U.S. and federal, but also in EMEA and APJ was actually a good tailwind for us. And I think obviously the puts from our side were more on the large deals that we were obviously tracking for the last six months that people have come to postpone or revisit for now. But we do believe that EUC alone have provided a big tailwind. Oh! I think we are early in this, thanks for the question. We are relatively early in this. Obviously the Global 2000, maybe the Global 5000 had tested this, but even there the penetration is still 30%. Even if you look at Citrix's data, the enterprise seats is not the same as the number of employees in these large enterprises, and I think large accounts are probably one-third penetrated right now, but the mid-market is yet another very large market and outside the U.S. I think there is a lot more that will get digital.  So I believe that this end user computing digital workspace will actually get redefined and it's probably in its early innings, maybe the second innings more so than the fifth or sixth actually, and it's not just the future of work, it's also future of healthcare and future of education.  Today there was a really good piece on CNN about universities. They have basically grown their fee structure like 1,400%, 14,000% or 1,400%, I can't remember the exact number, but over the last 40 years nothing has changed in terms of their courseware and the way they impart education. So there's a lot of things that are up here for grabs in higher education, state and local, as well as middle school and high school education plus in healthcare and work as well. Duston, you want to take that? Yeah, thanks for the question. HPE, very good partnership. It's been about 2.5 quarters, I would say since it began. They definitely have a global presence and our sellers are working together hand-in-hand managing these accounts. The PC [ph] goals a little early I would say, simply because we haven't put all our products in there, but some of the large customer, especially after COVID we've started to see questions emerge, a lot more questions emerge about, can we take entire Nutanix portfolio and have it transfer through GreenLake.  I think it's a pretty novel concept and there's some interesting partnership opportunities with HP and us, especially in the world of Xi you know. They are talking about Telcos and many of these service providers who currently buy hardware with CapEx. I think GreenLake needs a killer app and Nutanix can be the killer app on top of GreenLake and especially as we take this to GSI's and Telcos and service providers, all of whom actually, would be very willing to look at hardware in an OpEx model rather than CapEx."

            "name": "Duston Williams",
            "content": "Thank you, Dheeraj. With all the disruption and uncertainty that COVID-19 has caused, we were pleased to be able to deliver solid Q3 results in-line with or in the case of EPS, better than our expectations heading into the quarter.  As you may recall, when we issued our Q3 guidance in late February, we saw early indications that COVID-19 would cause a demand issue for our APJ operations and we adjusted our guidance accordingly. We did not adjust our outlook for our Americans or EMEA operations as the virus's impact on these regions was uncertain at that time. The virus clearly ended up affecting all three regions and despite this our teams did an excellent job executing in a very turbulent environment.  We also mentioned that we are starting to prudently manage our operating expenses during our Q2 earnings call. This proactive and timely approach was based on our view that it was possible that the current demand environment could deteriorate due to the impact of COVID-19. Once our initial premise of a weakening demand environment began to play out, we immediately took even further actions to reduce expenses, which I will return to a bit later.  Our subscription journey continues to move forward as selling term based subscriptions have clearly become the norm. Subscriptions billings now account for 84% of total billings, up from 79% in Q2, and subscription revenue now accounts for 82% of total revenue, up from 77% in Q2. The average dollar weighted term length in Q3 \u201820 including renewals was 3.9 years, flat with the 3.9 years we reported in Q2 \u201820. As with last quarter, this calculation assumes life of device licenses of five-year terms.  Now I'll move on to some specific Q3 financial highlights. TCV revenue or our software and support revenue for the third quarter came within our initial guidance range of $300 million to $320 million and above our May 5 estimated preliminary results range of $307 million to $312 million, coming in at $314 million, up 18% from the year ago quarter. TCV billings or software and support billings also came within our initial guidance range of $365 million to $385 million and above our May 5 estimated preliminary results range of $371 million to $376 million, coming in at $380 million, up 17% from the year ago quarter.  ACV booked in the quarter exceeding our expectations was $130 million and was up 22% from the year ago quarter. Additionally, total revenue also exceeded our May 5 estimated preliminary results range of $312 million to $317 million, coming in at $318 million, up 11% from the year ago quarter.  We used a modest amount of backlog during the quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter that we've experienced year-over-year growth in total revenue. The revenue growth rates are starting to reflect more meaningful comparisons as the revenue impacting hardware elimination has been effectively complete for the last six months. The ACV of our HPE DX related business increased 16% in the quarter versus Q2.  We exceeded our pipeline generation goal for Q3 that was set before the quarter started. As expected, new customer bookings lagged a bit in the quarter, representing 19% of total TCV versus 24% in Q3 '19 and down from 24% in Q2 \u201820. The America's and EMEA regions performed well. As expected, the APJ regional performance reflected more pronounced impact from the COVID-19 related issues.  TCV bookings or software support bookings from our international regions represented 44% of total bookings versus 45% in Q3 \u201819. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 80.7% above our guidance of 80%.  Operating expenses were $390 million, significantly below our guidance range of $420 million to $430 million. The lower than expected expense number for the quarter was mostly due to the hiring pause implemented early in the quarter, reduced travel, as well as overall expense management. And our non-GAAP net loss was $135 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.69 per share versus our guidance of a loss of $0.89 per share.  Now a few balance sheet highlights. We closed the quarter with cash and short term investments of $732 million. DSO's in Q3 were 67 days versus 76 days in Q3 '19, and 65 days in Q2 \u201820. Free cash flow during the quarter was negative $117 million. This performance was negatively impacted by $23 million of ESPP outflow in the quarter, higher than we expected due to the lower Nutanix stock price.  Free cash flow was also negatively impacted based on a somewhat higher than expected accounts receivable balance and higher capital expenditures. Our Q4 capital expenditures should be substantially less than the Q3 total of $33 million.  Now, a few comments turning to the future. As we have mentioned a few times, despite all the economic uncertainty that most companies are dealing with in today's environment, we were generally pleased with our Q3 results. As we look forward to Q4 and beyond, we remain very excited of what the future holds for Nutanix.  We are a much stronger and better company today than we were just 12 months ago. We continue to aggressively move forward with our subscription journey, our non-core products are starting to get serious traction in some of our largest accounts and our sales leadership continues to improve, all with the backdrop of a pipeline that is significantly larger than just one year ago.  Although the future clearly looks encouraging, the short term comes with a high degree of uncertainty. We are still in an unprecedented, volatile time period and importantly, we are still in the early innings of transforming our business to a subscription model fueled by low cost renewables.  While we're making great progress on the transformation, we have not yet reached the point where the predictable renewal business makes up a substantial portion of our quarterly results. We are getting there, but for now, new business and up sell business, areas with greater inherent uncertainty still account for a vast majority of our quarterly billings. Accordingly, we do not believe it's prudent to provide guidance for Q4.  But as I said, we're encouraged with the progress we're making. We spent the last year and a half building a subscription business that will ultimately lead to a much more predictable business. With 84% of our billings in the quarter now coming from subscriptions, combined with a customer retention metric of 97%, at this point we believe it's largely a matter of time until the business matures to a new level of predictability.  As such, at this time we plan to issue annual guidance for FY \u201821 during our Q4 conference call, with any top line guidance most likely focused on ACV and with growth rates appropriately correlated to the current macro environment. What we do know about FY \u201821 is that our teams will be ready, our product will be ready and our subscription model will be ready to take full advantage of any economic recovery that might take place.  In the meantime, in lieu of specific guidance for Q4, I'll provide a few thoughts around specific areas that we are focusing on and in which investors frequently show interest.  Expense management: As Dheeraj noted, we have been aggressively managing the expense structure since mid Q2 and will continue to do so moving forward. Hiring has been extremely limited; merit increases and bonuses have been paused; executive salaries have been reduced; and we've implemented two non-consecutive single weeks of unpaid time off for most of our employees worldwide, one week in Q4 and one week in Q1.  Major events such as .NEXT and our worldwide sales meetings will go virtual, along with many other cost savings initiatives. This early and aggressive action to control expenses in the near term, all while keeping relentless focus on the customer, have clearly paid off base on the Q3 operating expenses coming in $40 million lower than the high end of our range of previous guidance.  Going forward, we will continue to actively manage the expense structure as the macro environment dictates. For the immediate future, we would expect operating expenses to hover at somewhere around $375 million to $400 million per quarter.  Cash management and free cash flow: Again, our early and aggressive expense management has put us in a pretty good position to control the cash burn over the next several quarters. Our hiring has been very limited and whatever hiring that will take place will involve around highly critical roles, as well as some hiring around customer facing roles such as sales teams, professional services and support. Going forward we would expect the cash usage to decrease significantly from Q3 and we will continue to do what is required to minimize cash usage in the future.  A few comments on sales compensation: You know we continue to move aggressively to align our sales compensation plans to support a subscription based model, and starting in the first half of FY \u201821 we will move to either a partial or full ACV sales comp model. This is the first step in setting up a comp structure to take advantage of the natural leverage a subscription model affords.  Renewals: Renewals have become a major focus area for the company, and will be the foundation to build a profitable business going forward. We're in the process of setting up roles and responsibilities within the various organizations to make sure renewals are efficiently transacted. The available to renew pool of subscription transactions is just starting to come into play. In Q3 we transacted about $5 million in non-support related subscription renewals and the pool available to renew will grow to approximately $10 million in Q4.  A few thoughts on operating leverage: The subscription business model and operating leverage go hand-in-hand. Many investors routinely ask us, why our sales and marketing cost structure does not line up closely with other subscription businesses? Before we answer this question, some context is needed.  As you recall, we started our subscription journey back in the first half of FY \u201819 when the company was approaching a billings run rate of $1.5 billion. Since then we have transitioned a substantial portion of our business to a term based subscription model with average term duration of less than four years.  Subscription based businesses derive considerable operating leverage from their renewal base and most mature subscription companies probably have a renewal base that comes close to 50% of their total billings. Today all of our subscription renewals account for less than 10% of Nutanix's total billings, or to put it another way, more than 90% of our business today is still composed of new and upsell business; business that is costly to transact.  Compare this to renewals which are transacted at a low cost, much lower than new business or upsell business. As such, it is reasonable to expect a wide gap in operating leverage profiles from two different subscription companies. One, with less than 10% of their total business derived from renewals and the other with 50% of their total business coming from renewals.  As our subscription business matures and our renewals also become a substantial percentage of our total business, we believe it is realistic to assume that Nutanix over time will begin to display somewhat similar operating leverage characteristics as other mature subscription companies. To-date only the negative aspects of our subscription transition, mostly around topline compression related to terms and pricing, have been well documented and have carried the headlines. We refer to these negative aspects as the investments into our subscription transition.  Much of the financial content for our previously postponed Investor Day was aimed to focus on the future positive aspects of our subscription transition, mostly around why the renewal inflow will naturally provide significant operating leverage over time, just like every other subscription company. We refer to these positive aspects of the transition as the return on our subscription investments and the aforementioned move to ACV based compensation for our sales force will ultimately position us to garner this leverage from the renewal inflow. After all, every substantial investment requires a substantial return on that investment.  We look forward to sharing a more detailed view of our go-forward operational plan and corresponding financial targets at an appropriate time in the future. With that operator, you can now open the call up to questions. Thank you. Yeah, why not? I can start on that one. You know you can't do this work without worrying about not FY '21, but FY \u201822 also to your point, because you know the easiest thing for us to do again would be you know to completely stop everything and not worry about the future growth, but we can't do that. So you know we've done a lot of scenario planning downside base case, best case, and within that environment you have to have a view on FY \u201822 or those scenarios don't work well. So I think the other comment there is don't ignore the fact that we have excess sales capacity coming into this downturn also, so it's not like you know we were razor thin on capacity. So we've clearly got more capacity, so you know it's a fine line we walk and that's why I think we've done some pretty prudent things that you know again, kind of affect everybody and not you know singling you know folks out, because everybody's going to take part in the growth going forward. So I think we've done this thoughtfully, and we'll adjust it every week, every month, every quarter as we need to based on what's happening. Yeah. Again, this is something that we look at all the time with scenarios, and they say this downside base case, best case, and based on our view of those scenarios top-line potential and what we have done with expenses and the levers that we can pull with expenses. We feel really good about our cash balance throughout FY '21, based on what we've scenario out in those three cases there.  The markets are reasonably open. The terms in some of these - the terms are reasonably good, but again, what we've looked at we feel pretty good going forward. I think if we were at some point to raise cash in the future, it would be more around tilted to giving us some optionality with our continued subscription transition. It would be more tilted to that rather than day-to-day stuff. And this would be more potentially around, do we want to have average terms shrink down a little bit further from where they are today, about 3.9.  Because we know two things happen, that makes the business much more profitable with some a little bit lower terms, and that's lower discounting because the lower the term, the lower the discounting. That's highly leverageable from a business model perspective. And the shorter the term, the quicker that deal comes up for renewal and with a 97% retention rate, the quicker that deal comes up for renewal, the quicker we get an efficient deal levered into the business coming at a much, much lower cost.  So if we were going to do something, it would be more around, again, that optionality to make the business much more profitable and you know we've got the current debenture out there, but that's January '23 timeframe. So there's lots of optionality around that, too. Yeah. Again, some things are volatile and we're early into Q4, you know 3.5 weeks or so into our Q4 and again a lot of companies with a subscription-based business are giving that guidance with a substantial portion of their business coming up for renewals that they know is going to renew. I mean we're dealing with a chunk less than 10% of our business in that category.  So, it's kind of apples and oranges comparison there, and I gave you some pretty good thoughts about Q4, but for us to go put a range in there now with only less than 10% of the business coming in naturally, we just thought we'd pause for a quarter, and then let things play out macro-wise a little bit and then come back with a fresh view of FY '21. Jason, even for conventional businesses, if you look at, let's say VMware, 60% of the business is renewals. For us it's much less than 10%. So, it's not just about subscription companies. It's about most companies that actually have a renewal business. No, not of the quarterly bookings, no. No, in its entirety Jason, that percentage of recurring, whether you want to call it quarter or now subscription renewals is less than 10%, so substantially different. I mean that's what we're building up, that's the whole story here which we're talking about, is that we know those renewals as a percentage of the total business, those renewals are going to increase and they're going to increase over time, we've done close to $5 million last quarter.  We've got a pool of $10 million for this quarter, that's going continue to accelerate. But today, because we started this only a year and a half ago, these renewals just haven't timed out. That's why a little lower term is probably a good thing ultimately, because those renewals flow in quicker than they normally would have. Yeah, I mean, we have that all laid out for Investor Day. We'll do that probably when we give '21 guidance. Actually, it's very simple for folks to go model, because you know our average deal length and you know what we've done from a subscription perspective. So, it's pretty easy. That's kind of the exciting thing. I think it's pretty easy to go and see this and touch it and feel it, because it does by definition become a pretty substantial piece of the business going forward and again, those renewals, just like every other subscription-based company, come in with a very high efficiency factor.  So that's kind of the exciting stuff going forward. Just getting back to the Q4 guide, I wouldn't read anything specific into us not providing this. We just think that there's some volatility that you know we prudently, probably, shouldn't guide, but things look reasonably okay right now. But it's early and it's a period that's never happened before. I've certainly never seen it, so that's the view, but I wouldn't read anything specifically into that. No, I'm sorry, Dheeraj. Go ahead, sorry. Sure. I wouldn't expect all that much difference quite honestly. The product is very compelling; the value-add is compelling. I mentioned about how AHV becomes even more compelling in a cost conscious environment, which we're starting to see there. We've run those numbers through Q3, the quarter just ended, and there was probably still rounds to around 47 or 97 I'm sorry. So I wouldn't expect to see too much change there over the next several quarters, but you know we'll see."

            "content": "Yeah, just on that, new customer is around 700 in the quarter. So we'll have to sync up with you one and those two numbers. But yeah, the pipeline \u2013 and I guess maybe your question is more kind of Q4 in general and where we haven't given any specific guidance it's probably a question that will come up sooner or later. So you know why haven't I kind of answered your question and maybe a little bit of a bigger question. Now Q4; again you know in my comments I mentioned pipeline, a Q3 generation exceeded our target and it was the biggest in-quarter pipe that we generated in our history. So you know that's clearly encouraging. And if you look at Q4, now we're only you know roughly three weeks into the quarter, so you know take that for what it's worth. But, you know on the surface there's not many things that look terribly out of line. Now you know the results won't be as good as we thought they would be pre-COVID, but if you go down and look at conversion rates, you now where we should be three plus weeks into the quarter; where we are from you know what's converted from pipeline, that looks okay; the loss rates are actually a little bit lower, the sales cost or a one-to-one linearity is within the bounds of what we would expect historically in months to cumulative, the same thing. We closed several million dollar deals. I think at least three this week and a couple of those were spillovers that we thought was going to close in Q3, actually closed this week; two fed deals you know that pushed from Q3.  You know if you look at EMEA, there's some good stuff going on there with new customers and partners starting to get engaged there with some public sector activity that looks really encouraging, and you know AHV not surprisingly is getting I think some renewed attention from a cost savings perspective, because [inaudible] you know we clearly got something there for them with AHV. And APAC you know was first impacted and that's starting to open up and there's some reasonable news within some countries there. I think India and China are still obviously struggling, but you know not too bad, and you know to get to your question on pipe \u2013 the pipeline is there, there's no doubt about it. The sales capacity is there, there's no doubt about that, but deals are volatile and they are still volatile. So you know us not giving Q4 guidance, we mentioned that we wouldn't be doing this May 5, so there's really no surprise there. And then, you know the comment was that again, it's just a little tougher in a volatile period for us to given specific guidance, just because you know again less than 10% of our business is truly no business at this point. But when you go all through the metrics and stuff, you know there's some really good stuff happening. The product is performing really well, sales teams are executing all that; it's just the very, very volatile period."

And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dheeraj.\nDheeraj Pandey: Thanks, Tonya. Q2 was another strong quarter and I\u2019m pleased to see continued execution from across our organization. Our TCV billings came in on the high end of our guidance range and our TCV revenue gross margin and EPS all exceeded our guidance despite a softer US federal business. Further our deferred revenue surpassed a $1 billion for the first time this quarter growing 35% year-over-year. Business is robust and our transition is well ahead of our internal plans. But we\u2019re also in an environment that is more key due to the impact of the Coronavirus. Dealing with the unknown for the first time in the company\u2019s decade long history hence we\u2019re cautious about our second half guidance which Duston will delve into soon.  Since we began our transition to a subscription business model in Q1 of FY 2019. We\u2019ve regularly highlighted the areas of a business that are evolving along the way. After another strong quarter of progress I would like to emphasis few areas of the business that stood out in the quarter. First was a faster than expected transmission to subscription. Second, our growing number of large deals and the continued adoption of new products and solutions beyond our core. Third, the momentum we\u2019re seeing in a commercial business and finally, our promising partnership with HPE which continues to bring us new customers and once again outperformed our expectations during the quarter. A key driver for our improved sales execution over the past year has been the strong leadership of Chris Kaddaras in the Americas and EMEA in the years before that. Chris joined us as an EMEA sales leader more than three years ago, right around when we went public. We were tiny company back then almost one-third the revenue, one-fourth the number of customers, an appliance business model and a single product in our portfolio. We\u2019ve come a long way since then. The sales force in this time has endured a dramatic transition in the business model, learned to sell software and really strive to master the portfolio selling approach that most companies could only dream of. Chris is also [indiscernible] careful segmentation of the up market business in the last two years both in EMEA and in Americas. If you recall we set out to segment our business almost three years ago as the muscle to go beyond a billion of annual sales required last customers, a profound customer success culture and a strong portfolio of products that are secured and reliable. Large customers do not buy point products, they buy a platform and operating system that can be for multiple used cases. I\u2019m happy to report that our large enterprise business has flourished in the last 18 months. Ever since we started down the path of the subscription transition. We now have 18 customers with lifespan spend greater than $20 million up from 12 a year ago. Their aggregate lifetime spend is almost $600 million up 56% year-over-year. The largest three cohorts of lifetime spend $10 million to $15 million, $15 million to $20 million and $20 million plus dollars have now collectively grown more than 60% year-over-year both in number of total accounts and in aggregate dollar spent. There are 60 customers that fall into those cohorts and those 60 customers now account for more than $1 billion of lifetime spend with us. We have 220 accounts that have each spent more than $4 million lifetime spend, accounting for more than $2 billion lifetime and this cohort has grown nearly 50% year-over-year. Subscription, compression notwithstanding. And finally the cohort of the $1 million plus customers has grown in the lifetime spend but more than 40% year-over-year subscription compression notwithstanding. Specifically in Q2, we closed 52 deals worth over $1 million in the quarter including 11 deals worth over $3 million which includes three deals over $5 million. 11 of these customers also spend at least $1 million with us last quarter and more than half substantially increase their node count with us during the quarter. Notably TCV bookings from our top 10 customers in Q2 increased approximately 30% from the previous quarter. We now have 1,060 customers with at least a $1 million in lifetime spend up 36% year-over-year. We have 880 of the Global 2000 as customers including three of the Forbes Global 5, eight of the Forbes Global 10 and 70 of the Forbes Global 100. All in all we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of selling and competing in large account segment profoundly disrupting the hardware and perpetual software incumbence. This is why I\u2019m happy to announce the thoughtful architect of this enduring transition, Chris Kaddaras is now going to be a global leader of the company as Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales. He\u2019s equally passionate about the commercial midmarket and has been busy working in the other end of go-to-market barbell US commercial, more in this later.  Speaking of our ongoing subscription transition which Chris is also a big champion of, we outperformed our own internal plans seeing our percentage of billings attributed to subscription increased to 79% up from 73% in Q1, that well surpassed the guidance of 75% by Q4 of FY \u201820 we laid out earlier this year. Our large deals and our existing large customers are moving to subscription at rapid pace. Case in point is the largest lifetime customer who has spent $78 million lifetime with us. This full stack customer sparked the idea of building our own hypervisor AHV with us more than six years ago. They spent more than $5 million for this quarter to convert some of their renewals subscription. Similarly a large Fortune 500 insurance company that is an existing customer [indiscernible] an additional $1.5 million worth of our software subscription bringing their lifetime purchase to more than $6 million. This repeat purchase is due in part to Nutanix delivering on its commitment to mission critical availability and disaster recovery SLA\u2019s. The simplicity for solution the reason why government agencies are such large repeat customers of Nutanix as they\u2019re constantly challenged and talent and skill sets. These agencies are now embracing subscription without friction. One such example is our existing customer an agency in EMEA that supports asylum seekers with spent $1.5 million this quarter. Bringing their lifetime spend to more than $4 million. New customers are also looking at subscription terms by default. Case in point, a large multinational banking forum, a top 10 global 2000 company did a subscription deal that was worth $1 million this quarter as a first time customer. Our biggest deal of the quarter exemplified the partnerships, subscription model and new products all together in the same opportunity. This repeat Fortune 10 Company invested more than $17 million in subscription licenses this quarter to continue modernizing their IT infrastructure. This value customer which now is nearly $58 million of lifetime bookings with us, just in the last 18 months views us a critical partner in their journey to hybrid cloud which requires secure, reliable and easy to manage cloud services. Their purchase also included Nutanix Files, our software defined scale out filer and Xi Frame, our desktop and service offering. Speaking of portfolio selling. We saw continued momentum in the adoption of new products in the quarter 31% of deals on a rolling four quarter basis included at least one product outside of the company\u2019s HCI offering up from 21% in Q2 of last year. In addition, TCV billings from new products reached to record high in the quarter growing 99% year-over-year. We believe we one of the reasons for the increased attach rate of new products to our core software\u2019s increased focused on package solutions. Solutions to us is about offering our customers a choice between good, better and best and more often than not speaking their language which many a time is vertical specific. For example in an end user computing solution we now offer our customers a progressively cured experience modernizing [indiscernible] three-tier hardware to selling one click filers and data protection, to selling one click disaster recovery, to selling data and network security. With this approach, we\u2019re working the whole body of IT transformation too simple yet profound themes. Simplicity and reliability. Case in point, in how our simple and reliable message is resonating. There\u2019s a net new Fortune 50 telecom customer who\u2019ve spent more than $3 million with us, all age [indiscernible] files to modernize their call center infrastructure. A similar customer when their highlighted traction for solution selling was with the financial services provider in EMEA. They subscribed to more than three million of Xi Leap cloud services this quarter for their end user computing and disaster recovery needs. This solution based workflow driven approach also drove traction with an existing customer leading back in Mexico, who spent more than $1.5 million in subscription licenses. They purchase our product for operations management, multi-cloud orchestration and multi-cloud cost [indiscernible], but a large part of their purchase decision was to use Nutanix\u2019s ERA to offer a true databases service experience for the internal cloud. ERA was also a big reason why we won a large $1.5 million with a government ministry in Saudi, their Oracle database is extremely popular and private cloud is in high demand. In a world that is rethinking globalization and doubling down in data sovereignty, private clouds and customer\u2019s premises are becoming a pervasive discussion, an example of that was a deal in Europe was $1 million with one of the busiest airports in the world, who selected us to be the standard for their private cloud as they transition from legacy hardware and perpetual license software to a true web scale, software defined infrastructure driven by subscription licensing. Our multi-cloud control plains for automation, security compliance and cost covenants, calm and being respectively were instrumental in our sales campaign here. Our automation and multi-cloud orchestration Calm is all about DevOps. We\u2019re going deeper into DevOps with application lifecycle management, containers, databases and object storage. An existing global 2000 customer in the aerospace and defense industry brought their lifetime spend with Nutanix $2.5 million by purchasing Nutanix\u2019s says newer products to support the organizations DevOps. They are big users of Calm and also Flow for consumer grade networking and security. Flow and subscription licensing roles are the two big reasons why we did a large $2 million deal with a mission critical communications customer in EMEA. Not only did they select our core HCI software and native hypervisor AHV. The selected number of our new products including Flow has the simplicity of microsegmentation was key to their cybersecurity modernization. Security has become a core value proposition for our overall portfolio both on-prem and off-prem as the Zero Trust cyber security culture becomes pervasive in the enterprise. Zero Trust is a security concept centered in paranoia, a belief that organization should not automatically trust anything outside or inside it\u2019s perimeters and that machines and applications are already compromised. We recently hired a Chief Product Security Officer, Indu Keri with vast experience in cybersecurity from his past life. Indus is bringing an encrypt everything, microsegment everything, audit and analyze everything and an integrated approach to a Zero Trust security posture. Our DNA and simplicity and reliability is now key to making security invisible just like Apple did with its devices. On top of our software, our customers are not just running Splunk security and virtual firewalls, but also building fraud detection application. As will illustrated by more than $5 million deal with a large credit card financial services firm this quarter. This Fortune 500 company is nearly $13 million of lifetime TCV spend with us and values are ease-of-use, simple upgrade process and most importantly platform security which was core to their decision making.  On the subject of innovation in reliable and secured products. We continue to make steady progress across our multi-cloud, multi-product portfolio. In Q2, we made our hyperconverge backup products Nutanix\u2019s Mine with Veeam and HYCU generally available. This integrated data protection solution combines the power of the leading backup software offerings, all the benefits of our platform including HCI for compute and block storage and files and objects for deep storage. Backup and Splunk are killer used cases for our semi and unstructured data offerings files and objects. Our Objects product has come out resounding well in its first full quarter since general availability. In a deal worth nearly $1 million, a managed service provider in the US chose our full stack to create their own cloud offering backup and archival services that provide a simple consumption model for DevOps, disaster recovery and analytics workloads. Nutanix\u2019s Objects was a critical factor and their decision to go all in with us and replace multiple competitors. We also launched Karbon 2.0, Karbon with a K which dramatically simplifies, the configuration, deployment and lifecycle management of Kubernetes containers clusters. Karbon brings a simplicity of containers in the public cloud to a multi-cloud environment. Based on top of our core HCI, it delivers a full cloud native environment in all computing locations, public, private or edge. Response from customers including a major US airline and a leading consumer packaged goods company has been very positive. Karbon has enabled them to fast track their production Kubernetes deployments and has enabled public cloud user experience. Beyond the DevOps ecosystem during the quarter we also announced that our software is optimized around Epic\u2019s Operational Database. The most prevalent database system for healthcare companies in the US. We\u2019re going deep in the Epic healthcare EMR community. Had a time, when Epic is very carefully choosing it\u2019s cloud partners. On partnerships, while we\u2019ve done a good job with Dell, Lenovo, Fujitsu and others. Our synergy with HPE are looking strong in our first full quarter of joint selling.  Under our Chief Commercial Officer, Tarkan Maner\u2019s leadership both parties are bringing deals in customers to each other to learn co-selling and co-marketing. As an example in a win worth more than $4 million, a Global 2000 healthcare company which has a lifetime spend of $14 million took advantage for subscription licensing to run our cloud services on HPE servers. There\u2019s a one of three deals greater than $3 million in the pharmaceutical industry of vertical that is increasingly turning to Nutanix to build secure private clouds. In financial services we took a similar approach with HPE one of the big four account firms in a deal worth $1 million and a account that has spent almost $12 million with us lifetime, on the strength of our core software and our multi-cloud automation offering. And we also saw another $4 million of subscription deal this quarter with HPE, at a Fortune 100 financial services customers that has spent more than $23 million lifetime with us. Similar to Q1, well over half of the HPE [ph] customers new logos to Nutanix. Customers clearly see the value working with two world class technology partners and together we\u2019re winning competitive deals. Nearly one quarter of our new customers in the commercial segment purchased Nutanix software in HPE servers. As we mentioned before the other end of the barbell i.e. the commercial midmarket is extremely important for a company that has done so well in large enterprises and aspires to go to its third billion in annual subscription sales. We saw a solid quarter in terms of new customers, but we could do better. Our approximately 920 new customers rated our total customer count to 15,880. I\u2019m happy to report that our focus in the commercial segment has produced positive returns on our investment. The hard work we\u2019ve done to ramp partners is paying off. We saw a strong uptick in partner initiated deals in this segment. Our commercial business focus is also leading to more predictable revenue streams that complement a larger chunkier enterprise deals. Big market accounts can be very large as well especially in US commercial and both Chris and our US commercial leader, John know this well. Leading provider of business legal, tax and digital brand services to companies around the globe, that have spent more than $30 million over the course of our relationship converted from their removals to subscription in a deal worth an incremental $3 million this quarter. They\u2019re using our multi-cloud orchestration services Calm, our database service offering Era and Kubernetes platform, Karbon. The commercial segment is proving to be fertile ground for our new product adoption particularly [indiscernible] and Files. One of the reasons why partnerships such as HP and Citrix are flourishing because we\u2019ve built a reliable platform that has an extremely good [indiscernible] business profile. A large multinational pharmaceutical company and existing customer [indiscernible] spent $3.5 million with us this quarter bringing their lifetime spend to $10 million. We\u2019ve become a strategic partner to them as our platform runs most of their primary applications that help them discover, develop and launch breakthrough medicines. Reliability of our products is also the reason why another for large existing customers of Fortune 500 healthcare company which has spent nearly $35 million with us lifetime bought $4 million worth of additional software to build their dispersed private cloud across more than 100 hospitals. Exact same story with large electric utility company in the US which doubled down with our software over $3 million deal this quarter to bring their lifetime spend to $14 million.  These in Nutanix to build applications and services to help their customers reduce power consumption. Reliability of webscale applications and commodity service is the reason why we had yet another of our large Fintech customers in the US spent $2.5 million this quarter. Bringing their overall spend to $16 million lifetime. Reliability of customer service has reflected in the average Net Promoter Score or NPS of 90 was a big reason for one of our other large existing Fortune 500 customers. A large professional services from dealing with risk and strategy spent an additional $1.5 million in our software for the end user computing needs bringing their lifetime spend to $15 million. Reliability and simplicity of our disaster recovery and business continuity solutions were the primary reason why we won another $2 million deal at a large EMEA government agency dealing with public pensions, bringing their lifetime spend to $11 million. The voices of these happy repeat customers that are big part of the reason why they have been recognized as a leader for the third year in a row in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, a hyperconverged infrastructure. Scoring the highest of all evaluator and the ability to execute access.  Our obsession with simplicity, design and customer delight is what sets up apart. This is also why we were awarded Champion Status in the 2019 Canalys EMEA Channel Leadership Matrix. This honor was a result of partners who ranked Nutanix the highest amongst all hyperconverged infrastructure companies in channel management through EMEA based on our continued investments in channel incentives, enablement resources and customer support. Our culture and principal have been our internal compass to help us through the highs and lows company building and have helped us navigate the complexities of growth and global presence. Despite 2019 being the toughest year in our 10-year history and business model transitions in public markets do make you tough. We were thrilled to be on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work for list. Nutanix was one of the, only eight new companies to be added to the list in 2020. And one of only two information technology companies. The best part about achieving this certification is that it\u2019s predominantly driven [indiscernible] feedback and our employees resounding have opened that they cared for the mission. Speaking of the mission, the cloud is new server [ph] for us. As Xi Wall [ph] for making on-prem infrastructure invisible to making cloud locations invisible, our true worth remain steadfast. Delivered simplicity, choice and delight to our customers. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Duston. Duston?\nDuston Williams: Thank you Dheeraj. In Q2 we made outstanding progress on our continued shift to a subscription business. Subscription billings increased significantly and now account for 79% of total billings up from 73% in Q1. And subscription revenue now accounts for 77% of total revenue and that\u2019s up from 69% in Q1.  We repeatedly stated that it\u2019s our desire to move forward through the subscription transition as fast as possible as we made great progress on this goal in the quarter. Our execution in this area far exceeded our expectations in Q2 significantly surpassing our FY \u201820 Q4 goal of 75% and almost equaling our stated CY \u201821 goal of 80% mentioned at least year\u2019s Investor Day. It should come as no surprise that the short-term downside to this faster than expected push to subscription is the impact of the top line. Based both on term compression when compared to life of device deals and some pricing differential between our life of device licenses and our term based offerings. We expect to recover this top line impact as renewals come in overtime. This impact of the faster than expected push to subscription is reflected in our Q3 in fiscal year 2020 top line guidance. Exclusive of our professional services billings, our goal is to ultimately drive our subscription billings to 100% of total billings.  The average dollar weighted term length in Q2 \u201820 including renewals was 3.9 years flat with the 3.9 years we reported in Q1 \u201820. As with last quarter this calculation assumes life of device licenses or five-year terms. Some specific Q2 financial highlights; TCV revenue or software and support revenue for the second quarter exceeded our guidance range of $330 million to $335 million coming in at $338 million up from 14% a year ago and up 11% from the previous quarter. TCV billings, our software and support billings were $420 million versus our guidance of $410 million to $420 million up 12% from the year ago quarter and up 13% from the prior quarter. The TCV billings were negatively impacted by approximately $5 million due to the faster than expected shift to subscription. ACV booked in the quarter was $130 million and was up 18% from the year ago quarter. As a reminder with our discussion in Q1, we defined ACV as the annual contract value of new business plus the annual contract of renewals and we calculate ACV by taking the value of each transaction booked in the quarter including renewals but excluding professional services divided by its term length and then summing the total of those values.  While we saw a number of positives to our expectations, our federal business underperformed our expectations in the quarter. this business has always been somewhat lumpy in terms of timing and the significant portion of the federal miss [ph] was related to large deals that we believe were not lost, but rather pushed out to future quarters whoever the time to close these deals is uncertain. New customers bookings represent 24% of total bookings in the quarter versus 26% in Q2, 2019 and up from 23% in Q1, 2020. Our HPE DX related business continued its strong performance and accounted for 117 new customers. For the second quarter in a row the Americas was our best performing region in Q2. TCV bookings, our software and support bookings from our international regions represent 49% of total bookings versus the same 49% in Q2, 2019. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 81.4% exceeding our guidance of 80%. We expect gross margins to hover in the 80% range plus or minus a little bit over the next several quarters. Operating expenses were $396 million below our guidance range to $400 million to $410 million and our non-GAAP net loss was $116 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.60 per share. Now looking at few quick things on the balance sheet, we closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $819 million. We used $52 million of cash flow from operations in Q2 which was positively impacted by $19 million of ESPP inflow and free cash flow during the quarter was negative $74 million and this performance was also positively impacted by the $19 million of ESPP inflow. Now turning to the details of our fiscal 2020 guidance on a non-GAAP basis for fiscal 2020. TCV, we expect TCV billings to be between $1.6 billion and $1.67 billion versus our previous guidance of between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion. TCV revenue to be between $1.29 billion and $1.36 billion versus our previous guidance of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Gross margin of approximately 80.5%. Operating expenses between $1.63 and $1.65 billion versus our previous guidance of $1.65 to $1.7 billion. This guidance is impacted by a much faster than expected transition to subscription and a more cautious view on our business activities in the greater APJ due to the anticipated impact of the Coronavirus. Further, this FY 2020 guidance yields an operating loss and free usage that is roughly in line with current consensus estimates of $550 million and $250 million respectively. The implied ACV based on the FY \u201820 guide is approximately $505 million. The guidance for FY 2020 assumes no change to the current dollar weighted average deal terms currently as 3.9 years. And our guidance also does not assume any meaningful disruption to the global server related supply chain linked to the temporary factory closures in China. For additional clarity, of the $50 million to $80 million decrease in TCV billings guidance range, approximately $25 million to $30 million is related to the faster than expected transition to subscription with the remaining amount attributed to the reduction in our APJ region sales plan. Our APJ region is more dependent on new business in any given quarter. And with the shutdown and China and the slowness and uncertainty being exhibited in other APJ countries, we believe it\u2019s prudent to take a cautious view of APJ performance for the next few quarters. Our cautious APJ view also includes Japan, which generally operates under a March fiscal year end period. We have a few large deals pending in Japan, and which we assume a reduced portion will close in Q3. Based on our current outlook, both the Americas and EMEA region seem to be in a good position to deliver their expected results for the second half of fiscal 2020. This, of course, assumes that the business interruptions in the APJ region from the Coronavirus does not spread to these regions too. As our updated operating guidance suggest, excluding sales teams and a few other select roles, we are recently taking a pause on a significant portion of our planned headcount in the second half of our fiscal year, contributing to $20 million to $50 million expense reduction from our previous guidance range. Regarding our hiring, we have slowed headcount for the following two reasons. First, we would like to have more clarity to see if there might be any further potential disruption related to the impact of the Coronavirus, and whether that disruption spreads to other portions of the world. And secondly, quite honestly, it puts us in a better position to more efficiently integrate the 1,400 or so employees we\u2019ve added over the last year. Regardless of this headcount pause, we still plan to hire for critical roles on an as needed basis. We view this selected headcount pause as simply the right thing to do, and is in no way related to any change to our overall positive view of our business going forward. Now, turning to our Q3 guidance. On a non GAAP basis for Q3, we expect TCV billings to be between $365 million and $385 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 13% to 19%.TCV revenue to be between $300 million and $320 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13% 20%. Gross margin of approximately 80%; operating expenses between $420 million and $430 million and a per share loss of approximately $0.89, using weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $196 million. The Q3 guidance also reflects the much faster than expected transition to subscription and a more cautious view in our business activities in the greater APJ region due to the Coronavirus, consistent with my comments on our fiscal year 2020 guidance. Additionally, the sequential decline in our FY \u201820 Q3 implied booking guidance, which at the midpoint of the guide assumes a 7% sequential decline is actually better than what we experienced for actual FY \u201818 and FY \u201819 Q2 to Q3 sequential historical bookings performance, which was approximately a 10% sequential decline. Furthermore, the sequential increase in our FY \u201820 Q4 implied booking guidance, which at the midpoint of the guide assumes a 25% sequential increase is also in line with our FY \u201818 and our FY \u201819 actual Q3 to Q4 sequential historical bookings performance, which was a financial increase of 33% and 25% respectively. The current consensus numbers for TCV sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 and from Q3 to Q4 are quite misaligned to the historical averages. Our Q3 guidance and the applied Q4 guidance brings these sequential growth rates back in line with historical averages. As you are aware, FY \u201820 was our first year providing annual guidance. With this approach, the yearly guidance gets updated each quarter, and we also give quarterly guidance for the upcoming quarter. For example, during Q1 earnings call, we provided an updated annual guidance as well as our guidance for the upcoming quarter that being Q2. At this time, we obviously did not opine on Q3 and Q4, which put the shaping and the sizing of these quarters in the hands of the analyst community. Going forward, during our initial annual guidance setting at the start of any fiscal year, we will add some additional clarity on how we see the fiscal year shaping up, specifically around quarterly seasonality. If we had provided this insight at the beginning of the fiscal year, the sequential growth rate for the Q3 and Q4 top line consensus might have been more in line with historical trends and with our current guidance. And one last comment before we open the call up for questions. You know, clearly the company has been through a tough -- couple of tough transitions over the last few years with significant top line impact related to the hardware elimination and the current subscription transition. Although, when you cut through all the messiness and go back and focus on one simple metric that being total revenue, it is nice to see, like so many other companies that have been through subscription transitions, that finally the year-over-year growth rate has now started to reaccelerate once again. Our total revenue year-over-year growth rate appears to have bottomed out in Q3 and Q4 FY \u201819, growing at a negative 1%. That growth accelerated to 1% in Q1 FY \u201820, 3% in Q2 FY \u201820. And based on the midpoint of the Q3 guidance and implied Q4 guidance, we anticipate that the year-over-year growth rate will further accelerate to approximately 10% in Q3, and 25% in Q4. With that, operator, if you could now please open the call up for questions. That\u2019d be great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Participant: Thank you. This is RK [ph]. I wanted to do ask about ACV. You reported 18% growth versus your guidance for 24%. So is the delta all driven by the Federal business or are there any other factors to think about then, could you give us more color there? And I have a follow-up.\nDuston Williams: Sure. So a vast majority was driven by the Federal underperformance in the quarter and also just the subscription impact. We mentioned five million of TCV, so there\u2019s some ACV in there. And, you know, if you look at this ACV metric, it is a real-time metric of the business and we decided to provide that last quarter, because I thought it was important to give that kind of metric that you can\u2019t hide from anything. It is what it is. And I think it\u2019s important metric during a subscription transition, that things are messy, and you can\u2019t really get a good feel for the business going forward. But I think, we\u2019ll continue that through this fiscal year, and then probably end up transitioning to a more conventional ACV, which is more of a waterfall -- kind of fourth quarter waterfall type ACV metric that most companies show there. But, yes, it was mostly clearly mostly Federal, and a little bit of the subscription top line impact.\nUnidentified Participant: Thank you. And I wanted to take a step back and talk about your subscription transition. You had some problems with setting the pricing, right, and the sales motion and the discounting. So could you talk about where you are with each of these challenges and how you see that moving forward?\nDuston Williams: Sure, Dheeraj, you want to?\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes, I mean, both of us should probably chime in. I think, you know, pricing was a big change almost a year and a half ago, I would say, and we have mostly past it. Sales and customers have been surprisingly very receptive. I think, you know, customers -- we thought that the large customers will probably not move to subscription this quickly. But we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised at how much they\u2019ve actually been forthcoming and willing to actually move from the old license model to the new license model. Even the channel, for that matter, including the global system integrators have actually moved in that direction quite well. I think we had a conservative view on when we\u2019d get to 80%. That was in December, January of 2020-2021, is when we said we\u2019ll get to 80%. But one of the things we learned along the way that we have to plow through this as fast as possible. And as we realized that the large customers are willing to take this, went ahead and said let\u2019s get ready to take 80% even if it means it\u2019s year and a half ahead of time actually.\nDuston Williams: And on the discounting that you asked about their, we continue to focus that, obviously a lot in the back office work there and changed some processes and things. So that\u2019s ongoing. It will continue to be ongoing. I think we\u2019ve made some pretty good progress there. But, clearly, we have some more progress to go. And then we\u2019ve, realigned some of the pricing -- list pricing and things like that, but it takes a while for that to flush through. But, we continue to focus on both those.\nUnidentified Participant: Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron, your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: I want to go back to the sales kind of motion. Can you talk a little bit about with your plans to kind of, pause the spending or the investments in the sales organization, how we should think about, the guidance relative to the productivity ramp you\u2019re seeing in some of the new sales hires? And I think if I calculate productivity, right, it looks like you\u2019re down 20% or 25% versus what you were call it a year ago on a billings basis. Do you think that we can see productivity back at the levels that we\u2019ve seen back a year plus ago? And I have a follow-up.\nDuston Williams: Yeah. Let me let me start and Dheeraj can chime in here. Two things. First of all, we mentioned that we\u2019re not pausing sales teams. So that\u2019s very important that that comes across clearly. We\u2019ll continue to hire sales teams, because any downturn period, the worst thing in my mind you can do is halt sales teams, because -- so you have a little pause. In this case, it\u2019s completely out of our hands. I think we\u2019re being prudent. But if you start pausing on sales teams then it takes you twice as long to get back to an accelerated growth, because then you got to go hire folks and ramp them and things like that. So we\u2019ll continue with the vast majority of our sales teams hiring there. And then the productivity, you mentioned, I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re calculating that. But it\u2019s not close to, what we\u2019ve seen from a productivity degradation came down a little bit in \u201819.Came pretty close to what we expected here in Q2. And, Q1 was up from Q4, so --\nDheeraj Pandey: And ACV.\nDuston Williams: Yes. And we really look at it on ACV basis, because it takes any term change out of the equation and it puts it on a equal playing.\nDheeraj Pandey: If anything, that has only stayed better.\nDuston Williams: Yes.\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes.\nAaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. And then as a quick follow-up, you talk to you in this quarter about the engagement with HP Enterprise. I think there\u2019s 117 new customers. I think, last quarter you did 25. So, as you kind of continue to deepen the engagement there, how are you seeing that relationship evolve? Is there more to potentially come or deepen with regard to the HP go-to-market? When might that happen if there is? Thank you.\nDheeraj Pandey: It\u2019s an ongoing partnership discussion. Every quarter we get into know more about their aspirations as well. And, obviously, primarily, they have a pretty large server centric business. And while we -- as I said, you know, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job with Dell and Lenovo and Fujitsu and others. I think HP is becoming a pretty substantial portion of our both enterprise and commercial go-to-market. So, you know, I don\u2019t want to speculate anything about the future. But all I can say is that it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s a win-win for both sides. And demand being more things to come with subscription of our software in their hand with Green Lake and, especially some things around how we can -- go to market together and sell together, including their existing products.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from a line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: Thanks. Duston, just on the APJ impact from the virus. Is it right to think that\u2019s all demand and not supply at this point?\nDuston Williams: Correct. Yes, we\u2019ll have to look at the supply thing. I think Q3 is -- from what I see and what I\u2019m told here is that Q3 looks to be okay. And maybe a little tight and then depending on what happens with the factories and folks coming back to work here, it\u2019s a little bit -- we\u2019ll have to see there. But, yes, that\u2019s, that\u2019s not a not a supply issue. And what\u2019s happening in the region, quite honestly, is -- if you look at this, nothing happening in China. There\u2019s really no meetings happening in several other countries and we\u2019ve got -- if you look at the impacts to the Coronavirus in general in the verticals that it hits. Its retail, transportation and manufacturing and hospitality and travel and all that stuff. So, it\u2019s kind of a ripple effect of this. We got our initial roll up from our APJ folks. And, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a couple very intriguing, interest and deals in Japan that we feel really good about, but the timing of those, we just can\u2019t take aggressive stance on that at this point.\nJason Ader: Okay. All right, because, Microsoft just preannounced\nDuston Williams: Yes.\nJason Ader: I mean, I don\u2019t know if you saw that. But they talked about supply.\nDuston Williams: Jason, I think the important thing to understand here is, is we feel good about the business. There\u2019s two things happening. One that\u2019s got 100% completely in our control, and there\u2019s another thing that\u2019s 100% out of our control. And, we\u2019re really happy about the subscription transition, because, again, the quicker we get through here, the better it sets up the model when the renewals come -- start to flow in here. So we\u2019re really pleased on that. And we\u2019ll take the hit on the top line any day to go faster there. And then, you know, hopefully, we\u2019re taking a reasonably prudent view on some unknown factors related to the virus, so we\u2019ll see how that plays out. But the business itself, which we talked about in the script, and everything else. We feel good, large customers, repeat purchases, big -- Global 2000, new products. Everything is tilted in the right direction, except, we\u2019ve got one big unknown here that we can\u2019t control.\nJason Ader: Yes, and so qualitatively just.\nDheeraj Pandey: That\u2019s why we keep asserting that business is robust and quantitatively we just have to be a little bit more cautious.\nJason Ader: And on the subscription transition, do you have a forecast you had at 75. Obviously, you\u2019re going to far surpass that. What would you say would be a good guesstimate for Q4 right now in terms of percentage of billings from subscription?\nDuston Williams: Yes, it\u2019s probably going to bounce around a little bit. We had a pretty good acceleration this quarter, so probably not too much different. But, we\u2019ll again, update a couple of these thoughts at Investor Day here coming up on March 26th. So.\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. For the first time you put this new sales comp this past.\nDuston Williams: Yes, yes, and we\u2019re starting to tweak our sales comp. We put a roadmap in over the next several years for sales comp and how we end up morphing the sales comp ultimately to take advantage of the leverage effectively of this -- of our subscription business and the renewals and things like that. And this is the first period that we\u2019ve actually put a negative multiplier on some LOD business and in the next 6 months we\u2019ll put a negative multiplier on any LOD business. So I think that naturally there will start shifting some of our bigger legacy customers over to subscription over the next 6 here too.\nJason Ader: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of from Wamsi Mohan Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you. Just to follow up a little more on the Coronavirus situation. Can you give us some color on how you\u2019re coming up with that estimate? I mean, when you say that it\u2019s based purely on APJ demand, it seems like demand in other regions is also getting impacted as this situation remains quite fluid. And secondarily supply -- for the server supply chain seems like that might be impacted, very near term, so is there more clarity -- can you give us some clarity on why you think supply might not really be an issue in the near term, and I will follow up.\nDuston Williams: No, what I mentioned is Q3, from what we\u2019re being told, it doesn\u2019t -- it looks tight, but it doesn\u2019t look at this point to be a serious issue from our perspective.Q4, I don\u2019t know, it depends on how this progresses here. I think the reason why we have a little bit more point of view on APJ is that, there\u2019s been a longer issue there. And, we\u2019ve had a chance to kind of digest that and get some forecasts and things like that. We mentioned that EMA we\u2019ve -- looks good, and we\u2019ve got good pipeline there and the second half looks really good. But this assumes that there is not significant impact that migrates into there. And we just can\u2019t at this point, guess what might happen or guess what my happen with the server supply chain.\nDheeraj Pandey: And then, I think, HP hasn\u2019t told us anything to the contrary. And some of our legacy supply chain is Taiwan, not China. So I think it\u2019s not in the list of countries that people at least have talked about in the past. So I mean, we are making an educated guess in saw this stuff as well. But we do feel like this is a pretty good guess for the next half.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, thanks for that. And then, Dheeraj, there have been some high profile changes in management at IBM and Google Cloud. How do you think this changes the competitive landscape? Do you think it does or not? And also the M&A landscape around this? Thank you.\nDheeraj Pandey: Well, I think, we definitely feel like, we will be becoming more and more of a software company running -- I mean, as I mentioned this in the last paragraph of the script that the cloud becomes the new server for us. And the big issue with the public cloud right now is enterprise workloads have a tough time to lift and shift. And all of sudden if our software can bring that level of virtualization where it doesn\u2019t matter where it\u2019s running on commodity servers on-prem, or commodity servers off-prem, I think it really opens up new surface area for our software. And I think we are looking at the next 3 to 4 years to be such a transition. No different than when we transitioned from pure appliances to OEM and to Dell back in 2014.I mean, over the course of the next 3-4 years, a quarter of our business was running on Dell nodes. And I think a lot of that stuff we expect to see from hyperscalers too actually. So, you know, IBM, with the Red Hat thing will definitely be a partnership opportunity for us, especially around containers and hybrid cloud and IBM Cloud as well. And also, some of the work that we\u2019re doing with them on their Power and AIX software -- they have an operating system in AIX that we believe can we can modernize. I think, in Amazon and Azure, really good, I would say, engineering work going on. You will see this year to be the year when the hyperscalers get really close to us and we do the same with them. And we think that will actually prepare them for a true lift and shift that is not at the mercy of just global system integrators coming and trying to rearchitect the approximately, because rearchitecting the app to go -- move it to the public cloud is really, really hard and risk prone.\nWamsi Mohan: Thanks, Dheeraj. \nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKaty Huberty: Thanks for the question. Going back up, Duston, to your reference to sales force compensation changes. What are you doing around shifting compensation from TCV to ACV? And then related, you mentioned that you\u2019re confident that you can close the gap between term and life of device pricing on renewal. Is it the sales force compensation changes that can help you around pricing? Have you seen renewals yet? Such that you have confidence that you can -- you could raise prices as customers come up on their renewal?\nDuston Williams: Well, we haven\u2019t seen many renewals, quite honestly, on true subscription. You know, most of these haven\u2019t timed out yet on it from that perspective. We do know, I mean, if we just will show a graph here at Investor Day if you simply take an average three-year CBL deal, and assume that renews for another three years. So two to three-year CBL deal, compared to a five-year life of device, and if that renewed for one-year of support, so you had comparable six-year periods. That the two to three - year CBL deals clearly exceed the value of that life of device five-year plus one-year renewal.  So there\u2019s no doubt when you look at the averages of what we\u2019re pricing things, it\u2019s just that we take a hit up front. But through that six-year period we\u2019re much better off. So we just have to wait a little bit here. And then on the sales comp. I think the good news about the sale comp is that we can again we do commissions in six months period, which is really great in a period like this that we can kind of morph things every six months instead of year. So we will highly likely morph to ACV way before we need to and because we\u2019re kind of being seen was from that perspective we believe and then will kind of run with that mentality and photo setting and things like that. So when the renewals flow in, I think we\u2019ll be in pretty good shape to actually get some leverage from those renewals because just like any subscription business those renewals have to come in at a much higher efficiency factor. Hopefully we can show this in a reasonably thoughtful interesting way how this more so [indiscernible] over the next several years at Investor Day and how we see leverage playing in once these subscription renewals come at various efficiency factors and how the percentage of the business becomes pretty large portion in the outer years, as subscription renewals and things like that. I mean we\u2019re really happy about the faster pace to subscription, but a lot of the benefits are going to come in a couple of years.\nKaty Huberty: So the shift to ACV that will be six months out or more that\u2019s not in the current sales compensation changes.\nDuston Williams: Correct. Yes, what we\u2019ve done in the current sales comp that we started to put some negative multipliers on LD business.\nKaty Huberty: Okay and then just lastly from me. Sorry.\nDuston Williams: And to the next phase, we\u2019ll probably have some type of ACV transition. \nKaty Huberty: Okay and just lastly, you surpassed margin guidance and took it up for the full year. Can you just talk about drivers of upside and gross margin?\nDuston Williams: Yes, it\u2019s pretty simple when you look at it because right now the cost of bucket that we operate within, obviously software is 100% margin, but the cost bucket now is with the support model and now the support teams historically done a pretty good job of gaining leverage there and so in this case, we had a pop up and top line and we can leverage that support structure. So it\u2019s just more top line a small increase in the support cost and other cost internally here. So I know we guided 80% next quarter but that\u2019s just because it\u2019s a smaller top line base on a similar cost structure. But as I think we can continue to leverage that slightly as the top line continues to increase.\nKaty Huberty: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Participant: This is Nick filling in for Mehdi. So turning to the full stack of next fruition, how much is that impacting your billings and specifically is it, what percentage of the billings are actually for the entire stack?\nDheeraj Pandey: I think we mentioned last quarter was 11%, this quarter it\u2019s 13% of our bookings. \nDuston Williams: Yes, it\u2019s concerned to new products.\nDheeraj Pandey: New products on top of the core product itself. I think they are fairly accretive in many ways. There\u2019s a lot that we talked about in my earnings script as well, where many of these customers actually are buying our enter stack because they\u2019re really comparing it to cloud. The private cloud has to look like the public cloud in many which ways. If anything, we\u2019re really pleasantly surprised to see that this attach in the overall contribution in global 2000 is higher than the overall company average that number 13% is higher in the global 2000 which basically tells us that, this is not one of those conventional mid-market first sort of portfolios that we\u2019re actually selling, compared to let\u2019s say our hypervisor which really started more in the mid-market for the first three, four years before it went up market. I think many of our new products especially the ones around automation and databases and security. They\u2019re really starting equally if not better actually in the global 2000.\nUnidentified Participant: And do you break down that 13% base off of new customers versus maybe existing customers who are upgrading or do you not have those numbers?\nDuston Williams: We don\u2019t. I mean the only interesting statistic there than the 13% when you look at the global 2000 that 13% is actually a little bit bigger. So you might have some perception that this might be mid-market type customers trying things out. It\u2019s actually playing very well in our, these new products are playing well within our big customers.\nUnidentified Participant: Okay perfect and then just one follow-up on cash burn. [Indiscernible] that\u2019s concerning you guys in the near term. I know that the balance sheet looked a little bit better but maybe talking about that little bit.\nDuston Williams: Even with little bit of change in the top line guide we still believe we\u2019re in the same range that we\u2019ve been talking about what the consensus is roughly today $250 million or so. So we\u2019ll try to continue to kind of manage that bucket.\nUnidentified Participant: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Jack Andrews from Needham. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013Jack Andrews: I was wondering if you could shed some additional light on just where things stand with your solutions based approach on the go-to-market side. Nice to hear that you\u2019re seeing some success, but could you provide some broader tough context in terms of just how much is your sales force is fully enabled with this approach. And similarly, where do you stand with your partners in terms of getting them to embrace this solutions based approach?\nDheeraj Pandey: Great question. I mean you know there\u2019s two parts to this. One is, the way we talk to our customers which are new customers or new campaigns call it more North South and there we are really leading with things like databases and end user computing and private cloud and remote/edge and things like that. And all our sellers especially in the \u2013 I would say global 10,000 where you really go sell solutions because when you start to get lower in the mid-market it\u2019s hard to sell a solution to a first time commercial customer. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of HCI, plus Files, maybe a little bit of operations management that\u2019s going on in the mid-market. So the answer is a little bit more nuance because of the segment but I would say that, all of our enterprise sellers are really been doing this and that\u2019s the way they actually can go create a pipeline. The pipe is not created, we\u2019re just doing a bottom up selling off infrastructure. It\u2019s more work load driven and solution driven actually. The channel is getting there. I think we\u2019ve not yet started to track pipeline for solutions that\u2019s where the next sort of evolution of this solution driven approach is when we start to really track entire funnels that are driven by pipeline itself, but that\u2019s the next phase of the journey.\nQ \u2013Jack Andrews: Got it, thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s earnings call. We thank you for your participation. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Dheeraj Pandey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tonya. Q2 was another strong quarter and I'm pleased to see continued execution from across our organization. Our TCV billings came in on the high end of our guidance range and our TCV revenue gross margin and EPS all exceeded our guidance despite a softer US federal business. Further our deferred revenue surpassed a $1 billion for the first time this quarter growing 35% year-over-year. Business is robust and our transition is well ahead of our internal plans. But we're also in an environment that is more key due to the impact of the Coronavirus. Dealing with the unknown for the first time in the company's decade long history hence we're cautious about our second half guidance which Duston will delve into soon.  Since we began our transition to a subscription business model in Q1 of FY 2019. We've regularly highlighted the areas of a business that are evolving along the way. After another strong quarter of progress I would like to emphasis few areas of the business that stood out in the quarter. First was a faster than expected transmission to subscription. Second, our growing number of large deals and the continued adoption of new products and solutions beyond our core. Third, the momentum we're seeing in a commercial business and finally, our promising partnership with HPE which continues to bring us new customers and once again outperformed our expectations during the quarter. A key driver for our improved sales execution over the past year has been the strong leadership of Chris Kaddaras in the Americas and EMEA in the years before that. Chris joined us as an EMEA sales leader more than three years ago, right around when we went public. We were tiny company back then almost one-third the revenue, one-fourth the number of customers, an appliance business model and a single product in our portfolio. We've come a long way since then. The sales force in this time has endured a dramatic transition in the business model, learned to sell software and really strive to master the portfolio selling approach that most companies could only dream of. Chris is also [indiscernible] careful segmentation of the up market business in the last two years both in EMEA and in Americas. If you recall we set out to segment our business almost three years ago as the muscle to go beyond a billion of annual sales required last customers, a profound customer success culture and a strong portfolio of products that are secured and reliable. Large customers do not buy point products, they buy a platform and operating system that can be for multiple used cases. I'm happy to report that our large enterprise business has flourished in the last 18 months. Ever since we started down the path of the subscription transition. We now have 18 customers with lifespan spend greater than $20 million up from 12 a year ago. Their aggregate lifetime spend is almost $600 million up 56% year-over-year. The largest three cohorts of lifetime spend $10 million to $15 million, $15 million to $20 million and $20 million plus dollars have now collectively grown more than 60% year-over-year both in number of total accounts and in aggregate dollar spent. There are 60 customers that fall into those cohorts and those 60 customers now account for more than $1 billion of lifetime spend with us. We have 220 accounts that have each spent more than $4 million lifetime spend, accounting for more than $2 billion lifetime and this cohort has grown nearly 50% year-over-year. Subscription, compression notwithstanding. And finally the cohort of the $1 million plus customers has grown in the lifetime spend but more than 40% year-over-year subscription compression notwithstanding. Specifically in Q2, we closed 52 deals worth over $1 million in the quarter including 11 deals worth over $3 million which includes three deals over $5 million. 11 of these customers also spend at least $1 million with us last quarter and more than half substantially increase their node count with us during the quarter. Notably TCV bookings from our top 10 customers in Q2 increased approximately 30% from the previous quarter. We now have 1,060 customers with at least a $1 million in lifetime spend up 36% year-over-year. We have 880 of the Global 2000 as customers including three of the Forbes Global 5, eight of the Forbes Global 10 and 70 of the Forbes Global 100. All in all we've done a pretty good job of selling and competing in large account segment profoundly disrupting the hardware and perpetual software incumbence. This is why I'm happy to announce the thoughtful architect of this enduring transition, Chris Kaddaras is now going to be a global leader of the company as Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales. He's equally passionate about the commercial midmarket and has been busy working in the other end of go-to-market barbell US commercial, more in this later.  Speaking of our ongoing subscription transition which Chris is also a big champion of, we outperformed our own internal plans seeing our percentage of billings attributed to subscription increased to 79% up from 73% in Q1, that well surpassed the guidance of 75% by Q4 of FY \u201820 we laid out earlier this year. Our large deals and our existing large customers are moving to subscription at rapid pace. Case in point is the largest lifetime customer who has spent $78 million lifetime with us. This full stack customer sparked the idea of building our own hypervisor AHV with us more than six years ago. They spent more than $5 million for this quarter to convert some of their renewals subscription. Similarly a large Fortune 500 insurance company that is an existing customer [indiscernible] an additional $1.5 million worth of our software subscription bringing their lifetime purchase to more than $6 million. This repeat purchase is due in part to Nutanix delivering on its commitment to mission critical availability and disaster recovery SLA's. The simplicity for solution the reason why government agencies are such large repeat customers of Nutanix as they're constantly challenged and talent and skill sets. These agencies are now embracing subscription without friction. One such example is our existing customer an agency in EMEA that supports asylum seekers with spent $1.5 million this quarter. Bringing their lifetime spend to more than $4 million. New customers are also looking at subscription terms by default. Case in point, a large multinational banking forum, a top 10 global 2000 company did a subscription deal that was worth $1 million this quarter as a first time customer. Our biggest deal of the quarter exemplified the partnerships, subscription model and new products all together in the same opportunity. This repeat Fortune 10 Company invested more than $17 million in subscription licenses this quarter to continue modernizing their IT infrastructure. This value customer which now is nearly $58 million of lifetime bookings with us, just in the last 18 months views us a critical partner in their journey to hybrid cloud which requires secure, reliable and easy to manage cloud services. Their purchase also included Nutanix Files, our software defined scale out filer and Xi Frame, our desktop and service offering. Speaking of portfolio selling. We saw continued momentum in the adoption of new products in the quarter 31% of deals on a rolling four quarter basis included at least one product outside of the company's HCI offering up from 21% in Q2 of last year. In addition, TCV billings from new products reached to record high in the quarter growing 99% year-over-year. We believe we one of the reasons for the increased attach rate of new products to our core software's increased focused on package solutions. Solutions to us is about offering our customers a choice between good, better and best and more often than not speaking their language which many a time is vertical specific. For example in an end user computing solution we now offer our customers a progressively cured experience modernizing [indiscernible] three-tier hardware to selling one click filers and data protection, to selling one click disaster recovery, to selling data and network security. With this approach, we're working the whole body of IT transformation too simple yet profound themes. Simplicity and reliability. Case in point, in how our simple and reliable message is resonating. There's a net new Fortune 50 telecom customer who've spent more than $3 million with us, all age [indiscernible] files to modernize their call center infrastructure. A similar customer when their highlighted traction for solution selling was with the financial services provider in EMEA. They subscribed to more than three million of Xi Leap cloud services this quarter for their end user computing and disaster recovery needs. This solution based workflow driven approach also drove traction with an existing customer leading back in Mexico, who spent more than $1.5 million in subscription licenses. They purchase our product for operations management, multi-cloud orchestration and multi-cloud cost [indiscernible], but a large part of their purchase decision was to use Nutanix's ERA to offer a true databases service experience for the internal cloud. ERA was also a big reason why we won a large $1.5 million with a government ministry in Saudi, their Oracle database is extremely popular and private cloud is in high demand. In a world that is rethinking globalization and doubling down in data sovereignty, private clouds and customer's premises are becoming a pervasive discussion, an example of that was a deal in Europe was $1 million with one of the busiest airports in the world, who selected us to be the standard for their private cloud as they transition from legacy hardware and perpetual license software to a true web scale, software defined infrastructure driven by subscription licensing. Our multi-cloud control plains for automation, security compliance and cost covenants, calm and being respectively were instrumental in our sales campaign here. Our automation and multi-cloud orchestration Calm is all about DevOps. We're going deeper into DevOps with application lifecycle management, containers, databases and object storage. An existing global 2000 customer in the aerospace and defense industry brought their lifetime spend with Nutanix $2.5 million by purchasing Nutanix's says newer products to support the organizations DevOps. They are big users of Calm and also Flow for consumer grade networking and security. Flow and subscription licensing roles are the two big reasons why we did a large $2 million deal with a mission critical communications customer in EMEA. Not only did they select our core HCI software and native hypervisor AHV. The selected number of our new products including Flow has the simplicity of microsegmentation was key to their cybersecurity modernization. Security has become a core value proposition for our overall portfolio both on-prem and off-prem as the Zero Trust cyber security culture becomes pervasive in the enterprise. Zero Trust is a security concept centered in paranoia, a belief that organization should not automatically trust anything outside or inside it's perimeters and that machines and applications are already compromised. We recently hired a Chief Product Security Officer, Indu Keri with vast experience in cybersecurity from his past life. Indus is bringing an encrypt everything, microsegment everything, audit and analyze everything and an integrated approach to a Zero Trust security posture. Our DNA and simplicity and reliability is now key to making security invisible just like Apple did with its devices. On top of our software, our customers are not just running Splunk security and virtual firewalls, but also building fraud detection application. As will illustrated by more than $5 million deal with a large credit card financial services firm this quarter. This Fortune 500 company is nearly $13 million of lifetime TCV spend with us and values are ease-of-use, simple upgrade process and most importantly platform security which was core to their decision making.  On the subject of innovation in reliable and secured products. We continue to make steady progress across our multi-cloud, multi-product portfolio. In Q2, we made our hyperconverge backup products Nutanix's Mine with Veeam and HYCU generally available. This integrated data protection solution combines the power of the leading backup software offerings, all the benefits of our platform including HCI for compute and block storage and files and objects for deep storage. Backup and Splunk are killer used cases for our semi and unstructured data offerings files and objects. Our Objects product has come out resounding well in its first full quarter since general availability. In a deal worth nearly $1 million, a managed service provider in the US chose our full stack to create their own cloud offering backup and archival services that provide a simple consumption model for DevOps, disaster recovery and analytics workloads. Nutanix's Objects was a critical factor and their decision to go all in with us and replace multiple competitors. We also launched Karbon 2.0, Karbon with a K which dramatically simplifies, the configuration, deployment and lifecycle management of Kubernetes containers clusters. Karbon brings a simplicity of containers in the public cloud to a multi-cloud environment. Based on top of our core HCI, it delivers a full cloud native environment in all computing locations, public, private or edge. Response from customers including a major US airline and a leading consumer packaged goods company has been very positive. Karbon has enabled them to fast track their production Kubernetes deployments and has enabled public cloud user experience. Beyond the DevOps ecosystem during the quarter we also announced that our software is optimized around Epic's Operational Database. The most prevalent database system for healthcare companies in the US. We're going deep in the Epic healthcare EMR community. Had a time, when Epic is very carefully choosing it's cloud partners. On partnerships, while we've done a good job with Dell, Lenovo, Fujitsu and others. Our synergy with HPE are looking strong in our first full quarter of joint selling.  Under our Chief Commercial Officer, Tarkan Maner's leadership both parties are bringing deals in customers to each other to learn co-selling and co-marketing. As an example in a win worth more than $4 million, a Global 2000 healthcare company which has a lifetime spend of $14 million took advantage for subscription licensing to run our cloud services on HPE servers. There's a one of three deals greater than $3 million in the pharmaceutical industry of vertical that is increasingly turning to Nutanix to build secure private clouds. In financial services we took a similar approach with HPE one of the big four account firms in a deal worth $1 million and a account that has spent almost $12 million with us lifetime, on the strength of our core software and our multi-cloud automation offering. And we also saw another $4 million of subscription deal this quarter with HPE, at a Fortune 100 financial services customers that has spent more than $23 million lifetime with us. Similar to Q1, well over half of the HPE [ph] customers new logos to Nutanix. Customers clearly see the value working with two world class technology partners and together we're winning competitive deals. Nearly one quarter of our new customers in the commercial segment purchased Nutanix software in HPE servers. As we mentioned before the other end of the barbell i.e. the commercial midmarket is extremely important for a company that has done so well in large enterprises and aspires to go to its third billion in annual subscription sales. We saw a solid quarter in terms of new customers, but we could do better. Our approximately 920 new customers rated our total customer count to 15,880. I'm happy to report that our focus in the commercial segment has produced positive returns on our investment. The hard work we've done to ramp partners is paying off. We saw a strong uptick in partner initiated deals in this segment. Our commercial business focus is also leading to more predictable revenue streams that complement a larger chunkier enterprise deals. Big market accounts can be very large as well especially in US commercial and both Chris and our US commercial leader, John know this well. Leading provider of business legal, tax and digital brand services to companies around the globe, that have spent more than $30 million over the course of our relationship converted from their removals to subscription in a deal worth an incremental $3 million this quarter. They're using our multi-cloud orchestration services Calm, our database service offering Era and Kubernetes platform, Karbon. The commercial segment is proving to be fertile ground for our new product adoption particularly [indiscernible] and Files. One of the reasons why partnerships such as HP and Citrix are flourishing because we've built a reliable platform that has an extremely good [indiscernible] business profile. A large multinational pharmaceutical company and existing customer [indiscernible] spent $3.5 million with us this quarter bringing their lifetime spend to $10 million. We've become a strategic partner to them as our platform runs most of their primary applications that help them discover, develop and launch breakthrough medicines. Reliability of our products is also the reason why another for large existing customers of Fortune 500 healthcare company which has spent nearly $35 million with us lifetime bought $4 million worth of additional software to build their dispersed private cloud across more than 100 hospitals. Exact same story with large electric utility company in the US which doubled down with our software over $3 million deal this quarter to bring their lifetime spend to $14 million.  These in Nutanix to build applications and services to help their customers reduce power consumption. Reliability of webscale applications and commodity service is the reason why we had yet another of our large Fintech customers in the US spent $2.5 million this quarter. Bringing their overall spend to $16 million lifetime. Reliability of customer service has reflected in the average Net Promoter Score or NPS of 90 was a big reason for one of our other large existing Fortune 500 customers. A large professional services from dealing with risk and strategy spent an additional $1.5 million in our software for the end user computing needs bringing their lifetime spend to $15 million. Reliability and simplicity of our disaster recovery and business continuity solutions were the primary reason why we won another $2 million deal at a large EMEA government agency dealing with public pensions, bringing their lifetime spend to $11 million. The voices of these happy repeat customers that are big part of the reason why they have been recognized as a leader for the third year in a row in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, a hyperconverged infrastructure. Scoring the highest of all evaluator and the ability to execute access.  Our obsession with simplicity, design and customer delight is what sets up apart. This is also why we were awarded Champion Status in the 2019 Canalys EMEA Channel Leadership Matrix. This honor was a result of partners who ranked Nutanix the highest amongst all hyperconverged infrastructure companies in channel management through EMEA based on our continued investments in channel incentives, enablement resources and customer support. Our culture and principal have been our internal compass to help us through the highs and lows company building and have helped us navigate the complexities of growth and global presence. Despite 2019 being the toughest year in our 10-year history and business model transitions in public markets do make you tough. We were thrilled to be on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work for list. Nutanix was one of the, only eight new companies to be added to the list in 2020. And one of only two information technology companies. The best part about achieving this certification is that it's predominantly driven [indiscernible] feedback and our employees resounding have opened that they cared for the mission. Speaking of the mission, the cloud is new server [ph] for us. As Xi Wall [ph] for making on-prem infrastructure invisible to making cloud locations invisible, our true worth remain steadfast. Delivered simplicity, choice and delight to our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Duston. Duston? Yes, I mean, both of us should probably chime in. I think, you know, pricing was a big change almost a year and a half ago, I would say, and we have mostly past it. Sales and customers have been surprisingly very receptive. I think, you know, customers -- we thought that the large customers will probably not move to subscription this quickly. But we've been pleasantly surprised at how much they've actually been forthcoming and willing to actually move from the old license model to the new license model. Even the channel, for that matter, including the global system integrators have actually moved in that direction quite well. I think we had a conservative view on when we'd get to 80%. That was in December, January of 2020-2021, is when we said we'll get to 80%. But one of the things we learned along the way that we have to plow through this as fast as possible. And as we realized that the large customers are willing to take this, went ahead and said let's get ready to take 80% even if it means it's year and a half ahead of time actually. And ACV. If anything, that has only stayed better. Yes. It's an ongoing partnership discussion. Every quarter we get into know more about their aspirations as well. And, obviously, primarily, they have a pretty large server centric business. And while we -- as I said, you know, we've done a pretty good job with Dell and Lenovo and Fujitsu and others. I think HP is becoming a pretty substantial portion of our both enterprise and commercial go-to-market. So, you know, I don't want to speculate anything about the future. But all I can say is that it's looking like it's a win-win for both sides. And demand being more things to come with subscription of our software in their hand with Green Lake and, especially some things around how we can -- go to market together and sell together, including their existing products. That's why we keep asserting that business is robust and quantitatively we just have to be a little bit more cautious. Yes. For the first time you put this new sales comp this past. And then, I think, HP hasn't told us anything to the contrary. And some of our legacy supply chain is Taiwan, not China. So I think it's not in the list of countries that people at least have talked about in the past. So I mean, we are making an educated guess in saw this stuff as well. But we do feel like this is a pretty good guess for the next half. Well, I think, we definitely feel like, we will be becoming more and more of a software company running -- I mean, as I mentioned this in the last paragraph of the script that the cloud becomes the new server for us. And the big issue with the public cloud right now is enterprise workloads have a tough time to lift and shift. And all of sudden if our software can bring that level of virtualization where it doesn't matter where it's running on commodity servers on-prem, or commodity servers off-prem, I think it really opens up new surface area for our software. And I think we are looking at the next 3 to 4 years to be such a transition. No different than when we transitioned from pure appliances to OEM and to Dell back in 2014.I mean, over the course of the next 3-4 years, a quarter of our business was running on Dell nodes. And I think a lot of that stuff we expect to see from hyperscalers too actually. So, you know, IBM, with the Red Hat thing will definitely be a partnership opportunity for us, especially around containers and hybrid cloud and IBM Cloud as well. And also, some of the work that we're doing with them on their Power and AIX software -- they have an operating system in AIX that we believe can we can modernize. I think, in Amazon and Azure, really good, I would say, engineering work going on. You will see this year to be the year when the hyperscalers get really close to us and we do the same with them. And we think that will actually prepare them for a true lift and shift that is not at the mercy of just global system integrators coming and trying to rearchitect the approximately, because rearchitecting the app to go -- move it to the public cloud is really, really hard and risk prone. I think we mentioned last quarter was 11%, this quarter it's 13% of our bookings. New products on top of the core product itself. I think they are fairly accretive in many ways. There's a lot that we talked about in my earnings script as well, where many of these customers actually are buying our enter stack because they're really comparing it to cloud. The private cloud has to look like the public cloud in many which ways. If anything, we're really pleasantly surprised to see that this attach in the overall contribution in global 2000 is higher than the overall company average that number 13% is higher in the global 2000 which basically tells us that, this is not one of those conventional mid-market first sort of portfolios that we're actually selling, compared to let's say our hypervisor which really started more in the mid-market for the first three, four years before it went up market. I think many of our new products especially the ones around automation and databases and security. They're really starting equally if not better actually in the global 2000. Great question. I mean you know there's two parts to this. One is, the way we talk to our customers which are new customers or new campaigns call it more North South and there we are really leading with things like databases and end user computing and private cloud and remote/edge and things like that. And all our sellers especially in the \u2013 I would say global 10,000 where you really go sell solutions because when you start to get lower in the mid-market it's hard to sell a solution to a first time commercial customer. Obviously there's a lot of HCI, plus Files, maybe a little bit of operations management that's going on in the mid-market. So the answer is a little bit more nuance because of the segment but I would say that, all of our enterprise sellers are really been doing this and that's the way they actually can go create a pipeline. The pipe is not created, we're just doing a bottom up selling off infrastructure. It's more work load driven and solution driven actually. The channel is getting there. I think we've not yet started to track pipeline for solutions that's where the next sort of evolution of this solution driven approach is when we start to really track entire funnels that are driven by pipeline itself, but that's the next phase of the journey.\nQ \u2013Jack Andrews: Got it, thank you very much."

            "name": "Duston Williams",
            "content": "Thank you Dheeraj. In Q2 we made outstanding progress on our continued shift to a subscription business. Subscription billings increased significantly and now account for 79% of total billings up from 73% in Q1. And subscription revenue now accounts for 77% of total revenue and that's up from 69% in Q1.  We repeatedly stated that it's our desire to move forward through the subscription transition as fast as possible as we made great progress on this goal in the quarter. Our execution in this area far exceeded our expectations in Q2 significantly surpassing our FY \u201820 Q4 goal of 75% and almost equaling our stated CY \u201821 goal of 80% mentioned at least year's Investor Day. It should come as no surprise that the short-term downside to this faster than expected push to subscription is the impact of the top line. Based both on term compression when compared to life of device deals and some pricing differential between our life of device licenses and our term based offerings. We expect to recover this top line impact as renewals come in overtime. This impact of the faster than expected push to subscription is reflected in our Q3 in fiscal year 2020 top line guidance. Exclusive of our professional services billings, our goal is to ultimately drive our subscription billings to 100% of total billings.  The average dollar weighted term length in Q2 \u201820 including renewals was 3.9 years flat with the 3.9 years we reported in Q1 \u201820. As with last quarter this calculation assumes life of device licenses or five-year terms. Some specific Q2 financial highlights; TCV revenue or software and support revenue for the second quarter exceeded our guidance range of $330 million to $335 million coming in at $338 million up from 14% a year ago and up 11% from the previous quarter. TCV billings, our software and support billings were $420 million versus our guidance of $410 million to $420 million up 12% from the year ago quarter and up 13% from the prior quarter. The TCV billings were negatively impacted by approximately $5 million due to the faster than expected shift to subscription. ACV booked in the quarter was $130 million and was up 18% from the year ago quarter. As a reminder with our discussion in Q1, we defined ACV as the annual contract value of new business plus the annual contract of renewals and we calculate ACV by taking the value of each transaction booked in the quarter including renewals but excluding professional services divided by its term length and then summing the total of those values.  While we saw a number of positives to our expectations, our federal business underperformed our expectations in the quarter. this business has always been somewhat lumpy in terms of timing and the significant portion of the federal miss [ph] was related to large deals that we believe were not lost, but rather pushed out to future quarters whoever the time to close these deals is uncertain. New customers bookings represent 24% of total bookings in the quarter versus 26% in Q2, 2019 and up from 23% in Q1, 2020. Our HPE DX related business continued its strong performance and accounted for 117 new customers. For the second quarter in a row the Americas was our best performing region in Q2. TCV bookings, our software and support bookings from our international regions represent 49% of total bookings versus the same 49% in Q2, 2019. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 81.4% exceeding our guidance of 80%. We expect gross margins to hover in the 80% range plus or minus a little bit over the next several quarters. Operating expenses were $396 million below our guidance range to $400 million to $410 million and our non-GAAP net loss was $116 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.60 per share. Now looking at few quick things on the balance sheet, we closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $819 million. We used $52 million of cash flow from operations in Q2 which was positively impacted by $19 million of ESPP inflow and free cash flow during the quarter was negative $74 million and this performance was also positively impacted by the $19 million of ESPP inflow. Now turning to the details of our fiscal 2020 guidance on a non-GAAP basis for fiscal 2020. TCV, we expect TCV billings to be between $1.6 billion and $1.67 billion versus our previous guidance of between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion. TCV revenue to be between $1.29 billion and $1.36 billion versus our previous guidance of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Gross margin of approximately 80.5%. Operating expenses between $1.63 and $1.65 billion versus our previous guidance of $1.65 to $1.7 billion. This guidance is impacted by a much faster than expected transition to subscription and a more cautious view on our business activities in the greater APJ due to the anticipated impact of the Coronavirus. Further, this FY 2020 guidance yields an operating loss and free usage that is roughly in line with current consensus estimates of $550 million and $250 million respectively. The implied ACV based on the FY \u201820 guide is approximately $505 million. The guidance for FY 2020 assumes no change to the current dollar weighted average deal terms currently as 3.9 years. And our guidance also does not assume any meaningful disruption to the global server related supply chain linked to the temporary factory closures in China. For additional clarity, of the $50 million to $80 million decrease in TCV billings guidance range, approximately $25 million to $30 million is related to the faster than expected transition to subscription with the remaining amount attributed to the reduction in our APJ region sales plan. Our APJ region is more dependent on new business in any given quarter. And with the shutdown and China and the slowness and uncertainty being exhibited in other APJ countries, we believe it's prudent to take a cautious view of APJ performance for the next few quarters. Our cautious APJ view also includes Japan, which generally operates under a March fiscal year end period. We have a few large deals pending in Japan, and which we assume a reduced portion will close in Q3. Based on our current outlook, both the Americas and EMEA region seem to be in a good position to deliver their expected results for the second half of fiscal 2020. This, of course, assumes that the business interruptions in the APJ region from the Coronavirus does not spread to these regions too. As our updated operating guidance suggest, excluding sales teams and a few other select roles, we are recently taking a pause on a significant portion of our planned headcount in the second half of our fiscal year, contributing to $20 million to $50 million expense reduction from our previous guidance range. Regarding our hiring, we have slowed headcount for the following two reasons. First, we would like to have more clarity to see if there might be any further potential disruption related to the impact of the Coronavirus, and whether that disruption spreads to other portions of the world. And secondly, quite honestly, it puts us in a better position to more efficiently integrate the 1,400 or so employees we've added over the last year. Regardless of this headcount pause, we still plan to hire for critical roles on an as needed basis. We view this selected headcount pause as simply the right thing to do, and is in no way related to any change to our overall positive view of our business going forward. Now, turning to our Q3 guidance. On a non GAAP basis for Q3, we expect TCV billings to be between $365 million and $385 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 13% to 19%.TCV revenue to be between $300 million and $320 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13% 20%. Gross margin of approximately 80%; operating expenses between $420 million and $430 million and a per share loss of approximately $0.89, using weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $196 million. The Q3 guidance also reflects the much faster than expected transition to subscription and a more cautious view in our business activities in the greater APJ region due to the Coronavirus, consistent with my comments on our fiscal year 2020 guidance. Additionally, the sequential decline in our FY \u201820 Q3 implied booking guidance, which at the midpoint of the guide assumes a 7% sequential decline is actually better than what we experienced for actual FY \u201818 and FY \u201819 Q2 to Q3 sequential historical bookings performance, which was approximately a 10% sequential decline. Furthermore, the sequential increase in our FY \u201820 Q4 implied booking guidance, which at the midpoint of the guide assumes a 25% sequential increase is also in line with our FY \u201818 and our FY \u201819 actual Q3 to Q4 sequential historical bookings performance, which was a financial increase of 33% and 25% respectively. The current consensus numbers for TCV sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 and from Q3 to Q4 are quite misaligned to the historical averages. Our Q3 guidance and the applied Q4 guidance brings these sequential growth rates back in line with historical averages. As you are aware, FY \u201820 was our first year providing annual guidance. With this approach, the yearly guidance gets updated each quarter, and we also give quarterly guidance for the upcoming quarter. For example, during Q1 earnings call, we provided an updated annual guidance as well as our guidance for the upcoming quarter that being Q2. At this time, we obviously did not opine on Q3 and Q4, which put the shaping and the sizing of these quarters in the hands of the analyst community. Going forward, during our initial annual guidance setting at the start of any fiscal year, we will add some additional clarity on how we see the fiscal year shaping up, specifically around quarterly seasonality. If we had provided this insight at the beginning of the fiscal year, the sequential growth rate for the Q3 and Q4 top line consensus might have been more in line with historical trends and with our current guidance. And one last comment before we open the call up for questions. You know, clearly the company has been through a tough -- couple of tough transitions over the last few years with significant top line impact related to the hardware elimination and the current subscription transition. Although, when you cut through all the messiness and go back and focus on one simple metric that being total revenue, it is nice to see, like so many other companies that have been through subscription transitions, that finally the year-over-year growth rate has now started to reaccelerate once again. Our total revenue year-over-year growth rate appears to have bottomed out in Q3 and Q4 FY \u201819, growing at a negative 1%. That growth accelerated to 1% in Q1 FY \u201820, 3% in Q2 FY \u201820. And based on the midpoint of the Q3 guidance and implied Q4 guidance, we anticipate that the year-over-year growth rate will further accelerate to approximately 10% in Q3, and 25% in Q4. With that, operator, if you could now please open the call up for questions. That'd be great. Thank you. Sure. So a vast majority was driven by the Federal underperformance in the quarter and also just the subscription impact. We mentioned five million of TCV, so there's some ACV in there. And, you know, if you look at this ACV metric, it is a real-time metric of the business and we decided to provide that last quarter, because I thought it was important to give that kind of metric that you can't hide from anything. It is what it is. And I think it's important metric during a subscription transition, that things are messy, and you can't really get a good feel for the business going forward. But I think, we'll continue that through this fiscal year, and then probably end up transitioning to a more conventional ACV, which is more of a waterfall -- kind of fourth quarter waterfall type ACV metric that most companies show there. But, yes, it was mostly clearly mostly Federal, and a little bit of the subscription top line impact. Sure, Dheeraj, you want to? And on the discounting that you asked about their, we continue to focus that, obviously a lot in the back office work there and changed some processes and things. So that's ongoing. It will continue to be ongoing. I think we've made some pretty good progress there. But, clearly, we have some more progress to go. And then we've, realigned some of the pricing -- list pricing and things like that, but it takes a while for that to flush through. But, we continue to focus on both those. Yeah. Let me let me start and Dheeraj can chime in here. Two things. First of all, we mentioned that we're not pausing sales teams. So that's very important that that comes across clearly. We'll continue to hire sales teams, because any downturn period, the worst thing in my mind you can do is halt sales teams, because -- so you have a little pause. In this case, it's completely out of our hands. I think we're being prudent. But if you start pausing on sales teams then it takes you twice as long to get back to an accelerated growth, because then you got to go hire folks and ramp them and things like that. So we'll continue with the vast majority of our sales teams hiring there. And then the productivity, you mentioned, I'm not sure how you're calculating that. But it's not close to, what we've seen from a productivity degradation came down a little bit in \u201819.Came pretty close to what we expected here in Q2. And, Q1 was up from Q4, so -- Yes. And we really look at it on ACV basis, because it takes any term change out of the equation and it puts it on a equal playing. Yes. Correct. Yes, we'll have to look at the supply thing. I think Q3 is -- from what I see and what I'm told here is that Q3 looks to be okay. And maybe a little tight and then depending on what happens with the factories and folks coming back to work here, it's a little bit -- we'll have to see there. But, yes, that's, that's not a not a supply issue. And what's happening in the region, quite honestly, is -- if you look at this, nothing happening in China. There's really no meetings happening in several other countries and we've got -- if you look at the impacts to the Coronavirus in general in the verticals that it hits. Its retail, transportation and manufacturing and hospitality and travel and all that stuff. So, it's kind of a ripple effect of this. We got our initial roll up from our APJ folks. And, as I mentioned, we've got a couple very intriguing, interest and deals in Japan that we feel really good about, but the timing of those, we just can't take aggressive stance on that at this point. Yes. Jason, I think the important thing to understand here is, is we feel good about the business. There's two things happening. One that's got 100% completely in our control, and there's another thing that's 100% out of our control. And, we're really happy about the subscription transition, because, again, the quicker we get through here, the better it sets up the model when the renewals come -- start to flow in here. So we're really pleased on that. And we'll take the hit on the top line any day to go faster there. And then, you know, hopefully, we're taking a reasonably prudent view on some unknown factors related to the virus, so we'll see how that plays out. But the business itself, which we talked about in the script, and everything else. We feel good, large customers, repeat purchases, big -- Global 2000, new products. Everything is tilted in the right direction, except, we've got one big unknown here that we can't control. Yes, it's probably going to bounce around a little bit. We had a pretty good acceleration this quarter, so probably not too much different. But, we'll again, update a couple of these thoughts at Investor Day here coming up on March 26th. So. Yes, yes, and we're starting to tweak our sales comp. We put a roadmap in over the next several years for sales comp and how we end up morphing the sales comp ultimately to take advantage of the leverage effectively of this -- of our subscription business and the renewals and things like that. And this is the first period that we've actually put a negative multiplier on some LOD business and in the next 6 months we'll put a negative multiplier on any LOD business. So I think that naturally there will start shifting some of our bigger legacy customers over to subscription over the next 6 here too. No, what I mentioned is Q3, from what we're being told, it doesn't -- it looks tight, but it doesn't look at this point to be a serious issue from our perspective.Q4, I don't know, it depends on how this progresses here. I think the reason why we have a little bit more point of view on APJ is that, there's been a longer issue there. And, we've had a chance to kind of digest that and get some forecasts and things like that. We mentioned that EMA we've -- looks good, and we've got good pipeline there and the second half looks really good. But this assumes that there is not significant impact that migrates into there. And we just can't at this point, guess what might happen or guess what my happen with the server supply chain. Well, we haven't seen many renewals, quite honestly, on true subscription. You know, most of these haven't timed out yet on it from that perspective. We do know, I mean, if we just will show a graph here at Investor Day if you simply take an average three-year CBL deal, and assume that renews for another three years. So two to three-year CBL deal, compared to a five-year life of device, and if that renewed for one-year of support, so you had comparable six-year periods. That the two to three - year CBL deals clearly exceed the value of that life of device five-year plus one-year renewal.  So there's no doubt when you look at the averages of what we're pricing things, it's just that we take a hit up front. But through that six-year period we're much better off. So we just have to wait a little bit here. And then on the sales comp. I think the good news about the sale comp is that we can again we do commissions in six months period, which is really great in a period like this that we can kind of morph things every six months instead of year. So we will highly likely morph to ACV way before we need to and because we're kind of being seen was from that perspective we believe and then will kind of run with that mentality and photo setting and things like that. So when the renewals flow in, I think we'll be in pretty good shape to actually get some leverage from those renewals because just like any subscription business those renewals have to come in at a much higher efficiency factor. Hopefully we can show this in a reasonably thoughtful interesting way how this more so [indiscernible] over the next several years at Investor Day and how we see leverage playing in once these subscription renewals come at various efficiency factors and how the percentage of the business becomes pretty large portion in the outer years, as subscription renewals and things like that. I mean we're really happy about the faster pace to subscription, but a lot of the benefits are going to come in a couple of years. Correct. Yes, what we've done in the current sales comp that we started to put some negative multipliers on LD business. And to the next phase, we'll probably have some type of ACV transition. Yes, it's pretty simple when you look at it because right now the cost of bucket that we operate within, obviously software is 100% margin, but the cost bucket now is with the support model and now the support teams historically done a pretty good job of gaining leverage there and so in this case, we had a pop up and top line and we can leverage that support structure. So it's just more top line a small increase in the support cost and other cost internally here. So I know we guided 80% next quarter but that's just because it's a smaller top line base on a similar cost structure. But as I think we can continue to leverage that slightly as the top line continues to increase. Yes, it's concerned to new products. We don't. I mean the only interesting statistic there than the 13% when you look at the global 2000 that 13% is actually a little bit bigger. So you might have some perception that this might be mid-market type customers trying things out. It's actually playing very well in our, these new products are playing well within our big customers. Even with little bit of change in the top line guide we still believe we're in the same range that we've been talking about what the consensus is roughly today $250 million or so. So we'll try to continue to kind of manage that bucket."

With that, I'll turn it over to Dheeraj.\nDheeraj Pandey: Thank you, Tonya. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us and a very happy Thanksgiving in advance. In September, we celebrated our 10th anniversary. It reached $1 billion in annual revenue, faster than most software companies had in the past 20 years with deferred revenue at almost $1 billion as well. In the last two years, we have transformed our business model from appliance to software and are now doing sole subscription. As we look to our next 10 years, we see even bigger opportunities to continue to work hard with our customers to ensure that words frictionless, reliable, and invisible remains synonymous with Nutanix. Q1 was a strong quarter for us based on better than expected financial results, progress in subscription, recorded large deals, as well as continued new product traction. To build on last quarter\u2019s strong momentum with $370 million in software and support billings or TCV billings and $305 million in software and support revenue or TCV revenue both metrics beating consensus. We signed the second highest number ever of large deals in a quarter which we define as deals greater than $500,000. Subscription grew to 73% of total billings up from 71% last quarter as we move steadily towards the goal of more than 75% which is our stated goal by the end of fiscal 2020. Later, I'll talk more about why our move to subscription model gives us a competitive edge in a world that is increasingly going hybrid. We also had strong 39% year-over-year deferred revenue growth in Q1 reaching nearly $1 billion in the quarter, a notable milestone. In this call, I want to focus on the three pillars of our execution that are driving this improved financial performance; our go-to-market engine, our move to subscription model as we establish a new baseline and the organic adoption of our new products. The headline of the quarter was our continued momentum in execution across both sales and marketing. In addition to increasing our focus on lead generation, our global sales leaders continue to infuse rigorous operational discipline to our sales process around the world. The Americas region delivered record high software and support or TCV bookings this quarter. We also made excellent progress in sales hiring in the quarter with a record number of net new sales reps. We made another key sales hire during the quarter with the addition of a new VP of Americas channel. The new leadership is focused on helping our partners virtualize, simplify and integrate the multi-cloud experience of our customers. As we noted on last quarter's call, we spend the last three years building a robust enterprise business. Our goal is now to balance that with an equally strong mid-market business, as commercial customers are just as aspirational as enterprises on the hybrid cloud transformation. Not surprisingly, we discovered many of our million dollar accounts in this segment. One real example of a new customer win in this segment was with a U.S.-based Internet service provider. This deal which was $750 million comprised our core AOS operating system, Prism Pro, Bios and native AHV hypervisor to build a scalable private cloud, deleveraging Nutanix to run several of the enterprise apps including their Oracle databases. We also recently added a seasoned technology veteran to our executive team with the hire of Tarkan Maner as Chief Commercial Officer. In his multi-faceted role, Tarkan will lead business development, M&A, global system integrators, service providers and so on for cloud and platform products. I've watched Tarkan build two very meaningful companies in the last 15 years, Wyse Technology and Nexenta. It brings an entrepreneurial mindset and an acute awareness of the computing landscape. His authentic leadership style, a clear bias for action and a broad industry network have helped him create high energy companies in the space of end user computing and storage. I\u2019m thrilled to have an extremely hardworking leader who\u2019s passionate about cloud, telcos, people and clarity in communication. Speaking of clarity, let me share some of our progress in the simplification of our go-to market messaging that emphasizes customer solutions rather than individual products. We focused on three solutions around private cloud, end-user computing and databases. One of the most common themes we hear from customers is that they want their computing silos to work seamlessly from performance, security, APIs and ease of use point a few. This frictionless delivery is the focus of our new global ad campaign launched this quarter that shows how Nutanix software brings it all together now to virtualize, simplify and integrate data, applications and infrastructure. This outstanding approach was very well received at our European .NEXT Conference this October, where we brought together 4,500 attendees in Copenhagen at our biggest EMEA even to-date. Customers, prospects, employees and more than 1,200 Nutanix channel partners participated in over 100 technical breakout sessions to hear about the why, the how and the what of our future and how it relates to their multi-cloud journey over the next three to five years. Our customers now want to take our software to hyperscaler substrates in the public cloud as they realize that compute and storage need to set side by side in these highly virtualize network environments. At our conference, we showcased how we are approaching this problem by making the private and public cloud symmetric for our customers. They can build secondary sites, force computing to accommodate seasonal peaks, and globally load balance or distributed application across these data centers with a single fordable software license orchestrated by a single pane of glass that manages both sides of the aisle. It's events like .NEXT that help us drive strong momentum in large deals with new and existing customers. Shortly after .NEXT in Copenhagen we signed a multimillion dollar deal with a leading financial services forum in Germany that attended the event. They are now using Nutanix to run their mission critical financial services applications. This really is great example of how to leverage our premier marketing events to build trust with our prospects. That customer was just one of the 66 customers we signed in the quarter that worth over $1 million record for us. 13 of those customers also spend at least $1 million with us in Q4, with 50% of them increasing their engagement with us to support new workloads in Q1. In addition, this quarter, we closed nine deals worth more than $3 million. Finally, we are close to reaching a milestone of having nearly 1,000 customers with a lifetime spend of more than $1 million, up 39% year-over-year notwithstanding the compression in our topline due to subscription. Our biggest deal this quarter was with the repeat marquee client that invested nearly $9 million in subscription licenses to modernize the infrastructure. This global Fortune 10 company has lifetime bookings with us of over $38 million. The use case fuels a new edge computing solution that will manage their climbing use of IoT sensors and provide additional security to their digital transactions. This relationship accentuates what we are known for in the market reliability, reliability and reliability of our products, our processes and our people in customer support and customer success. And finally, this relationship also underscores how we're helping our Fortune global 100 customers transform from ownership of technology to access to technology with a subscription consumption model. To own music with iTunes or to stream music with Spotify is a simple way to think about tradeoffs of ownership versus access. Given how rapidly technology is changing, companies are introducing new products enterprise customers are waking up to this idea of subscription to a product portfolio being streamed to them in a very similar way. Just a short amount of time, we have shown strong progress in transforming our business to cater this new cloud consumption mentality. This transition will enable us to offer what we believe is one of the infrastructure segments only to license mobility models to protect our customers\u2019 investments in multicloud computing. It will help our customers to move investments fluidly between private and public clouds, as their business needs dictate. Our flexible licensing is a competitive differentiator and a clear customer benefit. Equally important is how the subscription model paves the way for our long-term profitability as we set go-to-market incentives, respectively for hunting versus farming of annual contract value or ACV driven by sales versus total contract value or TCV driven by customer success. Speaking of customer success, one of our top subscription deals in the quarter came from a large civilian department of the U.S. government and is worth nearly $5 million. The deal represents this customer's first private cloud solution with our AHV hypervisor to manage and scale mission-critical workloads. The customer who use Nutanix to run Oracle in addition to selecting error for their database management and frame to deliver virtual desktops to its growing user base. They chose us for a product quality and breadth, simplicity and strong customer references. Speaking of simplicity, recently a Nutanix customer posted on an online forum about how easy it is to update Nutanix Clusters. The customer said, \"I just wanted to give a shoutout to Nutanix on here so everyone knows how great and easy it is to set up an entire cluster from scratch\". This customer had previous experience with multimillion-dollar projects for incumbents, which took weeks. That said, with Nutanix, it would have taken two hours. They went on to say, \u201cI know Nutanix talks about this, but we need to be shouting this from the rooftops.\u201d We intend to bring the same level of invisible laps when customers are instantiating workloads in a hyperscale data center of the public cloud. Another example of a $1 million plus subscription deal in Q1 was with a new customer that is a high profile US-based apparel manufacturer. We're helping this customer modernize their infrastructure to move off of a legacy three tier solution into a cloud forest architecture for their data centers, their primary workloads into databases and VDI. We partnered with a global XI who's helping us integrate Xi Beam, Calm, Files, Flow and Prism Pro with our native virtualization technology, AHV. The customer chose us for a simple ease of use, single pane of glass and the flexibility for the IT team to scale an elastic infrastructure. On the topic of flexibility, one of the key benefits of subscription is that it allows customers complete freedom to choose to spend operating our capital budget dollars. The hybrid consumption model in this case unlocks mobility of the entire stack including data, applications, networks and licenses. The 2019 Enterprise Cloud Index or ECI issued just two weeks ago supports these pieces of app mobility. The independent third-party survey asked over 2,600 global IT decision-makers about the state of global enterprise cloud deployments and adoption plans for hybrid cloud. 85% of ECI respondents said hybrid cloud is the ideal IT operating model. 95% reported that it\u2019s essential, desirable to be able to easily move applications in the cloud environment. Moreover, 73% said they\u2019re moving applications back on-premises, indicating a clear need for mobility. Switching gears to our third pillar of execution in the quarter which was traction of our new product portfolio. Customers know and love us for our reliable HCI core and our customer success ethos. Architecturally, we brought together storage, compute and networking into a platform combining the benefits of web scale architecture with the consumer grade simplicity of a smartphone delivered with a genius-bar like customer support experience. Over time, this trust and loyalty made our customers realized they wanted and needing more from us higher up the stack. Given how poor their other IT relationships are. Our newer products continue to gain traction in the market. In fact, this holistic approach of a hybrid cloud stack is often a critical reason why we win deals. In Q1, our number of deals that included at least product beyond our core HCI offerings increased once again at 28% in a rolling four quarter basis showing nice progression from 26% in the previous quarter. Our software and services portfolio now covers the trifecta of data plane, control plane and management plane. With the data plane comprised of the run time for the machines which themselves a pure software in the world software define. The control plane is where the machines orchestrate other machines and the management plane is where humans interact with machines increasingly with the help of AI in an era of AI ops. One example of the power of our product portfolio is that one of the world's leading organ transplant nonprofit organizations. This customer purchased over $2 million of our software including our core AOS operating system, comm, flow, files and AHV Hypervisor to run their SQL databases. The use of Nutanix software is a critical part of the full scale modernization of the computing platform. When trialing our software earlier this year, we saw 1.5 times performance improvement with the legacy infrastructure. This customer is now evaluating Xi Leap our cloud based data recovery solution. We also scored a competitor win with a largest organic farming cooperative in North America in the quarter. The farming industry has been going through significant changes which drove this customer to look at new and innovative IT solutions to address their database performance issues and support future growth needs. Return to us to reduce operating costs by significantly shrinking the database licensing fees. And a great example for our TCO, the cost savings on these licenses alone funded the purchase of our software. On the topic of hyperscaler platforms we announced Nutanix clusters earlier this year to enable our software to run in public cloud data centers. Our approach to multi-cloud is architecturally different. Just like HCI was so different than converged infrastructure or CI. CI was nothing more than a band aid stropping large technology providers under one roof. We founded this company on the premise that CI was a hack, a temporary coalition of big brands that would not withstand the test of time because it was packaging expensive hardware and software under an umbrella term of convergence with no change to the operating and consumption models. HCI on the other hand was a fundamental rethink on an empty canvas of commodity servers, commodity networks and enterprise great software coming together with an elegant consumer grade design. How we look at the new multi-cloud world of the new HCI challenge with their commodity servers, their commodity networks and our software and design is the journey of this decade. I\u2019ll share more about clusters in the coming months. We hope to convince Gartner one more time about the real convergence of cloud\u2019s Magic Quadrant. Virtualizing, simplifying and integrating them all together into one delightful experience is in our DNA. Speaking of delight, providing our customers with the freedom to choose which hardware report platform to run our software was a masterstroke for us in 2014. When we decided to open our appliance router market to competition from other server vendors who started to OEM our software, we're pleased to see our new relationship with HPE start to blossom this being the first quarter since the integrated products G8. HPE\u2019s huge customer base can now easily adopt Nutanix. As we announced the general availability of our software in HPE ProLiant DX servers, fully integrated with our enabled support, HPE\u2019s hybrid cloud in the server\u2019s GreenLake solution was built in Nutanix AHV Hypervisor is also generally available now. As a result, we saw a number of new customer wins in these solutions during the quarter. In Q1, more than half of our HPE DX customers were also new logos to Nutanix, validating this new partnership and our software has increased exposure to HPE installed base. One example of how our new relationship with HPE is ramping faster than any of our past OEM partnerships is a nearly $2 million deal in Q1 with a new customer which is a large EMEA-based insurance company. Early success is compelling customers who already explored databases and service used case with Nutanix Era. One very critical initiative within the company is Xi test drive service running on Google GCP. To me this is one of our most important projects to get right for a true digital transformation of the company. How our prospective customers go from a digital banner ad to trying out our entire product portfolio hosted in the public cloud in a one click, self-guided experience is a testament to how far we've come from being an appliance company a couple of years ago. If we get this right, it\u2019ll immensely improve profitability in the commercial mid-market as most of the prospects would then be enable with a digital touch, and only the self-selected ones would require a human touch. I'm proud to say that in this last year, we also done a thousand-odd credit card transactions to sell our cloud services with zero human touch. Digital transactions are core to our future including for subscription renewal and eventually to our profitability. Finally, we are humbled we recognize that Comparably is a great company for millennials to work for in the San Francisco Bay area and also Bloomberg Intelligence is one of the 50 companies to watch for in 2020. Before I turn it over to on to bring it all together now. I want to bring it all together now. Strong quarter, continued progress and the rollout of a subscription model, record number of large deals, growing demand for new products and an increasingly digital go-to-market strategy, beneath it all, the care and attention we give customers remains one of our most substantial competitive differentiators. Our proven track record and passion for simplifying complexity makes us a trusted partner for enterprises building the computing platform. Our long-term differentiation continues to be at the intersection of public and private clouds in how we virtualize, simplify and integrate the silos to make computing invisible anyway. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Duston. Duston?\nDuston Williams: Thank you, Dheeraj. Q1 was a quarter during which we met or exceeded our guidance for software and support billings, software and support revenue, gross margin, operating expenses and earnings per share. We were pleased with the amount of pipeline we generated in the quarter in that our backlog position showed very little change from Q4 FY 2019 to Q1 FY 2020. This was in sharp contrast to the fact that over the last three years we have experienced on average about a 25% decline in backlog from Q4 to Q1. During the quarter, we also made good progress on our shift to our recurring subscription business. In Q1, subscription billings accounted for 73% of total billings up from 71% in Q4 and subscription revenue now accounts for 69% of total revenue, up from 65% in Q4. This subscription shift for the quarter was in line with our guidance last quarter at which time, we mentioned that the subscription percentages would fluctuate a bit plus or minus for the next couple of quarters with a goal of 75% of billing from subscriptions by Q4 of fiscal 2020. Q1 marked our fifth quarter into the subscription transition, we have strived during this transitionary period to find an ideal financial metric to portray an apples-to-apples comparison of our top line growth one that mixes the attributes of the old life of device model with the new subscription model. Historically, we've had one metric TCV or total contract value for software and support that we apply to show the growth rates for the entire company which combined the old life of device model business model and the new subscription based business model. Using TCV as a growth metric works well for the old life of device model but not for the new subscription based model as TCV ignores changes in term lengths and therefore significantly understates the true growth of the business in a period of decreasing term loans. As such, we believe the single best metric to measure the true growth profile of the company during our transition to our new subscription based model is new annual contract value plus renewals or ACV for short booked in the quarter, which includes sales of life of device licenses based on an assumed five-year term. By calculating in this way, we take into account the changing term lengths while still showing the impact of our continued sales of life of device licenses. Having aggregate ACV in any given period will allow us for a cleaner apples-to-apples comparison of period-over-period growth rates. In its most simplistic form, we define ACV booked in the quarter as the annual contract value of new business plus the annual contract value of renewals. And we calculate ACV booked in the quarter by taking the value of each transaction booked in the quarter including renewals but excluding professional services divided by its term length and then summing the total of those values. We have updated our investor deck to include this new ACV metric. The average dollar weighted term length in Q1 2020 including renewals was 3.9 years versus 3.9 years in Q4 2019. This calculation assumes life of device licenses for five year terms. Now moving on to some specific Q1 financial highlights. Again for simplicity purposes and as we said last quarter, we used the term TCV or total contract value to describe our software and support revenue in billings. TCV revenue or software and support revenue for the first quarter exceeded our guidance range of $290 million to $300 million coming in at $305 million up 9% from a year ago and up 6% from the previous quarter, reflecting the revenue compression from the company's ongoing transition to subscription and the significant reduction of hardware revenue. TCV billings or software and support billings were $370 million versus our guidance of $360 million to $370 million, up 5% from the year ago quarter and up 3% from the prior quarter also reflecting the billings compression from the company\u2019s ongoing transition to subscription in the significant reduction of hardware billings. ACV booked in the quarter was $123 million and up 18% from the year ago quarter. New customer bookings represented 24% of total bookings in the quarter the same as Q1 2019 and up from 23% in Q4 2019. Although we only had a partial shipment and a quarter of shipments, our HPE DX-related bookings got off to a good start with about $8 million in sales including 25 new customers to Nutanix. We will not normally disclose this level of detail but we felt that was important to provide an initial indication of the progress early in the relationship. Americas was our best performing region in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, the enterprise-related business outperformed the commercial business. Our federal business performed slightly better than expected. In Q1 TCV bookings are softer, and support bookings from our international regions represented 40% of total bookings versus 40% in Q1 2019. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 80% in line with our guidance. Operating expenses were $386 million and at the lower end of our guidance range of $385 million to $390 million. And our non-GAAP net loss was $135 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.71 per share. A few balance sheet highlights, we closed the quarter with cash and short term investments of $889 million down $20 million from Q4, we used $26 million of cash flow from operations in Q3 which was negatively impacted by $10 million of ESPP outflow. Free cash flow during the quarter was negative $44 million and this performance was also negatively impacted by the $10 million of the ESPP outflow in the quarter. Turning to our details of our Q2 guidance on a non-GAAP basis for Q2, we expect TCV billings or software and support billings to be between $410 million and $420 million versus current consensus estimates of $410 million. TCV revenue or software and support revenue to be between $330 million and $335 million versus current consensus estimates of $328 million, gross margins of approximately 80%, operating expenses between $400 million and $410 million versus current consensus estimates of $407 million in a per share loss of approximately $0.70 using weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $193 million. The TCV billings or software and support billings guidance assumes the dollar weighted average deal terms remain constant quarter-over-quarter at 3.9 years. Based on the TCV billings or software and support billings at the guidance midpoint of $415 million, ACV for Q2 would approximate a $135 million reflecting an approximate year-over-year growth rate of 24%. Now turning to the fiscal 2020 guidance. Our guidance for fiscal 2020 remains unchanged, which we believe to be prudent based on the uncertain macro environment referenced by many infrastructure related companies over the last several months. So, specifically for fiscal 2020, we expect TCV billings or software and support billings between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion. TCV revenue or software and support revenue between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. Gross margins of approximately 80% and operating expenses between $1.65 billion and $1.7 billion. For representative purposes, based on the TCV billings, our software and support billings at the guidance midpoint of $1.7 billion, ACV for fiscal 2020 were approximate $535 million, reflecting approximate year-over-year growth rate of 25%. The guidance for fiscal 2020 assumes no major economic downturn during the fiscal year and no change to the current dollar-weighted average deal terms currently at 3.9 years. And with that, operator, you could now open the call up for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks for taking my questions. And first of all happy 10th anniversary and congrats on the strong results, guys. I wanted to touch on maybe just first the macro spending question. Then I had a question on partnerships. Obviously good results here. It sounds like you had good progress in the Americas\u2019 strong large deal performance. I'm curious if you could talk about rest of world and maybe some of the things you've learned in the Americas that can be applied to the rest of the world. And maybe just your overall comments on IT buying patterns, spending patterns.\nDheeraj Pandey: Well, I think - thanks for the question, Matt. I think at the high level when we look at our overall quarterly performance, 40% from International hasn't been and in line with what we did a year ago. So we don't see anything unusual in APAC and EMEA. Obviously, Chris' leadership has been telling in America, they would love to actually go and apply a lot of that rigor to both APAC and EMEA as well.\nMatt Hedberg: Then, I guess in terms of your partnerships, you've specifically called HP which was it was great to hear some of the success there. And you commented briefly Dheeraj on GCP with Xi. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us a little bit more of an update on GCP in particular. If there's anything that you have in terms of joint customer or momentum that you could share, that would be - it would certainly be helpful.\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. Again on GCP, you know I talked about Google test drive, one of our most important projects to get right for us to increasingly have a digital go-to market motion and it's a very, very important project for us to really, really improve the efficiency of our commercial segment. We are working very closely on Kubernetes, Calm and Anthos are coming together well. And our approach is to integrate Anthos to the control team of Calm, rather than raw hypervisor like AHV or something. So, there's some really good progress we have made over the last three to six months in Anthos with GCP. And we\u2019re hopeful that with the recent acquisition of CloudSimple, it will open up new doors for bare metal as a service. And bring GCP on par with what we are doing with AWS and Azure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall: I wanted to ask for starters just to double check that our math is right on the top line impact this quarter. So the ACV grew 18% year-over-year and then software support up 9%. So the difference in the two is I guess what you would say is the top line impact from the transition. Just double checking that, Duston.\nDuston Williams: Yes, it's not as simple as that necessarily because the ACV calc obviously different term lengths are weighted differently within the ACV but you can get some feel there for the difference but I wouldn't take that literally.\nRod Hall: Right just going to put this in a ballpark anyway. Okay, thanks for that. And then the main thing I wanted to ask is ACV is accelerating to 25% growth in the forward quarter at least that's kind of where we are on the midpoint. I wonder if you guys could maybe comment on what's driving that? Is that GreenLake or is it - there's some other thing that is driving that acceleration in ACV?\nDheeraj Pandey: Well part of is just creating a new baseline because that - we just flushed through a big chunk of the transformation. We think we have a stable term length now. Our salespeople are getting used to selling subscription. Our customers are getting used to hearing about subscription, our channels partners have gotten enabled. We know how to defend value, protect value through software. It's getting better as well in that sense. So, I think all in all this was a tough 12 months for us. But I think it was well worth it. So, I think - to summarize it's really a new baseline and of course we put some real meat behind the bones when it comes to pipeline and marketing and demand generation and things like that.\nRod Hall: And do you guys - just one last question and I'll give up the floor. But do you guys Dheeraj have hopes for expansion beyond GreenLake to other on-prem cloud services like AWS, outposts or other things like that? I mean is it a good possibility maybe we\u2019ll see you in some of those in the future or can you just comment on what the strategy there is?\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. I think you know AWS definitely wants their hardware outpost to really run our software as well but also we hope to actually do a lot of that stuff in a way that is reliable and stable and because we take longer - one of the things that people don't know about is how we tested the heck out of the flash drives coming out of the platform vendors and now our test suite is the industry standard. And we've kept failing many of the very large SSD providers because of our rigor. So, we want to apply very similar rigor when it comes to these platforms coming out from hyperscalers as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mr. Rakers, your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Congratulations on the quarter. As you guys move through the subscription transition, one thing that you\u2019ve talked about in the past was the next kind of transitional phase for the company would move to more of a ratable type model. Can you just give us any kind of updated thoughts you have around that? What maybe the timing might be and what exactly that would entail as the next phase?\nDheeraj Pandey: Sure. Yes, obviously our new products are effectively mostly all ratable in nature. Now they\u2019re still a relatively piece of the equation there. It\u2019s something that\u2019s on our minds but quite honestly I think we have a few more quarters to get through first to I think maybe earn that right to do another movement in the model. And I think right now the focus is on consistent execution, continuing to get the business back to a level of expectations that we have for the business certainly and you know that's the focus. But ultimately, you know we'll need to do that I think to ultimately complete the transition and get to a very predictable revenue model building model etcetera.\nDuston Williams: And even before the ratably change there just a sales comps of that you know and this involves change management and the enablement and you know obviously we are more agile in our quota setting which is twice a year. You know, we do six month quotas unlike most of the enterprise heavy companies. So we are really trying to understand when we move to an ACV base sales comp.\nAaron Rakers: That's perfect. And then the follow up question, you know the number of deals now involving more than one product or one product above core at 28% that's a notable trend you know that the company started to see over the last few quarters. You know, I think last quarter you also noted that you've yet to kind of drive a more bundled sales approach across your organization. You know, can you talk a little bit about what's driving the success of that continued increase? And when looking-forward we can expect maybe a sales motion that bundles a bit more effectively the additional or add-on products?\nDuston Williams: Yes, we know we are approaching this more top down like customer in more solutions-driven than product driven. Each solution will drive many portfolio of products, and that's how we are educating our sales force and our prospects. So in many which ways we are asking him to segment their campaigns based on solutions and then they don't have to go and really talk about six or seven different products, maybe just three different products. Now we have not gone ahead and created a queue out of this bundle, where at the very least, we\u2019re really helping them think about a mini portfolio based on a solution they're approaching.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Elliott: This is Elizabeth on for Katy. Now two questions. One, well, what would your view have been on ACV growth if you had a full quarter of HPE each compared to the 2018 growth that we supported. And where do you expect ACV growth for the full year? And then, I have a follow-up.\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. It's hard to answer on the HP thing \u2013 HPE thing. It clearly depends on the length of the contracts and how much extra we could have done. So that's a tough one to theorize on that one. And then, we did mention I think in the script here that ACV growth for the year would roughly be 25% based on the TCV billings that we presented. And also this GreenLake thing which is fully ratable consumption water is very early for us to comment on. I think over the course of the next four quarters, as we understand the opportunities and the challenges in this hardware subscription model that HP has will be able to come and talk more about it.\nElizabeth Elliott: Thank you. And then a follow-up related to the deals outside of the core offerings. What are some of the software products that are most outperforming your expectations and could you give us an idea of what percent of customers have purchased something outside of the core HCI?\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. On the former, I think we talked about, I talked about it in my narrative as well, obviously AHV, we don't charge for and that's been 47% of our business on a rolling four quarter basis. Prism Pro has been doing very well in terms of attached files which is our software-defined filer, our micro segmentation product called Flow which is now integrating with our SaaS product called Beam. So that together they'll become the unified security posture for the company in a multi-cloud world. And then there\u2019s Era and Frame. So these products, we definitely see a lot of conversations going on, and a lot of attach as well.\nElizabeth Elliott: And did you have an idea of what percent of customers have purchased something outside of the core offerings?\nDheeraj Pandey: Not in our hands right now I think is to 28% of our deals this quarter on a rolling four quarter basis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: On the macro - on the guidance for the year, you talked about macro being a little bit weaker at some of your competitors. Just to be clear, is that something that you have seen in your business up to this point?\nDheeraj Pandey: It's early actually and it's so mixed because we're small Jason, that it's hard to really say whether we're seeing something right now. As I\u2019ve said, international business continues to be the way it was from quarters ago. I don\u2019t know Duston if you want to comment on this?\nDuston Williams: Yes. It\u2019s something obviously that we keep our eye on Jason just because of the frequency I think that you hear about it now. And you know when we\u2019ve look at spending we, you know trying to take a prudent approach to the spending equation looking forward. But there's nothing that you know is significant that we can point to. You always hear a story here or there but there's no trend that we've uncovered from that perspective.\nDheeraj Pandey: Not large enterprise in America is we actually do see doing well. There is a lot of noise in Brexit and China and we continue to monitor that and be cautious about it.\nJason Ader: And then just a follow up, Dheeraj clearly things have gotten better for you guys. But maybe you could talk about some areas of the business where you know you still feel like you could be doing a lot better?\nDheeraj Pandey: Well, I think the big investments that we\u2019re making in commercial and how we really need to make it extremely digital and a lot more efficient is a big part of this. How we can go and get even more developer productivity, I think that's one thing that we don't talk about externally. But we - it's on my mind and the minds of a lot of our people as well as how do we really bring delight to our developers who are also customers actually. We think a lot about our customers outside but sometimes the cobbler's children have no shoes so I think that's one thing we really focused on for the last six months. And I think it's going to bring a lot of you know sort of efficiency to our R&D as well. And we believe there's a lot that we can unlock there too. So between commercial and doing things you know with, with test drive and with test drive and Dev productivity.\nJason Ader: What do you mean by Dev productivity Dheeraj? Is it like more DevOps practices? I'm not quite sure what you mean by that.\nDheeraj Pandey: Well, we have sort of disaggregated our products in the last year and the more we disaggregate the more independence we give them to read independent of each other because in a multi-product portfolio does come up with the challenges of how do you do release management and how do you do integration and testing of integrated products and at the same time provide autonomy to individual product owners to go and release code at even agile, more agile pace setting those are the kind of things that unlocks a lot of value for growing companies.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSimon Leopold: I wanted to touch on the competitive environment given that some of the others within sort of the IT supply chain have talked about, some players becoming more competitive and cutting price whether or not you've seen any change in behavior from the folks you're going up against and then I've got a follow up.\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes, I think the win rates have not changed much. In fact, it's pretty much consistent with the last four quarters. I would say three, four years ago the competitive pressure was from converged infrastructure and big incumbents of the space of storage and virtualization and networking and now, it just happens to be two of us VMware and us and we are talking about how will you navigate this multi-cloud environment over the next five years and we think we have different approaches. I think hyperconvergence as a magic quadrant is really driven by software now as opposed to hardware. And I think it was a battle that we had to win over the last three, four years and I think the dust has finally settled that it's really an operating system play. And I would say that multiproduct portfolio is probably the next big battleground for both companies how to really do this well. I mean, we're doing this organically with no small teams that we come in together with and acquire and we believe that over the long haul I think this is a much better approach than going in and acquiring revenue. So we believe that there is obviously going to be competition. It's a very large market and large markets are red oceans. Red oceans are whales and red oceans are bloody. So we got to be the faster shark that knows how to really navigate change. And just in the last 18 months itself, this notion of running our software and hyperscaler public cloud involvement was something that we probably didn't conceive of three years ago. So, as we go and really expand the surface area for software, we get into other battlegrounds that we haven't talked about before.\nSimon Leopold: And just as a follow-up, I wanted to see how you're thinking about getting back to generating cash. Early in fiscal 2019, you had very strong cash from operations and then you sort of pivoted to making more investments. And I just want to think about what's sort of the trajectory to being a cash-generating company? Thanks.\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. Thank you. And I think this goes back to the transformation of our sales force, being more disciplined about extracting more value for software. I mean, it's a big change for a company that used to sell appliances till about 18 months ago. So I would say that a lot of it is around operational rigor and setting those enablement goals for our sellers who are now selling pure software and subscription, and going and educating the market on this transition itself.\nDuston Williams: Yes. And I think clearly over time, and this is obviously through the next several years here, it's how do we take advantage of the efficiencies that come from a subscription model. And we have to have a flow of renewals coming in first, but what we're doing in the interim is starting to structure the business, thinking from a productivity perspective, a channel productivity, how do we kind of position some of the things that we need to in advance of the subscription renewal and flow if you will, and how do we take advantage of those efficiencies. So, that's over time what's clearly going to help drive that. Now, when we exactly going to get back so we've given you guidance for FY 2020 and you know what that looks like and then now clearly give some updates at Investor Day back in - upcoming in March.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International. Dheeraj, I want to go to Slide 14 and wanted to reference your view that the industry is becoming more like a duopoly where Nutanix is coexisting with VMware and I think the bar chart to the left of the Slide 14 captures that and you\u2019re coexisting with your main competitor. In that context, when I look like - when I look at two, three years from now, what percentage of your billing should capture the entire stack of products that you're marketing. In other words, the second bar chart on the Slide 14 when would this represent more than 50%, 60% of the entire stack of products? And I have a follow up.\nDheeraj Pandey: So, one thing it\u2019s easy to show that the balloon can be made to look bigger by pressing it on the core side. You can always financially engineer things that come out of the core and go into the new products. Do it as accretive revenue is where the real sort of goodness belongs to any multiproduct portfolio company and we are very much focused on that. So, it actually improves seller productivity and channel productivity and it actually the accretive dollars. I would say that in the next three years, if you can actually get 25% of our business accretively to come from there, that\u2019ll be huge actually you know. And doing this right methodically without having to take money out of the left pocket and put in the right pocket will be key to this transformation.\nMehdi Hosseini: So, in the longer term two or three years, we should see basically at least a quarter of your billing driven by the entire stack of products. Is that what you're saying?\nDheeraj Pandey: New products, new products. Yes, I mean at least based on ACV right now we are tracking to like 10%, 11% or something.\nMehdi Hosseini: And then one other question outside of the U.S., yes there was a migration towards a multi-cloud but I still don\u2019t see a more organized way of doing this. There's a lot of standardization in North America or Europe, but not much in the Asian market. How do you see your capitalizing on this? In the past, you've had relationship with the likes of Lenovo. Is there anything there that you can capitalize on? Is there any views or thoughts that you can share with us?\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. I think China definitely between Insper and Lenovo as the server platform partners. But there's something there with Alibaba. We have not had bandwidth to go much deeper there, but it's actually coming up more and more. And Alibaba is also pretty prevalent with SoftBank in Japan. So there's some regional players coming up in that part of the world that we have to get really good with over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. And Tarkan is passionate about international and he talks a lot about - I'm learning a lot from him as well in some of these things. But I think there is going to be the Japanese several platform partners, Fujitsu being an important one and ECE, Hitachi. We\u2019re doing a lot of good work with Fujitsu in Germany as well. So I think there\u2019ll be a lot of local partners that we have to go and share some of the profits with, and that's the value of software that the cost of an additional unit is $0. So you can actually expand the market by sharing some of the margins with other partners. And that's our intent really. Doing this with the hyperscalers, Alibaba, in particular in APAC, but also the server platform vendors who are regional players like Lenovo and Insper and NEC and Fujitsu and Hitachi.\nMehdi Hosseini: Should I be concerned with OpEx commitment? Does this require more investment to be able to drive incremental billing?\nDheeraj Pandey: I wouldn't think it's going to be anything substantial or I mean, mostly a lot of this is supporting of software to these platforms. There's another one where we believe service providers in Asia Pacific will also be a very important part of our overall go-to market transition as well. I mean, we talk about Xi and Xi right now is our data centers but then in the next 12, 18, 24 months, we really want to do this with our software running on partners\u2019 capital so their data centers and their hardware investments and if they\u2019re willing to actually use our billing, and our payments and our identity, then all of sudden we actually get the best of both world between an asset light model of Nutanix with assets really coming from the partners.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Jack Andrews from Needham. Your line is open.\nJack Andrews: Duston, I wanted to see if you could drill down a little bit more on your comments regarding the backlog. I think you mentioned it was largely unchanged versus typically a sequential decline from 4Q to 1Q. Could you go into a little more detail about what is comprised in the backlog now? Do you have a series of much larger deals this point than you typically see?\nDuston Williams: I don't think the composition is that much different and again for us, it's just the backlog again is defined as a PO that we've received that we have not build and there's a different mix of customers and transactions and things like that, but there\u2019s nothing in there unusual that one customers\u2019 dominating and there\u2019s something along those lines. So, it\u2019s pretty much a similar composition and just the fact that at this point in this Q1 we were able to hold that flat and usually Q1 we rely on that a little bit more quite honestly with the weaker both EMEA and APAC are typically weaker for us. And in Q1, Americas had a good Q1 for us. Federal had a pretty good Q1 and things like that. So, nothing unusual there.\nJack Andrews: Okay, thanks for the color. And then just a quick follow up. As you had gone through the educational and enablement process with your sales force in the channel around all your new subscription products, I mean what are people most excited about which product or a couple of subscription products do you think represents the most significant upside from here?\nDheeraj Pandey: So, frame for sure, desktop is a service product. Lot of good proof of concept going on files for those who are actually selling hardware before we are really looking at how do you really connect with channel partners who related to hardware but these days will relate to similar services except being pure software as I think files is another one. And then database is a work in progress many of the bars don't relate to it but the SIs do. The global SIs definitely working on DevOps and as they relate to error a lot, I would say. And many of the mid-market resellers also relating to micro segmentation. So Flow has become a very big part of the AHV drag. So, we don't go and sell AHV by itself because if you can just sell free like oh it's cheap, it's free, you really don't have a good way to sell that but if you go and talk about slow and microsegmentation and the fact that you\u2019re democratizing something that\u2019s very expensive otherwise people are actually embracing both Flow and AHV.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Dheeraj Pandey",
            "content": "Thank you, Tonya. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us and a very happy Thanksgiving in advance. In September, we celebrated our 10th anniversary. It reached $1 billion in annual revenue, faster than most software companies had in the past 20 years with deferred revenue at almost $1 billion as well. In the last two years, we have transformed our business model from appliance to software and are now doing sole subscription. As we look to our next 10 years, we see even bigger opportunities to continue to work hard with our customers to ensure that words frictionless, reliable, and invisible remains synonymous with Nutanix. Q1 was a strong quarter for us based on better than expected financial results, progress in subscription, recorded large deals, as well as continued new product traction. To build on last quarter's strong momentum with $370 million in software and support billings or TCV billings and $305 million in software and support revenue or TCV revenue both metrics beating consensus. We signed the second highest number ever of large deals in a quarter which we define as deals greater than $500,000. Subscription grew to 73% of total billings up from 71% last quarter as we move steadily towards the goal of more than 75% which is our stated goal by the end of fiscal 2020. Later, I'll talk more about why our move to subscription model gives us a competitive edge in a world that is increasingly going hybrid. We also had strong 39% year-over-year deferred revenue growth in Q1 reaching nearly $1 billion in the quarter, a notable milestone. In this call, I want to focus on the three pillars of our execution that are driving this improved financial performance; our go-to-market engine, our move to subscription model as we establish a new baseline and the organic adoption of our new products. The headline of the quarter was our continued momentum in execution across both sales and marketing. In addition to increasing our focus on lead generation, our global sales leaders continue to infuse rigorous operational discipline to our sales process around the world. The Americas region delivered record high software and support or TCV bookings this quarter. We also made excellent progress in sales hiring in the quarter with a record number of net new sales reps. We made another key sales hire during the quarter with the addition of a new VP of Americas channel. The new leadership is focused on helping our partners virtualize, simplify and integrate the multi-cloud experience of our customers. As we noted on last quarter's call, we spend the last three years building a robust enterprise business. Our goal is now to balance that with an equally strong mid-market business, as commercial customers are just as aspirational as enterprises on the hybrid cloud transformation. Not surprisingly, we discovered many of our million dollar accounts in this segment. One real example of a new customer win in this segment was with a U.S.-based Internet service provider. This deal which was $750 million comprised our core AOS operating system, Prism Pro, Bios and native AHV hypervisor to build a scalable private cloud, deleveraging Nutanix to run several of the enterprise apps including their Oracle databases. We also recently added a seasoned technology veteran to our executive team with the hire of Tarkan Maner as Chief Commercial Officer. In his multi-faceted role, Tarkan will lead business development, M&A, global system integrators, service providers and so on for cloud and platform products. I've watched Tarkan build two very meaningful companies in the last 15 years, Wyse Technology and Nexenta. It brings an entrepreneurial mindset and an acute awareness of the computing landscape. His authentic leadership style, a clear bias for action and a broad industry network have helped him create high energy companies in the space of end user computing and storage. I'm thrilled to have an extremely hardworking leader who's passionate about cloud, telcos, people and clarity in communication. Speaking of clarity, let me share some of our progress in the simplification of our go-to market messaging that emphasizes customer solutions rather than individual products. We focused on three solutions around private cloud, end-user computing and databases. One of the most common themes we hear from customers is that they want their computing silos to work seamlessly from performance, security, APIs and ease of use point a few. This frictionless delivery is the focus of our new global ad campaign launched this quarter that shows how Nutanix software brings it all together now to virtualize, simplify and integrate data, applications and infrastructure. This outstanding approach was very well received at our European .NEXT Conference this October, where we brought together 4,500 attendees in Copenhagen at our biggest EMEA even to-date. Customers, prospects, employees and more than 1,200 Nutanix channel partners participated in over 100 technical breakout sessions to hear about the why, the how and the what of our future and how it relates to their multi-cloud journey over the next three to five years. Our customers now want to take our software to hyperscaler substrates in the public cloud as they realize that compute and storage need to set side by side in these highly virtualize network environments. At our conference, we showcased how we are approaching this problem by making the private and public cloud symmetric for our customers. They can build secondary sites, force computing to accommodate seasonal peaks, and globally load balance or distributed application across these data centers with a single fordable software license orchestrated by a single pane of glass that manages both sides of the aisle. It's events like .NEXT that help us drive strong momentum in large deals with new and existing customers. Shortly after .NEXT in Copenhagen we signed a multimillion dollar deal with a leading financial services forum in Germany that attended the event. They are now using Nutanix to run their mission critical financial services applications. This really is great example of how to leverage our premier marketing events to build trust with our prospects. That customer was just one of the 66 customers we signed in the quarter that worth over $1 million record for us. 13 of those customers also spend at least $1 million with us in Q4, with 50% of them increasing their engagement with us to support new workloads in Q1. In addition, this quarter, we closed nine deals worth more than $3 million. Finally, we are close to reaching a milestone of having nearly 1,000 customers with a lifetime spend of more than $1 million, up 39% year-over-year notwithstanding the compression in our topline due to subscription. Our biggest deal this quarter was with the repeat marquee client that invested nearly $9 million in subscription licenses to modernize the infrastructure. This global Fortune 10 company has lifetime bookings with us of over $38 million. The use case fuels a new edge computing solution that will manage their climbing use of IoT sensors and provide additional security to their digital transactions. This relationship accentuates what we are known for in the market reliability, reliability and reliability of our products, our processes and our people in customer support and customer success. And finally, this relationship also underscores how we're helping our Fortune global 100 customers transform from ownership of technology to access to technology with a subscription consumption model. To own music with iTunes or to stream music with Spotify is a simple way to think about tradeoffs of ownership versus access. Given how rapidly technology is changing, companies are introducing new products enterprise customers are waking up to this idea of subscription to a product portfolio being streamed to them in a very similar way. Just a short amount of time, we have shown strong progress in transforming our business to cater this new cloud consumption mentality. This transition will enable us to offer what we believe is one of the infrastructure segments only to license mobility models to protect our customers' investments in multicloud computing. It will help our customers to move investments fluidly between private and public clouds, as their business needs dictate. Our flexible licensing is a competitive differentiator and a clear customer benefit. Equally important is how the subscription model paves the way for our long-term profitability as we set go-to-market incentives, respectively for hunting versus farming of annual contract value or ACV driven by sales versus total contract value or TCV driven by customer success. Speaking of customer success, one of our top subscription deals in the quarter came from a large civilian department of the U.S. government and is worth nearly $5 million. The deal represents this customer's first private cloud solution with our AHV hypervisor to manage and scale mission-critical workloads. The customer who use Nutanix to run Oracle in addition to selecting error for their database management and frame to deliver virtual desktops to its growing user base. They chose us for a product quality and breadth, simplicity and strong customer references. Speaking of simplicity, recently a Nutanix customer posted on an online forum about how easy it is to update Nutanix Clusters. The customer said, \"I just wanted to give a shoutout to Nutanix on here so everyone knows how great and easy it is to set up an entire cluster from scratch\". This customer had previous experience with multimillion-dollar projects for incumbents, which took weeks. That said, with Nutanix, it would have taken two hours. They went on to say, \u201cI know Nutanix talks about this, but we need to be shouting this from the rooftops.\u201d We intend to bring the same level of invisible laps when customers are instantiating workloads in a hyperscale data center of the public cloud. Another example of a $1 million plus subscription deal in Q1 was with a new customer that is a high profile US-based apparel manufacturer. We're helping this customer modernize their infrastructure to move off of a legacy three tier solution into a cloud forest architecture for their data centers, their primary workloads into databases and VDI. We partnered with a global XI who's helping us integrate Xi Beam, Calm, Files, Flow and Prism Pro with our native virtualization technology, AHV. The customer chose us for a simple ease of use, single pane of glass and the flexibility for the IT team to scale an elastic infrastructure. On the topic of flexibility, one of the key benefits of subscription is that it allows customers complete freedom to choose to spend operating our capital budget dollars. The hybrid consumption model in this case unlocks mobility of the entire stack including data, applications, networks and licenses. The 2019 Enterprise Cloud Index or ECI issued just two weeks ago supports these pieces of app mobility. The independent third-party survey asked over 2,600 global IT decision-makers about the state of global enterprise cloud deployments and adoption plans for hybrid cloud. 85% of ECI respondents said hybrid cloud is the ideal IT operating model. 95% reported that it's essential, desirable to be able to easily move applications in the cloud environment. Moreover, 73% said they're moving applications back on-premises, indicating a clear need for mobility. Switching gears to our third pillar of execution in the quarter which was traction of our new product portfolio. Customers know and love us for our reliable HCI core and our customer success ethos. Architecturally, we brought together storage, compute and networking into a platform combining the benefits of web scale architecture with the consumer grade simplicity of a smartphone delivered with a genius-bar like customer support experience. Over time, this trust and loyalty made our customers realized they wanted and needing more from us higher up the stack. Given how poor their other IT relationships are. Our newer products continue to gain traction in the market. In fact, this holistic approach of a hybrid cloud stack is often a critical reason why we win deals. In Q1, our number of deals that included at least product beyond our core HCI offerings increased once again at 28% in a rolling four quarter basis showing nice progression from 26% in the previous quarter. Our software and services portfolio now covers the trifecta of data plane, control plane and management plane. With the data plane comprised of the run time for the machines which themselves a pure software in the world software define. The control plane is where the machines orchestrate other machines and the management plane is where humans interact with machines increasingly with the help of AI in an era of AI ops. One example of the power of our product portfolio is that one of the world's leading organ transplant nonprofit organizations. This customer purchased over $2 million of our software including our core AOS operating system, comm, flow, files and AHV Hypervisor to run their SQL databases. The use of Nutanix software is a critical part of the full scale modernization of the computing platform. When trialing our software earlier this year, we saw 1.5 times performance improvement with the legacy infrastructure. This customer is now evaluating Xi Leap our cloud based data recovery solution. We also scored a competitor win with a largest organic farming cooperative in North America in the quarter. The farming industry has been going through significant changes which drove this customer to look at new and innovative IT solutions to address their database performance issues and support future growth needs. Return to us to reduce operating costs by significantly shrinking the database licensing fees. And a great example for our TCO, the cost savings on these licenses alone funded the purchase of our software. On the topic of hyperscaler platforms we announced Nutanix clusters earlier this year to enable our software to run in public cloud data centers. Our approach to multi-cloud is architecturally different. Just like HCI was so different than converged infrastructure or CI. CI was nothing more than a band aid stropping large technology providers under one roof. We founded this company on the premise that CI was a hack, a temporary coalition of big brands that would not withstand the test of time because it was packaging expensive hardware and software under an umbrella term of convergence with no change to the operating and consumption models. HCI on the other hand was a fundamental rethink on an empty canvas of commodity servers, commodity networks and enterprise great software coming together with an elegant consumer grade design. How we look at the new multi-cloud world of the new HCI challenge with their commodity servers, their commodity networks and our software and design is the journey of this decade. I'll share more about clusters in the coming months. We hope to convince Gartner one more time about the real convergence of cloud's Magic Quadrant. Virtualizing, simplifying and integrating them all together into one delightful experience is in our DNA. Speaking of delight, providing our customers with the freedom to choose which hardware report platform to run our software was a masterstroke for us in 2014. When we decided to open our appliance router market to competition from other server vendors who started to OEM our software, we're pleased to see our new relationship with HPE start to blossom this being the first quarter since the integrated products G8. HPE's huge customer base can now easily adopt Nutanix. As we announced the general availability of our software in HPE ProLiant DX servers, fully integrated with our enabled support, HPE's hybrid cloud in the server's GreenLake solution was built in Nutanix AHV Hypervisor is also generally available now. As a result, we saw a number of new customer wins in these solutions during the quarter. In Q1, more than half of our HPE DX customers were also new logos to Nutanix, validating this new partnership and our software has increased exposure to HPE installed base. One example of how our new relationship with HPE is ramping faster than any of our past OEM partnerships is a nearly $2 million deal in Q1 with a new customer which is a large EMEA-based insurance company. Early success is compelling customers who already explored databases and service used case with Nutanix Era. One very critical initiative within the company is Xi test drive service running on Google GCP. To me this is one of our most important projects to get right for a true digital transformation of the company. How our prospective customers go from a digital banner ad to trying out our entire product portfolio hosted in the public cloud in a one click, self-guided experience is a testament to how far we've come from being an appliance company a couple of years ago. If we get this right, it'll immensely improve profitability in the commercial mid-market as most of the prospects would then be enable with a digital touch, and only the self-selected ones would require a human touch. I'm proud to say that in this last year, we also done a thousand-odd credit card transactions to sell our cloud services with zero human touch. Digital transactions are core to our future including for subscription renewal and eventually to our profitability. Finally, we are humbled we recognize that Comparably is a great company for millennials to work for in the San Francisco Bay area and also Bloomberg Intelligence is one of the 50 companies to watch for in 2020. Before I turn it over to on to bring it all together now. I want to bring it all together now. Strong quarter, continued progress and the rollout of a subscription model, record number of large deals, growing demand for new products and an increasingly digital go-to-market strategy, beneath it all, the care and attention we give customers remains one of our most substantial competitive differentiators. Our proven track record and passion for simplifying complexity makes us a trusted partner for enterprises building the computing platform. Our long-term differentiation continues to be at the intersection of public and private clouds in how we virtualize, simplify and integrate the silos to make computing invisible anyway. Now I'd like to turn it over to Duston. Duston? Well, I think - thanks for the question, Matt. I think at the high level when we look at our overall quarterly performance, 40% from International hasn't been and in line with what we did a year ago. So we don't see anything unusual in APAC and EMEA. Obviously, Chris' leadership has been telling in America, they would love to actually go and apply a lot of that rigor to both APAC and EMEA as well. Yes. Again on GCP, you know I talked about Google test drive, one of our most important projects to get right for us to increasingly have a digital go-to market motion and it's a very, very important project for us to really, really improve the efficiency of our commercial segment. We are working very closely on Kubernetes, Calm and Anthos are coming together well. And our approach is to integrate Anthos to the control team of Calm, rather than raw hypervisor like AHV or something. So, there's some really good progress we have made over the last three to six months in Anthos with GCP. And we're hopeful that with the recent acquisition of CloudSimple, it will open up new doors for bare metal as a service. And bring GCP on par with what we are doing with AWS and Azure. Well part of is just creating a new baseline because that - we just flushed through a big chunk of the transformation. We think we have a stable term length now. Our salespeople are getting used to selling subscription. Our customers are getting used to hearing about subscription, our channels partners have gotten enabled. We know how to defend value, protect value through software. It's getting better as well in that sense. So, I think all in all this was a tough 12 months for us. But I think it was well worth it. So, I think - to summarize it's really a new baseline and of course we put some real meat behind the bones when it comes to pipeline and marketing and demand generation and things like that. Yes. I think you know AWS definitely wants their hardware outpost to really run our software as well but also we hope to actually do a lot of that stuff in a way that is reliable and stable and because we take longer - one of the things that people don't know about is how we tested the heck out of the flash drives coming out of the platform vendors and now our test suite is the industry standard. And we've kept failing many of the very large SSD providers because of our rigor. So, we want to apply very similar rigor when it comes to these platforms coming out from hyperscalers as well. Sure. Yes, obviously our new products are effectively mostly all ratable in nature. Now they're still a relatively piece of the equation there. It's something that's on our minds but quite honestly I think we have a few more quarters to get through first to I think maybe earn that right to do another movement in the model. And I think right now the focus is on consistent execution, continuing to get the business back to a level of expectations that we have for the business certainly and you know that's the focus. But ultimately, you know we'll need to do that I think to ultimately complete the transition and get to a very predictable revenue model building model etcetera. Yes. It's hard to answer on the HP thing \u2013 HPE thing. It clearly depends on the length of the contracts and how much extra we could have done. So that's a tough one to theorize on that one. And then, we did mention I think in the script here that ACV growth for the year would roughly be 25% based on the TCV billings that we presented. And also this GreenLake thing which is fully ratable consumption water is very early for us to comment on. I think over the course of the next four quarters, as we understand the opportunities and the challenges in this hardware subscription model that HP has will be able to come and talk more about it. Yes. On the former, I think we talked about, I talked about it in my narrative as well, obviously AHV, we don't charge for and that's been 47% of our business on a rolling four quarter basis. Prism Pro has been doing very well in terms of attached files which is our software-defined filer, our micro segmentation product called Flow which is now integrating with our SaaS product called Beam. So that together they'll become the unified security posture for the company in a multi-cloud world. And then there's Era and Frame. So these products, we definitely see a lot of conversations going on, and a lot of attach as well. Not in our hands right now I think is to 28% of our deals this quarter on a rolling four quarter basis. It's early actually and it's so mixed because we're small Jason, that it's hard to really say whether we're seeing something right now. As I've said, international business continues to be the way it was from quarters ago. I don't know Duston if you want to comment on this? Not large enterprise in America is we actually do see doing well. There is a lot of noise in Brexit and China and we continue to monitor that and be cautious about it. Well, I think the big investments that we're making in commercial and how we really need to make it extremely digital and a lot more efficient is a big part of this. How we can go and get even more developer productivity, I think that's one thing that we don't talk about externally. But we - it's on my mind and the minds of a lot of our people as well as how do we really bring delight to our developers who are also customers actually. We think a lot about our customers outside but sometimes the cobbler's children have no shoes so I think that's one thing we really focused on for the last six months. And I think it's going to bring a lot of you know sort of efficiency to our R&D as well. And we believe there's a lot that we can unlock there too. So between commercial and doing things you know with, with test drive and with test drive and Dev productivity. Well, we have sort of disaggregated our products in the last year and the more we disaggregate the more independence we give them to read independent of each other because in a multi-product portfolio does come up with the challenges of how do you do release management and how do you do integration and testing of integrated products and at the same time provide autonomy to individual product owners to go and release code at even agile, more agile pace setting those are the kind of things that unlocks a lot of value for growing companies. Yes, I think the win rates have not changed much. In fact, it's pretty much consistent with the last four quarters. I would say three, four years ago the competitive pressure was from converged infrastructure and big incumbents of the space of storage and virtualization and networking and now, it just happens to be two of us VMware and us and we are talking about how will you navigate this multi-cloud environment over the next five years and we think we have different approaches. I think hyperconvergence as a magic quadrant is really driven by software now as opposed to hardware. And I think it was a battle that we had to win over the last three, four years and I think the dust has finally settled that it's really an operating system play. And I would say that multiproduct portfolio is probably the next big battleground for both companies how to really do this well. I mean, we're doing this organically with no small teams that we come in together with and acquire and we believe that over the long haul I think this is a much better approach than going in and acquiring revenue. So we believe that there is obviously going to be competition. It's a very large market and large markets are red oceans. Red oceans are whales and red oceans are bloody. So we got to be the faster shark that knows how to really navigate change. And just in the last 18 months itself, this notion of running our software and hyperscaler public cloud involvement was something that we probably didn't conceive of three years ago. So, as we go and really expand the surface area for software, we get into other battlegrounds that we haven't talked about before. Yes. Thank you. And I think this goes back to the transformation of our sales force, being more disciplined about extracting more value for software. I mean, it's a big change for a company that used to sell appliances till about 18 months ago. So I would say that a lot of it is around operational rigor and setting those enablement goals for our sellers who are now selling pure software and subscription, and going and educating the market on this transition itself. So, one thing it's easy to show that the balloon can be made to look bigger by pressing it on the core side. You can always financially engineer things that come out of the core and go into the new products. Do it as accretive revenue is where the real sort of goodness belongs to any multiproduct portfolio company and we are very much focused on that. So, it actually improves seller productivity and channel productivity and it actually the accretive dollars. I would say that in the next three years, if you can actually get 25% of our business accretively to come from there, that'll be huge actually you know. And doing this right methodically without having to take money out of the left pocket and put in the right pocket will be key to this transformation. New products, new products. Yes, I mean at least based on ACV right now we are tracking to like 10%, 11% or something. Yes. I think China definitely between Insper and Lenovo as the server platform partners. But there's something there with Alibaba. We have not had bandwidth to go much deeper there, but it's actually coming up more and more. And Alibaba is also pretty prevalent with SoftBank in Japan. So there's some regional players coming up in that part of the world that we have to get really good with over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. And Tarkan is passionate about international and he talks a lot about - I'm learning a lot from him as well in some of these things. But I think there is going to be the Japanese several platform partners, Fujitsu being an important one and ECE, Hitachi. We're doing a lot of good work with Fujitsu in Germany as well. So I think there'll be a lot of local partners that we have to go and share some of the profits with, and that's the value of software that the cost of an additional unit is $0. So you can actually expand the market by sharing some of the margins with other partners. And that's our intent really. Doing this with the hyperscalers, Alibaba, in particular in APAC, but also the server platform vendors who are regional players like Lenovo and Insper and NEC and Fujitsu and Hitachi. I wouldn't think it's going to be anything substantial or I mean, mostly a lot of this is supporting of software to these platforms. There's another one where we believe service providers in Asia Pacific will also be a very important part of our overall go-to market transition as well. I mean, we talk about Xi and Xi right now is our data centers but then in the next 12, 18, 24 months, we really want to do this with our software running on partners' capital so their data centers and their hardware investments and if they're willing to actually use our billing, and our payments and our identity, then all of sudden we actually get the best of both world between an asset light model of Nutanix with assets really coming from the partners. So, frame for sure, desktop is a service product. Lot of good proof of concept going on files for those who are actually selling hardware before we are really looking at how do you really connect with channel partners who related to hardware but these days will relate to similar services except being pure software as I think files is another one. And then database is a work in progress many of the bars don't relate to it but the SIs do. The global SIs definitely working on DevOps and as they relate to error a lot, I would say. And many of the mid-market resellers also relating to micro segmentation. So Flow has become a very big part of the AHV drag. So, we don't go and sell AHV by itself because if you can just sell free like oh it's cheap, it's free, you really don't have a good way to sell that but if you go and talk about slow and microsegmentation and the fact that you're democratizing something that's very expensive otherwise people are actually embracing both Flow and AHV."

            "name": "Duston Williams",
            "content": "Thank you, Dheeraj. Q1 was a quarter during which we met or exceeded our guidance for software and support billings, software and support revenue, gross margin, operating expenses and earnings per share. We were pleased with the amount of pipeline we generated in the quarter in that our backlog position showed very little change from Q4 FY 2019 to Q1 FY 2020. This was in sharp contrast to the fact that over the last three years we have experienced on average about a 25% decline in backlog from Q4 to Q1. During the quarter, we also made good progress on our shift to our recurring subscription business. In Q1, subscription billings accounted for 73% of total billings up from 71% in Q4 and subscription revenue now accounts for 69% of total revenue, up from 65% in Q4. This subscription shift for the quarter was in line with our guidance last quarter at which time, we mentioned that the subscription percentages would fluctuate a bit plus or minus for the next couple of quarters with a goal of 75% of billing from subscriptions by Q4 of fiscal 2020. Q1 marked our fifth quarter into the subscription transition, we have strived during this transitionary period to find an ideal financial metric to portray an apples-to-apples comparison of our top line growth one that mixes the attributes of the old life of device model with the new subscription model. Historically, we've had one metric TCV or total contract value for software and support that we apply to show the growth rates for the entire company which combined the old life of device model business model and the new subscription based business model. Using TCV as a growth metric works well for the old life of device model but not for the new subscription based model as TCV ignores changes in term lengths and therefore significantly understates the true growth of the business in a period of decreasing term loans. As such, we believe the single best metric to measure the true growth profile of the company during our transition to our new subscription based model is new annual contract value plus renewals or ACV for short booked in the quarter, which includes sales of life of device licenses based on an assumed five-year term. By calculating in this way, we take into account the changing term lengths while still showing the impact of our continued sales of life of device licenses. Having aggregate ACV in any given period will allow us for a cleaner apples-to-apples comparison of period-over-period growth rates. In its most simplistic form, we define ACV booked in the quarter as the annual contract value of new business plus the annual contract value of renewals. And we calculate ACV booked in the quarter by taking the value of each transaction booked in the quarter including renewals but excluding professional services divided by its term length and then summing the total of those values. We have updated our investor deck to include this new ACV metric. The average dollar weighted term length in Q1 2020 including renewals was 3.9 years versus 3.9 years in Q4 2019. This calculation assumes life of device licenses for five year terms. Now moving on to some specific Q1 financial highlights. Again for simplicity purposes and as we said last quarter, we used the term TCV or total contract value to describe our software and support revenue in billings. TCV revenue or software and support revenue for the first quarter exceeded our guidance range of $290 million to $300 million coming in at $305 million up 9% from a year ago and up 6% from the previous quarter, reflecting the revenue compression from the company's ongoing transition to subscription and the significant reduction of hardware revenue. TCV billings or software and support billings were $370 million versus our guidance of $360 million to $370 million, up 5% from the year ago quarter and up 3% from the prior quarter also reflecting the billings compression from the company's ongoing transition to subscription in the significant reduction of hardware billings. ACV booked in the quarter was $123 million and up 18% from the year ago quarter. New customer bookings represented 24% of total bookings in the quarter the same as Q1 2019 and up from 23% in Q4 2019. Although we only had a partial shipment and a quarter of shipments, our HPE DX-related bookings got off to a good start with about $8 million in sales including 25 new customers to Nutanix. We will not normally disclose this level of detail but we felt that was important to provide an initial indication of the progress early in the relationship. Americas was our best performing region in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, the enterprise-related business outperformed the commercial business. Our federal business performed slightly better than expected. In Q1 TCV bookings are softer, and support bookings from our international regions represented 40% of total bookings versus 40% in Q1 2019. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 80% in line with our guidance. Operating expenses were $386 million and at the lower end of our guidance range of $385 million to $390 million. And our non-GAAP net loss was $135 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.71 per share. A few balance sheet highlights, we closed the quarter with cash and short term investments of $889 million down $20 million from Q4, we used $26 million of cash flow from operations in Q3 which was negatively impacted by $10 million of ESPP outflow. Free cash flow during the quarter was negative $44 million and this performance was also negatively impacted by the $10 million of the ESPP outflow in the quarter. Turning to our details of our Q2 guidance on a non-GAAP basis for Q2, we expect TCV billings or software and support billings to be between $410 million and $420 million versus current consensus estimates of $410 million. TCV revenue or software and support revenue to be between $330 million and $335 million versus current consensus estimates of $328 million, gross margins of approximately 80%, operating expenses between $400 million and $410 million versus current consensus estimates of $407 million in a per share loss of approximately $0.70 using weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $193 million. The TCV billings or software and support billings guidance assumes the dollar weighted average deal terms remain constant quarter-over-quarter at 3.9 years. Based on the TCV billings or software and support billings at the guidance midpoint of $415 million, ACV for Q2 would approximate a $135 million reflecting an approximate year-over-year growth rate of 24%. Now turning to the fiscal 2020 guidance. Our guidance for fiscal 2020 remains unchanged, which we believe to be prudent based on the uncertain macro environment referenced by many infrastructure related companies over the last several months. So, specifically for fiscal 2020, we expect TCV billings or software and support billings between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion. TCV revenue or software and support revenue between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. Gross margins of approximately 80% and operating expenses between $1.65 billion and $1.7 billion. For representative purposes, based on the TCV billings, our software and support billings at the guidance midpoint of $1.7 billion, ACV for fiscal 2020 were approximate $535 million, reflecting approximate year-over-year growth rate of 25%. The guidance for fiscal 2020 assumes no major economic downturn during the fiscal year and no change to the current dollar-weighted average deal terms currently at 3.9 years. And with that, operator, you could now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Yes, it's not as simple as that necessarily because the ACV calc obviously different term lengths are weighted differently within the ACV but you can get some feel there for the difference but I wouldn't take that literally. And even before the ratably change there just a sales comps of that you know and this involves change management and the enablement and you know obviously we are more agile in our quota setting which is twice a year. You know, we do six month quotas unlike most of the enterprise heavy companies. So we are really trying to understand when we move to an ACV base sales comp. Yes, we know we are approaching this more top down like customer in more solutions-driven than product driven. Each solution will drive many portfolio of products, and that's how we are educating our sales force and our prospects. So in many which ways we are asking him to segment their campaigns based on solutions and then they don't have to go and really talk about six or seven different products, maybe just three different products. Now we have not gone ahead and created a queue out of this bundle, where at the very least, we're really helping them think about a mini portfolio based on a solution they're approaching. Yes. It's something obviously that we keep our eye on Jason just because of the frequency I think that you hear about it now. And you know when we've look at spending we, you know trying to take a prudent approach to the spending equation looking forward. But there's nothing that you know is significant that we can point to. You always hear a story here or there but there's no trend that we've uncovered from that perspective. Yes. And I think clearly over time, and this is obviously through the next several years here, it's how do we take advantage of the efficiencies that come from a subscription model. And we have to have a flow of renewals coming in first, but what we're doing in the interim is starting to structure the business, thinking from a productivity perspective, a channel productivity, how do we kind of position some of the things that we need to in advance of the subscription renewal and flow if you will, and how do we take advantage of those efficiencies. So, that's over time what's clearly going to help drive that. Now, when we exactly going to get back so we've given you guidance for FY 2020 and you know what that looks like and then now clearly give some updates at Investor Day back in - upcoming in March. I don't think the composition is that much different and again for us, it's just the backlog again is defined as a PO that we've received that we have not build and there's a different mix of customers and transactions and things like that, but there's nothing in there unusual that one customers' dominating and there's something along those lines. So, it's pretty much a similar composition and just the fact that at this point in this Q1 we were able to hold that flat and usually Q1 we rely on that a little bit more quite honestly with the weaker both EMEA and APAC are typically weaker for us. And in Q1, Americas had a good Q1 for us. Federal had a pretty good Q1 and things like that. So, nothing unusual there."

As we continue to navigate through the COVID pandemic. How Q4 was a strong hand to an excellent Fiscal year, which was marked by consistent execution and good progress across both financial and strategic objectives.  Your Dynex delivers a strong Fiscal 2021 across a number of areas. They exceeded our guidance. And we Quarter of the year. As our team consistently over the TV. We felt good linearity within each Quarter. As we benefit from ongoing operational improvements in our go-to-market engine.  And we also saw improved economics and the continued build-out of our renewals business, which will help drive the acceleration of our top-line as we approach the completion of our subscription journey. Importantly, we drove this top-line improvement while carefully managing expenses, leading to a substantially improved bottom-line performance compared to our prior Fiscal year.  On the strategic front, we received a $750 million investment from Bain Capital in one, which provided additional financial flexibility to fund our growth. And we made good progress on our alliance partnerships, extending our relationships with HP, Lenovo. And more recently, signing a new agreement with Rod Hall. Looking deeper at Q4, the outperformed on all our key metrics. Seeing all time, our recent record in a number of areas.  We reported record revenue up 19% Year-over-year. The best Growth we've delivered in the last three years. We saw a record ACV billing, which grew 26% Year-over-year. Our highest Growth rate in over two years. We again saw good linearity in Q4, which contributed to better-than-expected cash flow.  The underlying momentum in the business gives us confidence in providing strong guidance for the first quarter of our fiscal 22. And we believe for this investment well, to achieve our plan for the balance of the year. Overall, we were pleased with our Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2021 Financial results. Which were identified against the continued challenging backdrop of COVID-19.  We saw strong momentum across our entire hybrid multi-cloud portfolio during the Quarter. Including both core and emerging products. On my thing, products, new ACV bookings, grew over 100% Year-over-year and saw a record rolling four-quarter a tax rate of 41%. One example of a complete portfolio solution was our largest deal of the quarter.  A multi-million-dollar ACV deals with a Fortune 100 Financial Services Company that expanded their use of our core Hexis software to run their mission-critical applications. Along with a large expansion of their era footprint to automate and simplify that database management. The sonics cluster, a key component of our hybrid multi-cloud platform, continued to see solid momentum during the Quarter.  One example, where the Global 2000 real estate e-commerce Company, that [Indiscernible] cluster on AWS to expand that [Indiscernible] footprint and enable that lift and shift data center consolidation. In Europe, a large government ministry to our cloud platform, along with our Unified storage solution, including Pfizer and ah, SMIC, has the primary cloud platform.  I'd now like to take a moment to highlight some key takeaways from our Investor Day in June. Be highlighted. Our leadership position in the large and growing hyper-converged infrastructure market. And the substantial additional opportunity we see in our decent markets.  Specifically, we noted a combined total available market opportunity in our core and different markets. As we expect to exceed $60 billion by 2025. We said our plan was to focus on delivering a single platform that fixed Nutanix hallmarks, simplicity, and performance into the hybrid multi-cloud market.  We laid out a roadmap for our solutions strategy and how we're streamlining our portfolio. Focusing on a fewer, bigger bet. In the area folk database-as-a-service, unified storage, and desktop-as-a-service. We also explained how we're expecting to see go-to-market leverage by executing on low-cost renewals.  Benefiting from solution selling and from increasing our focus on partnerships. And finally, we provided a model targeting free cash flow, breakeven. In the second half of calendar 2022 and 25% Annualized SEC filings. Both through Fiscal year 25. And we're tracking well on both metrics. Next, I'd like to also provide an update on some of our previously discussed priorities.  First on deepening our partnerships to provide more impact on how we go to market. Our recently announced partnership with Red Hat the world's leading provider of commercial OpenFlow solutions. Brings together Red Hat, industry-leading, Red Hat Enterprise Linux around, and its OpenShift container platform.  With the simplicity, flexibility, and resilience of our platform. Nutanix, it's now the preferred choice for hedge HCI on Red Hat's platform. And our HBE hypervisor is certified to support around and OpenShift on the Nutanix platform. Likewise, OpenShift. If now the preferred choice for enterprise full-stack Kubernetes on the Nutanix platform.  Finally, the two companies also have a neutral support agreement and a research and development roadmap focused on ensuring customer success and enhanced integration, respectively. This partnership provides customers with a full-stack platform to build, scale and manage containerized and virtualized cloud-native applications in a hybrid multi-cloud environment.  We see this as an important proof point in our strategy of furthering customer choice and enhancing our platform by partnering with other best-in-class providers. During the Quarter, we also announced an expanded partnership with HP, in which they are offering new Capex era are multi-database operations and management solutions bundled with HP Pro-Line servers as-a-service to HBP agreement.  In addition to our core platform, which is already a part of a [Indiscernible] offering. Now I'd like to turn to another of our priorities, diversity and [Indiscernible] We released our first environmental, social, and governance of EFC report. During the Quarter detailing our initiatives in the various and establishing a baseline. We can measure ourselves against.  This is an important first step in our journey towards having greater diversity and intuition and our workforce and enabling more sustainable businesses for both mechanics and our customers. We also held our first global women's Conference in July with Nutanix leaders and outside experts, both to our entire employee base about how we can redefine leadership to include diverse backgrounds and perspectives.  In closing, I'm pleased with the execution across the board. And our fourth Quarter has spent about a full Fiscal year, especially given the challenging backdrop created by the pandemic. And the fact that it was the Fiscal year of our ACV model. We are entering our fiscal 22 with a strong position.  Finally, I'm looking forward to connecting with many of you at our upcoming doc next user conference being held September 20th through the 23rd. Let me look forward to welcoming tens of thousands of our customers and partners. Please see our Earnings press release on our website for registration details. And with that, I will hand it over to Duston Williams. Dustin.\nDuston Williams: Thank you, Rajiv. Q4 was another quarter of consistent execution, as well as a great way to finish out the fiscal year. Sales were strong throughout the entire quarter. There was no unusual deal slippage, and we build a backlog during the quarter. In Q4, we exceeded all guidance metrics in our overall business model continues to be strengthened by the benefits of our subscription focus.  A few key highlights for the Quarter included record new ACV billings, record total ACV billings, record, total billings, record total revenue. Record emerging products, new ACV bookings, a record number of greater than $1 million transactions in the quarter. And we had the largest year-over-year total percentage growth in revenue since Q4, 18.  Now I move onto some specific Q4 financial highlights. And before I get into the specific details for the Q4 and FY 21 financial highlights. I would like to remind you that all future financial disclosures with aligned with disclosure and guidance metrics, the roadmap that we provided during our June 22nd Investor Day presentation.  For further details in clarification about our go-forward disclosure plan. I would encourage investors to review the slide titled Guidance and disclosure plan for FY 22 from my Investor Day presentation. ACV billings for Q4 were 176 million, reflecting 26% growth year-over-year above our guidance range of 170 million to 175 million. And ahead of the Street consensus number of 173 million.  New ACV bookings, which include new logo ACV, as well as upsell ACV, experienced the strongest year-over-year growth rate since Q1, 19. ARR at the end of Q4 was 0.88 billion growing 83% year-over-year. Run-rate ACV as of the end of Q4 was 1.54 billion, growing 26% Year-over-year, compared to our estimated Growth of the Mid-20% range.  Our average contract term blanks increased slightly to 3.4 years versus 3.3 years in Q3 21 as our largest deal in the quarter from an existing customer, was a 5-year term. We also had a few other notable 5-year deals from existing customers. At this point, we would expect our average contract term lengths to trend back down next Quarter. Most likely in the low 3-year range. As one usually carries a significant amount of federal business.  And our federal customers typically have much shorter average contract term lengths. Assuming contract term lines do approach the low 3-year range in one, we would approximate the TCV to ACV billings ratio to be somewhere around 2.25. Versus the 2.4 in Q4. Revenue was 391 million growing 19% from Q4, 20 substantially above the Street consensus number of 365 million.  We have not seen this level of Year-over-year Growth rate in revenue since Q4, 18 emerging products, new ACV bookings grew in excess of 100% year-over-year. The emerging products attach rate was 41%. The Q4 sales rep productivity significantly exceeded our assumptions set forth at Investor Day. Our non-GAAP Gross margin in Q4 was 82.9% versus our guidance of 81.5 to 82% Operating expenses were 373 million versus our guidance of 380 to 385 million.  Our Q4 expenses included approximately 12 million in severance expenses related to our previously disclosed sales and marketing headcount reduction. Our non-GAAP net loss was 55 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.26 per share. Q4 linearity remains very good. DFO's in Q4 were 48 days up from 37 days in Q3, 21 and down significantly from 68 days in Q4, 20.  Our free cash flow for Q4 was once again, aided by good linearity coming in at a negative forty-two million, sixteen million betters than the Street consensus. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of 1 to 1 billion down slightly from 1.25 billion in Q3 21. Before I provide the Q1 guidance overview, let me first do a quick recap of FY 21. ACV billings were 594 million growing 18% versus FY 20 and versus the 590 to 595 million range we provided at our Investor Day.  Once again, as we mentioned last quarter, or a total Fiscal year ACV billing, uh, not derived from the simple addition of the four fiscal quarters. For our reported quarterly ACV billings. we annualized any deal that is less than one year in term length. And our yearly ACV billings calculations eliminate any duplication that happens with the renewal of a deal that occurs within the period and is less than one year in duration.  Based on this methodology. Over the last three fiscal years, with some of the four fiscal quarters of ACV billings have exceeded the adjusted annual ACV billings by six to 7% We would encourage investors to account for this distinction during the modeling process.  FY 21 new ACV billings, which includes new logo ACV, as well as upsell ACV, were 433 million growing 11% versus FY 20 and versus the 430 to 435 million range we provided at our Investor Day. Our renewal business performed well within our expectations for FY 21 renewals, ACV, including loads, support renewals, or a 161 million growing 38% versus FY 20 and versus the approximate 160 million estimates, we shared at Investor Day.  FY 21 renewals TCV, including LoD support renewals, were a 179 million growing 32% versus FY 20 Revenue was 1.39 billion growing 7% versus FY 2020. Yearly revenue growth was impacted by term compression during the year. Customer retention, including loads and subscriptions, closed the year at 96%. The gross retention rate for our subscription business continued to operate within the range of greater than 90% as provided during our Investor Day.  The net dollar retention rate, including the LoD business, was 124% versus the Investor Day estimate of approximately 125%. The net dollar retention rate for our subscription-based business only was 158% versus the Investor Day estimate of approximately 155% Emerging products, new ACV bookings grew 97% in FY 21. And we also added 61 G2K customers in FY 21. Now, turning to our Q1 22 guidance, the guidance for Q1 is as follows.  ACV billings to be between a hundred and seventy-two and a hundred and seventy-seven million representing year-over-year growth of 25 to 28% Gross margin by approximately 81.5% operating expenses between 365370 million weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 216 million.  The one ACV billings guidance, which calls for year-over-year growth of 25% to 28%, compares to the actual growth of 14% in Q1 20, 10% in Q1 21, and versus the street consensus growth for Q1 22 of 23% based on continued good execution and an increasing renewal base.  And a robust backlog, all supported by a strong product portfolio. We are pleased to project a Q1 22 year-over-year ATV billings growth rate, that is on par with our strong Q4 21 ATV billings growth rate of 26% Based on the 122 ACV billings guidance, we expect us to grow 65% or more Year-over-year. I'd like to make one final comment regarding our ACV billings trends for FY 20-22.  Due to our growing mix of renewals. For the second half of FY 22, where you would expect a higher amount of ACV billings in Q4 versus Q3 than what is currently reflected in the consensus estimates. This mix shift from Q3 to Q4 is a direct result of our growing ATR or available to renew base of renewals that show a proportionately larger increase in Q4 versus Q3.  We strongly advise analysts and investors to carefully look at their quarter-over-quarter ACV billings estimates to ensure that the strong growth in Q4 relative to Q3 is reflected in models. With that Operator. Could you please open the call-up for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: As a reminder, to ask a question. On your telephone, to withdraw your question, press the pound key. Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Thanks. Congratulations on the Quarter. And just wanted to kind of maybe level set the discussion around the base of renewal opportunity and the linearity throughout this next fiscal year.  Duston is there any way that you can help us frame a just relative in size how large the basic renewal opportunity looks like this year, relative to fiscal 21. And what exactly that linearity doesn't look like as a progression through the quarterly, quarterly numbers through fiscal point here.\nDuston Williams: Sure. Aaron. We provided a fair amount of detail during Investor Day. We obviously just reported on the 21 numbers. We gave a 23 estimate; we gave a 25 estimate during the Investor Day to relative to. FY 22. Again, there won't be obviously a massive increase in FY 22 on the renewals just because you've got some offsetting load support renewals declining and then the subscription renewals are increasing.  I will tell you and I mentioned this in the script that, you know, the first three quarters of the fiscal year have a slight increase, but not much, but there is a large tranche in Q4 that starts to kick in on the subscription renewals.  And that's why the comment was. Just to kind of look at the quarterly splits there because there will be just based on the ATR, the available to renew in Q4, the amount increases quite a bit relative to certain in Q2 and Q3.\nAaron Rakers: And then a real quick follow-on is that you talked about the average weighted terms coming down. Relative to 3.4 in fiscal 1Q. Do you think that we continue to trend downward through the course, the successive quarters through fiscal '22?\nDuston Williams: Well, probably not that much. Now, 10th here there maybe. But again, in Q1 the federal business ends up being a much larger percentage of the total business just because of the federal year-end in September and federal terms are quite a bit lower in general.  So and you saw the same thing actually last year. Quite honestly, from Q4 to Q3, you saw -- I don't have it exactly in front of me, but I think it's a three-tenths of a year decrease, something like that. From Q4 to one, and then it kind of flattened a little bit.  So definitely will come down as we see it today. And as we get through the first month and that's what we're seeing already. But then I would suspect that kind of be flattish a little bit, but I don't think there's any. Shane certainly from the kind of the 2.8 to 3 as we see it today, as we laid out at Investor Day.\nAaron Rakers: You're going. Thank you, Duston.\nDuston Williams: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yeah. Thanks. I have 2 quick ones. First is, it seems like you're taking share in the HCI market in the first half of calendar 21, and I just was hoping you could talk about why you think that's happening?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. Look, I mean, I think there's a knock. We are seeing nice quarter-over-quarter improvement in our window. They are obviously very focused on this market. VTM execution has continued to improve throughout the entire year.  And fundamentally, and goalie and dad with a very strong offering that we continue to get better. They're the best in terms of managing data, offering all forms of storage. Moving that to hybrid cloud, as you know, we provide the best freedom of choice across hypervisors, across Cognex dot farms, and get me the fact.  And of course, going forward across multiple cloud customers, like the simplicity of what we provide and then our NPS as 90 continues to be better than almost everybody else. So we have a sustainable launch this year, combined with the increasing focus. The improvements in our operational execution. That's what's leading to the focus.\nJason Ader: Alright, thanks. And then just a follow-up on that is in terms of this whole cloud versus on-prem debate, how are your conversations with customers changing over the last year? And are you seeing any pendulum swing about towards the on-prem environment?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I mean, I think there's been a lot set of this recently right about the cloud. And I think customers are going to be more nuanced about how they go to the cloud. There. There's just. Both a cooking application, san, new applications that come into, come into play here.  And obviously, customers now are looking at different things, but I need to be in a multi-cloud world. I don't want to be locked. The one product going to be running lag applications across all clouds. And we are seeing very specific use cases that customers are looking at, right.  So one class of customers or people moving on-prem, wanting to migrate to the cloud. Our user cloud. We're seeing them use us to expand, take, expanding their existing footprints into the cloud.  Disaster recovery of the use case for customers that are having more public cloud-oriented historically, desktop to look at South costs. Just coming to look at that data governance security, they're starting to look at cloud lock-in and see that they're also looking at there are more of a multi-cloud environment, hybrid environment.  So I think there are definitely more conversations that were happening, happening with our customer base around these. And again, we're starting to see the youth. It doesn't come into play, right? In production.\nJason Ader: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hey guys, thanks for the questions. Pretty so that's your biggest upside in four years versus our estimate. So nice to see the software side really driving that upside and coming out. This transition equity speed.  So kudos to you guys. At a high level, are you seeing a pickup or steady-state for the conversions of traditional three-tier storage architectures too hyper-converged? And going back to what you just said around used cases, any changes in the used cases for hyper-converged versus the last few quarters.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yeah. David, as we said at Investor Day then the fundamental benefits of continued to apply, right? Simplicity in Operations Management, bringing these silos together but whining, good TCO, competitor tradition this year. And what we're seeing now with HCI, they are able to address a broad set of enterprise [Indiscernible].  And we've seen that. For example, our largest deal of this quarter was with a large financial services customer. And they are of course running all the databases of our platform. And that's a high-performance workout. And so we're seeing.  And broadening the adoption of HCI for lots of enterprise workloads. And so I think that trend continues. And then the second trend really is, as you go to the cloud, HCI becomes logical, it's not just an on-prem treaty or replacements, but it also becomes a platform that they can then take to the cloud.\nJames Fish: Understood. And any further commentary you guys can provide on how sustainable this productivity can be, and how that compares to your Analyst Day expectations for increasing productivity over the next few years. And doesn't specify any change to how you're thinking about that mid to high teen\u2019s growth for next year that you alluded to at the analyst.\nDuston Williams: Okay. Let me start with the productivity thing. We have so many things to help productivity going forward. As I said, we're running ahead of the Investor Day estimates, certainly in Q4. And we think the productivity will continue.  To be strong. We have a lot of things going on in the background as far as channel enablement and a lot of autonomous selling that we're trying to enable with the channel; we'll start some solution selling. Clearly, partnerships are picking up. Not to mention our renewals and things like that. So lots of good stuff happening.  From a productivity perspective, I think then if you've kind of backed up and even talk a little bit higher level there. The demand environment is good, the pipeline is strong. And not only as a pipeline strong has the quality of the pipe continued to get really stronger as we go on here. The products performing well.  Emerging products continue to increase deal sizes and ASP, or increasing the renewals of building and stuff like that. So when you step back on that, when you look at FY 22, we feel good about 22 obviously are planned for our FY 22 in media. The mapped and the modeling assumptions that we provided at Investor Day for FY 22, and that was obviously meant to be a kind of a one-time thing to help with the modeling efforts.  We're really happy with what happened in Q4. We're really pleased with what we can have guided certainly for one and the likes there. So we feel really good as we go into the fiscal year. And we'll address things as we move forward. But at this point in time, again, that was meant to be kind of a one-time look at 22, but in general. And while we feel very good, about 20 to going into the fiscal year.\nJames Fish: Helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of. Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Great. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats from my side as well. Just taking a step back. Could you maybe talk about the demand environment are you kind of seeing the hesitancy around big data center transformation projects kind of fee that we at this point.  And how did the demand in them and get a trend through August versus, versus expectations that you're seeing any kind of slowdown due to Delta or anything in the revenue here?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Maybe I'll start there. Things have been here. So first of all, I think we're seeing a healthy demand backdrop. And it's being driven by this broad acceleration of digital transformation initiatives, like the [Indiscernible] and COVID actually capitalized, and there is some extent of pent-up demand.  Being realized style as customers have now become used to operating in a corporate environment. Now for us specifically, I would say the demand is being driven by four key areas Flex5, continuing the [Indiscernible] only question about this -- about continuing modernization of their legacy through the infrastructure.  Running more work on our platform helping extended as they move to the cloud, right? Are helping our customers migrate to the cloud. And then, of course, hybrid and remote work is here to stay. And that's another driver for what we're fee to overall, we certainly Delta has not. In fact demand. We're still seeing a good demand environment. And people are continuing to invest in these initiatives with us.\nPinjalim Bora: I understood. Okay. Thank you for that. And one thing about clusters, I guess I think it's now available in the AWS Gulf cloud. What has been the early feedback from federal customers? I know you're going into your biggest federal quarter. But the conversations forming in that area, how do you feel about clusters on the government side?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I think. As you know, fluxes have become available here in [Indiscernible] AWS cloud. And we do expect again a number of government agencies to be looking at operating in golf clubs. And so we're.  And the only knock-on relations with them, but essentially the scene use cases apply to them as well. Right. So how do I extend my sense of the public cloud, how do I do disaster recovery, how do I do the capacity expansion, how do I consolidate data centers?  So the [Indiscernible] used cases, they are starting to see also play out in government. And again, I think it's still early days for us. Has the offering just become available? And I hope to be able to talk to you about future government customers and government customers in future calls at some point.\nPinjalim Bora: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Andrews with Needham.\nJack Andrews: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could unpack a little bit more of the various strong net dollar retention rates you're seeing, particularly the 158% excluding life and devices. Could you provide some more contexts on what's really driving that number?\nDuston Williams: Let me take it and Rajiv you may want to chime in here. But there are only a few inputs to that output of 158. And obviously the upsell, it\u2019s continuing to get better. Again, the deal sizes are getting larger. I think as we continue to go up the stack with our product offering, that's a natural enhancement to total deal sizes slash up-sell in the business.  And the gross retention rate. A huge focus internally on that. But the gross retention rate is still a relatively small base. But what we've seen so far, we're happy with the gross retention rates. So that will come down a little bit as we showed in the Investor Day, but I think that will still be up at the top there as far as. Metric from a competitive perspective.  Again, the product continues to perform well, NPS scores still stay at 90 plus and all those things add up to a lot of upselling and increased deal sizes, and a pretty good net retention rate.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yeah.\nJack Andrews: Well, makes sense. I appreciate that.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yeah, I would just add to that saying all the [Indiscernible] and the larger scheme that we had this quarter, right, everything that Duston said, they don't -- not customer went in with the small deployment to start where they continuously expanded their deployment, they're continuously buying more and buying more of our portfolio.\nPinjalim Bora: That's great to hear. And maybe just as a follow-up, Rajiv, just given an increasing focus on solution-based selling, could you just speak to maybe how you navigate the relationships with some of your partners who also would typically look to bundle technology offerings into their own solutions.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yeah, and I think if you look at the solutions that we're focused on today, it's clouded. Hybrid cloud being one. Its database management is another example. And of course, our traditional focus is on end-user computing.  And all of this plays very nicely from a solution perspective. If you look at some examples with partners. So when they go with HP, they're looking at bundling all software from a cloud platform perspective along with their hardware and offering all of that as a subscription, Greenlee.  And they're doing that for both our hybrid cloud risk, whether it's now database, has said that offering. So typically. What do you find us, ah, solutions selling combined with what we can do with partners, including Lenovo for example.  To end-to-end what's left our offering with several [Indiscernible] staff will stack from Nutanix at [Indiscernible] as-a-service. So it. Yes. Enhances the overall value of the solution and makes it easier for customers to push safe. And what would we need to see that business outcome in the simpler form. I appreciate that context.  Thanks and congratulations on the results. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. A good afternoon with all the demand indicators in sales productivity metrics tracking\nJack Andrews: Really well. Exiting last year, what's driving the October quarter ACV billings decline of 1% sequentially, if you look over the past three years, that was up about 3% on average, is it just a function of the business scaling, and so we'll see more seasonality in the business or anything else to read into that? And I have a follow-up.\nDuston Williams: Sure. You know Katie, as far as the guide as you saw there is still a year-over-year increase of 26% compared to the 14, and 10% from the prior 2 years. So it's a huge year-over-year increase. Q1 usually typically, when you look at it, is a bit slower for us.  Certainly IMEA. When you look at what the trends were there and the wildcard is kind of fed Roland so far. Federal was playing out, playing out fine in Q1. So we'll see, but I think we have a lot of things going for us. Certainly, not only in Q1 but net fly 22. So we'll see how things play out there. And obviously, a pretty robust backlog, which gives us a lot of comforts.\nJack Andrews: Got it. That's clear. And then Duston, OPEX is tracking below your prior guidance of 380 to 385. Is that tied to temporary dynamics around just the timing of reopening and labor market tightness or is this a more sustainable reduction and then what do you think the spending run rate as well\nDuston Williams: As we again, to Investor Day, you'll see single what were you expecting 22 was at that point in time, we were saying single-digit growth year-over-year. Clearly, one of the bigger variables is a travel and still continues.  To stay locked down for the most part. Anyway, so we will see some increases there. But I think the focus on expenses continues to be pretty robust from what we're doing on the expense side of the equation, it will continue that way.  We need to fund obviously, reps and engineering projects and things like that, which we're doing. But I think we're still assuming, we're still somewhere in that single-digit growth year-over-year, but we'll continue to try just like we did this quarter. And the guides for one to continue to drive it down, but still grow the business. At our 25% plus.\nJack Andrews: Dustin is the 170 reduction in sales and marketing heads this quarter, which is bigger than the prior quarter. Is that just the restructuring? Is that all related to the restructuring that you referenced in your prepared remarks?\nDuston Williams: Clearly, restructuring is in there, and not all of it, but clearly restructuring this is in there. And that's some of the servers that you saw that we booked in the quarter there.\nJack Andrews: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. And congrats on the results. Dustin, you did some seasonality in ACV billings weighted more in 4Q given what is available to renew, is that a dynamic that carries over into it? Quarters beyond that. And when should we expect stabilization of that, maybe a follow-up.\nRichard Valera: Well, you're not going to see ultimate stabilization for [Indiscernible] is going to continue to increase, right. And we've given an FY23 number in the Investor Day presentation there, so you're going to continue to see an acceleration of the renewals that, again, what we've been working on for the last three\nDuston Williams: Years or so, would the transition to a subscription more tranches are going to come in for renewal. So that's what you're going to see there. The comment I made on Q3 to Q4 was because still not massive in any given quarter. What I was saying there is we just had a pretty big bump up in ATR that we expect from Q3 to Q4.  Relative to the size of Q3 and that's why we thought we'd call that out just to make sure that was clear from a modeling perspective. But again, into FY 23, you'll continue to see it will be. A little bit more linear. But there'll be some bumps up and down, but more linear.  Certainly, we expect to see Q3 to Q4. It's obviously trying to why a little, little sort of not be as big of step-ups on a sequential basis. All one as well on honest, this quarter-over-quarter, you'll still you've got a benchmark again that we're running two for FY 20, that kind of gives you a feel for that type of growth from 22 to 23.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, thanks.\nDuston Williams: Continue to increase, sorry.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. No, I get it I'm just questioning on-trend sequentially if there's an abnormality in those trends that call out later points. As a follow-up, Rajiv on I thinks at the Analyst Day in order that VDI was 20 to 25% of workloads and curious, just given back to work in many places.  If you're expecting to see any impact from that at all. I mean, on the PC side, clearly, there are concerns of a demand roll-over. And I understand the distinction between media and PCs, but just wondering if you're seeing any signs of that business decelerating. Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: No, I would say not once. I mean, no signs of that. And I think largely because we're going to continue to remain hybrid, even people come back to the offices, is going to be a mix. And so I would say is that business for us has trended to be in that 20 to 25% range overall. So I don't see any significance. Can you just one of those people come back to work here?\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.\nRod Hall: Yeah, thanks for the question, guys. I wanted to jump into the I think the comment you made us than on the five-year deal. And then I think you had said there were other five-year deals in there. Just curious if you can. Firstly, help us quantify that at all, give us any idea what the billings percentage that was five years in that billing stack looks like.  And then also any color around why these customers are doing five-year deals were they five-years before and they are just kind of renewing it five-years or you giving them better deals for five years. Any kind of color you can give us on why you're seeing that thanks. And I have a follow-up.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So the quarterly investor presentation should be loaded on the website routes and that will give you the ACV breakout by term. So that I think that answers that question for you. And on the five-year deal, yeah, these are existing customers that had been purchased.  On a five-year term. And again, once you have somebody in five years, it takes a little bit if we can to get them down to the 3-year or something like that. This happens to be the largest deal that has turned into\nDuston Williams: What we referred to sometimes. But I referred to as a chronic repeat purchaser. It's kind of a textbook example to a very large customer that just continues to eat away at different workloads and use cases.  In this case, there was a fair amount of emerging products in there also, which is really nice to see. But it's -- yeah, so there were existing. And then we had several others that we're already at the five-year mark, and they bulked up on some purchases. So that's what we saw therein\nDuston Williams: Q4. And as I said in one that will reverse and come back down to the low three's three-year Royal three somewhere around there.\nRod Hall: Right. Yes. I'm sorry, I missed that in the presentation, but thanks for that. Does some of that's good color the other thing is on the terms. So I know you're saying it comes back down next quarter.  What are you thinking about term links now as we look out several quarters, I mean, we were thinking it kind of slowly slips I think towards three. But do you think it -- are we stabilizing now at this kind of 3.3, 3.2 level, do you think it keeps coming down just a little bit of kind of what are you thinking now on [Indiscernible]?\nDuston Williams: Yes. Same thought. I had a year or two ago that everything I see with the mix of new businesses and existing business, it's still -- and we put this in the Investor Day presentation, 28 to 30, somewhere around there.  I think this fiscal year and probably remains in the three, low three range somewhere around there. As we migrate into 23, maybe get a little more tweaked down there. But like everything that we see today, that would be the continued view on terms.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay. So yeah, this quarter is just kind of an anomaly and we continue on that trend we've been on. All right. Great guys. I appreciate it.\nDuston Williams: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini. With SIG.\nMehdi Hossein: Yes. Thanks for taking my question two follow-ups. It was great to see the booking and I'm just wondering if you can help me understand. Is there a way of qualitatively or quantitatively? You can talk about a booking. By like a native data application versus a hybrid model.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Okay. Maybe I can try. I mean, we've tried to quantify some of these by use cases, right? So the one that -- I mean, I think. In general, what I would just say today is large because of the bulk of our businesses, what I would call on-prem. Right.  And you're starting to see more of it, more to hybrid as TDS early use, customers migrating to the public cloud. And that portion is still related with small but growing nicely. Right? So the bulk of it today is on-prem, but I expect that over time we will see more and more of a mix of public cloud-based workloads.  In addition to our on-prem boatloads. So that's one piece of it. The other way to think about it if need also, is what kind of workflows TAVI running. And they're like we've said, the one was loads that we quantified is End-User Computing. And that typically runs between 20, 25% of our overall business.  The rest of it tends to be other workloads, like databases, which we haven't quantified, but the database is anything -- other solar virtualization type workloads. So perhaps let me give you a reasonable framework.\nMehdi Hossein: Sure, sure. Yes. You referenced I think if I'm not mistaking 60 billion TAM, and I think the native data is the fastest growth, but perhaps is the smallest piece -- is secular, but it's going to take some time for it to scale, right.\nRajiv Ramaswami: When you say native, are you talking about cloud-native or club? I mean, sort of I mean, I think that means when we talk about $50 billion TAM, we talked about a couple of different pieces of it.  One is our core ACI, hybrid, hyper-converged read, as we said, that's continuing to grow exceeding into three-tier. It's capturing more enterprise workloads and that business that continues to grow very nicely, right? Over the next several years. And then on top of that, it extends to the hybrid cloud, right?  Which is the publisher out component of this? We've talked about. And then on top of that, we talked about opportunities in Unified storage, which is all about files and optic, and. And Greg, where we're gaining share against service providers. And then the database is full, right? But also the component from the broke it down for you.\nMehdi Hossein: I actually don't share gains was premises on my question, just look at Slide 16. Your share gain, you're 53% of adoption, like eight quarters ago. It was in the mid-40, so you definitely are well over 50%. And as a follow-up, is there a cap? Are you're going to like a year or two from now. If you're going to be closer to 60 and where do we go from there?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I expect that our adoption will continue to pick up for multiple reasons. First, is that [Indiscernible] is getting stronger and stronger in the hypervisor in terms of broader and broader [Indiscernible] capabilities.  Second, for example, is that partnerships such as the one that we just did with Red Hat, there are now -- Red Hat Linux is obviously certified with a tweak. But why more confidence in our customers and adopting the HVS platform.  So I do expect that it's going to continue to pick up over time as more and more customers adapt to their workloads. So it's. So it's too hard to see whether there's going to be a ceiling on it or not at this point a little bit early, but I would expect it to continue to tick up and it certainly is something I'm sure.\nMehdi Hossein: And then just finally, just a quick follow-up and the scaling of your new products would complement as I imagine at some point incremental share gains would be more challenging. But how you scale new products could be -- could help sustain the growth.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yeah, I mean, I think I'm very excited about our new products as Dustin pointed out, there were 41% above a number of our leaders. I think this last this last quarter.  And they're all unlocking great opportunities for our database management in the database as a service is a huge, big market opportunity than I forget relates me small but growing rapidly into that unified storage for us as all again, growing into a larger 15 markets, where our percentage related response for these newer emerging products are all sizeable markets where we have related with a small share. Opportunity to gain share and grow rapidly. And also attached to our core platform.\nMehdi Hossein: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about how we should be thinking. In terms of the percent of billings coming from renewals, this quarter was about 12% and you've provided a forecast for fiscal 25 of getting to 40, but I am imagining that this should not be a linear progression. And I think this quarter is very similar to last. How should we think about that rate of change for that particular metric?\nDuston Williams: Yeah. You'll see again that some of this varied into the Investor Day package. You might want to reference that Simon, There's a 23 number in there, so that gives you a feel there. So again, you'll see it ratcheting up in 23 as a percentage and both from an ACV percentage and a TCV percentage.  But that bigger increase will occur in FY 23 rather than the Netfly 22. And that's just a timing perspective on these deals that average 3 plus years or just they haven't come up for renewals yet. But in FY 23, there are just larger tranches that naturally come into play.\nSimon Leopold: And I guess the other question, may be a little bit difficult to quantify, but it making the transition where you want to focus more on renewals and essentially. Been less on sales and marketing and new customer acquisition.  If hypothetically, you under-invest in underspend, how long would it take for you to observe that you've made a mistake in terms of your allocation? What's the sort of delay in productivity? Anyway, we could judge it. Thank you.\nDuston Williams: Well, yeah, I can mention that the energy might want to also pitch in here, but I just want to make something clear. It's not like we're taking massive cost out of the new and the up-sell part of the equation.  A vast majority of the leverage is going to come from the mix, right? As the mix of the renewal. Sales increased and those come in 80% less, less cost of new and upsell. That's where the leverage is going to come now, yes, we've gotten a lot more efficient on-demand gen and pipeline generation from that perspective, which is working well more from a digital perspective.  And our test drive and all that stuff, which is really helping those efforts. But it's not like we're cutting significantly on the new and the up-sell. This is more, we're continuing to focus on that, do whatever we can. But the majority of this leverage is going to come from that mix shift.\nSimon Leopold: That's helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities.\nErik Suppiger: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the big quarter. I know you guys don't sell hardware, but can you comment? I think your software is often tied to hardware. Can you comment a little bit on what effects do you see from many of the component constraints that are out there on the hardware side? And then secondly, just curious if there's been any change on the competitive front. In particular with VMware.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Sure. Let me take that, Rick. So look, I think our software ramp kind of variety of hardware platforms and it's also not tie in one-on-one to new hardware sales price. So it's not that we're always selling along with hardware. Sometimes people buy software independent of hardware, they'll have they've already procured. And of course. I haven't talked. So the supply chain impact on our business so far has been relatively modest. They've seen some customers pulling forward some orders to try and ensure that they have access to hardware. And we've also seen other customers that the eight placements a little bit, but the results so far have been pretty minimal for us.  And that said, we are very comfortable with that 1Q forecasts that we guided to and we will need to continue to monitor the situation here. [Indiscernible] second, I think you said [Indiscernible] the competitive dynamics in what we're seeing in the market?  I would say again in the fourth quarter, we so a nice quarter-over-quarter improvement of our win rates against your largest competitor, but also our ATI competitors. And I sort of said this earlier a little bit here, Eric, but fundamentally we're very focused.  Very focused in terms of execution on this category. Our product is strong. We provide simplicity fleet of choice. A great customer experience with our NPS sitting at 90. So the product offering is really strong.  Our go-to-market operations have continuously improved over the last several quarters, and we're benefiting from that as well because of that combination of a good product plus. Good, strong, and improving go-to-market execution is what's leading to.\nErik Suppiger: These rates have increased, okay, thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich. And good afternoon, everyone. I hope you ended the last ones for healthy and safe. As we continue to navigate through the COVID pandemic. How Q4 was a strong hand to an excellent Fiscal year, which was marked by consistent execution and good progress across both financial and strategic objectives.  Your Dynex delivers a strong Fiscal 2021 across a number of areas. They exceeded our guidance. And we Quarter of the year. As our team consistently over the TV. We felt good linearity within each Quarter. As we benefit from ongoing operational improvements in our go-to-market engine.  And we also saw improved economics and the continued build-out of our renewals business, which will help drive the acceleration of our top-line as we approach the completion of our subscription journey. Importantly, we drove this top-line improvement while carefully managing expenses, leading to a substantially improved bottom-line performance compared to our prior Fiscal year.  On the strategic front, we received a $750 million investment from Bain Capital in one, which provided additional financial flexibility to fund our growth. And we made good progress on our alliance partnerships, extending our relationships with HP, Lenovo. And more recently, signing a new agreement with Rod Hall. Looking deeper at Q4, the outperformed on all our key metrics. Seeing all time, our recent record in a number of areas.  We reported record revenue up 19% Year-over-year. The best Growth we've delivered in the last three years. We saw a record ACV billing, which grew 26% Year-over-year. Our highest Growth rate in over two years. We again saw good linearity in Q4, which contributed to better-than-expected cash flow.  The underlying momentum in the business gives us confidence in providing strong guidance for the first quarter of our fiscal 22. And we believe for this investment well, to achieve our plan for the balance of the year. Overall, we were pleased with our Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2021 Financial results. Which were identified against the continued challenging backdrop of COVID-19.  We saw strong momentum across our entire hybrid multi-cloud portfolio during the Quarter. Including both core and emerging products. On my thing, products, new ACV bookings, grew over 100% Year-over-year and saw a record rolling four-quarter a tax rate of 41%. One example of a complete portfolio solution was our largest deal of the quarter.  A multi-million-dollar ACV deals with a Fortune 100 Financial Services Company that expanded their use of our core Hexis software to run their mission-critical applications. Along with a large expansion of their era footprint to automate and simplify that database management. The sonics cluster, a key component of our hybrid multi-cloud platform, continued to see solid momentum during the Quarter.  One example, where the Global 2000 real estate e-commerce Company, that [Indiscernible] cluster on AWS to expand that [Indiscernible] footprint and enable that lift and shift data center consolidation. In Europe, a large government ministry to our cloud platform, along with our Unified storage solution, including Pfizer and ah, SMIC, has the primary cloud platform.  I'd now like to take a moment to highlight some key takeaways from our Investor Day in June. Be highlighted. Our leadership position in the large and growing hyper-converged infrastructure market. And the substantial additional opportunity we see in our decent markets.  Specifically, we noted a combined total available market opportunity in our core and different markets. As we expect to exceed $60 billion by 2025. We said our plan was to focus on delivering a single platform that fixed Nutanix hallmarks, simplicity, and performance into the hybrid multi-cloud market.  We laid out a roadmap for our solutions strategy and how we're streamlining our portfolio. Focusing on a fewer, bigger bet. In the area folk database-as-a-service, unified storage, and desktop-as-a-service. We also explained how we're expecting to see go-to-market leverage by executing on low-cost renewals.  Benefiting from solution selling and from increasing our focus on partnerships. And finally, we provided a model targeting free cash flow, breakeven. In the second half of calendar 2022 and 25% Annualized SEC filings. Both through Fiscal year 25. And we're tracking well on both metrics. Next, I'd like to also provide an update on some of our previously discussed priorities.  First on deepening our partnerships to provide more impact on how we go to market. Our recently announced partnership with Red Hat the world's leading provider of commercial OpenFlow solutions. Brings together Red Hat, industry-leading, Red Hat Enterprise Linux around, and its OpenShift container platform.  With the simplicity, flexibility, and resilience of our platform. Nutanix, it's now the preferred choice for hedge HCI on Red Hat's platform. And our HBE hypervisor is certified to support around and OpenShift on the Nutanix platform. Likewise, OpenShift. If now the preferred choice for enterprise full-stack Kubernetes on the Nutanix platform.  Finally, the two companies also have a neutral support agreement and a research and development roadmap focused on ensuring customer success and enhanced integration, respectively. This partnership provides customers with a full-stack platform to build, scale and manage containerized and virtualized cloud-native applications in a hybrid multi-cloud environment.  We see this as an important proof point in our strategy of furthering customer choice and enhancing our platform by partnering with other best-in-class providers. During the Quarter, we also announced an expanded partnership with HP, in which they are offering new Capex era are multi-database operations and management solutions bundled with HP Pro-Line servers as-a-service to HBP agreement.  In addition to our core platform, which is already a part of a [Indiscernible] offering. Now I'd like to turn to another of our priorities, diversity and [Indiscernible] We released our first environmental, social, and governance of EFC report. During the Quarter detailing our initiatives in the various and establishing a baseline. We can measure ourselves against.  This is an important first step in our journey towards having greater diversity and intuition and our workforce and enabling more sustainable businesses for both mechanics and our customers. We also held our first global women's Conference in July with Nutanix leaders and outside experts, both to our entire employee base about how we can redefine leadership to include diverse backgrounds and perspectives.  In closing, I'm pleased with the execution across the board. And our fourth Quarter has spent about a full Fiscal year, especially given the challenging backdrop created by the pandemic. And the fact that it was the Fiscal year of our ACV model. We are entering our fiscal 22 with a strong position.  Finally, I'm looking forward to connecting with many of you at our upcoming doc next user conference being held September 20th through the 23rd. Let me look forward to welcoming tens of thousands of our customers and partners. Please see our Earnings press release on our website for registration details. And with that, I will hand it over to Duston Williams. Dustin. Yes. Look, I mean, I think there's a knock. We are seeing nice quarter-over-quarter improvement in our window. They are obviously very focused on this market. VTM execution has continued to improve throughout the entire year.  And fundamentally, and goalie and dad with a very strong offering that we continue to get better. They're the best in terms of managing data, offering all forms of storage. Moving that to hybrid cloud, as you know, we provide the best freedom of choice across hypervisors, across Cognex dot farms, and get me the fact.  And of course, going forward across multiple cloud customers, like the simplicity of what we provide and then our NPS as 90 continues to be better than almost everybody else. So we have a sustainable launch this year, combined with the increasing focus. The improvements in our operational execution. That's what's leading to the focus. Yes. I mean, I think there's been a lot set of this recently right about the cloud. And I think customers are going to be more nuanced about how they go to the cloud. There. There's just. Both a cooking application, san, new applications that come into, come into play here.  And obviously, customers now are looking at different things, but I need to be in a multi-cloud world. I don't want to be locked. The one product going to be running lag applications across all clouds. And we are seeing very specific use cases that customers are looking at, right.  So one class of customers or people moving on-prem, wanting to migrate to the cloud. Our user cloud. We're seeing them use us to expand, take, expanding their existing footprints into the cloud.  Disaster recovery of the use case for customers that are having more public cloud-oriented historically, desktop to look at South costs. Just coming to look at that data governance security, they're starting to look at cloud lock-in and see that they're also looking at there are more of a multi-cloud environment, hybrid environment.  So I think there are definitely more conversations that were happening, happening with our customer base around these. And again, we're starting to see the youth. It doesn't come into play, right? In production. Yeah. David, as we said at Investor Day then the fundamental benefits of continued to apply, right? Simplicity in Operations Management, bringing these silos together but whining, good TCO, competitor tradition this year. And what we're seeing now with HCI, they are able to address a broad set of enterprise [Indiscernible].  And we've seen that. For example, our largest deal of this quarter was with a large financial services customer. And they are of course running all the databases of our platform. And that's a high-performance workout. And so we're seeing.  And broadening the adoption of HCI for lots of enterprise workloads. And so I think that trend continues. And then the second trend really is, as you go to the cloud, HCI becomes logical, it's not just an on-prem treaty or replacements, but it also becomes a platform that they can then take to the cloud. Maybe I'll start there. Things have been here. So first of all, I think we're seeing a healthy demand backdrop. And it's being driven by this broad acceleration of digital transformation initiatives, like the [Indiscernible] and COVID actually capitalized, and there is some extent of pent-up demand.  Being realized style as customers have now become used to operating in a corporate environment. Now for us specifically, I would say the demand is being driven by four key areas Flex5, continuing the [Indiscernible] only question about this -- about continuing modernization of their legacy through the infrastructure.  Running more work on our platform helping extended as they move to the cloud, right? Are helping our customers migrate to the cloud. And then, of course, hybrid and remote work is here to stay. And that's another driver for what we're fee to overall, we certainly Delta has not. In fact demand. We're still seeing a good demand environment. And people are continuing to invest in these initiatives with us. Yes, I think. As you know, fluxes have become available here in [Indiscernible] AWS cloud. And we do expect again a number of government agencies to be looking at operating in golf clubs. And so we're.  And the only knock-on relations with them, but essentially the scene use cases apply to them as well. Right. So how do I extend my sense of the public cloud, how do I do disaster recovery, how do I do the capacity expansion, how do I consolidate data centers?  So the [Indiscernible] used cases, they are starting to see also play out in government. And again, I think it's still early days for us. Has the offering just become available? And I hope to be able to talk to you about future government customers and government customers in future calls at some point. Yeah. Yeah, I would just add to that saying all the [Indiscernible] and the larger scheme that we had this quarter, right, everything that Duston said, they don't -- not customer went in with the small deployment to start where they continuously expanded their deployment, they're continuously buying more and buying more of our portfolio. Yeah, and I think if you look at the solutions that we're focused on today, it's clouded. Hybrid cloud being one. Its database management is another example. And of course, our traditional focus is on end-user computing.  And all of this plays very nicely from a solution perspective. If you look at some examples with partners. So when they go with HP, they're looking at bundling all software from a cloud platform perspective along with their hardware and offering all of that as a subscription, Greenlee.  And they're doing that for both our hybrid cloud risk, whether it's now database, has said that offering. So typically. What do you find us, ah, solutions selling combined with what we can do with partners, including Lenovo for example.  To end-to-end what's left our offering with several [Indiscernible] staff will stack from Nutanix at [Indiscernible] as-a-service. So it. Yes. Enhances the overall value of the solution and makes it easier for customers to push safe. And what would we need to see that business outcome in the simpler form. I appreciate that context.  Thanks and congratulations on the results. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. A good afternoon with all the demand indicators in sales productivity metrics tracking No, I would say not once. I mean, no signs of that. And I think largely because we're going to continue to remain hybrid, even people come back to the offices, is going to be a mix. And so I would say is that business for us has trended to be in that 20 to 25% range overall. So I don't see any significance. Can you just one of those people come back to work here? Yes. So the quarterly investor presentation should be loaded on the website routes and that will give you the ACV breakout by term. So that I think that answers that question for you. And on the five-year deal, yeah, these are existing customers that had been purchased.  On a five-year term. And again, once you have somebody in five years, it takes a little bit if we can to get them down to the 3-year or something like that. This happens to be the largest deal that has turned into Okay. Maybe I can try. I mean, we've tried to quantify some of these by use cases, right? So the one that -- I mean, I think. In general, what I would just say today is large because of the bulk of our businesses, what I would call on-prem. Right.  And you're starting to see more of it, more to hybrid as TDS early use, customers migrating to the public cloud. And that portion is still related with small but growing nicely. Right? So the bulk of it today is on-prem, but I expect that over time we will see more and more of a mix of public cloud-based workloads.  In addition to our on-prem boatloads. So that's one piece of it. The other way to think about it if need also, is what kind of workflows TAVI running. And they're like we've said, the one was loads that we quantified is End-User Computing. And that typically runs between 20, 25% of our overall business.  The rest of it tends to be other workloads, like databases, which we haven't quantified, but the database is anything -- other solar virtualization type workloads. So perhaps let me give you a reasonable framework. When you say native, are you talking about cloud-native or club? I mean, sort of I mean, I think that means when we talk about $50 billion TAM, we talked about a couple of different pieces of it.  One is our core ACI, hybrid, hyper-converged read, as we said, that's continuing to grow exceeding into three-tier. It's capturing more enterprise workloads and that business that continues to grow very nicely, right? Over the next several years. And then on top of that, it extends to the hybrid cloud, right?  Which is the publisher out component of this? We've talked about. And then on top of that, we talked about opportunities in Unified storage, which is all about files and optic, and. And Greg, where we're gaining share against service providers. And then the database is full, right? But also the component from the broke it down for you. I expect that our adoption will continue to pick up for multiple reasons. First, is that [Indiscernible] is getting stronger and stronger in the hypervisor in terms of broader and broader [Indiscernible] capabilities.  Second, for example, is that partnerships such as the one that we just did with Red Hat, there are now -- Red Hat Linux is obviously certified with a tweak. But why more confidence in our customers and adopting the HVS platform.  So I do expect that it's going to continue to pick up over time as more and more customers adapt to their workloads. So it's. So it's too hard to see whether there's going to be a ceiling on it or not at this point a little bit early, but I would expect it to continue to tick up and it certainly is something I'm sure. Yeah, I mean, I think I'm very excited about our new products as Dustin pointed out, there were 41% above a number of our leaders. I think this last this last quarter.  And they're all unlocking great opportunities for our database management in the database as a service is a huge, big market opportunity than I forget relates me small but growing rapidly into that unified storage for us as all again, growing into a larger 15 markets, where our percentage related response for these newer emerging products are all sizeable markets where we have related with a small share. Opportunity to gain share and grow rapidly. And also attached to our core platform. Sure. Let me take that, Rick. So look, I think our software ramp kind of variety of hardware platforms and it's also not tie in one-on-one to new hardware sales price. So it's not that we're always selling along with hardware. Sometimes people buy software independent of hardware, they'll have they've already procured. And of course. I haven't talked. So the supply chain impact on our business so far has been relatively modest. They've seen some customers pulling forward some orders to try and ensure that they have access to hardware. And we've also seen other customers that the eight placements a little bit, but the results so far have been pretty minimal for us.  And that said, we are very comfortable with that 1Q forecasts that we guided to and we will need to continue to monitor the situation here. [Indiscernible] second, I think you said [Indiscernible] the competitive dynamics in what we're seeing in the market?  I would say again in the fourth quarter, we so a nice quarter-over-quarter improvement of our win rates against your largest competitor, but also our ATI competitors. And I sort of said this earlier a little bit here, Eric, but fundamentally we're very focused.  Very focused in terms of execution on this category. Our product is strong. We provide simplicity fleet of choice. A great customer experience with our NPS sitting at 90. So the product offering is really strong.  Our go-to-market operations have continuously improved over the last several quarters, and we're benefiting from that as well because of that combination of a good product plus. Good, strong, and improving go-to-market execution is what's leading to."

            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. Q4 was another quarter of consistent execution, as well as a great way to finish out the fiscal year. Sales were strong throughout the entire quarter. There was no unusual deal slippage, and we build a backlog during the quarter. In Q4, we exceeded all guidance metrics in our overall business model continues to be strengthened by the benefits of our subscription focus.  A few key highlights for the Quarter included record new ACV billings, record total ACV billings, record, total billings, record total revenue. Record emerging products, new ACV bookings, a record number of greater than $1 million transactions in the quarter. And we had the largest year-over-year total percentage growth in revenue since Q4, 18.  Now I move onto some specific Q4 financial highlights. And before I get into the specific details for the Q4 and FY 21 financial highlights. I would like to remind you that all future financial disclosures with aligned with disclosure and guidance metrics, the roadmap that we provided during our June 22nd Investor Day presentation.  For further details in clarification about our go-forward disclosure plan. I would encourage investors to review the slide titled Guidance and disclosure plan for FY 22 from my Investor Day presentation. ACV billings for Q4 were 176 million, reflecting 26% growth year-over-year above our guidance range of 170 million to 175 million. And ahead of the Street consensus number of 173 million.  New ACV bookings, which include new logo ACV, as well as upsell ACV, experienced the strongest year-over-year growth rate since Q1, 19. ARR at the end of Q4 was 0.88 billion growing 83% year-over-year. Run-rate ACV as of the end of Q4 was 1.54 billion, growing 26% Year-over-year, compared to our estimated Growth of the Mid-20% range.  Our average contract term blanks increased slightly to 3.4 years versus 3.3 years in Q3 21 as our largest deal in the quarter from an existing customer, was a 5-year term. We also had a few other notable 5-year deals from existing customers. At this point, we would expect our average contract term lengths to trend back down next Quarter. Most likely in the low 3-year range. As one usually carries a significant amount of federal business.  And our federal customers typically have much shorter average contract term lengths. Assuming contract term lines do approach the low 3-year range in one, we would approximate the TCV to ACV billings ratio to be somewhere around 2.25. Versus the 2.4 in Q4. Revenue was 391 million growing 19% from Q4, 20 substantially above the Street consensus number of 365 million.  We have not seen this level of Year-over-year Growth rate in revenue since Q4, 18 emerging products, new ACV bookings grew in excess of 100% year-over-year. The emerging products attach rate was 41%. The Q4 sales rep productivity significantly exceeded our assumptions set forth at Investor Day. Our non-GAAP Gross margin in Q4 was 82.9% versus our guidance of 81.5 to 82% Operating expenses were 373 million versus our guidance of 380 to 385 million.  Our Q4 expenses included approximately 12 million in severance expenses related to our previously disclosed sales and marketing headcount reduction. Our non-GAAP net loss was 55 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.26 per share. Q4 linearity remains very good. DFO's in Q4 were 48 days up from 37 days in Q3, 21 and down significantly from 68 days in Q4, 20.  Our free cash flow for Q4 was once again, aided by good linearity coming in at a negative forty-two million, sixteen million betters than the Street consensus. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of 1 to 1 billion down slightly from 1.25 billion in Q3 21. Before I provide the Q1 guidance overview, let me first do a quick recap of FY 21. ACV billings were 594 million growing 18% versus FY 20 and versus the 590 to 595 million range we provided at our Investor Day.  Once again, as we mentioned last quarter, or a total Fiscal year ACV billing, uh, not derived from the simple addition of the four fiscal quarters. For our reported quarterly ACV billings. we annualized any deal that is less than one year in term length. And our yearly ACV billings calculations eliminate any duplication that happens with the renewal of a deal that occurs within the period and is less than one year in duration.  Based on this methodology. Over the last three fiscal years, with some of the four fiscal quarters of ACV billings have exceeded the adjusted annual ACV billings by six to 7% We would encourage investors to account for this distinction during the modeling process.  FY 21 new ACV billings, which includes new logo ACV, as well as upsell ACV, were 433 million growing 11% versus FY 20 and versus the 430 to 435 million range we provided at our Investor Day. Our renewal business performed well within our expectations for FY 21 renewals, ACV, including loads, support renewals, or a 161 million growing 38% versus FY 20 and versus the approximate 160 million estimates, we shared at Investor Day.  FY 21 renewals TCV, including LoD support renewals, were a 179 million growing 32% versus FY 20 Revenue was 1.39 billion growing 7% versus FY 2020. Yearly revenue growth was impacted by term compression during the year. Customer retention, including loads and subscriptions, closed the year at 96%. The gross retention rate for our subscription business continued to operate within the range of greater than 90% as provided during our Investor Day.  The net dollar retention rate, including the LoD business, was 124% versus the Investor Day estimate of approximately 125%. The net dollar retention rate for our subscription-based business only was 158% versus the Investor Day estimate of approximately 155% Emerging products, new ACV bookings grew 97% in FY 21. And we also added 61 G2K customers in FY 21. Now, turning to our Q1 22 guidance, the guidance for Q1 is as follows.  ACV billings to be between a hundred and seventy-two and a hundred and seventy-seven million representing year-over-year growth of 25 to 28% Gross margin by approximately 81.5% operating expenses between 365370 million weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 216 million.  The one ACV billings guidance, which calls for year-over-year growth of 25% to 28%, compares to the actual growth of 14% in Q1 20, 10% in Q1 21, and versus the street consensus growth for Q1 22 of 23% based on continued good execution and an increasing renewal base.  And a robust backlog, all supported by a strong product portfolio. We are pleased to project a Q1 22 year-over-year ATV billings growth rate, that is on par with our strong Q4 21 ATV billings growth rate of 26% Based on the 122 ACV billings guidance, we expect us to grow 65% or more Year-over-year. I'd like to make one final comment regarding our ACV billings trends for FY 20-22.  Due to our growing mix of renewals. For the second half of FY 22, where you would expect a higher amount of ACV billings in Q4 versus Q3 than what is currently reflected in the consensus estimates. This mix shift from Q3 to Q4 is a direct result of our growing ATR or available to renew base of renewals that show a proportionately larger increase in Q4 versus Q3.  We strongly advise analysts and investors to carefully look at their quarter-over-quarter ACV billings estimates to ensure that the strong growth in Q4 relative to Q3 is reflected in models. With that Operator. Could you please open the call-up for questions? Thank you. Sure. Aaron. We provided a fair amount of detail during Investor Day. We obviously just reported on the 21 numbers. We gave a 23 estimate; we gave a 25 estimate during the Investor Day to relative to. FY 22. Again, there won't be obviously a massive increase in FY 22 on the renewals just because you've got some offsetting load support renewals declining and then the subscription renewals are increasing.  I will tell you and I mentioned this in the script that, you know, the first three quarters of the fiscal year have a slight increase, but not much, but there is a large tranche in Q4 that starts to kick in on the subscription renewals.  And that's why the comment was. Just to kind of look at the quarterly splits there because there will be just based on the ATR, the available to renew in Q4, the amount increases quite a bit relative to certain in Q2 and Q3. Well, probably not that much. Now, 10th here there maybe. But again, in Q1 the federal business ends up being a much larger percentage of the total business just because of the federal year-end in September and federal terms are quite a bit lower in general.  So and you saw the same thing actually last year. Quite honestly, from Q4 to Q3, you saw -- I don't have it exactly in front of me, but I think it's a three-tenths of a year decrease, something like that. From Q4 to one, and then it kind of flattened a little bit.  So definitely will come down as we see it today. And as we get through the first month and that's what we're seeing already. But then I would suspect that kind of be flattish a little bit, but I don't think there's any. Shane certainly from the kind of the 2.8 to 3 as we see it today, as we laid out at Investor Day. You're welcome. Okay. Let me start with the productivity thing. We have so many things to help productivity going forward. As I said, we're running ahead of the Investor Day estimates, certainly in Q4. And we think the productivity will continue.  To be strong. We have a lot of things going on in the background as far as channel enablement and a lot of autonomous selling that we're trying to enable with the channel; we'll start some solution selling. Clearly, partnerships are picking up. Not to mention our renewals and things like that. So lots of good stuff happening.  From a productivity perspective, I think then if you've kind of backed up and even talk a little bit higher level there. The demand environment is good, the pipeline is strong. And not only as a pipeline strong has the quality of the pipe continued to get really stronger as we go on here. The products performing well.  Emerging products continue to increase deal sizes and ASP, or increasing the renewals of building and stuff like that. So when you step back on that, when you look at FY 22, we feel good about 22 obviously are planned for our FY 22 in media. The mapped and the modeling assumptions that we provided at Investor Day for FY 22, and that was obviously meant to be a kind of a one-time thing to help with the modeling efforts.  We're really happy with what happened in Q4. We're really pleased with what we can have guided certainly for one and the likes there. So we feel really good as we go into the fiscal year. And we'll address things as we move forward. But at this point in time, again, that was meant to be kind of a one-time look at 22, but in general. And while we feel very good, about 20 to going into the fiscal year. Let me take it and Rajiv you may want to chime in here. But there are only a few inputs to that output of 158. And obviously the upsell, it's continuing to get better. Again, the deal sizes are getting larger. I think as we continue to go up the stack with our product offering, that's a natural enhancement to total deal sizes slash up-sell in the business.  And the gross retention rate. A huge focus internally on that. But the gross retention rate is still a relatively small base. But what we've seen so far, we're happy with the gross retention rates. So that will come down a little bit as we showed in the Investor Day, but I think that will still be up at the top there as far as. Metric from a competitive perspective.  Again, the product continues to perform well, NPS scores still stay at 90 plus and all those things add up to a lot of upselling and increased deal sizes, and a pretty good net retention rate. Sure. You know Katie, as far as the guide as you saw there is still a year-over-year increase of 26% compared to the 14, and 10% from the prior 2 years. So it's a huge year-over-year increase. Q1 usually typically, when you look at it, is a bit slower for us.  Certainly IMEA. When you look at what the trends were there and the wildcard is kind of fed Roland so far. Federal was playing out, playing out fine in Q1. So we'll see, but I think we have a lot of things going for us. Certainly, not only in Q1 but net fly 22. So we'll see how things play out there. And obviously, a pretty robust backlog, which gives us a lot of comforts. As we again, to Investor Day, you'll see single what were you expecting 22 was at that point in time, we were saying single-digit growth year-over-year. Clearly, one of the bigger variables is a travel and still continues.  To stay locked down for the most part. Anyway, so we will see some increases there. But I think the focus on expenses continues to be pretty robust from what we're doing on the expense side of the equation, it will continue that way.  We need to fund obviously, reps and engineering projects and things like that, which we're doing. But I think we're still assuming, we're still somewhere in that single-digit growth year-over-year, but we'll continue to try just like we did this quarter. And the guides for one to continue to drive it down, but still grow the business. At our 25% plus. Clearly, restructuring is in there, and not all of it, but clearly restructuring this is in there. And that's some of the servers that you saw that we booked in the quarter there. Years or so, would the transition to a subscription more tranches are going to come in for renewal. So that's what you're going to see there. The comment I made on Q3 to Q4 was because still not massive in any given quarter. What I was saying there is we just had a pretty big bump up in ATR that we expect from Q3 to Q4.  Relative to the size of Q3 and that's why we thought we'd call that out just to make sure that was clear from a modeling perspective. But again, into FY 23, you'll continue to see it will be. A little bit more linear. But there'll be some bumps up and down, but more linear.  Certainly, we expect to see Q3 to Q4. It's obviously trying to why a little, little sort of not be as big of step-ups on a sequential basis. All one as well on honest, this quarter-over-quarter, you'll still you've got a benchmark again that we're running two for FY 20, that kind of gives you a feel for that type of growth from 22 to 23. Continue to increase, sorry. What we referred to sometimes. But I referred to as a chronic repeat purchaser. It's kind of a textbook example to a very large customer that just continues to eat away at different workloads and use cases.  In this case, there was a fair amount of emerging products in there also, which is really nice to see. But it's -- yeah, so there were existing. And then we had several others that we're already at the five-year mark, and they bulked up on some purchases. So that's what we saw therein Q4. And as I said in one that will reverse and come back down to the low three's three-year Royal three somewhere around there. Yes. Same thought. I had a year or two ago that everything I see with the mix of new businesses and existing business, it's still -- and we put this in the Investor Day presentation, 28 to 30, somewhere around there.  I think this fiscal year and probably remains in the three, low three range somewhere around there. As we migrate into 23, maybe get a little more tweaked down there. But like everything that we see today, that would be the continued view on terms. Yes. Yeah. You'll see again that some of this varied into the Investor Day package. You might want to reference that Simon, There's a 23 number in there, so that gives you a feel there. So again, you'll see it ratcheting up in 23 as a percentage and both from an ACV percentage and a TCV percentage.  But that bigger increase will occur in FY 23 rather than the Netfly 22. And that's just a timing perspective on these deals that average 3 plus years or just they haven't come up for renewals yet. But in FY 23, there are just larger tranches that naturally come into play. Well, yeah, I can mention that the energy might want to also pitch in here, but I just want to make something clear. It's not like we're taking massive cost out of the new and the up-sell part of the equation.  A vast majority of the leverage is going to come from the mix, right? As the mix of the renewal. Sales increased and those come in 80% less, less cost of new and upsell. That's where the leverage is going to come now, yes, we've gotten a lot more efficient on-demand gen and pipeline generation from that perspective, which is working well more from a digital perspective.  And our test drive and all that stuff, which is really helping those efforts. But it's not like we're cutting significantly on the new and the up-sell. This is more, we're continuing to focus on that, do whatever we can. But the majority of this leverage is going to come from that mix shift."

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon everyone. I hope you are all staying safe and healthy. We are closely monitoring the current COVID situation around the globe, particularly in India, where we've offered help and support to our local team, from healthcare assistance to fundraising for organization supporting relief efforts in the country. I'm impressed by the resilience of both our employees and customers around the world, especially in India. Now, I'll move on to our results. Q3 was a strong quarter across the board. We delivered another quarter of improved execution, continued momentum, and outperformance on all our guided metrics. Today, I'd like to highlight some of our accomplishments in the quarter and also discuss progress on some of the key priorities I outlined on our last earnings call. We continue to execute on our transition to an ACV based revenue model. And as expected, our renewal pipeline is continuing to build. These economics continue to improve due to shorter duration terms combined with uplift from our emerging products. In addition, we saw good linearity in the quarter as a result of our ongoing operational improvements through our go-to-market engine. And finally, while we typically see a seasonal decline in backlog in the third quarter, we were able to hold steady, further demonstrating the strength of demand in the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and can see that the hard work of moving to a subscription model is paying off. Duston will go into more details later on our financial performance. Last quarter, I shared my observations as a new CEO in Nutanix and outlined our priorities for driving long-term growth, including simplifying components of our product portfolio, deepening our ecosystem partnerships, continuing our shift to subscription, and nurturing our talent pool. I'd like to give updates on a couple of these priorities today, including our transformation to a subscription business model and deepening our ecosystem partnerships to provide more impact on how we go to market. Starting with our transition to a subscription model, our average contract term continues to decline coming down from last quarter to 3.3 years, helping drive higher unit economics. We also see our growing base of renewals as an increasingly important driver of top line growth and sales and marketing efficiency. With this transition well underway and with our increased focus on efficiency, we see a clear path to cash flow positivity and operating profit, and we'll go into more details at our upcoming Investor Day. Focusing on deepening partnerships of scale how we go to market, as well as creating more opportunities with larger accounts is critical to our long-term success. In April, Lenovo and Nutanix announced a complete as-a-service solution for hosted desktops to enable IT division make us [indiscernible] in the new remote hybrid workforce model. This new solution, all managed as a service with the convenience of a single monthly payment and single point of contact for support, includes Lenovo client devices, Citrix virtual desktops, and Lenovo server powered by Nutanix software. This new aspect of our extended relationship with the number one seller of PCs in the world is a great example of how we can work with a strategic partner to leverage their capabilities from the data center to the desktop in order to better serve our customers as well as give us meaningful incremental opportunity. Our partnership with Microsoft also continued to progress. During the quarter, we announced that our Kubernetes solution, Karbon, is now validated with Azure Arc Kubernetes management, with the ease of deploying and managing the certified Kubernetes Cluster on Nutanix HCI with consistent policies and governance across clusters provided by Azure Arc. Our mutual customers now have a smooth and fast path to modern containerized applications in a hybrid cloud environment. This month, we announced that the Nutanix platform now extends to AWS GovCloud, providing a unified hybrid cloud environment across Nutanix on-premises and bare metal Amazon EC2 instances running on AWS GovCloud. US public sector organization looking for strength and security offered by AWS GovCloud can now accelerate their adoption and leverage a single platform and management interface across their private and public cloud. Next, I'll talk about the momentum in our core software as well as our emerging solutions during the quarter. In Q3, we continued to acquire new customers while our existing customers expanded their engagements with us. We saw continued strength in our core solution reflected by a healthy year-over-year increase in our win rates against both our largest competitor and three-tier infrastructure solutions. We also saw continued strength in emerging products with our attach rates on a rolling four-quarter basis, increasing to 39%, up from 37% last quarter. We are seeing more examples of customers choosing our complete cloud software platform together with emerging solutions to meet all of their business needs. An example of this was the government entity in the Asia-Pacific region that chose our cloud platform software as well as our network security solutions to develop a secure, private cloud supporting their mission critical system, including security, exchange, and SQL database workloads. Our database management solution era continues to be an important differentiator for us and had good momentum during the quarter. A financial services company headquartered in Europe selected Era and other emerging solutions on top of our cloud platform to help expand their infrastructure at scale to support their banking customers requirements for performance, growth, and Financial Service Level Agreement. This customer will use our database management solution to deploy, optimize, and manage SQL databases across multiple hybrid clouds, helping to drastically simplify and standardize their overall database operations. We also saw increased adoption of clusters during the quarter with the use cases including data center consolidation, virtual desktop, disaster recovery, and the ability to burst to the cloud for additional capacity. In one case, a Fortune 500 North American financial services company selected Nutanix in a multi-million-dollar deal to replace their previous architecture and run their VDI workflows and is using clusters to burst into AWS on-demand for disaster recovery in their multi-cloud environment. Next, I'd like to touch on efficiency. This is an important part of our path to profitability. We have increased our go-to-market productivity, including more efficient digital marketing spend, increased leverage of our channel partners, and optimized headcount in geographies based on market opportunity. In connection with these efforts, we recently decreased our global headcount by 2.5% from within the sales and marketing function as we continue to refine our go-to market model. We expect these actions to yield approximately $50 million in annual savings. Finally, I'd like to highlight some industry awards that Nutanix received during the quarter which demonstrate our customers enthusiasm for our products and support. We were recognized by Gartner as a Peer Insights Customers' Choice vendor for emerging solutions for distributed file systems and object storage. In addition our core software was recognized by Trust Radius as a Top Rated Product in the HCI Server Virtualization, software defined storage and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure category. Also we recently won the NorthFace Scoreboard Service Award for achieving excellence in customer service. All of these awards are based on customer feedback. In summary, I'm very pleased with our execution across the board in the third quarter. I look forward to sharing more information at our upcoming Investor Day on June 22. We plan to go into more details about our mission to delight customers with a simple open hybrid and multi-cloud software platform with fixed data services to build, run and manage any applications. We will also provide insights on our strategies, solution portfolio, go-to-market and mid-term financial outlook. In the meantime I will hand it over to Duston Williams. Duston?\nDuston Williams: Thank you, Rajiv. Q3 was another quarter of consistent execution. In Q3 we exceeded all guidance metric and the expected benefits of our subscription transition and our ACV first focus continued to play out as planned. Our average contract term lengths compressed as expected, declining to 3.3 years versus 3.4 years in Q2 '21. Term compression is highly correlated to better deal economics and we were very pleased with the improvement deal economics during the quarter. Other key components of our subscription transition in our ACV first focus include retention rates and increased attach rates for our emerging products, which typically have shorter average contract term lengths, both of these metrics performed well in the quarter. And as average contract term lengths do begin to stabilize, we expect reported year-over-year revenue growth to move closer to ACV billings growth over time. Now, I'll move on to some specific Q3 financial highlights. In Q3, we had record ACV billings. ACV billings were $160 million, reflecting 18% growth year-over-year, above our guidance range of $150 million to $155 million. Run rate ACV as of the end of Q3 was $1.45 billion, growing 25% year-over-year compared to our guidance for growth in the mid 20% range. Revenue was $345 million, growing 8% from Q3 '20. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 81.7% versus our guidance of 81%. Operating expenses were $361 million versus our guidance of $365 million to $370 million. We continue to benefit from overall spending reductions, including go-to-market efficiencies. Our non-GAAP net loss was $86 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.41 per share. We were pleased that our backlog position remained flat in Q3 versus Q2, despite Q3 typically being a seasonally slower quarter in which we usually experience some usage of backlog. In Q3, we experienced a solid year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increase in our pipeline. This pipeline growth occurred with significantly less demand generation spending versus our spend in Q3 '20. Q3 represented our third consecutive quarter of good linearity. DSOs in Q3 were 37 days, down from 44 days in Q2 '21 and down significantly from 67 days in Q3 '20. Our free cash flow for Q3 was once again aided by good linearity, coming in at a negative $71 million, $15 million better than consensus. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.25 billion, down slightly from $1.29 billion in Q2 '21. Now turning to our Q4 '21 guidance. The guidance for Q4 is as follows: ACV billings to be between $170 million and $175 million representing year-over-year growth of 21% to 25%. Gross margin of approximately 81.5% to 82%. Operating expenses between $380 million and $385 million. Weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 212 million. Based on the Q4 '21 ACV billings guidance, we expect run rate ACV to grow in the low to mid 20% range year-over-year. Additionally based on our Q4 '21 ACV billings guidance, we expect ACV billings for FY '21 to approximate $590 million to $95 million, up from $505 million in FY '20 reflecting year-over-year growth of 17% to 18%. As a reminder, for our reported quarterly ACV billings, we annualize any deal that is less than one year in term length, therefore, the total fiscal year ACV billings are not derived from the simple addition of the four fiscal quarters. Our yearly ACV billings calculation to eliminate any duplication that happens with the renewal of a deal that occurs within the period and is less than one year in duration. We do not believe we will see any material change in average contract term length in Q4. Based on our ACV billings guidance the implied revenue for Q4 should reflect double-digit year-over-year growth. Our operating expense guidance includes approximately $15 million in severance costs related to the previously mentioned limited workforce reductions that took place in Q4. We expect some improvement in our free cash flow performance in Q4 versus Q3. And finally, to help with your modeling, we continue to include in our earnings presentation located on our IR website, our historical trends for ACV billings, run rate ACV, billings term length and a bridge on how to model and convert our current and future ACV billings guidance to total billings. We will continue to include this level of detail through the end of FY '21. With that, operator, could you please open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Congrats on the strong ACV results. I wanted to ask about clusters. You guys talked about in your script, it sounds like it's doing better. I wonder if you can provide a bit more detail on some adoption trends there and how is it helping I guess both with an upsell perspective, but also future-proofing existing customer spend? Is that kind of how we think about clusters in terms of extending the Nutanix stack to the cloud?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Matt. Happy to answer that. It's Rajiv here. It's still fairly early days first of all for clusters, since we [indiscernible] for AWS. But we are quite encouraged by what we're seeing from a tax perspective. If you look at the use cases, today existing use case is that customers are using clusters. For example, disaster recovery for VDI funds, we talked about a large financial services customer doing that today. There, of course, is somewhat elastic where you can actually run your media workload for any other workloads, on-prem but use the cloud as you need for disaster recovery, and that's a very cost effective and a very effective use case for clusters. We are also seeing other use cases for driving data center consolidation. You want to get out of the data center and migrate to the cloud, but the easiest way to lift and shift workloads for existing applications without needing to re-architect them. We are starting to also see organizations use this for dev test and burst capacity for seasonal demands. Now to the latter part of your question there, Matt, I think there is an equally important factor of future proofing. So, our customers vary across the spectrum in terms of cloud adoption. Some of them are of course using cloud already today. Others are thinking about it as a path to the future. And for those customers who are actually looking at this as part of their future journey, having this capability today gives them a lot more confidence in choosing Nutanix as a platform. Now the [indiscernible] our multi-cloud roadmap. We have talked about working with Azure on clusters, and we do expect that to be available for early access later this year, and we are closely partnering with Microsoft on that project.\nMatt Hedberg: That's great, thanks. Rajiv. And then maybe one for Duston. Obviously, strong ACV results, ACV billings throughout this quarter, and you're calling for another acceleration in Q4. I assume a lot of this is based off your pipeline and also the fact that backlog didn't decrease but - what else gives you confidence in that kind of acceleration which is certainly noticeable here?\nDuston Williams: Yes, no, we're pleased to give you that guidance, which as I said is about 21%, 25% year-over-year growth on the ACV billings. Q4 typically is a stronger quarter for us. So, you see some of that. Clearly, the pipeline and the work that has gone on with the pipeline management and the discipline in the pipeline is a big deal from that perspective. Conversion rates are doing okay and things like that. The product is doing well in the marketplace. Emerging products are continuing to do their thing. We've seen some early indications with the channels having to do a little bit more of the lift themselves with deals. So, I think it's a combination of those things. But again, Q4 is always a little bit better, but with the backdrop of a lot of good things going on behind the scenes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJames Fish: Kind of going off of Matt's question there. The main environment does appear to be favorable now as the business is inflecting from our vantage point. How are you feeling about the sales capacity and productivity and what are you looking to do to ensure that the first added renewals really go as well over the next 12 to 18 months?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So maybe I can start and Duston you can chime in there. So we continue to focus very much in terms of our sales productivity. Yes, we've talked about how - of course we are [indiscernible] lot of discipline in terms of pipeline management and much more predictable pipeline conversion with the sales team. We are also building out, of course, leveraging the partner ecosystem more now. We are bringing our more solution-oriented selling and then the emerging products on top of that also improve our productivity. And at the same time again compressing deal terms help our overall ASP uplift as well. Now, when it comes to the second part renewals of your question Jim, so we have been focused very much on building out the engine for being ready for all the renewals coming in. So we are building out the renewals team now to focus on a low-cost renewal mechanism. We are putting in all the tooling necessary so that we get full visibility into where customers are in their adoption and consumption cycle and we've also created the clarity around who is responsible across the sales organization and the customer success teams for driving this whole profit from the time of sales through the time of renewal. So all in all, we feel pretty good about the upcoming stream of renewals here.\nJames Fish: That's very helpful Rajiv. And just keeping on the sales and marketing, obviously the announcement about the headcount reduction. Just any further details here, was it more kind of middle management layer or any of the reps themselves or how do we think about that reduction element? Thanks guys.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I mean -- I think it was - it wasn't done and it is exclusively in sales and marketing, but it was based more on where we saw for example excess coverage that we didn't need that many people far in specific market regions, elimination of certain functions, creating again the room to go build-out our renewal business [ph] separate from the team that's doing the ACV. So, it was fairly distributed across the spectrum. And of course, wherever possible we tried to not impact quota-carrying reps, but look at the non-quota-carrying reps in terms of this process. So, it was fairly distributed. Not specific to one particular area.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPinjalim Bora: Seems like a pretty good one. Rajiv, I want to double-click on the emerging products. We have been hearing a constant drumbeat about Era being a differentiation in the market and kind of pulling the core platform in some cases, maybe I think you kind of alluded in the last quarter, where is this - what's the maturity of the thinking at this point in time to sell Era as a standalone solution to kind of act of the beachhead and the other part to that is, at this point in time, what kind of an ACV uplift are you seeing from Era and maybe Files?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. Good questions there. So on Era, clearly Era is a database management offering. It allows our customers to streamline holiday, install database as provision databases and then lifecycle of the databases and manage all the day-to-day operations that they need to do on their databases. And we make use of the underlying Nutanix platform to do some of these functions very efficiently. So that is the connection implied today to the underlying platform. So what we see is a very two-fold go-to-market around Era. Obviously within our installed base of Nutanix customers we can go in there and upsell them on Era on top of our platform. But also Era has been a way for us to get into new accounts, where they don't have any previous Nutanix footprint by focusing on the value proposition of Era which is differentiated and allowing us to pull in our core platform as well. So it works both ways. So I would say this is a very good product market fit at this point and is in an area that we are investing more in and our vision of course over time is to grow Era into a multi-platform, multi-cloud offering, not just tied to only Nutanix platform, and increase the range of database engine that we will support in the offering. I'll let Duston comment on the specific ACV uplift that we are seeing for Era and Flow, Files etc. Duston?\nDuston Williams: Sure. Let me talk a little bit more in a broader bucket as far as just the emerging products which flow in Era and the likes in there and as you heard 80% percent year-over-year increase in ACV for those products, 39% attach rate and from an uplift perspective, I think the best way to look at it, that we look at it also is, is just deal economics and there's two ways to get better deal economics, term compression obviously shorter terms have higher deal economics, but then just better like-for-like pricing on a three-year to a three-year deal. And when we look at deal economics without Era, Flow and the likes of that emerging bucket, and with those products, we're seeing a significant uplift in the overall deal economics and Era is front and center as far as the uplift that we're getting there. And I think we'll shed a little bit of light because there have been questions, a little bit uplift where we're getting from a five-year to a three year and a three year to a one year deal and how our emerging products helping deal economics? So I think we'll try to shed a little bit of light on that at Investor Day and give you some insight I think for the first time there.\nPinjalim Bora Q - Pinjalim Bora: Duston, one for you. I was wondering on - I mean at this point in time you already have motions to go back to your life of device customers and get them convert to Trump term maybe on renewals, but how has those conversations been? Those customers - are those customers weighing more towards like a three-year deal than a one-year deal? And what portion of the ACV growth is coming from that motion at this point?\nDuston Williams: Yes, not a ton. Naturally as you said, when your support renewal is up for renewal a life of device support renewals up, for renewal it's a natural time to have that discussion as far as emerging over into subscription based transaction. So those go on naturally. Our guys are all over that, and so that's a natural occurrence from that perspective. And with the shift to ACV based comp, it's got a higher likelihood that those deals, which we've pegged is five years for a life of device, gets more tilted toward three or maybe even shorter deal, because most likely have better deal economics, better higher ACV and the rest going to get more money, more commission dollars with that down tick in terms of, again its a natural occurrence. A lot of our support renewals that come up for renewals just merge, they don't renew. They'll merge into a new subscription transaction. So that's ongoing and the great news there is that we've got a big pool of that as you all know and so that's an ongoing effort over the next several years that we'll continue to tack from that perspective.\nPinjalim Bora: Understood. I'm sure we'll hear more about that at the Analyst Day, but, congrats on the quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: My first question, I guess for Rajiv, there's this narrative that COVID has accelerated the shift to cloud, and I was just wondering, how you think that's impacted demand in the on-prem space generally. And then how has it impacted demand, specifically for Nutanix?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I mean I think at the top level if you look at the COVID impact a lot more customers talked about how to get their employees working remotely pretty effectively. And that certainly had a stimulus effect on terms of what's in desktop deployments and scaling those deployments. And that's a sweet spot use case for us. So we certainly benefited from that. We are also starting to use CV, the use of cloud. Now, cloud migration certainly, I think as customers look at cloud more and more customers are looking at making use of the public cloud, and we have certainly seen that being a driver for some of our deployments as well, like we've talked about here with some of the examples we provided like the financial services customer who is actually doing - meaning doing both. Doing VDI to support their remote workforce but also using the cloud for disaster recovery in a very cost effective way. So we are certainly seeing more and more of the use cases of hybrid cloud emerge as we go forward. So I think in general, when we look at COVID, I think it's isolated customers digital transformation, which means their focused also in doing more and more digital, driving application work and that generally means they're also modernizing infrastructure where it makes sense. So that helps us and the drive to hybrid cloud is going to be helping factor for us as well and then there is remote work that's here to stay. It's going to be hybrid workflows as we all come back into the offices. It will likely be people working part of the time in the office and part of the time remotely. So it will continue. So those drivers in general I think are helping us.\nJason Ader: And you haven't seen any kind of significant shift from customers or opportunities where they've just said, we're done with on-prem data centers, we want to go cloud native and we just don't need you guys anymore, we are not really seeing that type of a phenomenon?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I mean we haven't quite seen that as you can see our business continues to grow healthily. We are seeing good demand and we are seeing in fact an uptick in demand here. So, no, I think we're not seeing that yet. But we are seeing more and more customers talking about wanting to be in this multi-cloud world. They're going to decide what they want to go in terms of their applications, some application will continue to run on-prem, some will be in the public cloud, some will be in the edge and these are newer applications as well. So we are starting to see more of that hybrid trend emerge.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Andrews with Needham. Your line is open.\nJack Andrews: Rajiv given your focus on partnerships and I was wondering if you could just maybe discuss how - maybe I guess the amount of awareness and maturity your channel ecosystem has for your line of emerging products relative to their awareness of your core HCI offerings? Is the channel fully up to speed in terms of just all the capabilities that you've introduced to the market or is there still an education process happening there?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I think it's very much the latter, there is still an education process. Most of our channel partners are very much selling our core offering, our core HCI, that's what they're most familiar with. These newer products such as Era and File and Flow and so forth are relatively new to our partners and only now are they building up their capabilities to be able to sell that. I think the initial product market fit for some of these products was doing very much by us and now we are deploying - they are actually scaling these products, so that we have product market fit on. And this is where the partners come in and play a very significant role. So we are certainly investing in building up the capabilities and enabling them to transact and build up their competencies in these emerging products. And I think there is a future opportunity for leveraging the partners data as well.\nJack Andrews: And then quick one for Duston. You mentioned that you're not expecting any material changes to contract term whilst here in the fiscal 4Q. Any comments in terms of how you're thinking about it beyond this and moving into next fiscal year?\nDuston Williams: Yes, I think again you will see some potential gradual decline. So I think what we see in the pipeline, there's not a whole lot of movement in those terms. Now, when it converts to actual deals, we'll see how that plays out. But I think again, I've said for a while now and we'll have to see here over the next couple of years. But what I had said previously is now probably 2.8 to 3.0 somewhere around there years, but that's over a period of time and it's pretty much now things can change, but it's pretty much played out. So far, I believe that we have expected, we thought it would be a gradual decline because you got plus or minus 80% of the existing customer base already has a set term. So you need to change that and whatever. So again, I think it's ultimately somewhere between that 2.8 and 3 years and I think that occurs over some period of time and we're at 3.3 today and we'll see how that goes over the next year or two.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you and congrats on the solid ACV results and guide. Rajiv there clearly has been a lot of change or a deal largest competitor, both in terms of leadership, ownership, etc. Do you anticipate any significant competitive changes there as it pertains to Nutanix especially with respect to either channel or pricing? And I have a follow-on.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. Look, I think obviously competition is good for the customer. I feel pretty good about our position in the market, independent of what's happening at any of our competitors. We are very focused. We are focused on executing on our HCI platform, building out the emerging products on top of that and extending that to multiple clouds and we are very focused in our customers and delivering the best outcomes to our customers. And look if we do that right, I think the rest will fall in place. Now, it is worth noting that we are still the one provided at the likes of most choice in the market allowing our customers to take the hardware and the hypervisor, [indiscernible] cloud platforms, along with our software. And we remain very focused in terms of executing on that mission and also continuing to build and leverage partners where I see even more opportunity for us.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, thanks Rajiv. And Duston the $50 million in annual savings, is that on a gross or net basis. And is there some that's getting reinvested somewhere else or is all of that to flow down the P&L. Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, most of it flows into the P&L. There may be some minor reinvesting, but most of it all flows and probably two-thirds of that is in operating expense and the rest is in COGS, with some of our services and things like that. But, vast majority though will flow through.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKaty Huberty: Yes, thank you. My congrats on the quarter too. I wanted to start with a question for Duston. Can you just give some context around the better than seasonal third quarter backlog. Is that a function of an internal strategy to just run at higher backlog levels and improve visibility or was that a bit of a surprise in a signal of strengthening demand that you weren't able to ship at the end of the quarter?\nDuston Williams: Yes, sure. Katy, I mean you always hope for higher backlog to your point there. But, pipelines have been strong. You saw the comments that we were pleased with the quarter-over-quarter increase in pipe, the year-over-year increase in pipe. So I think you definitely see something going on from a demand perspective there. And then, again, you have to layer that on with the backdrop of some pretty good execution also within the pipeline management and deal management and deal closure and things like that. So I think it's certainly a combination of both and a good indicator also was linearity, which we talked about. Quite honestly linearity surprised me a little bit in the quarter being as good as it was, just typically not like that in Q3, coming off a big Q2. So I think it's a combination of mostly positive things at play there.\nKaty Huberty: And then just as a follow-up, maybe Rajiv can comment here. Today, what percentage of the business is driven by OEM partners and how does that compare to a year ago? And then which OEMs are you seeing the fastest growth with? And I just asked that in the context that clearly part of your strategic change is to build out that partner ecosystem? Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: I'll comment on the second one and then Duston you can comment on the size of the business to the OEMs. So I would say, HP, clearly is the one that's been growing the fastest for us overall in terms of the OEM relationships for us. Clearly Dell continues and I would say Dell is more fulfillment as we partnered together and customers want to land our solution in Dell hardware, Dell supports that. So I would say, HP, Lenovo, to the extent that they are in markets where they are strong, continues to be from a server perspective also continuously a very good partner for us. So I would probably say those are the two big ones. Duston you want to comment on the sizing?\nDuston Williams: Yes, I don't have a whole lot to add, because we stopped giving that stat out a while ago and because it just got complicated, because most, if not all the Dell business has rolled over to the XE core, which is going to meet channel with our software running on their service, which continues to do quite well. But it's outside of that OEM bucket there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall: I wanted to start with the kind of this question of supply. I know you're selling software not servers within your customers have to install it on a server. So I'm just curious whether you think there's any risk as you look out the next quarter or two, given all the supply shortages we keep hearing about? People want to buy your software, but then they can't find servers to install it on? And then I have a follow-up.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I mean, Rod, I could just tell you global shortage of chips out there and I think the one thing that I can say about software sales is, not all our software necessarily need serves all the time. I mean it's - people are doing more virtualization and they might deploy it even on existing ones. In some cases there are stuff that they have already procured. So we haven't quite seen supply shortages being a driver or impacting us at this point at all.\nRod Hall: Okay, that's great. Thank you Rajiv. And then my follow-up. I just wanted to come back to this point on contract term. I think some people look at a stabilization and maybe they worry that we're stabilizing a little higher level. I'm just curious, I mean Duston you said that's tracking where you guys would have expected. I'm assuming this is just kind of puts and takes around mix on terms and I think any other color you could dig into to help us understand why that 3.3 years remained stable in Q4 in the guide and how we ought to maybe see that trajectory after probably ticks down after that or how is that kind of playing out? That would be great. Thanks.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. As you know, that's not an exact science to predict how exactly what the terms are going to be in any given quarter. It could go down a 10th here or there, whatever, I wouldn't be surprised about that. My comments here is just - I just a material quarter-over-quarter change. Now it's a little bit different in Q1 when Fed pops up and they have a lot of one-year deals. So take that out of the equation, but I just don't see any rapid decline in terms and again I - we'll see how it plays out over the next couple of years. 2.8 years, 3.0 years are somewhere in that range. I think as we have more time and reps have more discussions with customers. We are naturally going to try to move them from five to three or shorter. So I think that occurs naturally over time. But I - it's not my assumption that we stay here at 3.3 years and we don't move any further. I just don't think it's a rapid decline.\nRod Hall: We shouldn't think that maybe there is any slowing on renewals or anything like that, or would stabilize, or is it nothing like that?\nDuston Williams: No. We will give you a very good feel when we are loud and clear on the renewal front and we'll give you more visibility and all that. So you're going to - you'll see a good toast of that on June 22.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nVictor Chiu: This is the Victor Chiu in for Simon. I want to draw a little more into the cloud portfolio. Hybrid cloud is kind of a generic term that encompasses a number of different approaches and solutions. So can you maybe speak about Nutanix's competitive proposition compared to more integrated cloud platforms/software defined data center solutions like VMware Cloud and Azure Stack and maybe help us understand what are the most vital factors that enterprises consider when deciding which particular hybrid cloud approach to adopt?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I think the key question there, by the way is, first of all, I mean, people operate, our customers are operating, of course, with the data center but with one or more public cloud as well. Now if you are looking at a particular public cloud provider, all the public cloud providers are also embracing hybrid strategies now. AWS has outsourced Azure Arc and so the customers is locked to one public cloud and they can also look at that particular public cloud hybrid solution. But more often than not and we showed you some more data at Investor Day, where we show that customers are interested in more than one public cloud. So they are using multiple public clouds and their on-prem and now when you start looking at this environment, they look - the value that we provide with our cloud solutions is, we provide one platform, one set of tooling, one set of management interfaces, one license that a customer can use to deploy and manage their workload on whichever cloud they want. Whether it's today is of course on-prem, edge or data center and also moving to AWS and tomorrow once we get our Azure out, and over time, hopefully we'll have more. And so that unique - think of this as a multi-cloud platform that our customers can actually get and to some extent VMware has something similar as well, right. The approach that we have a slightly different, today we essentially say customers you have your own whatever public cloud accounts you have, you can just deploy, buy the software from us that same license, you don't get where you use it. You use it wherever you want. If you want to deploy that in the public cloud of your choice, we enable you to do that and you can go out and deploy it. You can manage it all with one solution. And we also do a lot more work in terms of handling all the data services in terms of our heritage being in terms of how we manage and store data. So we do that particularly well as well. So our value proposition fundamentally is to be able to provide this platform that cuts across multiple clouds, essentially make these clouds invisible, highly underlying complexities of each of the cloud silos and provide this consistent platform for customers to go run their businesses on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Erik, your line is open.\nErik Suppiger: Thanks for taking the question. On the Lenovo partnership, can you talk about what the competitive dynamics are there? Are there any other providers that are working with Lenovo and if they have this tied in the integration as you do? And then secondly, just curious with AHV it's kind of settled in at 52%, it's been in the 50% range for a while. Is that something that's going to change at any point down the road or is it probably where it settles in for a while?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Good questions. So Lenovo launched this offering just with us for now, right. I'm sure they may have other partners that they are bringing on board over time. But the - this particular announcement, which was April and Awards, it's called the true scale offering it is everything delivered as a subscription. So that means the hardware and the PCs, the servers, the Citrix media and the Nutanix software all put together delivered as a subscription offering, as a service offering to their customers. And so this is an example where they work with us as a first partner to go deliver this complete end-to-end, as-a-service subscription offering combining hardware and software to address this customer use case or end-to-end solution right, enabling their end users as well as to be able to consume remote desktops. So we are the first solution then. Now is your question on AHV. We expect continued growth and adoption of AHV over time. It's been a gradual continuing upshift. So customers look at the value of AHV, it's getting better and better every day to where AHV can today handle all the mission critical workloads that customers want. So customers look at this as an opportunity for them to save quite a bit of costs and over time, continue to migrate more and more of their workloads to AHV. For example, I mean one of the large deals that we announced is this Asia Pacific mission critical deployment was on AHV, right. It makes you - it made use of our major network security solution that\u2019s build in essentially in part of the AHV, and so people are very comfortable with that assay as mainstream hypervisor that can run all workloads. So we do expect more and more. It will be a gradual uptick in terms of the deployment of AHV.\nErik Suppiger: Is there any catalysts that would drive that higher?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Potentially as cloud for example, all our cloud - hybrid cloud solutions in AWS and also Azure are based on AHV, and to the extent that the customers actually start using more and more of that, that will be by AHV. As customers look at renewals of their existing software from other vendors and they look at this as potential cost savings that could accelerate as well.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes, thank you for taking my question. So, has there been a change in the way your building up the ACV guidance this quarter relative to the prior three quarters, because for the entire three quarters, you've been beating your own guidance by a healthy margin in the past. So just wondering if there has been a change in the way that you're building up this ACV guidance?\nDuston Williams: Same methodology.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay, great. And then when you talk about an uplift from emerging products, does it just mean the driver of the ACV billings acceleration or are you also seeing year-over-year increase in ACV core and is that what you mean by like-for-like pricing actually?\nDuston Williams: Yes, the latter. Yes. It's actually better deal economics.\nNehal Chokshi: And could you - I know this is somewhat difficult but can you tell us what percent of ACV billings was actually renewals in the quarter?\nDuston Williams: We have not given that on an ACV basis but highly likely you'll see a fair amount of detail again at Investor Day on that.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay, great. Congrats on the strong quarter and I think, what I think is fantastic guidance. Congratulations.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon everyone. I hope you are all staying safe and healthy. We are closely monitoring the current COVID situation around the globe, particularly in India, where we've offered help and support to our local team, from healthcare assistance to fundraising for organization supporting relief efforts in the country. I'm impressed by the resilience of both our employees and customers around the world, especially in India. Now, I'll move on to our results. Q3 was a strong quarter across the board. We delivered another quarter of improved execution, continued momentum, and outperformance on all our guided metrics. Today, I'd like to highlight some of our accomplishments in the quarter and also discuss progress on some of the key priorities I outlined on our last earnings call. We continue to execute on our transition to an ACV based revenue model. And as expected, our renewal pipeline is continuing to build. These economics continue to improve due to shorter duration terms combined with uplift from our emerging products. In addition, we saw good linearity in the quarter as a result of our ongoing operational improvements through our go-to-market engine. And finally, while we typically see a seasonal decline in backlog in the third quarter, we were able to hold steady, further demonstrating the strength of demand in the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and can see that the hard work of moving to a subscription model is paying off. Duston will go into more details later on our financial performance. Last quarter, I shared my observations as a new CEO in Nutanix and outlined our priorities for driving long-term growth, including simplifying components of our product portfolio, deepening our ecosystem partnerships, continuing our shift to subscription, and nurturing our talent pool. I'd like to give updates on a couple of these priorities today, including our transformation to a subscription business model and deepening our ecosystem partnerships to provide more impact on how we go to market. Starting with our transition to a subscription model, our average contract term continues to decline coming down from last quarter to 3.3 years, helping drive higher unit economics. We also see our growing base of renewals as an increasingly important driver of top line growth and sales and marketing efficiency. With this transition well underway and with our increased focus on efficiency, we see a clear path to cash flow positivity and operating profit, and we'll go into more details at our upcoming Investor Day. Focusing on deepening partnerships of scale how we go to market, as well as creating more opportunities with larger accounts is critical to our long-term success. In April, Lenovo and Nutanix announced a complete as-a-service solution for hosted desktops to enable IT division make us [indiscernible] in the new remote hybrid workforce model. This new solution, all managed as a service with the convenience of a single monthly payment and single point of contact for support, includes Lenovo client devices, Citrix virtual desktops, and Lenovo server powered by Nutanix software. This new aspect of our extended relationship with the number one seller of PCs in the world is a great example of how we can work with a strategic partner to leverage their capabilities from the data center to the desktop in order to better serve our customers as well as give us meaningful incremental opportunity. Our partnership with Microsoft also continued to progress. During the quarter, we announced that our Kubernetes solution, Karbon, is now validated with Azure Arc Kubernetes management, with the ease of deploying and managing the certified Kubernetes Cluster on Nutanix HCI with consistent policies and governance across clusters provided by Azure Arc. Our mutual customers now have a smooth and fast path to modern containerized applications in a hybrid cloud environment. This month, we announced that the Nutanix platform now extends to AWS GovCloud, providing a unified hybrid cloud environment across Nutanix on-premises and bare metal Amazon EC2 instances running on AWS GovCloud. US public sector organization looking for strength and security offered by AWS GovCloud can now accelerate their adoption and leverage a single platform and management interface across their private and public cloud. Next, I'll talk about the momentum in our core software as well as our emerging solutions during the quarter. In Q3, we continued to acquire new customers while our existing customers expanded their engagements with us. We saw continued strength in our core solution reflected by a healthy year-over-year increase in our win rates against both our largest competitor and three-tier infrastructure solutions. We also saw continued strength in emerging products with our attach rates on a rolling four-quarter basis, increasing to 39%, up from 37% last quarter. We are seeing more examples of customers choosing our complete cloud software platform together with emerging solutions to meet all of their business needs. An example of this was the government entity in the Asia-Pacific region that chose our cloud platform software as well as our network security solutions to develop a secure, private cloud supporting their mission critical system, including security, exchange, and SQL database workloads. Our database management solution era continues to be an important differentiator for us and had good momentum during the quarter. A financial services company headquartered in Europe selected Era and other emerging solutions on top of our cloud platform to help expand their infrastructure at scale to support their banking customers requirements for performance, growth, and Financial Service Level Agreement. This customer will use our database management solution to deploy, optimize, and manage SQL databases across multiple hybrid clouds, helping to drastically simplify and standardize their overall database operations. We also saw increased adoption of clusters during the quarter with the use cases including data center consolidation, virtual desktop, disaster recovery, and the ability to burst to the cloud for additional capacity. In one case, a Fortune 500 North American financial services company selected Nutanix in a multi-million-dollar deal to replace their previous architecture and run their VDI workflows and is using clusters to burst into AWS on-demand for disaster recovery in their multi-cloud environment. Next, I'd like to touch on efficiency. This is an important part of our path to profitability. We have increased our go-to-market productivity, including more efficient digital marketing spend, increased leverage of our channel partners, and optimized headcount in geographies based on market opportunity. In connection with these efforts, we recently decreased our global headcount by 2.5% from within the sales and marketing function as we continue to refine our go-to market model. We expect these actions to yield approximately $50 million in annual savings. Finally, I'd like to highlight some industry awards that Nutanix received during the quarter which demonstrate our customers enthusiasm for our products and support. We were recognized by Gartner as a Peer Insights Customers' Choice vendor for emerging solutions for distributed file systems and object storage. In addition our core software was recognized by Trust Radius as a Top Rated Product in the HCI Server Virtualization, software defined storage and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure category. Also we recently won the NorthFace Scoreboard Service Award for achieving excellence in customer service. All of these awards are based on customer feedback. In summary, I'm very pleased with our execution across the board in the third quarter. I look forward to sharing more information at our upcoming Investor Day on June 22. We plan to go into more details about our mission to delight customers with a simple open hybrid and multi-cloud software platform with fixed data services to build, run and manage any applications. We will also provide insights on our strategies, solution portfolio, go-to-market and mid-term financial outlook. In the meantime I will hand it over to Duston Williams. Duston? Yes, Matt. Happy to answer that. It's Rajiv here. It's still fairly early days first of all for clusters, since we [indiscernible] for AWS. But we are quite encouraged by what we're seeing from a tax perspective. If you look at the use cases, today existing use case is that customers are using clusters. For example, disaster recovery for VDI funds, we talked about a large financial services customer doing that today. There, of course, is somewhat elastic where you can actually run your media workload for any other workloads, on-prem but use the cloud as you need for disaster recovery, and that's a very cost effective and a very effective use case for clusters. We are also seeing other use cases for driving data center consolidation. You want to get out of the data center and migrate to the cloud, but the easiest way to lift and shift workloads for existing applications without needing to re-architect them. We are starting to also see organizations use this for dev test and burst capacity for seasonal demands. Now to the latter part of your question there, Matt, I think there is an equally important factor of future proofing. So, our customers vary across the spectrum in terms of cloud adoption. Some of them are of course using cloud already today. Others are thinking about it as a path to the future. And for those customers who are actually looking at this as part of their future journey, having this capability today gives them a lot more confidence in choosing Nutanix as a platform. Now the [indiscernible] our multi-cloud roadmap. We have talked about working with Azure on clusters, and we do expect that to be available for early access later this year, and we are closely partnering with Microsoft on that project. Yes. So maybe I can start and Duston you can chime in there. So we continue to focus very much in terms of our sales productivity. Yes, we've talked about how - of course we are [indiscernible] lot of discipline in terms of pipeline management and much more predictable pipeline conversion with the sales team. We are also building out, of course, leveraging the partner ecosystem more now. We are bringing our more solution-oriented selling and then the emerging products on top of that also improve our productivity. And at the same time again compressing deal terms help our overall ASP uplift as well. Now, when it comes to the second part renewals of your question Jim, so we have been focused very much on building out the engine for being ready for all the renewals coming in. So we are building out the renewals team now to focus on a low-cost renewal mechanism. We are putting in all the tooling necessary so that we get full visibility into where customers are in their adoption and consumption cycle and we've also created the clarity around who is responsible across the sales organization and the customer success teams for driving this whole profit from the time of sales through the time of renewal. So all in all, we feel pretty good about the upcoming stream of renewals here. Yes, I mean -- I think it was - it wasn't done and it is exclusively in sales and marketing, but it was based more on where we saw for example excess coverage that we didn't need that many people far in specific market regions, elimination of certain functions, creating again the room to go build-out our renewal business [ph] separate from the team that's doing the ACV. So, it was fairly distributed across the spectrum. And of course, wherever possible we tried to not impact quota-carrying reps, but look at the non-quota-carrying reps in terms of this process. So, it was fairly distributed. Not specific to one particular area. Yes. Good questions there. So on Era, clearly Era is a database management offering. It allows our customers to streamline holiday, install database as provision databases and then lifecycle of the databases and manage all the day-to-day operations that they need to do on their databases. And we make use of the underlying Nutanix platform to do some of these functions very efficiently. So that is the connection implied today to the underlying platform. So what we see is a very two-fold go-to-market around Era. Obviously within our installed base of Nutanix customers we can go in there and upsell them on Era on top of our platform. But also Era has been a way for us to get into new accounts, where they don't have any previous Nutanix footprint by focusing on the value proposition of Era which is differentiated and allowing us to pull in our core platform as well. So it works both ways. So I would say this is a very good product market fit at this point and is in an area that we are investing more in and our vision of course over time is to grow Era into a multi-platform, multi-cloud offering, not just tied to only Nutanix platform, and increase the range of database engine that we will support in the offering. I'll let Duston comment on the specific ACV uplift that we are seeing for Era and Flow, Files etc. Duston? Yes, I mean I think at the top level if you look at the COVID impact a lot more customers talked about how to get their employees working remotely pretty effectively. And that certainly had a stimulus effect on terms of what's in desktop deployments and scaling those deployments. And that's a sweet spot use case for us. So we certainly benefited from that. We are also starting to use CV, the use of cloud. Now, cloud migration certainly, I think as customers look at cloud more and more customers are looking at making use of the public cloud, and we have certainly seen that being a driver for some of our deployments as well, like we've talked about here with some of the examples we provided like the financial services customer who is actually doing - meaning doing both. Doing VDI to support their remote workforce but also using the cloud for disaster recovery in a very cost effective way. So we are certainly seeing more and more of the use cases of hybrid cloud emerge as we go forward. So I think in general, when we look at COVID, I think it's isolated customers digital transformation, which means their focused also in doing more and more digital, driving application work and that generally means they're also modernizing infrastructure where it makes sense. So that helps us and the drive to hybrid cloud is going to be helping factor for us as well and then there is remote work that's here to stay. It's going to be hybrid workflows as we all come back into the offices. It will likely be people working part of the time in the office and part of the time remotely. So it will continue. So those drivers in general I think are helping us. I mean we haven't quite seen that as you can see our business continues to grow healthily. We are seeing good demand and we are seeing in fact an uptick in demand here. So, no, I think we're not seeing that yet. But we are seeing more and more customers talking about wanting to be in this multi-cloud world. They're going to decide what they want to go in terms of their applications, some application will continue to run on-prem, some will be in the public cloud, some will be in the edge and these are newer applications as well. So we are starting to see more of that hybrid trend emerge. I think it's very much the latter, there is still an education process. Most of our channel partners are very much selling our core offering, our core HCI, that's what they're most familiar with. These newer products such as Era and File and Flow and so forth are relatively new to our partners and only now are they building up their capabilities to be able to sell that. I think the initial product market fit for some of these products was doing very much by us and now we are deploying - they are actually scaling these products, so that we have product market fit on. And this is where the partners come in and play a very significant role. So we are certainly investing in building up the capabilities and enabling them to transact and build up their competencies in these emerging products. And I think there is a future opportunity for leveraging the partners data as well. Yes. Look, I think obviously competition is good for the customer. I feel pretty good about our position in the market, independent of what's happening at any of our competitors. We are very focused. We are focused on executing on our HCI platform, building out the emerging products on top of that and extending that to multiple clouds and we are very focused in our customers and delivering the best outcomes to our customers. And look if we do that right, I think the rest will fall in place. Now, it is worth noting that we are still the one provided at the likes of most choice in the market allowing our customers to take the hardware and the hypervisor, [indiscernible] cloud platforms, along with our software. And we remain very focused in terms of executing on that mission and also continuing to build and leverage partners where I see even more opportunity for us. Yes, most of it flows into the P&L. There may be some minor reinvesting, but most of it all flows and probably two-thirds of that is in operating expense and the rest is in COGS, with some of our services and things like that. But, vast majority though will flow through. I'll comment on the second one and then Duston you can comment on the size of the business to the OEMs. So I would say, HP, clearly is the one that's been growing the fastest for us overall in terms of the OEM relationships for us. Clearly Dell continues and I would say Dell is more fulfillment as we partnered together and customers want to land our solution in Dell hardware, Dell supports that. So I would say, HP, Lenovo, to the extent that they are in markets where they are strong, continues to be from a server perspective also continuously a very good partner for us. So I would probably say those are the two big ones. Duston you want to comment on the sizing? Yes, I mean, Rod, I could just tell you global shortage of chips out there and I think the one thing that I can say about software sales is, not all our software necessarily need serves all the time. I mean it's - people are doing more virtualization and they might deploy it even on existing ones. In some cases there are stuff that they have already procured. So we haven't quite seen supply shortages being a driver or impacting us at this point at all. Yes. As you know, that's not an exact science to predict how exactly what the terms are going to be in any given quarter. It could go down a 10th here or there, whatever, I wouldn't be surprised about that. My comments here is just - I just a material quarter-over-quarter change. Now it's a little bit different in Q1 when Fed pops up and they have a lot of one-year deals. So take that out of the equation, but I just don't see any rapid decline in terms and again I - we'll see how it plays out over the next couple of years. 2.8 years, 3.0 years are somewhere in that range. I think as we have more time and reps have more discussions with customers. We are naturally going to try to move them from five to three or shorter. So I think that occurs naturally over time. But I - it's not my assumption that we stay here at 3.3 years and we don't move any further. I just don't think it's a rapid decline. Yes, I think the key question there, by the way is, first of all, I mean, people operate, our customers are operating, of course, with the data center but with one or more public cloud as well. Now if you are looking at a particular public cloud provider, all the public cloud providers are also embracing hybrid strategies now. AWS has outsourced Azure Arc and so the customers is locked to one public cloud and they can also look at that particular public cloud hybrid solution. But more often than not and we showed you some more data at Investor Day, where we show that customers are interested in more than one public cloud. So they are using multiple public clouds and their on-prem and now when you start looking at this environment, they look - the value that we provide with our cloud solutions is, we provide one platform, one set of tooling, one set of management interfaces, one license that a customer can use to deploy and manage their workload on whichever cloud they want. Whether it's today is of course on-prem, edge or data center and also moving to AWS and tomorrow once we get our Azure out, and over time, hopefully we'll have more. And so that unique - think of this as a multi-cloud platform that our customers can actually get and to some extent VMware has something similar as well, right.

And we also do a lot more work in terms of handling all the data services in terms of our heritage being in terms of how we manage and store data. So we do that particularly well as well. So our value proposition fundamentally is to be able to provide this platform that cuts across multiple clouds, essentially make these clouds invisible, highly underlying complexities of each of the cloud silos and provide this consistent platform for customers to go run their businesses on. Good questions. So Lenovo launched this offering just with us for now, right. I'm sure they may have other partners that they are bringing on board over time.

So we are the first solution then. Now is your question on AHV. We expect continued growth and adoption of AHV over time. It's been a gradual continuing upshift. So customers look at the value of AHV, it's getting better and better every day to where AHV can today handle all the mission critical workloads that customers want.

            "name": "Duston Williams",
            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. Q3 was another quarter of consistent execution. In Q3 we exceeded all guidance metric and the expected benefits of our subscription transition and our ACV first focus continued to play out as planned. Our average contract term lengths compressed as expected, declining to 3.3 years versus 3.4 years in Q2 '21. Term compression is highly correlated to better deal economics and we were very pleased with the improvement deal economics during the quarter. Other key components of our subscription transition in our ACV first focus include retention rates and increased attach rates for our emerging products, which typically have shorter average contract term lengths, both of these metrics performed well in the quarter. And as average contract term lengths do begin to stabilize, we expect reported year-over-year revenue growth to move closer to ACV billings growth over time. Now, I'll move on to some specific Q3 financial highlights. In Q3, we had record ACV billings. ACV billings were $160 million, reflecting 18% growth year-over-year, above our guidance range of $150 million to $155 million. Run rate ACV as of the end of Q3 was $1.45 billion, growing 25% year-over-year compared to our guidance for growth in the mid 20% range. Revenue was $345 million, growing 8% from Q3 '20. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 81.7% versus our guidance of 81%. Operating expenses were $361 million versus our guidance of $365 million to $370 million. We continue to benefit from overall spending reductions, including go-to-market efficiencies. Our non-GAAP net loss was $86 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.41 per share. We were pleased that our backlog position remained flat in Q3 versus Q2, despite Q3 typically being a seasonally slower quarter in which we usually experience some usage of backlog. In Q3, we experienced a solid year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increase in our pipeline. This pipeline growth occurred with significantly less demand generation spending versus our spend in Q3 '20. Q3 represented our third consecutive quarter of good linearity. DSOs in Q3 were 37 days, down from 44 days in Q2 '21 and down significantly from 67 days in Q3 '20. Our free cash flow for Q3 was once again aided by good linearity, coming in at a negative $71 million, $15 million better than consensus. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.25 billion, down slightly from $1.29 billion in Q2 '21. Now turning to our Q4 '21 guidance. The guidance for Q4 is as follows: ACV billings to be between $170 million and $175 million representing year-over-year growth of 21% to 25%. Gross margin of approximately 81.5% to 82%. Operating expenses between $380 million and $385 million. Weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 212 million. Based on the Q4 '21 ACV billings guidance, we expect run rate ACV to grow in the low to mid 20% range year-over-year. Additionally based on our Q4 '21 ACV billings guidance, we expect ACV billings for FY '21 to approximate $590 million to $95 million, up from $505 million in FY '20 reflecting year-over-year growth of 17% to 18%. As a reminder, for our reported quarterly ACV billings, we annualize any deal that is less than one year in term length, therefore, the total fiscal year ACV billings are not derived from the simple addition of the four fiscal quarters. Our yearly ACV billings calculation to eliminate any duplication that happens with the renewal of a deal that occurs within the period and is less than one year in duration. We do not believe we will see any material change in average contract term length in Q4. Based on our ACV billings guidance the implied revenue for Q4 should reflect double-digit year-over-year growth. Our operating expense guidance includes approximately $15 million in severance costs related to the previously mentioned limited workforce reductions that took place in Q4. We expect some improvement in our free cash flow performance in Q4 versus Q3. And finally, to help with your modeling, we continue to include in our earnings presentation located on our IR website, our historical trends for ACV billings, run rate ACV, billings term length and a bridge on how to model and convert our current and future ACV billings guidance to total billings. We will continue to include this level of detail through the end of FY '21. With that, operator, could you please open the call up for questions. Yes, no, we're pleased to give you that guidance, which as I said is about 21%, 25% year-over-year growth on the ACV billings. Q4 typically is a stronger quarter for us. So, you see some of that. Clearly, the pipeline and the work that has gone on with the pipeline management and the discipline in the pipeline is a big deal from that perspective. Conversion rates are doing okay and things like that. The product is doing well in the marketplace. Emerging products are continuing to do their thing. We've seen some early indications with the channels having to do a little bit more of the lift themselves with deals. So, I think it's a combination of those things. But again, Q4 is always a little bit better, but with the backdrop of a lot of good things going on behind the scenes. Sure. Let me talk a little bit more in a broader bucket as far as just the emerging products which flow in Era and the likes in there and as you heard 80% percent year-over-year increase in ACV for those products, 39% attach rate and from an uplift perspective, I think the best way to look at it, that we look at it also is, is just deal economics and there's two ways to get better deal economics, term compression obviously shorter terms have higher deal economics, but then just better like-for-like pricing on a three-year to a three-year deal. And when we look at deal economics without Era, Flow and the likes of that emerging bucket, and with those products, we're seeing a significant uplift in the overall deal economics and Era is front and center as far as the uplift that we're getting there. And I think we'll shed a little bit of light because there have been questions, a little bit uplift where we're getting from a five-year to a three year and a three year to a one year deal and how our emerging products helping deal economics? So I think we'll try to shed a little bit of light on that at Investor Day and give you some insight I think for the first time there. Yes, not a ton. Naturally as you said, when your support renewal is up for renewal a life of device support renewals up, for renewal it's a natural time to have that discussion as far as emerging over into subscription based transaction. So those go on naturally. Our guys are all over that, and so that's a natural occurrence from that perspective. And with the shift to ACV based comp, it's got a higher likelihood that those deals, which we've pegged is five years for a life of device, gets more tilted toward three or maybe even shorter deal, because most likely have better deal economics, better higher ACV and the rest going to get more money, more commission dollars with that down tick in terms of, again its a natural occurrence. A lot of our support renewals that come up for renewals just merge, they don't renew. They'll merge into a new subscription transaction. So that's ongoing and the great news there is that we've got a big pool of that as you all know and so that's an ongoing effort over the next several years that we'll continue to tack from that perspective. Yes, I think again you will see some potential gradual decline. So I think what we see in the pipeline, there's not a whole lot of movement in those terms. Now, when it converts to actual deals, we'll see how that plays out. But I think again, I've said for a while now and we'll have to see here over the next couple of years. But what I had said previously is now probably 2.8 to 3.0 somewhere around there years, but that's over a period of time and it's pretty much now things can change, but it's pretty much played out. So far, I believe that we have expected, we thought it would be a gradual decline because you got plus or minus 80% of the existing customer base already has a set term. So you need to change that and whatever. So again, I think it's ultimately somewhere between that 2.8 and 3 years and I think that occurs over some period of time and we're at 3.3 today and we'll see how that goes over the next year or two. Yes, sure. Katy, I mean you always hope for higher backlog to your point there. But, pipelines have been strong. You saw the comments that we were pleased with the quarter-over-quarter increase in pipe, the year-over-year increase in pipe. So I think you definitely see something going on from a demand perspective there. And then, again, you have to layer that on with the backdrop of some pretty good execution also within the pipeline management and deal management and deal closure and things like that. So I think it's certainly a combination of both and a good indicator also was linearity, which we talked about. Quite honestly linearity surprised me a little bit in the quarter being as good as it was, just typically not like that in Q3, coming off a big Q2. So I think it's a combination of mostly positive things at play there. Yes, I don't have a whole lot to add, because we stopped giving that stat out a while ago and because it just got complicated, because most, if not all the Dell business has rolled over to the XE core, which is going to meet channel with our software running on their service, which continues to do quite well. But it's outside of that OEM bucket there. No. We will give you a very good feel when we are loud and clear on the renewal front and we'll give you more visibility and all that. So you're going to - you'll see a good toast of that on June 22. Same methodology. Yes, the latter. Yes. It's actually better deal economics. We have not given that on an ACV basis but highly likely you'll see a fair amount of detail again at Investor Day on that."

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Tonya, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a strong quarter across the board. We exceeded guidance across all metrics, saw ACV growth, spend less than expected on operating expenses, gain momentum in our renewals engine and continued to make progress on our transition to subscription. Before I get into more details I will begin by talking about how I have spent my time since joining Nutanix in December and provide my initial observations on the business and the priorities going forward. In addition to some introductory meetings with shareholders I met with many of our major constituents including customers, partners and employees since coming on board in December. The observations lead from these meetings has provided me with a good perspective with which to form some priorities for our future. These observations include the deep value that our customers get from the simplicity of our software, the importance that our channel partners play in growing our business at scale, the significant opportunity ahead of us with strategic alliances that will help us penetrate bigger accounts and the quality and engagement of our talented employee base who are critical to the execution of our [business]. Feedback from these key constituents and collaboration with my engaged leadership team has enabled us to clarify several core priority areas to drive long-term growth. All of these priorities are part of the natural evolution for a company at scale. First, we will drive more simplification of our portfolio and how we take our solutions to market including our products and packages for the benefit of our customers. Second, we will focus on deepening our partnerships to provide more impact in how we go to market as well as create more opportunities within larger accounts. Third, we will continue our transformation of our business model to subscription with a significant focus on renewals and our part to cash flow positivity. And fourth, we will continue to nurture and grow our talent pool as well as to ensure that our employee base has a diversity of talent, thoughts and experiences to create a better workplace environment and business outcomes. Now let me provide a little bit more detail on these conversations, observations and priorities. I have had many encouraging and informative conversations with customers including our advisory boards. When it comes to our product portfolio customers love our simplicity. I think our solutions and support are exceptional and appreciate the end-to-end nature of our portfolio. They've also told me that Nutanix is a critical component of their business transformation plans. On the constructive side some have expressed that they would like us to make it easier for them to adopt and consume our software by delivering more solutions that bring our portfolio together and to simplify our pricing and packaging. We have built the feedback into our key priorities for our go-to market strategy. During the quarter I had the pleasure of presenting at a well attended global partner event where I met several key partners. They see the value that Nutanix software and solutions can bring to their business as they help customers on their multi-cloud journey. Last quarter we launched our elevate partner program which focuses on partner competencies through training to increase the quality of partners working with us and partner enabled including improving the deal registration process to increase volume. With this focus we have seen a 12% year-over-year expansion in the number of partners who transacted with us during the quarter as well as an increase in partner-led deals. Engaged and efficient channel partners will be a critical component of ensuring that we have the leverage needed to grow and scale our business through our subscription transformation. Our partnerships with HPE, Lenovo and other server OEMS remain strong. Our customers recognize tremendous value in having freedom of choice in their selection of hardware with these partners and in a broader ecosystem allowing us to address the increasingly complex needs of large enterprises. For example, we were selected by a leading financial services company headquartered in EMEA to modernize their data center and to provide virtual desktops to more than 90,000 users. This multi-million dollar one-year subscription deal was with our core software, our AHV hypervisor and our files solution. We partnered with HPE, Citrix and ETOS one of our global systems integrator partners to provide the total solution required for their used cases. I have been encouraged by the value that our customers see from our software, the variety of workloads they are deploying on our platform and our traction with our global 2000 customer base. We now count 950 global 2000 companies as our customers after adding about 20 in the quarter. We continue to progress with our public cloud partnerships and integration with both Azure and AWS and are exploring how to maximize these relationships to help our customers on their journeys to multi-cloud. Our partnership with Azure is still in its early days but we are excited about its prospects. We will focus on deepening our integration and relationships in this area. Finally, I have had the pleasure of speaking with many employees at all levels. I have been delighted to see that there is strong talent in this company and I'm highly impressed with their passion. It's no surprise to me that Nutanix was named in both the Fortune Best Workplaces in the Bay Area 2021 and A Great Place to Work in India during the quarter. I already mentioned that an area of opportunity for us is to advance our efforts to diversify our talented employee base. In addition, we will increase our focus on ESD and related disclosures. Now let me talk about the market opportunity in front of us as well as provide more color on the momentum and execution we saw during the quarter. During the quarter, industry analysts highlighted the market potential for hyper-converged infrastructure or HCI and its part to multi-cloud. IDC released reports concluding that HCI can create a consistent experience across all platforms whether on premises or in the cloud, how multi-cloud strategies are now the enterprise norm and how a large majority of IT managers plan to migrate or repatriate workloads from public clouds to an on premises for ease of management. In addition, Gartner raised its forecast for HCI Systems during the quarter to $8.1 billion a five-year CAGR of 15% from 2019 through 2024. They noticed that organizations are expanding their HCI assistance footprint on a wider set of enterprise workloads with emphasis on a new set of software capabilities such as orchestration in a multi-cloud world. Now let me provide some highlights about our performance this quarter. We delivered record ACV billings growth of 14% year-over-year which included notable strength coming from emerging products. Our OpEx was less than expected and we will continue a disciplined approach to managing our OpEx going forward. Our thesis of the benefits to a shift to term licenses continues to play out with better deep economics and reduce average tumbling driving shorter renewal cycles. As we have said, getting this right will be critical to our success both in growing the top line and in reducing our operating costs. A year into the pandemic we continue to see various industries and verticals impacted differently. While some industries face headwinds there are a number that have the resources to focus on innovation and transformation with IT as their enabler. To that end we saw strength and demand from the financial services, healthcare and state and local government sectors in the quarter. Our emerging products particularly our database management solution Era and our file storage solution Files had a strong quarter. Emerging product ACV was up over a 100% year-over-year and we had a 37% attach rate to deals on a rolling four quarter basis. We are encouraged by the fact that nearly half of the Fortune 100 have adopted our emerging products. Our Era solution is showing great momentum and market fit and I see this as a competitive differentiator for us going forward. We've seen repeat purchases from large enterprises who are early adopters. This quarter a U.S.-based financial services company purchased Era and our core software in a multi-million dollar deal. They are using Era to provide a single database management platform to enable their app developers to provision new environments, clone and refresh multiple tier one workloads and now have the ability to replicate and recover large databases in a fraction of the time that their current solution takes. Era has become a competitive differentiator for us in the telco, finance, retail and manufacturing sectors in particular and we now count three of the top 10 global 2000 customers as Era customers. We saw growing interest in our clusters of AWS solutions since its launch last quarter. One customer example this quarter is a pension services company in EMEA; an existing customer who is building on their Nutanix hyper-converged infrastructure software as they continue their journey to multi-cloud. They were looking to increase the mobility of their applications and workloads across multiple clouds as well as to have options for bursting and clusters fit the requirement. Ultimately they selected the Nutanix solution so that they could get a single solution to consistently manage their private, hybrid and multi-cloud environment. We remain focused on go-to-market sales productivity and execution. We are pleased with our progress so far which is a reflection in part on Chris Kaddaras' leadership. During this quarter Chris was promoted to Chief Revenue Officer after leading the global sales organization for the last year. We're also seeing material progress in demand gen productivity across the board including our virtual events and overall digital marketing performance all at significantly lower costs. We also continue to see benefit from our test drive which is seeing an increasing number of trials over the past year and has proved to increase conversion rates when compared to sales where best price isn't used. We are encouraged by our momentum and we will continue to focus on overall go-to-market efficiency. We continue to innovate our storage offerings with the recent release of new features enabling our customers to simplify data management and effectively manage costs, moving IT teams even closer to true hybrid and multi-cloud operating models. The new capabilities include cloud tiering for object storage, hybrid cloud file storage and simplified disaster recovery for both objects and files. Recently we also announced new features in our cloud platform to help protect customers against Ransomware attacks which are becoming even more common as a result of increased remote work. These new capabilities all natively built into the Nutanix stack add to Nutanix's rich data services for network security, files and object storage and business continuity to help enterprises prevent, detect and recover against Ransomware attacks across multiple cloud environments. We are pleased with the external recognition we continue to receive for our solutions and our market share. In Q2 we were recognized by Gartner as a leader in their magic quadrant for hyper-converged infrastructure for the fourth year in a row and by position best and execution when compared to all vendors in the report. Also Gartner released its software market share numbers for hyper-converged infrastructure and Nutanix was once again ranked number one in market share for HCI and saw our market share increase year-over-year. In addition in IDC's new software-only view of the market the software-defined infrastructure factor Nutanix is the leading vendor in the space. This new view is not influenced by hardware sales. Let me conclude by reiterating how excited I am to be leading Nutanix into its next phase of growth and execution. We remain focused on our vision of making clouds invisible and freeing customers to focus on their business outcomes and our north star continues to be our customers. We believe our mission of delighting customers with a simple, open, hybrid and multi-cloud software platform with which data services to build, run and manage any application will help us achieve that vision. Our strengths lie in our significant experience designing software that is easy to use and in our expertise in key areas for the journey to multi-cloud including storage and data services. I have confidence in our continued momentum going into the second half of the year balanced with cautious optimism about the global macroeconomic environment. I very much look forward to sharing more details with all of you at our Investor Day on June 22. I'd now like to turn it over to Duston for more details about our financial performance. Duston?\nDuston Williams: Thank you Rajiv. Our sales team executed quite well in Q2 amidst an uncertain macro environment and our ongoing ACV transition. Comparable to the quarter before last quarter we provided guidance that took into consideration the uncertain macro environment we are operating in and clearly we outperformed our expectations for the quarter while at the same time adding to our backlog. As we look forward our thesis for the business continues to be proven out that an ACV first focus will gradually compress term lengths leading to better deal economics and a shorter time to more efficient low-cost renewals. As the mix of our low-cost renewals increases as a percent of our total business we believe it will eventually add significant leverage to our go-to-market cost structure. We are also seeing the result of our ACV based sales compensation plan putting a renewed focus on sales of emerging products which typically have shorter term lengths. I have previously shared that we expected term lengths which compress slightly in Q2. Our Q2 average term length was 3.4 decreasing by 0.1 and down slightly from 3.5 years in Q1. We are also pleased with the overall deal economics in Q2. We build a record amount of subscription renewals during the quarter and while the sample size is still relatively small and we are still early in the process we are encouraged by the retention rates that we are currently seeing. We continue to sign an increasing number of one-year deals. These deals will add to the pool of low-cost renewals available to renew in FY \u201822. As we previously noted we had an outstanding quarter related to our emerging products with most of those individual products generating record ACV. Emerging products continued to play an important role in improving our deal economics during the quarter, so in summary based on our strong execution in Q2 our thesis for the business continue to play out as expected. As we move into the second half of our fiscal year we remain very encouraged with our progress to-date. Now I will move on to some specific Q2 financial highlights. In Q2, we had record new ACV, renewal ACV and total ACV. ACV billings were $159 million reflecting 14% growth year-over-year significantly above our guidance range of $145 million to $148 million. Run rate ACV as of the end of Q1 was $1.38 billion growing 28% year-over-year compared to our guidance of approximately 25% growth. Revenue was $346 million essentially flat from Q2, 20 driven by a 0.5 year decrease in average term length versus Q2, \u201820. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 rose to 82.7% versus our guidance of 81.5%. Operating expenses were $354 million down 11% year-over-year and less than our guidance of $360 million to $370 million. We continued to benefit from overall spending reductions including go-to-market efficiencies. Our non-GAAP net loss was $74 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.37 per share. We also saw a good year-over-year increase in our pipeline in the quarter as well as continued improvement in overall pipeline quality. Our linearity in Q2 was outstanding resulting in one of our most linear quarters ever. Our free cash flow for Q2 was aided by good linearity coming in at negative $28 million. This performance was significantly better than our expectations. DSOs in Q2 were 45 days down from 54 days in Q1, \u201821 also driven by good linearity and we closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of 1.29 billion down slightly $1.32 billion in Q1 \u201821. Now turning to our Q3, \u201821 guidance. The guidance for Q3 is as follows. ACV billings to be between $150 million and $155 million representing year-over-year growth of 11% to 15%. Gross margin of approximately 81%. Operating expenses between $365 million and $370 million representing a year-over-year decline of 5% to 6%. Weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 207 million. Now a few modeling assumptions our guidance for Q3 continues to have a small conservative bias based on the ongoing uncertain macro environment. As we communicated last quarter in similar to the seasonality we have experienced over the last two years our Q3 guidance anticipates a slight seasonal decrease in ACV billings in Q3 versus Q2 while at the same time reflecting year-over-year growth of 11% to 15% and a raise of 5% to 8% from the current [straight] estimates. Based on the Q3, ;\u20191 ACV billings guidance we expect run rate ACV to continue its strong growth trend and grow in the mid 20% range year-over-year. We believe we are now to the point in our transition that we will not see dramatic quarter-over-quarter change in term lengths with terms fluctuating by 0.1 or so per quarter going forward. As term length begins to stabilize we expect reported year-over-year revenue growth to move closer to ACV billings growth over time. We also expect our operating expenses for fiscal \u201821 to now come in up with the $50 million less than what we spent in the prior fiscal year. From a free cash flow perspective liner in Q3 is typically not liner strong which we experienced in Q2 and therefore expect our cash uses to increase in Q3. Our Q3 case uses will most likely approach our current [indiscernible] expenses numbers for Q3. We are pleased with our overall cash management efforts especially in the light of compressing terms and continue to exceed our internal plan set forth at the beginning of the fiscal year. And finally to help with your modeling we continue to include in our earnings presentation located on our IR website our historical trends for ACV billings, run rate ACV, billings term length and a bridge on how to model and convert our current and future ACV billings guidance to total billings. We will continue to include this level of detail through the end of FY \u201821. With that operator could you please open up the call for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey it's Dan from Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking our questions. Rajiv welcome aboard. Maybe after your initial listening and looking tour here there's some things that really stood out to you based on your past experience. Just curious if you thought of a logical next step or logical second inning that you see here?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Sure. Happy to take that. Nutanix had a vision around making computing invisible and what I see here is growing our portfolio, we are expanding that vision to make cloud invisible, the customers are increasingly operating the multiplied world and the purpose of making cloud invisible is to really highly analyzed complexities and stream up our customers to focus on business outcomes. Now when you look at our core market itself HCI they are very focused leading that market and extending that to multi-cloud as we said earlier the HCI on-prem market alone is growing at about 15% CAGR according to Gartner. So within that I think our focus areas if you would ask me today would be a product leadership in HCI making sure we continue to be leaders there investing in network fixes and really treating cloud as a first class citizen extending everything that we do into a hybrid and multi-cloud world. And as we do that there's an opportunity for us to also simplify our packaging and our solutions in terms of how we can take all of this to market and then I think we continue the focus and shift to subscription like we've been talking about and making sure we get to the other end of that journey as a renewal packaging and we built this efficient renewals engine and we have talked earlier also about discipline the focus on cost management and driving to free cash flow break even and again the last but not the least is to really leverage our channel partners and strategic partnerships because that's what's going to give us leverage in the market.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's great, very helpful. And then maybe for Duston. ACV billings guidance for the third quarter here slight decrease in absolute dollar value of our strong second quarter results. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks, but could you just help us think of the decline a little more quarter-over-quarter?\nDuston Williams: Sure. Yes, as you mentioned, we talked about this last earnings call. If you look at the last two Q3's there was a decline for roughly 4% to 8% in those quarters. And if you look at this decline, it's roughly 3% to 6% decline, but coming off a very big Q2, obviously and something that outpaced our expectations, but I think we set back and just look at the guidance itself, a, we came off a big Q2, we messaged this last quarter so it's completely within what we expected. The guide delivers 11% to 15% year-over-year growth, it increases the consensus on the high-end by $12 million or so, it's a 5% to 8% raise. If you look below the bottom line, there is -- or below the topline there's additional gross profit dollars that we will be delivered when you do your math for your model, revenue will go up, expenses will come down $15 million -- $10 million to $15 million from consensus and the operating loss, again we do your math will be substantially less than the consensus there. So we feel really good about delivering the guide that we did, we feel really good about Q2. And we feel really good how we're progressing and exiting Q2 with our backlog position. So when you add all that up, I think it's a pretty strong guide and then something that we feel pretty comfortable [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst: That's great. Thanks for the insight.\nOperator: Our next question comes on the line of Kathryn Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nKathryn Huberty: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, OpEx was lower in the quarter, as well as for the fiscal year. So maybe Duston can you talk about whether those savings are temporary versus more structural? And then Rajiv, if you can follow that up and just talk about the areas of investment in the business that you think you might be able to scale back or rationalize as you march toward the goal of breakeven and cash flow positive? Thank you.\nDuston Williams: On the first part there, Kat. It's a combination of both. Clearly, we've been benefited from obviously lack of travel and things like that. And travel will come back over time, I don't think we'll ever spend again as much on travel as we have in the past, we've learned that we can do things differently, we've learned that we can do things much more efficient. But having said all that, I think we've got a great opportunity and Rajiv will talk about this going forward. There is clearly a different view on operating expenses and focusing now really on efficiency. If you look at the last three years outside of -- but take FY '20, which was, kind of, a COVID year, but the three -- this current year, if you look at the three prior years, we grew expenses about 35% on average year-over-year for a three-year period. So we've got a lot of resources. Now the focus is, how do we get those resources more efficient? How do we get the go-to market model more efficient, and that's what Rajiv has brought to the table here and there'll be not only for this year, but I'm trusting for FY '22 and FY '23 you will see a renewed focus on that. And maybe Rajiv you want to follow that up a little bit.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Sure, sure, Duston. In fact on that point, I think with respect to efficiency, it's really around sales and marketing efficiency largely. I feel that we are pretty good in terms of where we are at on the R&D side and remain at the slightly look at REIT inducting some of that the newer areas, but when you look at sales and marketing let's start first with marketing. In fact COVID has been a blessing in some form, because it forced us to go virtual. But I think if that has taught us a bit of tremendous efficiencies to be gained by growing virtual, whether it be with virtual events and our demand generation being more digital and therefore far more efficient and better ROI on our cost and what we spend there. And then more recently we've been introducing Test Drive, which is a feature that allows customers to try our offerings in the cloud and convert there from just trying it to actually buying. And so there people have used Test Drive, the conversion ratios have been much higher than place they haven't. So all of these put together are starting to make our marketing more efficient in -- and even in this post-COVID world, as we come out of it, that's number one. Number two on the sales side. The fundamental thesis here is that we are still largely doing new ACV deals. Our term license renewals are still very, very early in their lifecycle. As renewal start kicking in, we are in the process of building an efficient renewal engines here, where the cost is going to be much lower than the cost of sale for new customer acquisition of new ACV. So that should fundamentally help the sales side of this from an OpEx perspective as well. And we'll talk more about these by the way at our Investor Day in June.\nKathryn Huberty: That's great. Thank you so much for the color. Congrats on the quarter.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Please go ahead.  Your line is open. \nJason Ader: Thank you. Hi guys. I've question for you, Duston on the comment on duration. You said, we'll not see a dramatic fluctuation on duration going forward. And I guess, I had been modeling what's call it by the end of '22. Did you guys would get down to like three years? Is that not the correct assumption anymore? I mean, I would think that if you're doing more one-year deals and you continue to see increasing mix of one-year deals then that 3.4 will continue to sort of trend down. Could you help us out with that?\nDuston Williams: Yes. No, it's a good point. When I was mentioning there is 0.1 or so per quarter. And then you're kind of there at your 3.0, so I still think 3.0 could it be 2.8, it could be 3.1 somewhere around there. I think it begins to stabilize. But I think the main point there is from everything we know now, there shouldn't be drastic changes quarter-over-quarter from a term perspective, and you kind of saw a little bit in Q1, but federal kind of did that initial push there. And I think it could be flat, maybe this quarter or whatever, but I just think in general, it's probably a point one or so here per quarter going forward. So I think your 3 is still in the ballpark.\nJason Ader: Okay, great. And then Rajiv, I wanted to ask you, I guess, if you look over the next five years, like and I know that's a long [horizon in tech], but I think the issue at some people have with Nutanix and other companies like Nutanix, is that it's more of an on-prem infrastructure company, and that's kind of a bad word on-prem right? So how do you help investors get comfortable with this kind of -- that -- this kind of thing where Nutanix is on the, kind of, right side of history?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I think there is no doubt in the market that our customers are going to live in a multi-cloud world. Now I think it's equally clear that on-prem is not going away. Again Gartner forecast by the way with our on-prem HCI infrastructure. And they are saying that the market will grow at 16% over the next five years. And that doesn't really include multi-cloud as much, right? So we still see a lot of growth just purely in on-prem, but we are not stopping there. They are investing and making all our products really had a cloud customer -- first mentality. You saw some of our recent announcement side with Clusters, we are extending our core product offering, so that customers can buy a single license from us and use that to deploy workloads anywhere they want, whether it'd be in the public cloud of their choice or in their on-prem infrastructure. With some of the recent announcements that we saw with objects and files, any type of storage offering that we provide has natural steering into the public cloud, right? So fundamentally, we are -- we have a long-term play here in terms of helping our customers operate in this multi-cloud world. And that I think is the long-term sustainable advantage that we have.\nJason Ader: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Jack Andrews with Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJack Andrews: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to see, if we could drill down a bit more on the strength you achieved in the emerging products. Could you help us what's -- understand what's happening behind the scenes, is it -- are they helping you land new customers or these longtime Nutanix customers who are going bigger on Nutanix? Do you feel that your channel is fully educated on the capabilities of all these products. Could you just flush out maybe what's happening to drive -- help dry that strength?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I'll give you some color and then Duston can add on as well on top of this. So look first of all having a broader solution with a differentiated multi-cloud portfolio allows us to satisfy more of our customer needs and drive increased demand right? Beyond just selling core HCI, so these emerging products are starting to mature very nicely and many of them saw record billings this quarter. The top emerging products which quarter were Era, Files and Flow. And all of them have strong attached to our core product platform. So for example, flow, if security, right? So when people are deploying our core platform they will deploy security with it. File have just file storage, right? And that comes as part of the platform. Era actually preference a significant new opportunity on top, because now we are going up the management of database, and that can help us insert and find customers -- new customers that haven't used the core Nutanix platform in the past. So these emerging products in some cases can actually help us open new accounts and when new deals in other cases, they are attached to our existing Nutanix core platform. Duston do you want to add any color?\nDuston Williams: No, I think you covered really well there. I think that's [indiscernible].\nJack Andrews: Well, thanks for the perspective on that. And just as a follow-up question, Rajiv, I was wondering if you could maybe shed some more light on your comments regarding the importance of strategic alliances helping you penetrate larger accounts? Are you looking to engage with perhaps new and different types of partners? Or who among your existing relationships, do you think could help you really achieve that goal?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, at this point, I think the greatest opportunity really lies with further deepening and developing the partnerships that we have already. And I'll break that across three categories, we've got OEM partners, HP, Lenovo, and many others there. Then we've got an emerging set of cloud partners like Azure that we talked about we are also an AWS bare metal. And then our ecosystem of technology partners, who are crucial, for example, Citrix, it's a key technology partner there, right? For all of burst in desktop workloads. We talked about this large deal that we won this quarter together, which was really Citrix, Nutanix and HP, all coming together to deliver the solution. And with all of these partners, I think we've got room to also continue to accelerate our go-to-market. Google is one of the partner, right? They're core selling desktop-as-a-service with Google and again, but Google ain't selling on top of our stack that would be a technology ecosystem type of partnership. So I think with each of these, like I said, across OEM partners, cloud partners and ecosystem, technology partners, we've got more room to be building solutions taking these solutions together to market.\nJack Andrews: Great. That's helpful. Congratulations on the results.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Kurtz of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlexander Kurtzs: Thanks for taking my question. Rajiv, welcome and is breaking to know your prior company excited here. What comes next the Analyst Day. Just like to your earlier comments about Test Drive, Rajiv just at a high level, a lot of your, kind of, emerging competitors in the infrastructure space are very focused on delivering software that's not traditionally sold through a sales rep, it's -- as you said downloaded premium type model and then it ramps from there? Could you envision a future where the majority of Nutanix core hyper-converged activity is done through that type of a model, where there is very low touch at the beginning of the sales process and then the reps coming at the end of -- kind of expand -- lend and expand?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I mean, Alex, you are definitely heading in the right direction there. With Test Drive that is exactly what we're trying to do with this, it's a zero touch self service for prospective customers, right. So it allows them to really go out there and tried out for themselves and that reduces our need to go, do a high touch selling process with them, right? When they're engaged by themselves and then from then on, we would like to take what they see in Test Drive and then convert that to a sales right there, right over time. It's still early days for us, but that is exactly the promise. Now [indiscernible] we can take this, I mean, for simpler offering so I think this will work now for complex solution sales they're going to actually have to do a lot of hands on selling as well. So we expect that, I think this is again a great way for us to get more efficient over time with our sales.\nAlexander Kurtzs: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes in the line of James Fish of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nJames Fish: Hey, guys. Great -- congrats on the great and to 2020 -- calendar 2020 and Rajiv, like Alex said welcome to Nutanix and congrats on becoming CEO looking forward to working with you more over here. But I did want to actually ask, Duston, first you talked about good linearity, but just wanted to understand how much of the strength and the linearity was actually due to year-end budget flush? And what you saw in -- versus kind of what you saw in January to follow-up with that?\nDuston Williams: Yes, I mean, you always get pieces of budget flush, but I don't think we saw really thing unusual there whatsoever. We had many large deals in the pipeline. The question was when those we're going to close or not close? And I'm not sure really year-end budget \"flush\", I mean those were planned out in advance and things like that. So from that perspective I would label it is any different than the normal.\nJames Fish: That's helpful. And then Rajiv, as a follow-up. On the first priority you did mention more consolidation around Nutanix and customers having that desire. I know, it's kind of early, but what types of bundles are demanding solutions are really customers wanting? I mean, it sounds like Era, Files and Flow are kind of the part there, but any sense to kind of what bundles we could see from Nutanix in the coming months?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. Thanks, James. So on that it's going to be around solutions and use cases for customers. So for example, you could, I mean, as we've talked about here virtual desktops and enabling remote users. That's clearly a use case for which a specific subset of our portfolio comes together to deliver that as a solution for them. Mission critical workloads, if you're going to run databases and manage databases then Era running on top of our core AOS, AHV, right? Together with management is a good solution set for that. So we're going to be focused on examples and solution sets like that, that tied directly to what customers are buying. If a customer is buying a hybrid cloud and they are looking at our journey to the hybrid cloud, then it will be AOS, AHV with clusters. So that's how we plan to package it.\nJames Fish: Makes sense. Congrats again guys.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you James.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes, thanks. Two questions. First for Duston, I know that you guys continue to say that new ACV remains the bulk of the ACV billings. Can you actually give us the actual split between new ACV and renewing ACV? And then also how much more quarterly new ACV billings do you think you can get out of your existing sales force? I understand that the renewals is going to be largely incurred the new ACV capacity?\nDuston Williams: Yes, on the split. We haven't actually talked about the split specifically on an ACV basis. On a TCV basis, we've talked about renewals 10%, 11%, 12% range, and which really is the leverage, where Gartners leverage as a percent of TCV from a P&L perspective. So from macro, so it's still pretty small now, we're still in FY '21 as you get into FY '22 certainly into FY '23 that profile changes and that's what we've been talking about for quite some time. And then we would hope at Investor Day that we start giving you some really good views on our perspective of those renewal flows. Now we have a couple of quarters under above, we're starting to understand retention rates a little bit, we know when things are up for renewal. Obviously, I think, it would be really good to start providing the investment community little insight there to what we think from renewals, the percent of ACV, the percent of TCV. And more importantly, try to give you a view of the cost profile between new and upsell and renewals. So that is kind of a TBD something we're working on now, and which we expect to have a more wholesome discussion during Investor Day. On the productivity side, I'll let Rajiv chime in here too. But the answer is, we should be able to get quite a bit more productivity of the existing sales force. There is really no reason for that perspective, Chris has done a good job of trying to hire the right people, and once you hire those people to enable them to sell in our environment to make sure they have the right coverage, whether that's account base or geography base or vertical base. So that's ongoing and getting more leverage as Rajiv said from partners and things like that. So our view, I mean, which we are massively focused on now [efficiency] is too would do exactly that get more productivity out of the existing sales force here. So, Rajiv, you might want to add a couple of thought there too.\nRajiv Ramaswami: No, I think you covered, that the only thing I'll add there also if again what we talked about earlier in the call about portfolio of solution aligning our solutions will also help drive sales productivity increase [indiscernible] it's products industrial things, right? It helps upsize the deal and sell a broader portfolio. And second, it makes consumption by the customer review.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Great thanks, Rajiv and for you actually have you seen any change in the comparison environment and I am specifically thinking about, I believe that -- do you more recently pivoted the cloud updation as a linchpin to their hybrid cloud, which is basically HCI base. So, has that changed the competitive dynamic for you guys at all?\nRajiv Ramaswami: That's particularly not new, right. I mean, that's always been the case there. What I would say is look as the competition is always good for a customer. I feel good about where we are independent of anything happening at competition. Gartner is showing us increasing our market share year-over-year to roughly about 50% of the market. IDC shows us in the number one market share position. I do agree with the pieces that HCI is a foundational platform for hybrid cloud. And I think that's an industrywide statement not just a Nutanix statement. And from that perspective, as long as we continue to focus on delivering the best solutions and the best outcome for our customers, I think we will do just fine from a competitive perspective at that point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nRod Hall: Yes, thanks for the question. I guess, I wanted to start with you, Duston on DSOs, it's [indiscernible] we've seen them for five years, so really good job on that. I know you called out linearity in the quarter, it sounds like it's a really good linear quarter, but I wonder if you could dig into a little bit more on a, sustainability of that DSO level and b, I guess leading on from that, just kind of what drove the linearity if you can give us any color on that? And then I've got a follow-up.\nDuston Williams: Yes, on the linearity in the DSOs, we've always had I think good DSOs, we've always had good efforts there. They've never really gotten out of control and in any way there. So they've always been great now at, I think it was about 45 days or whatever. This quarter, it's not going to stay there, Rod, there was a really good linear quarter, if you look at past Q3's, it's just the way Q3s goal. It's just not going to be as linear now we'll do the best obviously and will go collect as much as we can and ship as linear as possible. But that's not going to continue like it was in Q2. Now the early indications for Q3 is that linearity is, kind of, going as expected. So there is nothing out of bounds there, when we look at Q3 from that perspective. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?\nRod Hall: I just -- I wondered what drove that linearity in the quarter, was it just kind of circumstantial situation or whether there something you guys did different from the execution?\nDuston Williams: Well, it always comes down to execution, right? At the end of the day and execution has improved. There is no doubt that every quarter execution gets better and that comes with discipline and it comes with pipeline management and that comes with having good pipe and not only the amount of pipe, but the quality of pipe. And we've seen the quality of the pipeline, go up a fair amount and then you layer on top of that, the ACV based comp that give sales reps a lot more optionality, if you will, to go maneuver things and things like that. So I think it's a broad reasoning, but it always starts with execution.\nRod Hall: Okay and can I have a follow-up for Rajiv? Is it okay?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Sure. Go ahead Rod.\nRod Hall: Yes, Rajiv, a just big picture, wondering if you could comment on where you see Nutanix is niche from a customer side point of view looking forward. VMware has been a tough competitor up in the large enterprise Nutanix seems to do really well with kind of these large-size, but maybe not a Fortune 100s. But just curious, what do you think in terms of future vision for where the sweet spot for Nutanix is?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, And I think clearly, Rod as you indicate, we had historical strength and what I would say a medium smaller enterprises. I think that's our sweet spot. But we've also penetrated a good amount of the global -- a large customers as well, right? We count like 950 of the top 2000 global as customers. But what I would say is that these larger customers, if we are more focused on winning specific use cases, like we are not quite there yet in terms of being able to say we are the platform of choice for everything, although we would like to get there. So with these global, for example, yes the wins that we highlighted this quarter was okay large global complex environment, but very focused on virtual desktops and remote users. Now one thing [indiscernible] there and we are actually used, then we see opportunities to build the footprint, right? Go, what I would say one use case at a time. So that's why I think about it, I think, we've got a lots of under penetration here in the market penetration opportunities in the market. But you're right, I mean, there is -- and there are other players in the market, they're going to have to go earn our way into these customers. And then, what I would also say is, there are some areas where we are able to come in at the top, for example Era and Database Management represents the potential to go in, it's a fairly unique solution in the marketplace and we're able to go use that as a way to get into new customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes in the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Rajiv, can you share some more color on the first point you made around the simplification of the portfolio that you said was part of the customer feedback? And maybe some color on what has differed from your expectations as you have joined the company and I have a follow-up?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I think on the first one we covered it little earlier. I see an opportunity to really being more of these products together, right? Our portfolio has grown quite a bit over the past few years. It's no longer [indiscernible] ALS and AHV which are our core HCI platform. But we've got management around that, we've got networking and security around that, we've got Files and Optics, we've got disaster recovery. And so, and then we've got frame as for desktop-as-a-service and then we've got Era. So they brought portfolio as you can see, and then we have -- at containers with carbon, for example. So what I see, you mentioned of trying to sell each of these products as an individual product in the market. There is an opportunity to put these together into a solution, if somebody is deploying a cloud native workload, okay, I mentioned virtual desktops. Now let's talk about cloud native, whereas carbon plus, iOS plus AHV is a platform with object storage that makes sense for somebody deploying a cloud native workloads. And by packaging that together and making it easy for our customer to consume that becomes more of a turnkey solution. So we see that kind of packaging for specific use cases that I think we can go drive and simplify in the market. What was part two of the question, sorry, could you repeat that?\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. What's been different from your expectations as you joined the company?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, largely I would say, it's -- I think pleasantly surprised actually on the upside, there's still a ton of talent, the very strong talent in the company, very strong, very passionate talent. And the team has done a lot with resources, limited resources, especially on the product and the portfolio side. So that's been a pleasant upward surprise for me and it's a really good, it makes me feel good about the strength of the product portfolio going forward. And then, no surprise, I do realize there is a lot of work ahead for us in terms of making this journey to subscription and they're very focused on execution on that front as we've been saying all along.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session and conference call for today. A reminder that Nutanix has an investor day scheduled for June 22 and Nutanix would love to see you there. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Tonya, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a strong quarter across the board. We exceeded guidance across all metrics, saw ACV growth, spend less than expected on operating expenses, gain momentum in our renewals engine and continued to make progress on our transition to subscription. Before I get into more details I will begin by talking about how I have spent my time since joining Nutanix in December and provide my initial observations on the business and the priorities going forward. In addition to some introductory meetings with shareholders I met with many of our major constituents including customers, partners and employees since coming on board in December. The observations lead from these meetings has provided me with a good perspective with which to form some priorities for our future. These observations include the deep value that our customers get from the simplicity of our software, the importance that our channel partners play in growing our business at scale, the significant opportunity ahead of us with strategic alliances that will help us penetrate bigger accounts and the quality and engagement of our talented employee base who are critical to the execution of our [business]. Feedback from these key constituents and collaboration with my engaged leadership team has enabled us to clarify several core priority areas to drive long-term growth. All of these priorities are part of the natural evolution for a company at scale. First, we will drive more simplification of our portfolio and how we take our solutions to market including our products and packages for the benefit of our customers. Second, we will focus on deepening our partnerships to provide more impact in how we go to market as well as create more opportunities within larger accounts. Third, we will continue our transformation of our business model to subscription with a significant focus on renewals and our part to cash flow positivity. And fourth, we will continue to nurture and grow our talent pool as well as to ensure that our employee base has a diversity of talent, thoughts and experiences to create a better workplace environment and business outcomes. Now let me provide a little bit more detail on these conversations, observations and priorities. I have had many encouraging and informative conversations with customers including our advisory boards. When it comes to our product portfolio customers love our simplicity. I think our solutions and support are exceptional and appreciate the end-to-end nature of our portfolio. They've also told me that Nutanix is a critical component of their business transformation plans. On the constructive side some have expressed that they would like us to make it easier for them to adopt and consume our software by delivering more solutions that bring our portfolio together and to simplify our pricing and packaging. We have built the feedback into our key priorities for our go-to market strategy. During the quarter I had the pleasure of presenting at a well attended global partner event where I met several key partners. They see the value that Nutanix software and solutions can bring to their business as they help customers on their multi-cloud journey. Last quarter we launched our elevate partner program which focuses on partner competencies through training to increase the quality of partners working with us and partner enabled including improving the deal registration process to increase volume. With this focus we have seen a 12% year-over-year expansion in the number of partners who transacted with us during the quarter as well as an increase in partner-led deals. Engaged and efficient channel partners will be a critical component of ensuring that we have the leverage needed to grow and scale our business through our subscription transformation. Our partnerships with HPE, Lenovo and other server OEMS remain strong. Our customers recognize tremendous value in having freedom of choice in their selection of hardware with these partners and in a broader ecosystem allowing us to address the increasingly complex needs of large enterprises. For example, we were selected by a leading financial services company headquartered in EMEA to modernize their data center and to provide virtual desktops to more than 90,000 users. This multi-million dollar one-year subscription deal was with our core software, our AHV hypervisor and our files solution. We partnered with HPE, Citrix and ETOS one of our global systems integrator partners to provide the total solution required for their used cases. I have been encouraged by the value that our customers see from our software, the variety of workloads they are deploying on our platform and our traction with our global 2000 customer base. We now count 950 global 2000 companies as our customers after adding about 20 in the quarter. We continue to progress with our public cloud partnerships and integration with both Azure and AWS and are exploring how to maximize these relationships to help our customers on their journeys to multi-cloud. Our partnership with Azure is still in its early days but we are excited about its prospects. We will focus on deepening our integration and relationships in this area. Finally, I have had the pleasure of speaking with many employees at all levels. I have been delighted to see that there is strong talent in this company and I'm highly impressed with their passion. It's no surprise to me that Nutanix was named in both the Fortune Best Workplaces in the Bay Area 2021 and A Great Place to Work in India during the quarter. I already mentioned that an area of opportunity for us is to advance our efforts to diversify our talented employee base. In addition, we will increase our focus on ESD and related disclosures. Now let me talk about the market opportunity in front of us as well as provide more color on the momentum and execution we saw during the quarter. During the quarter, industry analysts highlighted the market potential for hyper-converged infrastructure or HCI and its part to multi-cloud. IDC released reports concluding that HCI can create a consistent experience across all platforms whether on premises or in the cloud, how multi-cloud strategies are now the enterprise norm and how a large majority of IT managers plan to migrate or repatriate workloads from public clouds to an on premises for ease of management. In addition, Gartner raised its forecast for HCI Systems during the quarter to $8.1 billion a five-year CAGR of 15% from 2019 through 2024. They noticed that organizations are expanding their HCI assistance footprint on a wider set of enterprise workloads with emphasis on a new set of software capabilities such as orchestration in a multi-cloud world. Now let me provide some highlights about our performance this quarter. We delivered record ACV billings growth of 14% year-over-year which included notable strength coming from emerging products. Our OpEx was less than expected and we will continue a disciplined approach to managing our OpEx going forward. Our thesis of the benefits to a shift to term licenses continues to play out with better deep economics and reduce average tumbling driving shorter renewal cycles. As we have said, getting this right will be critical to our success both in growing the top line and in reducing our operating costs. A year into the pandemic we continue to see various industries and verticals impacted differently. While some industries face headwinds there are a number that have the resources to focus on innovation and transformation with IT as their enabler. To that end we saw strength and demand from the financial services, healthcare and state and local government sectors in the quarter. Our emerging products particularly our database management solution Era and our file storage solution Files had a strong quarter. Emerging product ACV was up over a 100% year-over-year and we had a 37% attach rate to deals on a rolling four quarter basis. We are encouraged by the fact that nearly half of the Fortune 100 have adopted our emerging products. Our Era solution is showing great momentum and market fit and I see this as a competitive differentiator for us going forward. We've seen repeat purchases from large enterprises who are early adopters. This quarter a U.S.-based financial services company purchased Era and our core software in a multi-million dollar deal. They are using Era to provide a single database management platform to enable their app developers to provision new environments, clone and refresh multiple tier one workloads and now have the ability to replicate and recover large databases in a fraction of the time that their current solution takes. Era has become a competitive differentiator for us in the telco, finance, retail and manufacturing sectors in particular and we now count three of the top 10 global 2000 customers as Era customers. We saw growing interest in our clusters of AWS solutions since its launch last quarter. One customer example this quarter is a pension services company in EMEA; an existing customer who is building on their Nutanix hyper-converged infrastructure software as they continue their journey to multi-cloud. They were looking to increase the mobility of their applications and workloads across multiple clouds as well as to have options for bursting and clusters fit the requirement. Ultimately they selected the Nutanix solution so that they could get a single solution to consistently manage their private, hybrid and multi-cloud environment. We remain focused on go-to-market sales productivity and execution. We are pleased with our progress so far which is a reflection in part on Chris Kaddaras' leadership. During this quarter Chris was promoted to Chief Revenue Officer after leading the global sales organization for the last year. We're also seeing material progress in demand gen productivity across the board including our virtual events and overall digital marketing performance all at significantly lower costs. We also continue to see benefit from our test drive which is seeing an increasing number of trials over the past year and has proved to increase conversion rates when compared to sales where best price isn't used. We are encouraged by our momentum and we will continue to focus on overall go-to-market efficiency. We continue to innovate our storage offerings with the recent release of new features enabling our customers to simplify data management and effectively manage costs, moving IT teams even closer to true hybrid and multi-cloud operating models. The new capabilities include cloud tiering for object storage, hybrid cloud file storage and simplified disaster recovery for both objects and files. Recently we also announced new features in our cloud platform to help protect customers against Ransomware attacks which are becoming even more common as a result of increased remote work. These new capabilities all natively built into the Nutanix stack add to Nutanix's rich data services for network security, files and object storage and business continuity to help enterprises prevent, detect and recover against Ransomware attacks across multiple cloud environments. We are pleased with the external recognition we continue to receive for our solutions and our market share. In Q2 we were recognized by Gartner as a leader in their magic quadrant for hyper-converged infrastructure for the fourth year in a row and by position best and execution when compared to all vendors in the report. Also Gartner released its software market share numbers for hyper-converged infrastructure and Nutanix was once again ranked number one in market share for HCI and saw our market share increase year-over-year. In addition in IDC's new software-only view of the market the software-defined infrastructure factor Nutanix is the leading vendor in the space. This new view is not influenced by hardware sales. Let me conclude by reiterating how excited I am to be leading Nutanix into its next phase of growth and execution. We remain focused on our vision of making clouds invisible and freeing customers to focus on their business outcomes and our north star continues to be our customers. We believe our mission of delighting customers with a simple, open, hybrid and multi-cloud software platform with which data services to build, run and manage any application will help us achieve that vision. Our strengths lie in our significant experience designing software that is easy to use and in our expertise in key areas for the journey to multi-cloud including storage and data services. I have confidence in our continued momentum going into the second half of the year balanced with cautious optimism about the global macroeconomic environment. I very much look forward to sharing more details with all of you at our Investor Day on June 22. I'd now like to turn it over to Duston for more details about our financial performance. Duston? Sure. Happy to take that. Nutanix had a vision around making computing invisible and what I see here is growing our portfolio, we are expanding that vision to make cloud invisible, the customers are increasingly operating the multiplied world and the purpose of making cloud invisible is to really highly analyzed complexities and stream up our customers to focus on business outcomes. Now when you look at our core market itself HCI they are very focused leading that market and extending that to multi-cloud as we said earlier the HCI on-prem market alone is growing at about 15% CAGR according to Gartner. So within that I think our focus areas if you would ask me today would be a product leadership in HCI making sure we continue to be leaders there investing in network fixes and really treating cloud as a first class citizen extending everything that we do into a hybrid and multi-cloud world. And as we do that there's an opportunity for us to also simplify our packaging and our solutions in terms of how we can take all of this to market and then I think we continue the focus and shift to subscription like we've been talking about and making sure we get to the other end of that journey as a renewal packaging and we built this efficient renewals engine and we have talked earlier also about discipline the focus on cost management and driving to free cash flow break even and again the last but not the least is to really leverage our channel partners and strategic partnerships because that's what's going to give us leverage in the market. Sure, sure, Duston. In fact on that point, I think with respect to efficiency, it's really around sales and marketing efficiency largely. I feel that we are pretty good in terms of where we are at on the R&D side and remain at the slightly look at REIT inducting some of that the newer areas, but when you look at sales and marketing let's start first with marketing. In fact COVID has been a blessing in some form, because it forced us to go virtual. But I think if that has taught us a bit of tremendous efficiencies to be gained by growing virtual, whether it be with virtual events and our demand generation being more digital and therefore far more efficient and better ROI on our cost and what we spend there. And then more recently we've been introducing Test Drive, which is a feature that allows customers to try our offerings in the cloud and convert there from just trying it to actually buying. And so there people have used Test Drive, the conversion ratios have been much higher than place they haven't. So all of these put together are starting to make our marketing more efficient in -- and even in this post-COVID world, as we come out of it, that's number one. Number two on the sales side. The fundamental thesis here is that we are still largely doing new ACV deals. Our term license renewals are still very, very early in their lifecycle. As renewal start kicking in, we are in the process of building an efficient renewal engines here, where the cost is going to be much lower than the cost of sale for new customer acquisition of new ACV. So that should fundamentally help the sales side of this from an OpEx perspective as well. And we'll talk more about these by the way at our Investor Day in June. Thank you. Yes, I think there is no doubt in the market that our customers are going to live in a multi-cloud world. Now I think it's equally clear that on-prem is not going away. Again Gartner forecast by the way with our on-prem HCI infrastructure. And they are saying that the market will grow at 16% over the next five years. And that doesn't really include multi-cloud as much, right? So we still see a lot of growth just purely in on-prem, but we are not stopping there. They are investing and making all our products really had a cloud customer -- first mentality. You saw some of our recent announcement side with Clusters, we are extending our core product offering, so that customers can buy a single license from us and use that to deploy workloads anywhere they want, whether it'd be in the public cloud of their choice or in their on-prem infrastructure. With some of the recent announcements that we saw with objects and files, any type of storage offering that we provide has natural steering into the public cloud, right? So fundamentally, we are -- we have a long-term play here in terms of helping our customers operate in this multi-cloud world. And that I think is the long-term sustainable advantage that we have. Yes, I'll give you some color and then Duston can add on as well on top of this. So look first of all having a broader solution with a differentiated multi-cloud portfolio allows us to satisfy more of our customer needs and drive increased demand right? Beyond just selling core HCI, so these emerging products are starting to mature very nicely and many of them saw record billings this quarter. The top emerging products which quarter were Era, Files and Flow. And all of them have strong attached to our core product platform. So for example, flow, if security, right? So when people are deploying our core platform they will deploy security with it. File have just file storage, right? And that comes as part of the platform. Era actually preference a significant new opportunity on top, because now we are going up the management of database, and that can help us insert and find customers -- new customers that haven't used the core Nutanix platform in the past. So these emerging products in some cases can actually help us open new accounts and when new deals in other cases, they are attached to our existing Nutanix core platform. Duston do you want to add any color? Yes, at this point, I think the greatest opportunity really lies with further deepening and developing the partnerships that we have already. And I'll break that across three categories, we've got OEM partners, HP, Lenovo, and many others there. Then we've got an emerging set of cloud partners like Azure that we talked about we are also an AWS bare metal. And then our ecosystem of technology partners, who are crucial, for example, Citrix, it's a key technology partner there, right? For all of burst in desktop workloads. We talked about this large deal that we won this quarter together, which was really Citrix, Nutanix and HP, all coming together to deliver the solution. And with all of these partners, I think we've got room to also continue to accelerate our go-to-market. Google is one of the partner, right? They're core selling desktop-as-a-service with Google and again, but Google ain't selling on top of our stack that would be a technology ecosystem type of partnership. So I think with each of these, like I said, across OEM partners, cloud partners and ecosystem, technology partners, we've got more room to be building solutions taking these solutions together to market. Thank you. Yes, I mean, Alex, you are definitely heading in the right direction there. With Test Drive that is exactly what we're trying to do with this, it's a zero touch self service for prospective customers, right. So it allows them to really go out there and tried out for themselves and that reduces our need to go, do a high touch selling process with them, right? When they're engaged by themselves and then from then on, we would like to take what they see in Test Drive and then convert that to a sales right there, right over time. It's still early days for us, but that is exactly the promise. Now [indiscernible] we can take this, I mean, for simpler offering so I think this will work now for complex solution sales they're going to actually have to do a lot of hands on selling as well. So we expect that, I think this is again a great way for us to get more efficient over time with our sales. Yes. Thanks, James. So on that it's going to be around solutions and use cases for customers. So for example, you could, I mean, as we've talked about here virtual desktops and enabling remote users. That's clearly a use case for which a specific subset of our portfolio comes together to deliver that as a solution for them. Mission critical workloads, if you're going to run databases and manage databases then Era running on top of our core AOS, AHV, right? Together with management is a good solution set for that. So we're going to be focused on examples and solution sets like that, that tied directly to what customers are buying. If a customer is buying a hybrid cloud and they are looking at our journey to the hybrid cloud, then it will be AOS, AHV with clusters. So that's how we plan to package it. Thank you James. No, I think you covered, that the only thing I'll add there also if again what we talked about earlier in the call about portfolio of solution aligning our solutions will also help drive sales productivity increase [indiscernible] it's products industrial things, right? It helps upsize the deal and sell a broader portfolio. And second, it makes consumption by the customer review. That's particularly not new, right. I mean, that's always been the case there. What I would say is look as the competition is always good for a customer. I feel good about where we are independent of anything happening at competition. Gartner is showing us increasing our market share year-over-year to roughly about 50% of the market. IDC shows us in the number one market share position. I do agree with the pieces that HCI is a foundational platform for hybrid cloud. And I think that's an industrywide statement not just a Nutanix statement. And from that perspective, as long as we continue to focus on delivering the best solutions and the best outcome for our customers, I think we will do just fine from a competitive perspective at that point. Sure. Go ahead Rod. Yes, And I think clearly, Rod as you indicate, we had historical strength and what I would say a medium smaller enterprises. I think that's our sweet spot. But we've also penetrated a good amount of the global -- a large customers as well, right? We count like 950 of the top 2000 global as customers. But what I would say is that these larger customers, if we are more focused on winning specific use cases, like we are not quite there yet in terms of being able to say we are the platform of choice for everything, although we would like to get there. So with these global, for example, yes the wins that we highlighted this quarter was okay large global complex environment, but very focused on virtual desktops and remote users. Now one thing [indiscernible] there and we are actually used, then we see opportunities to build the footprint, right? Go, what I would say one use case at a time. So that's why I think about it, I think, we've got a lots of under penetration here in the market penetration opportunities in the market. But you're right, I mean, there is -- and there are other players in the market, they're going to have to go earn our way into these customers. And then, what I would also say is, there are some areas where we are able to come in at the top, for example Era and Database Management represents the potential to go in, it's a fairly unique solution in the marketplace and we're able to go use that as a way to get into new customers. Yes, I think on the first one we covered it little earlier. I see an opportunity to really being more of these products together, right? Our portfolio has grown quite a bit over the past few years. It's no longer [indiscernible] ALS and AHV which are our core HCI platform. But we've got management around that, we've got networking and security around that, we've got Files and Optics, we've got disaster recovery. And so, and then we've got frame as for desktop-as-a-service and then we've got Era. So they brought portfolio as you can see, and then we have -- at containers with carbon, for example. So what I see, you mentioned of trying to sell each of these products as an individual product in the market. There is an opportunity to put these together into a solution, if somebody is deploying a cloud native workload, okay, I mentioned virtual desktops. Now let's talk about cloud native, whereas carbon plus, iOS plus AHV is a platform with object storage that makes sense for somebody deploying a cloud native workloads. And by packaging that together and making it easy for our customer to consume that becomes more of a turnkey solution. So we see that kind of packaging for specific use cases that I think we can go drive and simplify in the market. What was part two of the question, sorry, could you repeat that? Yes, largely I would say, it's -- I think pleasantly surprised actually on the upside, there's still a ton of talent, the very strong talent in the company, very strong, very passionate talent. And the team has done a lot with resources, limited resources, especially on the product and the portfolio side. So that's been a pleasant upward surprise for me and it's a really good, it makes me feel good about the strength of the product portfolio going forward. And then, no surprise, I do realize there is a lot of work ahead for us in terms of making this journey to subscription and they're very focused on execution on that front as we've been saying all along."

            "content": "Thank you Rajiv. Our sales team executed quite well in Q2 amidst an uncertain macro environment and our ongoing ACV transition. Comparable to the quarter before last quarter we provided guidance that took into consideration the uncertain macro environment we are operating in and clearly we outperformed our expectations for the quarter while at the same time adding to our backlog. As we look forward our thesis for the business continues to be proven out that an ACV first focus will gradually compress term lengths leading to better deal economics and a shorter time to more efficient low-cost renewals. As the mix of our low-cost renewals increases as a percent of our total business we believe it will eventually add significant leverage to our go-to-market cost structure. We are also seeing the result of our ACV based sales compensation plan putting a renewed focus on sales of emerging products which typically have shorter term lengths. I have previously shared that we expected term lengths which compress slightly in Q2. Our Q2 average term length was 3.4 decreasing by 0.1 and down slightly from 3.5 years in Q1. We are also pleased with the overall deal economics in Q2. We build a record amount of subscription renewals during the quarter and while the sample size is still relatively small and we are still early in the process we are encouraged by the retention rates that we are currently seeing. We continue to sign an increasing number of one-year deals. These deals will add to the pool of low-cost renewals available to renew in FY \u201822. As we previously noted we had an outstanding quarter related to our emerging products with most of those individual products generating record ACV. Emerging products continued to play an important role in improving our deal economics during the quarter, so in summary based on our strong execution in Q2 our thesis for the business continue to play out as expected. As we move into the second half of our fiscal year we remain very encouraged with our progress to-date. Now I will move on to some specific Q2 financial highlights. In Q2, we had record new ACV, renewal ACV and total ACV. ACV billings were $159 million reflecting 14% growth year-over-year significantly above our guidance range of $145 million to $148 million. Run rate ACV as of the end of Q1 was $1.38 billion growing 28% year-over-year compared to our guidance of approximately 25% growth. Revenue was $346 million essentially flat from Q2, 20 driven by a 0.5 year decrease in average term length versus Q2, \u201820. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 rose to 82.7% versus our guidance of 81.5%. Operating expenses were $354 million down 11% year-over-year and less than our guidance of $360 million to $370 million. We continued to benefit from overall spending reductions including go-to-market efficiencies. Our non-GAAP net loss was $74 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.37 per share. We also saw a good year-over-year increase in our pipeline in the quarter as well as continued improvement in overall pipeline quality. Our linearity in Q2 was outstanding resulting in one of our most linear quarters ever. Our free cash flow for Q2 was aided by good linearity coming in at negative $28 million. This performance was significantly better than our expectations. DSOs in Q2 were 45 days down from 54 days in Q1, \u201821 also driven by good linearity and we closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of 1.29 billion down slightly $1.32 billion in Q1 \u201821. Now turning to our Q3, \u201821 guidance. The guidance for Q3 is as follows. ACV billings to be between $150 million and $155 million representing year-over-year growth of 11% to 15%. Gross margin of approximately 81%. Operating expenses between $365 million and $370 million representing a year-over-year decline of 5% to 6%. Weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 207 million. Now a few modeling assumptions our guidance for Q3 continues to have a small conservative bias based on the ongoing uncertain macro environment. As we communicated last quarter in similar to the seasonality we have experienced over the last two years our Q3 guidance anticipates a slight seasonal decrease in ACV billings in Q3 versus Q2 while at the same time reflecting year-over-year growth of 11% to 15% and a raise of 5% to 8% from the current [straight] estimates. Based on the Q3, ;'1 ACV billings guidance we expect run rate ACV to continue its strong growth trend and grow in the mid 20% range year-over-year. We believe we are now to the point in our transition that we will not see dramatic quarter-over-quarter change in term lengths with terms fluctuating by 0.1 or so per quarter going forward. As term length begins to stabilize we expect reported year-over-year revenue growth to move closer to ACV billings growth over time. We also expect our operating expenses for fiscal \u201821 to now come in up with the $50 million less than what we spent in the prior fiscal year. From a free cash flow perspective liner in Q3 is typically not liner strong which we experienced in Q2 and therefore expect our cash uses to increase in Q3. Our Q3 case uses will most likely approach our current [indiscernible] expenses numbers for Q3. We are pleased with our overall cash management efforts especially in the light of compressing terms and continue to exceed our internal plan set forth at the beginning of the fiscal year. And finally to help with your modeling we continue to include in our earnings presentation located on our IR website our historical trends for ACV billings, run rate ACV, billings term length and a bridge on how to model and convert our current and future ACV billings guidance to total billings. We will continue to include this level of detail through the end of FY \u201821. With that operator could you please open up the call for questions? Thank you. Sure. Yes, as you mentioned, we talked about this last earnings call. If you look at the last two Q3's there was a decline for roughly 4% to 8% in those quarters. And if you look at this decline, it's roughly 3% to 6% decline, but coming off a very big Q2, obviously and something that outpaced our expectations, but I think we set back and just look at the guidance itself, a, we came off a big Q2, we messaged this last quarter so it's completely within what we expected. The guide delivers 11% to 15% year-over-year growth, it increases the consensus on the high-end by $12 million or so, it's a 5% to 8% raise. If you look below the bottom line, there is -- or below the topline there's additional gross profit dollars that we will be delivered when you do your math for your model, revenue will go up, expenses will come down $15 million -- $10 million to $15 million from consensus and the operating loss, again we do your math will be substantially less than the consensus there. So we feel really good about delivering the guide that we did, we feel really good about Q2. And we feel really good how we're progressing and exiting Q2 with our backlog position. So when you add all that up, I think it's a pretty strong guide and then something that we feel pretty comfortable [indiscernible]. On the first part there, Kat. It's a combination of both. Clearly, we've been benefited from obviously lack of travel and things like that. And travel will come back over time, I don't think we'll ever spend again as much on travel as we have in the past, we've learned that we can do things differently, we've learned that we can do things much more efficient. But having said all that, I think we've got a great opportunity and Rajiv will talk about this going forward. There is clearly a different view on operating expenses and focusing now really on efficiency. If you look at the last three years outside of -- but take FY '20, which was, kind of, a COVID year, but the three -- this current year, if you look at the three prior years, we grew expenses about 35% on average year-over-year for a three-year period. So we've got a lot of resources. Now the focus is, how do we get those resources more efficient? How do we get the go-to market model more efficient, and that's what Rajiv has brought to the table here and there'll be not only for this year, but I'm trusting for FY '22 and FY '23 you will see a renewed focus on that. And maybe Rajiv you want to follow that up a little bit. Yes. No, it's a good point. When I was mentioning there is 0.1 or so per quarter. And then you're kind of there at your 3.0, so I still think 3.0 could it be 2.8, it could be 3.1 somewhere around there. I think it begins to stabilize. But I think the main point there is from everything we know now, there shouldn't be drastic changes quarter-over-quarter from a term perspective, and you kind of saw a little bit in Q1, but federal kind of did that initial push there. And I think it could be flat, maybe this quarter or whatever, but I just think in general, it's probably a point one or so here per quarter going forward. So I think your 3 is still in the ballpark. No, I think you covered really well there. I think that's [indiscernible]. Yes, I mean, you always get pieces of budget flush, but I don't think we saw really thing unusual there whatsoever. We had many large deals in the pipeline. The question was when those we're going to close or not close? And I'm not sure really year-end budget \"flush\", I mean those were planned out in advance and things like that. So from that perspective I would label it is any different than the normal. Yes, on the split. We haven't actually talked about the split specifically on an ACV basis. On a TCV basis, we've talked about renewals 10%, 11%, 12% range, and which really is the leverage, where Gartners leverage as a percent of TCV from a P&L perspective. So from macro, so it's still pretty small now, we're still in FY '21 as you get into FY '22 certainly into FY '23 that profile changes and that's what we've been talking about for quite some time. And then we would hope at Investor Day that we start giving you some really good views on our perspective of those renewal flows. Now we have a couple of quarters under above, we're starting to understand retention rates a little bit, we know when things are up for renewal. Obviously, I think, it would be really good to start providing the investment community little insight there to what we think from renewals, the percent of ACV, the percent of TCV. And more importantly, try to give you a view of the cost profile between new and upsell and renewals. So that is kind of a TBD something we're working on now, and which we expect to have a more wholesome discussion during Investor Day. On the productivity side, I'll let Rajiv chime in here too. But the answer is, we should be able to get quite a bit more productivity of the existing sales force. There is really no reason for that perspective, Chris has done a good job of trying to hire the right people, and once you hire those people to enable them to sell in our environment to make sure they have the right coverage, whether that's account base or geography base or vertical base. So that's ongoing and getting more leverage as Rajiv said from partners and things like that. So our view, I mean, which we are massively focused on now [efficiency] is too would do exactly that get more productivity out of the existing sales force here. So, Rajiv, you might want to add a couple of thought there too. Yes, on the linearity in the DSOs, we've always had I think good DSOs, we've always had good efforts there. They've never really gotten out of control and in any way there. So they've always been great now at, I think it was about 45 days or whatever. This quarter, it's not going to stay there, Rod, there was a really good linear quarter, if you look at past Q3's, it's just the way Q3s goal. It's just not going to be as linear now we'll do the best obviously and will go collect as much as we can and ship as linear as possible. But that's not going to continue like it was in Q2. Now the early indications for Q3 is that linearity is, kind of, going as expected. So there is nothing out of bounds there, when we look at Q3 from that perspective. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question? Well, it always comes down to execution, right? At the end of the day and execution has improved. There is no doubt that every quarter execution gets better and that comes with discipline and it comes with pipeline management and that comes with having good pipe and not only the amount of pipe, but the quality of pipe. And we've seen the quality of the pipeline, go up a fair amount and then you layer on top of that, the ACV based comp that give sales reps a lot more optionality, if you will, to go maneuver things and things like that. So I think it's a broad reasoning, but it always starts with execution."

We hope to connect with many of you there.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dheeraj. Dheeraj?\nDheeraj Pandey: Thank you, Tonya, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a very good quarter, positioning us well for the rest of fiscal. While Duston will go into more details on the financials, the headline is that we outperformed across all our key metrics. ACV billings were 14% ahead of the midpoint of our guidance and consensus. And notably, Q1 was our best ACV bookings quarter ever, the pandemic notwithstanding. In addition, we delivered strong gross margins, EPS and free cash flow performance.  We are delighted with our continued progress, and it is great to look back on our journey over the last 3 years and see how far w ehave come, our product thesis of a hybrid and multi-cloud future built on top of our industry-leading hyperconverged infrastructure, the HCI of last decade, combined with an ambitious transition to a cloud-like subscription business model, is bearing fruit. Well, there's more to do. So, the hardest work is behind us, and I'm proud and grateful for what we have collectively accomplished to date.  There were a number of factors that contributed to our Q1 performance. First, our ACV-based sales compensation strategy delivered positive benefits to our business. In Q1, our average contract term shortened. And as a result of the shift, we saw lower overall discounting and we sold more new products, all while driving significant run rate ACV growth of 29% year-over-year at a $1.3 billion scale.  Next, as I mentioned, we saw strong adoption of our new products on top of growth in our core software. On a rolling 4-quarter basis, our new product attach rate during Q1 was 35%, up 7 percentage points from a year ago. In fact, new ACV for new products grew 87% year-over-year and 27% quarter-over-quarter. Within our newer products, we saw particularly good momentum with our data center solutions, Files and Flow, as well as DevOps and database-as-a-service solutions, our Calm and Era. Notably, a significant number of new product deals also included more licenses for our core software, proving our thesis that as we drive demand for our new products, we also drive demand for our core software, which is the foundation for our hybrid cloud infrastructure, the new HCI of this decade. Demand for our solutions was consistent across all our geographies and many verticals, including federal, which had a good quarter as expected, owing to the seasonality of the U.S. government's fiscal year-end. The Fed sector also had a number of 1-year contract duration deals contributing to the reduction of average contract durations in the quarter, which Duston will address in more detail.  As always, our customer journeys are the best ways to speak of the quarter. A customer win during the quarter that combined many of the themes I've discussed was with one of the largest and oldest financial services firms in the world providing investment management, servicing and administration. This existing customer, which has spent more than $20 million in lifetime spent another $1.7 million in ACV to expand their private cloud. We also had a very similar story with one of the largest power companies in Japan, which has spent upwards of $15 million lifetime digitizing their desktops and filers with our software stack, spending another $1.8 million in ACV in Q1. Our strong results were also driven by our go-to-market momentum in the area of cloud. Specifically, the successful launch of our ACV sales compensation plan, together with effective sales enablement and training around ACV benefits. In addition, our sales teams have done an excellent job of improving the quality of the sales process by building a robust pipeline even during COVID-19, working closely with partners and adopting a multi-product and multi-workload sale approach. The channel continues to play an extremely important role in how we help evolve our customer journey.  To that end, we announced a simplified channel program to deliver even more profitability and an accelerated road map to help partners embrace the cloud business model. Additionally, we made meaningful improvements to Nutanix University, our education arm. The program now provides more certifications across new skill levels in technolog fracks to increase the stickiness of Nutanix software and overall consumption of our technology. We quadrupled participation in this program in the past year with over 38,000 learners and counting. Our on-prem partnerships with HPE, Dell, Lenovo and others continue to be an important part of our strategy for offering freedom of choice to our customers. In fact, we had our best quarter-to-date with HPE in new ACV as well as meaningful new customer acquisition.  A great example of a new customer we gained during this quarter is a large European furniture retailer who selected our core software, database-as-a-service solution, Era and automation software, Calm. We plan to implement a fully automated distributed cloud solution that will reduce IT implementation time from weeks to days with no IT staff on site, especially as they navigate the pandemic.  Speaking on the pandemic and digital transformation, it has helped accelerate. For the past several quarters, we have become a meaningfully digital marketing organization. Test drive, 0 touch self-service or prospects continues to provide distinctive top of the funnel engagement and has been shown to shorten sales cycles while delivering the highest conversion rate of all of our marketing programs. We also continue to hold virtual events globally. And in Q1, we held the largest event ever, virtual in person in our company's history. Our 100% virtual.next-gen had record attendance of over [indiscernible] customers and partners. And is on track to deliver strong pipeline generation in the quarter at a significantly lower cost than in person events.  Let me also share with you how we are morphing from being a pioneer in on-prem hyperconverged infrastructure to being an authentic hybrid cloud infrastructure, the new HCI company. During the quarter, we announced the general availability of clusters, our HCI on AWS. We also announced a significant partnership with Microsoft to bring our product portfolio on to Azure. This partnership substantially evolves our company's strategy, enabling us to provide solutions that will deliver seamless application, data and license mobility, including a singular experience in management across all clouds. This is a major competitive advantage as we become the foremost infrastructure software company with a bring your own license approach to help our customers in the hybrid computing journey.  As we've stated in the past, the availability of Nutanix clusters on AWS also offers new benefits, including extending the simplicity and ease of use of our software to the public cloud. This represents a significant step forward in realizing our vision to make computing invisible anywhere by delivering a unified fabric across multiple clouds, public or private. A financial services institution in the APJ region is an example of a new customer who purchased clusters on AWS during the quarter in a 1-year contract. They selected Nutanix to help support their growing test and dev needs for services to their clients, and Nutanix cluster in AWS provides them with the flexibility and frictionless migration to any cloud they require.  We continue to innovate both our core platform and new products in the quarter. This includes new capabilities to our core software platform as well as the launch of our Kubernetes-based PaaS solution, platform-as-a-service, and significant updates to our database-as-a-service solution, Era. As subscription business models continue to underscore the need for consumption and renewals, our product reliability and outstanding customer service continue to be a big driver of our loyalty and repeat business. For the seventh year in a row, we were awarded the NorthFace ScoreBoard award from CRMI in recognition of our customer centricity. And because of our sustained excellence for having won this award for more than 5 years, we also confirmed the NorthFace Summit Class award, which is a rare honor.  Finally, as we think about our performance relative to our future opportunity, I'd like to talk briefly about our addressable markets and how they continue to grow and evolve. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 80% of organizations will be using hyperconverged solutions, doubling from 40% in 2020. We've been encouraged to see that IT spending has held up despite the pandemic as companies prioritize modernization with private public clouds, hands-free automation and remote work and business continuity projects. This is validated by the results for out third annual Enterprise Cloud Index, which we launched last week. Across 3,400 IT professionals around the world, 46% of respondents said they increased their hybrid investments as a result of the pandemic. Global IT teams are planning substantial infrastructure changes and collectively see hybrid cloud deployments, increasing 37 percentage points over the next 5 years. In short, these trends provide a powerful tailwind in the lift and shift to cloud, both private and public.  With that, let me hand it over to Duston. Duston?\nDuston Williams: Thank you, Dheeraj. Going into the quarter, we provided guidance that took into consideration both an uncertain macro environment and our transition to an ACV-based sales compensation model. We clearly outperformed our expectations and are very pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year. As we enter FY '21, our overall thesis for the business going forward is centered on the following: our industry-leading product set that seamlessly enables on-prem, off-prem and the convergence of both remains the best and most elegant solution in the marketplace. Next, new products will continue to drive the growth of our core HCI offering by further extending our solution to address new opportunities that were previously out of reach with our core solution alone. Optionality truly matters to our customers and prospects and offering subscription options with variable terms and their corresponding flexibility will continue to add significant optionality, which in turn leads to additional ACV growth. Our ACV-first focus will ultimately strengthen our business model via term compression leading to lower discounting, better deal economics accelerated ACV growth in a shorter time to more efficient renewals. And finally, we expect our go-to-market execution will continue to show improvement and this, combined with a market-leading solution, ultimately becomes a very powerful combination for ACV growth going forward.  The business thesis set forth above clearly played out in Q1. During the quarter, our core product continued to perform very well with new customer ACV bookings, representing 23% of total ACV bookings. We also added about 680 net new customers in the quarter, despite the ongoing macro uncertainties related to COVID. Linearity was also very good during Q1. We generated a record amount of new pipeline, and we also added a substantial amount of ACV backlog compared to a typical usage of backlog in previous Q1s. As you may recall, during our Q4 earnings call, it was our belief that our ACV-based sales comp would put a renewed focus on new product sales, and not surprisingly, new products performed very well in Q1.  As Dheeraj noted, we had a record quarter of new ACV related to our new products with Calm, Era, Files, Flow and Objects, all delivering record ACV quarters. New products also played a role in improving our deal economics during the quarter. Furthermore, the benefit of subscription optionality clearly came into play during the quarter with more customers opting for the budget flexibility of 1-year deals. Our outperformance on 1-year deals in Q1 has added an incremental $20 million to $25 million to the renewals pool, that will come up in Q1 FY '22, which is over and above our previous plan. We expect these renewals to be more predictable and transacted at significantly less cost compared to our new and upsell business, which will drive leverage in our model.  As we look ahead, we are very optimistic about the setup for the balance of the fiscal year. In Q1, we experienced lower discounting that resulted in better deal economics, as well as some term compression, all as we expected. The specifics around the actual Q1 term compression also mirrored our previously communicated expectations, specifically that our new ACV-based sales comp plan with compressed terms and we would see a shift from 5-year deals to more 3-year and 1-year deals. And when terms did compress, existing customers would not experience any significant term compression, while new customers would potentially see larger amounts of term compression.  In Q1, average contract term decreased to 3.5 years compared to 3.8 years in Q4 '20, which was somewhat lower than our expectations. Federal completed several large 1-year deals, which contributed to the average decrease. Since our federal business is usually a much smaller percentage of our total business in Q2 versus Q1, we do not expect the federal business to have the same level of impact on average term in Q2. While we do not plan to disclose this level of detail every quarter, average contract term of existing customers, ex-renewals, decreased by one-tenth of a year, while average contract term of new customers declined by six-tenths of a year. Lastly, our go-to-market is showing consistent execution as evidenced by our top line outperformance over the last few quarters. Although we only have one quarter under our belt in FY '21, we are very encouraged with our progress to date.  Now, I'll move on to some specific Q1 financial highlights. ACV billings were $138 million, reflecting 10% growth year-over-year, well above our guidance range of $118 million to $121 million. Run rate ACV as of the end of Q1 was $1.29 billion, growing 29% year-over-year compared to our guidance of at least 20% growth.  Revenue, which as expected, was impacted by decreased average term length, was $313 million, down 1% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 81.9% versus our guidance of 81%. Operating expenses were $341 million, down 12% year-over-year and versus our guidance of $350 million to $360 million. End user computing, as a percent of total business was flat versus Q4 '20 as the spike in demand we saw at the beginning of COVID moderated.  During the quarter, we completed our previously announced $125 million stock buyback. We purchased 5.175 million shares at an average price of $24.15 per share. As a reminder, the stock buyback was executed with the intention of offsetting the additional dilution that we will incur related to the PIK, or paid-in-kind interest feature on the Bain convertible notes. Our non-GAAP net loss was $89 million for the quarter, or a loss of $0.44 per share.  Our free cash flow for Q1, which was aided by very good linearity was negative $16 million. This performance was significantly better than our internal expectations. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.32 billion versus $720 million in Q4 '20. The Q1 cash total includes $750 million from the Bain convertible note, less expenses and the $125 million stock buyback. And DSOs in Q1 were 54 days versus 68 days in Q4 '20, also driven by good linearity.  Now turning to our Q2 '21 guidance. ACV billings to be between $145 million and $148 million, representing year-over-year growth of 4% to 6%. Gross margin of approximately 81.5%. Operating expenses between $360 million and $370 million, representing year-over-year decline of 7% to 9%. Weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $202 million.  Now a few modeling assumptions. Our guidance for Q2 includes a slightly negative COVID impact, as we continue to be cautious in the light of the second and third waves of COVID that could create additional macro uncertainty. On a bookings basis, the implied year-over-year growth rate of our Q2 '21 ACV is expected to be substantially higher as we consumed backlog in Q2 '20. As a reminder, similar to what we have experienced over the last two years, we would expect Q3 to exhibit sequential seasonality, which suggests a slight decrease in ACV billings in Q3 versus Q2. And based on the Q2 '21 ACV billings guidance, we would expect run rate ACV to continue its strong growth trend and grow approximately 25% year-over-year. We are projecting a slight decrease in term length in Q2 compared to 3.5 years in Q1.  From a free cash flow perspective, we are not currently expecting Q2 linearity to mirror that of Q1, and therefore, we expect our cash usage to increase in Q2. Regardless of the exact amount of cash usage in Q2, we would expect free cash flow for the first half of FY '21 to exceed our internal plan set forth at the beginning of the fiscal year. While we maintain our focus on go-to-market efficiencies and we continue to benefit from lower travel costs, as we have previously communicated, we anticipate fiscal '21 operating expenses to be flat to slightly higher than last year as we continue to grow and invest in the business.  And finally, as we did last quarter to help with your modeling, included in our earnings presentation located on our IR website, our historical trends for ACV billings, run rate ACV, billings term length and a bridge how to model and convert our current and future ACV billings guidance to total billings.  With that, I'd like to pass it back to Dheeraj for additional remarks before we take questions. Thank you.\nDheeraj Pandey: Thanks, Duston. I want to close this quarter's earnings call with a thank you to everyone who has participated in the journey to get where we are now. We're extremely encouraged with the progress in the last 3 years of our business model transformation. While we still have work to do, these results demonstrate the power of the subscription thesis. Our Board continues to make progress on the CEO search. We look forward to updating you when we have meaningful news.  Personally, it has been a journey of a lifetime to serve our customers and partners, working alongside mutants, as we call our employees. With a future-proof business model, a customer base that fundamentally values reliability and a technology portfolio that has such a strong product market fit, our best is yet to come. This is the decade to watch for a company that's so value simple, secure and seamless.  Now we'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair.\nJason Ader: My question is on the ACV transition. And it seems like maybe there were a little bit of surprises, but if you could just talk about, broadly speaking, what surprised you? What didn't surprise you? And why you did better than you expected?\nDuston Williams: Yes. I'll take a shot, and Dheeraj, feel free to jump in here, too. Jason, I would say there was very few, if any, real surprises. I think we had a -- which we talked about, we had an opinion and view going into Q1. And pretty much all those views played out as planned. We thought terms would decrease. We thought they decreased more in new customers, less on existing customers. We thought that, that would lead to higher deal economics. Deal economics improved. Optionality, we knew mattered. And it mattered not only for our customers, but for our sales reps because they have more tools now to offer as they go attack their quotas. So I can't really think of anything. Yes, it was maybe 1/10 lower or so in the terms than we expected, but that's not an exact science anyway. So there was just very little surprises that we hadn't thought through, quite honestly.  And I think the ACV from -- certainly from a sales comp, I think, played out better than probably we anticipated. And I think everybody has kind of rallied around that. And optionality, again, matters. And you saw what it delivered for a quarter and a good guide for Q2.\nJason Ader: And the demand environment was better than you expected?\nDuston Williams: Well, based on record pipeline, we were pretty pleased with -- especially in this environment. Obviously, it's not perfect. And the economy is not humming at full 100%, they impacted here. Yes, I think we were pretty pleased overall from that perspective, too.\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. And I think the only thing I'll add to that, Jason and Duston is how -- very much like federal was for us early on in 2011 through 2015, I think the federal business with ACV has really embraced this. And we kind of knew it when we were going into it that O&M is going to be our friend because a lot of cyclical spenders, operations and maintenance, where to keep it under the radar in terms of spend and budgeting. So it turned out to be a great quarter for federal. Part of it is upon the 1-year deals that Duston talked about.  Maybe the other pleasant surprise has been how our salespeople embraced it to really think that this makes them a lot more competitive than selling 3-, 5-, 7-year deals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: A couple of questions from me. First of all, from a sales capacity. How do you guys think about the evolution of the capacity going forward, just given that renewal activity is now going to be done on an annual basis instead of a multiyear basis. So more time from sales capacity standpoint would be dedicated to renewals than new business. How do you think about the evolution of capacity? Does that mean you need to hire aggressively again on that front in order to create more new customer capacity?\nDuston Williams: So, I -- sure. Go ahead, Dheeraj.\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. So, I think the field reps are all focused on land and expand, which is all new ACV-focused. Now they will get a ding if we didn't get the renewal. But all in all, we expect them to be really focused on land and expand. All of their customer success team, which is all on the inside, on the phone that's really doing adopt and renew and that's how they are going to be comped as well.\nDuston Williams: Yes. No, what I'd add to that, Ittai, is that the whole thesis around this -- one of the main premise here around the move to ACV is leverage, right? And that's the exact point, all the renewal will not take aggressive hiring, right? Because that's going to be handled predominantly by a separate team. Now we have to go build up that separate team. But all these renewals will not be one-for-one sales rep adds. So that's where pretty much any subscription business gets a lot of their leverage. We just haven't had the renewals flow in yet. And you saw the impact from just the acceleration of 1-year deals in the quarter. We've added $20 million, $25 million to the pool in Q1 '21 -- '22. And that's not going to require new reps to go attack that. So that's the premise of the ACV move.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, maybe just then on that topic, clearly, you've done very well in cutting the contract term quite aggressively in the quarter. I guess it was just a little bit of outperformance there. But does this help you make you perhaps think differently about where is your long-term steady state from a term standpoint? Or the pace by which you can get there?\nDuston Williams: Not dramatically. Federal played a role in some of the term compression in Q1. They won't be the same percent of the business in Q2. So there's some offsetting factors there. We've got this view of kind of low 3-year average somewhere at the end of the fiscal year. We'll see how that plays out. I think the more that our sales reps get used to this model and maybe to start to be the more customers get used to this model, with the optionality and things like that. Maybe we see a little bit bigger, but 1 quarter is too early to give a real opinionated view, especially because how federal kind of played into this a little bit. But certainly, we're encouraged from what we've seen from the first quarter anyway.\nDheeraj Pandey: And there's going to be opposing forces as well. The large enterprises kind of places like Japan, they're probably still going to be longer term. Some of our very large customers are still longer term. And then you look at federal and commercial on the other side, that will go shorter term. So I think it's going to be a healthy yin-yang between these two.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Alex Kurtz of KeyBanc.\nAlexander Kurtz: I had a question, but I want to start with a clarification. Duston, on the contract duration target that three you just threw out, was at the end of fiscal '22 you were targeting?\nDuston Williams: Well, I was mentioning low -- again, we've got 1 quarter, but what I was referencing there, kind of in the low 3s at the end of fiscal '21.\nAlexander Kurtz: And do you think there's a chance that given what you saw with the wonder opportunities that this thing could dip below 3 at some point in fiscal '22 or too early to tell?\nDuston Williams: It's too early to tell, but we've got -- as Dheeraj said, you've got some older school customers that still will hang and cling to 5-year deals, too. So I think, again, 1 quarter, it's just too early to tell, but we're encouraged of everything that kind of we thought was going to happen pretty much happened. But give us another quarter and we'll give another, I think, a better opinion.\nDheeraj Pandey: I just want to say that we'll be able to go and tweak this, depending on how much cash we need to collect as well based on simple sales incentives and such as well as part of sales compensation. So we're not overly worried. We feel like now we have a great architecture in place. And we can go and tweak the way we want it.\nAlexander Kurtz: I appreciate that, Dheeraj. The question to you about the person to replace you over the -- when that decision happened, there's been a lot of discussions with investors about what the right profile would look like and capabilities and experience. And now that you're a little bit into this process, maybe you could share your vision about the person that would take over your role as CEO? And what you would like to see that person bring to the table? I know you touched on it last quarter, if you could expand, I think that would be very helpful.\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. I think the big piece is, how do you balance the short-term and the long-term because you can't overdo one or the other, you have to be strategy-focused, be able to look around the corner because computing is an industry that's changing so fast that you can't take your eyes off the strategy ball. Basically, someone who can embrace process people, technology and product. So I think we've gotten some great candidates in the pipeline. And we definitely would like the relevance of the infrastructure to be there. There's a lot of people out there with the business software space. We're looking at quite a few people in infrastructure as well. And I think, all in all, somebody who has a 3- to 5-year view and a vision would be very, very important, especially for our sales engineers, our developers, our system reliability engineers. There's a lot of engineering in the company in various different departments that also need to look up to somebody for a strategy and the public cloud landscape that's out in front of us.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jack Andrews of Needham.\nJon Andrews: Congratulations on the good start to the new fiscal year. I wanted to see if you could drill down a bit more on the new product strength that you're experiencing. You mentioned a number of products that you're seeing success with, but could you drill down on the specific types of use cases? Are they mainly DevOp-related or something else? And the related question is, are you seeing the success? Have you changed any sales incentives around new products? Or is -- do you credit the shift to ACV is helping to drive this new product attach rate?\nDheeraj Pandey: Duston, do you want me to take that? Or should you take it?\nDuston Williams: I'll let you take the use cases, Dheeraj.\nDheeraj Pandey: Okay. Cool. Yes. So first of all, we saw really good unit economics, as Duston said, because of short mid-term lens. So we're not taking money out of one pocket and putting it together. We are very, very mindful of that. New products have to fend for themselves and they have to pull-through the core. So a lot of what we [indiscernible] watch for is no financial engineering of money moving from core business to new products. I think, all in all, we saw some great traction in database-as-a-service. Again, amazing economics with large databases, Oracle, Sequel, SAP, Ethic and health care. We're seeing a ton of large database workloads, and we've made them so simple that DB is loving this new architecture, and the fact that they can drag and drop it from one cloud to another.  The other one is around unstructured data files and objects with the special containers. We're doing a really good job around that DevOps use case. And finally, desktop-as-a-service. I think there's a lot of work we've done, not just for Citrix and VMware Horizon, but also around our own brokers. So all in all, I think databases, unstructured data and desktop-as-a-service, some great use cases around that. Duston?\nDuston Williams: And then just -- yes, just on the sales comp part, for the most part, it is something spread around. But for the most part, I believe it was the help -- it was certainly helped by the move to ACV because you got to remember, now $100,000 1-year deal for a new product is the same as it was the same as a $500,000 deal that they had to go try to do on a 5-year basis. So there's clearly more optionality, I said, not only on our customers' perspective, but with the sales reps to go use these different tools from an ACV perspective and go drive additional quota retirement with smaller terms.  And I will say this played well. There's obvious little things here and there, but it played well in all regions. I mean, all regions were above quota. Which we love to see, obviously. So that kind of gives you a little bit of feel of the power of optionality to.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of James Fish of Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Just want to drill down on the change for ACV-based compensation. Can you give further color as to what you're seeing from reps? And whether this cause any additional churn to normal as your employee count and your sales and marketing down -- actually was down sequentially?\nDuston Williams: I'm sorry, Jim, on the last part of the question, was what again?\nJames Fish: Just your sales and marketing and total employee count was down sequentially. So I'm just wondering, on the change to ACV-based compensation, can you give us further color as to what you're seeing from reps? And if it caused additional churn in the quarter than normal?\nDuston Williams: Yes. I mean, churn in general within the sales organization isn't much different from what it has been over the last several quarters. Now there might have been some more selective and maybe some forced churn, the focus maybe on a little bit more software selling and things like that. But overall, the churn rates aren't significantly different. Now what Kris coders and team have done, though, in the field is they've certainly shifted to incremental leverage, how do we get more productivity out of the same reps. There's been some realignment with resources amongst regions and things like that. So that -- the real focus right now is that we have a reasonable lot of reps. How do you get them even more productive, certainly from an ACV perspective and things like that. So that's the main focus right now. We won't add a significant amount of reps this fiscal year.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Matt Hedberg of RBC.\nDaniel Bergstrom: It's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. So Dheeraj, you mentioned clusters in the prepared remarks. Just curious around early use case for early adopters there? Are customers looking for that, the elasticity on demand bursting, mobility across clouds or optionality around the operating model? Just any thoughts around early adoption or what you're hearing from customers?\nDheeraj Pandey: Absolutely. Yes, I just want to have everybody probably also draw from the whole movement of virtualization 15 years ago. A lot of the enterprises are moving from Unix servers to Intel x86. And virtualization had to find a great use case and that was test and dev. And then it became VDI at 5 years. Citrix was one of the biggest workloads for Vmware, apart from testing then in 2008 and '09 And so for us, I think we are, again, very use case focused when it comes to clusters. It's a very important piece of the puzzle is around very high I/O intensive workloads, low latency workloads, test and dev, virtual desktops. And also lift and shift, I think there's a big disaster recovery sort of initiative coming within the large enterprises as well.  And the best part about clusters is bring your own license, bring your own contract of AWS and will be the same for Azure as well. So we expect that many of these early use cases around large databases, test and dev, as you saw from one of the wins I talked about and finally, a lift and shift to the cloud.\nDaniel Bergstrom: Great. And then maybe for Duston, on the expense side. You provided some color around guidance for the quarter, for the year. From here, should we think about maybe remaining prudent on the expenses for now. But would there be a potential to maybe accelerate investment into accelerated growth? Should we start to see that on the top line further out?\nDheeraj Pandey: Duston, are you there?\nDuston Williams: I'm so sorry. Yes, just in the near to midterm, hopefully, from a top line perspective, we're going to get most of that through leverage, increased rep productivity. So you won't see some great hiring surge to get incremental ACV growth. We should be able to get reasonable lot of incremental ACV growth with most of the resources we have currently now we need to continue higher here and there or whatever. But I wouldn't clearly put it as a surge of anything like that. I mean, we've got a fair amount of resources spread throughout the regions as it is here now.  So at some point, there's some things that we've just benefited from, clearly, and everybody else has, obviously, no travel, right? So at some point, some travel will come back online. But even when -- whatever things -- whatever normal is in the future, we won't spend -- hopefully, we won't spend nearly as much travel as we had in the past just because everybody's learned how to do things differently. So first and foremost, it's leverage, rep productivity and then selective hiring as we need realignment of resources as we need and to make sure, obviously, we're taking care of customers with products and support and things like that. So that's kind of the view here over the near to midterm.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Huberty: Just coming off the strong October quarter ACV performance. Why would ACV billings growth decelerate in January, especially given what you said about the record pipeline levels, the fact that you didn't eat into backlog like you typically do in the first quarter and the successful next conference? Just some color as to why the outlook is a bit more conservative than the performance you just put in? Then I have a follow-up.\nDuston Williams: Yes. Again, we mentioned that we haven't gotten real aggressive with the Q2 outlook. We're concerned what's happening. Obviously, things are going in the wrong direction from a COVID perspective and shutdowns in second and third phases, so that's clearly encompassed in our billings. Obviously, to your point, we grew ACV billings 10% in Q1 year-over-year. We've guided 4% to 6%. Now again, though, if you look at it on a bookings basis, which we're not disclosing anymore, but that 4% to 6% growth rate is probably 2x, at least 2x there on a comparative bookings basis. So there's some pretty good growth when you look at it on a bookings base because, again, in Q2 '20, we brought -- actually used some backlog, which was a little unusual from that perspective. So I think the combination of -- on a bookings, it's quite a bit better. And again, we're a little -- again, we've got something baked in there from a COVID perspective to a certain degree.\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes, just to add to...\nKathryn Huberty: Just to that point -- I was just going to say, are you seeing anything in the month of November that would cause you to want to be more conservative on the outlook? Or is it just the news headlines and the potential for rollback of economic closings?\nDuston Williams: Yes. News. News headlines. It's not much different than our prior approach. I just think at this point, I think, to get very aggressive just doesn't make sense in this environment.\nKathryn Huberty: Sorry, Deeraj, I didn't mean to cut you off.\nDheeraj Pandey: No, sorry. I was just saying that, look, we've had 1 quarter where we understand ACV and the ACV-first strategy, but we get a second one. We understand that it would be a coincident. The third one would be a pattern. So I think next 2 quarters are going to be really important for us to learn about this ACV-first strategy.\nKathryn Huberty: Okay. And then just lastly, Duston, how do you think about from here, the time line to breakeven free cash flow? What has to happen to build confidence and in that becoming a more near-term goal?\nDuston Williams: Well, we need to get terms kind of compressed to where they're going to even out. And I don't know if that's three year, maybe a little bit above, maybe a little bit below. But we have to have that happen first. Because right now, we've got two offsetting factors is how fast will terms come down. So that takes out, obviously, billings and revenue. And then on the flip side, regardless of terms, how fast can we accelerate the ACV growth to kind of offset that. But we need some stabilization in the terms first to have a good view. Now we think that's probably as probably the first half maybe of FY '22. And then I think the combination of some more productivity and the prudent expense growth, products, all that stuff, it stepped up quite well after that point. But again, we need some stabilization and that's why I've always been of the view that, the quicker we get through the term compression, quite honestly, the better.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Can you tell us if the renewal activity changed much during the quarter? And how we should think about renewal billings as a percent of total billings in fiscal '21? Is 15% sort of in the ballpark there? And I have a follow-up.\nDuston Williams: Yes. We haven't given specifics on that, but the good news is, we've given you now quite a bit of data to go start modeling that on your own. You now have Q4 and Q1, ACV as a percent of ACV by term length. So, you know now, obviously, Q1 1-year deals will swap in four quarters. You\u2019ve got the 3-year, the 5-year and things like that. So, we've disclosed quite a bit to do some pretty simple modeling from that perspective.  On a TCV basis, over the last 12 months, it's been roughly 10% or below renewals and things like that. And that will start to kick up. Again, we've already added $20 million, $25 million to Q1 '22, just based on what happened here in this quarter. And that will continue to accelerate. You'll see some more in '22. And then, again, we've talked about this in FY '23, you've got a pretty big tranche of 3-year deals that start to kick in now from the initial push to subscription a few years ago.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. And can you maybe help us think about the strength between Enterprise and SMB? And especially given the vaccine news now, how are you thinking about sort of a recovery in SMB and maybe even just tell us like where your SMB exposure is?\nDuston Williams: Do you want to take that, Dheeraj?\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. I mean, obviously, it's early. It's probably going to take another three quarters for administering the vaccine itself. And we have a fairly international business. We have -- there are quarters in which we do about 45%, 50% of our business outside the U.S. And when you talk about SMB, a lot of the mid-market outside the U.S., we consider as SMB. Even the enterprise outside the U.S., we look at that as commercial. So, I think given the fact that we have customers in about 150 countries, we are taking a view that it will probably take two to three quarters of real administration of the vaccine itself.  In the meanwhile, we are focused on new products, new workloads and whatever you can get from new customers. I think we've done a fairly good job, and we are changing a lot of our practices like digital prospecting. What can we do to reinvent ourselves, transform ourselves so that when the pent-up demand opens up, we have an amazing digital business? So, we're doing everything we can right now to really open up for the SMB as they actually feel safer.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Congrats on the quarter. Thinking about just the modeling variables. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about how we should think about ACV to billings ratio? And how you think about billings to revenue? I'm just curious because we did see some compression on those ratios in the quarter. I mean, how do we think about those going forward? And I have a follow-up.\nDuston Williams: Sure. Again, Aaron, we've given you, I think, all the tools to go do that as far as working with ACV and TCV and doing where you think terms are going to come down. So all that is pretty easily doable with the tools that we've given you there. Again, with a tenth of a decline or two-tenths or whatever it might be, Q1 to Q2, you're not going to see massive movement. I don't think anyway, we'll see how the quarter plays out in those ratios. On the bill to revenue ratio in general, not talking -- see the total billings, total revenue, that's probably a little easier to talk about. With the term compression, you've got slower total revenue and total billings growth, but you still got a fair amount coming off the balance sheet a little bit higher rate. So that's why you saw the bill to revenue come down this quarter.  And I think probably going forward for a bid, it's probably 1.1 to 1.15, somewhere around there on that ratio. But again, the good news is, you've got a lot of tools there to go. You can go pick where you think terms are going to be and you can back into ACV and then total billings and all that stuff. So, it's a pretty good exercise.\nAaron Rakers: That's very helpful. And then as a quick follow-up. You mentioned in the transcript about AWS and Microsoft and the engagement there. I'm just curious, can you go a little bit deeper in terms of the go-to-market engagement with those cloud providers?\nDheeraj Pandey: Yes. So, the good thing is that -- bring your own contract is very helpful for a consumption point of view. I mean both AWS and Azure sellers get paid on consumption. And HCI is a killer workload to really get rapid consumption of everything that they sold and commit. They don't get paid on commits. They get paid on consumption. So, we're really working hand-in-hand at Microsoft. We've actually built Nutanix ready nodes, and those things will be burning the sort of -- it does a great job for customers as well as for the sellers. It burns the credits so that they don't lose them at the end of 3 years, which is what happens if you don't use the cloud credits.  And for the sellers, it just means that they have better, faster consumption. That's how they get paid because consumption is revenue recognition for the cloud players. So we're really working hand-in-hand with both cloud players and their sellers and doing webinars and a lot of joint prospecting. And honestly, there's a lot that they are also understanding and learning from the enterprise because the enterprise has a lot of mundane workloads, legacy workloads. I was talking to one of the customers the other day. And they are like the Windows machine does not reboot in the public cloud. It does not boot up in the public cloud because they have legacy devices and things of that nature. So there's a ton of that lift and shift that will come up, and we hope to actually not have to take 3 years to redesign the operating system or redesign the applications before this can all come together.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Simon Leipold of Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: First one, I just wanted to maybe set context. You talked about the strong growth rates of new products and you've rattled off some of what contributes to that, but I'm not sure I got the baseline of what percent of ACV roughly is coming from new products? And how should we see that evolve over time?\nDuston Williams: Yes. We broke that out for a few quarters or a couple of points at 15% or so of new ACV is coming from new products. And we've got, obviously, goal in '21 to accelerate that further. I don't think there's any reason why it shouldn't. We're off to a good start. Again, we've got all the tools to go focus on these products. So we've got a continued acceleration as a percent of new ACV built into the plan .\nSimon Leopold: Great. And then as a follow-up, and maybe somewhat related. But when we see the duration trend, one of the aspects you mentioned in your prepared remarks was the high federal contribution. And I guess my understanding is some agencies are restricted to 1-year term deals. So that has to play something in the mix. Could you maybe help us understand how much the federal contribution influenced the average duration and how we should think about sort of what's normal in quarters that don't have the big federal contribution? I hope that makes sense.\nDuston Williams: Yes, it makes perfect sense. I'm not sure we have a normal yet with 1 quarter, obviously. But federal probably, it depends how you exactly look at it with renewals or ex-renewals or whatever. But 1/10, maybe you could get it to almost 2/10 of a year, but let's call it closer maybe to a 1/10. So that federal will obviously come down as a percent of the total business here in Q2, which it always does from Q1. And then do we get more knowledge with our sales force and more knowledge with the customer base going forward that you get some continued downward trend.  That's why we assume it's a slight decrease in Q2. I'd be surprised if it was a little more than -- it will be more than that. But again, I just -- there's no normal yet. Give us another quarter, we'll give you another opinion, as I said earlier. But again, I'd be surprised if there was any drastic movement. And again, it comes back to the new customer mix in the existing customer mix and new will go down faster, most likely, just like we saw in Q1. And just on the new business, by the way, 680 new logos. But on a percent of ACV, new business was actually up from Q4. So it was better than Q3, it was better than Q4. In -- I'm sorry, in Q1. So we saw some encouraging signs, anyway, as far as new customer ACV as a percent of total, going up a little bit quarter-over-quarter, too. So that's just a side note there. But that's kind of the view.\nOperator: And with that last question, that's all the time we have left for today. This concludes today's earnings call. Thank you very much for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dheeraj Pandey",
            "content": "Thank you, Tonya, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a very good quarter, positioning us well for the rest of fiscal. While Duston will go into more details on the financials, the headline is that we outperformed across all our key metrics. ACV billings were 14% ahead of the midpoint of our guidance and consensus. And notably, Q1 was our best ACV bookings quarter ever, the pandemic notwithstanding. In addition, we delivered strong gross margins, EPS and free cash flow performance.  We are delighted with our continued progress, and it is great to look back on our journey over the last 3 years and see how far w ehave come, our product thesis of a hybrid and multi-cloud future built on top of our industry-leading hyperconverged infrastructure, the HCI of last decade, combined with an ambitious transition to a cloud-like subscription business model, is bearing fruit. Well, there's more to do. So, the hardest work is behind us, and I'm proud and grateful for what we have collectively accomplished to date.  There were a number of factors that contributed to our Q1 performance. First, our ACV-based sales compensation strategy delivered positive benefits to our business. In Q1, our average contract term shortened. And as a result of the shift, we saw lower overall discounting and we sold more new products, all while driving significant run rate ACV growth of 29% year-over-year at a $1.3 billion scale.  Next, as I mentioned, we saw strong adoption of our new products on top of growth in our core software. On a rolling 4-quarter basis, our new product attach rate during Q1 was 35%, up 7 percentage points from a year ago. In fact, new ACV for new products grew 87% year-over-year and 27% quarter-over-quarter. Within our newer products, we saw particularly good momentum with our data center solutions, Files and Flow, as well as DevOps and database-as-a-service solutions, our Calm and Era. Notably, a significant number of new product deals also included more licenses for our core software, proving our thesis that as we drive demand for our new products, we also drive demand for our core software, which is the foundation for our hybrid cloud infrastructure, the new HCI of this decade. Demand for our solutions was consistent across all our geographies and many verticals, including federal, which had a good quarter as expected, owing to the seasonality of the U.S. government's fiscal year-end. The Fed sector also had a number of 1-year contract duration deals contributing to the reduction of average contract durations in the quarter, which Duston will address in more detail.  As always, our customer journeys are the best ways to speak of the quarter. A customer win during the quarter that combined many of the themes I've discussed was with one of the largest and oldest financial services firms in the world providing investment management, servicing and administration. This existing customer, which has spent more than $20 million in lifetime spent another $1.7 million in ACV to expand their private cloud. We also had a very similar story with one of the largest power companies in Japan, which has spent upwards of $15 million lifetime digitizing their desktops and filers with our software stack, spending another $1.8 million in ACV in Q1. Our strong results were also driven by our go-to-market momentum in the area of cloud. Specifically, the successful launch of our ACV sales compensation plan, together with effective sales enablement and training around ACV benefits. In addition, our sales teams have done an excellent job of improving the quality of the sales process by building a robust pipeline even during COVID-19, working closely with partners and adopting a multi-product and multi-workload sale approach. The channel continues to play an extremely important role in how we help evolve our customer journey.  To that end, we announced a simplified channel program to deliver even more profitability and an accelerated road map to help partners embrace the cloud business model. Additionally, we made meaningful improvements to Nutanix University, our education arm. The program now provides more certifications across new skill levels in technolog fracks to increase the stickiness of Nutanix software and overall consumption of our technology. We quadrupled participation in this program in the past year with over 38,000 learners and counting. Our on-prem partnerships with HPE, Dell, Lenovo and others continue to be an important part of our strategy for offering freedom of choice to our customers. In fact, we had our best quarter-to-date with HPE in new ACV as well as meaningful new customer acquisition.  A great example of a new customer we gained during this quarter is a large European furniture retailer who selected our core software, database-as-a-service solution, Era and automation software, Calm. We plan to implement a fully automated distributed cloud solution that will reduce IT implementation time from weeks to days with no IT staff on site, especially as they navigate the pandemic.  Speaking on the pandemic and digital transformation, it has helped accelerate. For the past several quarters, we have become a meaningfully digital marketing organization. Test drive, 0 touch self-service or prospects continues to provide distinctive top of the funnel engagement and has been shown to shorten sales cycles while delivering the highest conversion rate of all of our marketing programs. We also continue to hold virtual events globally. And in Q1, we held the largest event ever, virtual in person in our company's history. Our 100% virtual.next-gen had record attendance of over [indiscernible] customers and partners. And is on track to deliver strong pipeline generation in the quarter at a significantly lower cost than in person events.  Let me also share with you how we are morphing from being a pioneer in on-prem hyperconverged infrastructure to being an authentic hybrid cloud infrastructure, the new HCI company. During the quarter, we announced the general availability of clusters, our HCI on AWS. We also announced a significant partnership with Microsoft to bring our product portfolio on to Azure. This partnership substantially evolves our company's strategy, enabling us to provide solutions that will deliver seamless application, data and license mobility, including a singular experience in management across all clouds. This is a major competitive advantage as we become the foremost infrastructure software company with a bring your own license approach to help our customers in the hybrid computing journey.  As we've stated in the past, the availability of Nutanix clusters on AWS also offers new benefits, including extending the simplicity and ease of use of our software to the public cloud. This represents a significant step forward in realizing our vision to make computing invisible anywhere by delivering a unified fabric across multiple clouds, public or private. A financial services institution in the APJ region is an example of a new customer who purchased clusters on AWS during the quarter in a 1-year contract. They selected Nutanix to help support their growing test and dev needs for services to their clients, and Nutanix cluster in AWS provides them with the flexibility and frictionless migration to any cloud they require.  We continue to innovate both our core platform and new products in the quarter. This includes new capabilities to our core software platform as well as the launch of our Kubernetes-based PaaS solution, platform-as-a-service, and significant updates to our database-as-a-service solution, Era. As subscription business models continue to underscore the need for consumption and renewals, our product reliability and outstanding customer service continue to be a big driver of our loyalty and repeat business. For the seventh year in a row, we were awarded the NorthFace ScoreBoard award from CRMI in recognition of our customer centricity. And because of our sustained excellence for having won this award for more than 5 years, we also confirmed the NorthFace Summit Class award, which is a rare honor.  Finally, as we think about our performance relative to our future opportunity, I'd like to talk briefly about our addressable markets and how they continue to grow and evolve. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 80% of organizations will be using hyperconverged solutions, doubling from 40% in 2020. We've been encouraged to see that IT spending has held up despite the pandemic as companies prioritize modernization with private public clouds, hands-free automation and remote work and business continuity projects. This is validated by the results for out third annual Enterprise Cloud Index, which we launched last week. Across 3,400 IT professionals around the world, 46% of respondents said they increased their hybrid investments as a result of the pandemic. Global IT teams are planning substantial infrastructure changes and collectively see hybrid cloud deployments, increasing 37 percentage points over the next 5 years. In short, these trends provide a powerful tailwind in the lift and shift to cloud, both private and public.  With that, let me hand it over to Duston. Duston? Thanks, Duston. I want to close this quarter's earnings call with a thank you to everyone who has participated in the journey to get where we are now. We're extremely encouraged with the progress in the last 3 years of our business model transformation. While we still have work to do, these results demonstrate the power of the subscription thesis. Our Board continues to make progress on the CEO search. We look forward to updating you when we have meaningful news.  Personally, it has been a journey of a lifetime to serve our customers and partners, working alongside mutants, as we call our employees. With a future-proof business model, a customer base that fundamentally values reliability and a technology portfolio that has such a strong product market fit, our best is yet to come. This is the decade to watch for a company that's so value simple, secure and seamless.  Now we'll open it up for questions. Yes. And I think the only thing I'll add to that, Jason and Duston is how -- very much like federal was for us early on in 2011 through 2015, I think the federal business with ACV has really embraced this. And we kind of knew it when we were going into it that O&M is going to be our friend because a lot of cyclical spenders, operations and maintenance, where to keep it under the radar in terms of spend and budgeting. So it turned out to be a great quarter for federal. Part of it is upon the 1-year deals that Duston talked about.  Maybe the other pleasant surprise has been how our salespeople embraced it to really think that this makes them a lot more competitive than selling 3-, 5-, 7-year deals. Yes. So, I think the field reps are all focused on land and expand, which is all new ACV-focused. Now they will get a ding if we didn't get the renewal. But all in all, we expect them to be really focused on land and expand. All of their customer success team, which is all on the inside, on the phone that's really doing adopt and renew and that's how they are going to be comped as well. And there's going to be opposing forces as well. The large enterprises kind of places like Japan, they're probably still going to be longer term. Some of our very large customers are still longer term. And then you look at federal and commercial on the other side, that will go shorter term. So I think it's going to be a healthy yin-yang between these two. I just want to say that we'll be able to go and tweak this, depending on how much cash we need to collect as well based on simple sales incentives and such as well as part of sales compensation. So we're not overly worried. We feel like now we have a great architecture in place. And we can go and tweak the way we want it. Yes. I think the big piece is, how do you balance the short-term and the long-term because you can't overdo one or the other, you have to be strategy-focused, be able to look around the corner because computing is an industry that's changing so fast that you can't take your eyes off the strategy ball. Basically, someone who can embrace process people, technology and product. So I think we've gotten some great candidates in the pipeline. And we definitely would like the relevance of the infrastructure to be there. There's a lot of people out there with the business software space. We're looking at quite a few people in infrastructure as well. And I think, all in all, somebody who has a 3- to 5-year view and a vision would be very, very important, especially for our sales engineers, our developers, our system reliability engineers. There's a lot of engineering in the company in various different departments that also need to look up to somebody for a strategy and the public cloud landscape that's out in front of us. Duston, do you want me to take that? Or should you take it? Okay. Cool. Yes. So first of all, we saw really good unit economics, as Duston said, because of short mid-term lens. So we're not taking money out of one pocket and putting it together. We are very, very mindful of that. New products have to fend for themselves and they have to pull-through the core. So a lot of what we [indiscernible] watch for is no financial engineering of money moving from core business to new products. I think, all in all, we saw some great traction in database-as-a-service. Again, amazing economics with large databases, Oracle, Sequel, SAP, Ethic and health care. We're seeing a ton of large database workloads, and we've made them so simple that DB is loving this new architecture, and the fact that they can drag and drop it from one cloud to another.  The other one is around unstructured data files and objects with the special containers. We're doing a really good job around that DevOps use case. And finally, desktop-as-a-service. I think there's a lot of work we've done, not just for Citrix and VMware Horizon, but also around our own brokers. So all in all, I think databases, unstructured data and desktop-as-a-service, some great use cases around that. Duston? Absolutely. Yes, I just want to have everybody probably also draw from the whole movement of virtualization 15 years ago. A lot of the enterprises are moving from Unix servers to Intel x86. And virtualization had to find a great use case and that was test and dev. And then it became VDI at 5 years. Citrix was one of the biggest workloads for Vmware, apart from testing then in 2008 and '09 And so for us, I think we are, again, very use case focused when it comes to clusters. It's a very important piece of the puzzle is around very high I/O intensive workloads, low latency workloads, test and dev, virtual desktops. And also lift and shift, I think there's a big disaster recovery sort of initiative coming within the large enterprises as well.  And the best part about clusters is bring your own license, bring your own contract of AWS and will be the same for Azure as well. So we expect that many of these early use cases around large databases, test and dev, as you saw from one of the wins I talked about and finally, a lift and shift to the cloud. Duston, are you there? Yes, just to add to... No, sorry. I was just saying that, look, we've had 1 quarter where we understand ACV and the ACV-first strategy, but we get a second one. We understand that it would be a coincident. The third one would be a pattern. So I think next 2 quarters are going to be really important for us to learn about this ACV-first strategy. Yes. I mean, obviously, it's early. It's probably going to take another three quarters for administering the vaccine itself. And we have a fairly international business. We have -- there are quarters in which we do about 45%, 50% of our business outside the U.S. And when you talk about SMB, a lot of the mid-market outside the U.S., we consider as SMB. Even the enterprise outside the U.S., we look at that as commercial. So, I think given the fact that we have customers in about 150 countries, we are taking a view that it will probably take two to three quarters of real administration of the vaccine itself.  In the meanwhile, we are focused on new products, new workloads and whatever you can get from new customers. I think we've done a fairly good job, and we are changing a lot of our practices like digital prospecting. What can we do to reinvent ourselves, transform ourselves so that when the pent-up demand opens up, we have an amazing digital business? So, we're doing everything we can right now to really open up for the SMB as they actually feel safer. Yes. So, the good thing is that -- bring your own contract is very helpful for a consumption point of view. I mean both AWS and Azure sellers get paid on consumption. And HCI is a killer workload to really get rapid consumption of everything that they sold and commit. They don't get paid on commits. They get paid on consumption. So, we're really working hand-in-hand at Microsoft. We've actually built Nutanix ready nodes, and those things will be burning the sort of -- it does a great job for customers as well as for the sellers. It burns the credits so that they don't lose them at the end of 3 years, which is what happens if you don't use the cloud credits.  And for the sellers, it just means that they have better, faster consumption. That's how they get paid because consumption is revenue recognition for the cloud players. So we're really working hand-in-hand with both cloud players and their sellers and doing webinars and a lot of joint prospecting. And honestly, there's a lot that they are also understanding and learning from the enterprise because the enterprise has a lot of mundane workloads, legacy workloads. I was talking to one of the customers the other day. And they are like the Windows machine does not reboot in the public cloud. It does not boot up in the public cloud because they have legacy devices and things of that nature. So there's a ton of that lift and shift that will come up, and we hope to actually not have to take 3 years to redesign the operating system or redesign the applications before this can all come together."

            "content": "Thank you, Dheeraj. Going into the quarter, we provided guidance that took into consideration both an uncertain macro environment and our transition to an ACV-based sales compensation model. We clearly outperformed our expectations and are very pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year. As we enter FY '21, our overall thesis for the business going forward is centered on the following: our industry-leading product set that seamlessly enables on-prem, off-prem and the convergence of both remains the best and most elegant solution in the marketplace. Next, new products will continue to drive the growth of our core HCI offering by further extending our solution to address new opportunities that were previously out of reach with our core solution alone. Optionality truly matters to our customers and prospects and offering subscription options with variable terms and their corresponding flexibility will continue to add significant optionality, which in turn leads to additional ACV growth. Our ACV-first focus will ultimately strengthen our business model via term compression leading to lower discounting, better deal economics accelerated ACV growth in a shorter time to more efficient renewals. And finally, we expect our go-to-market execution will continue to show improvement and this, combined with a market-leading solution, ultimately becomes a very powerful combination for ACV growth going forward.  The business thesis set forth above clearly played out in Q1. During the quarter, our core product continued to perform very well with new customer ACV bookings, representing 23% of total ACV bookings. We also added about 680 net new customers in the quarter, despite the ongoing macro uncertainties related to COVID. Linearity was also very good during Q1. We generated a record amount of new pipeline, and we also added a substantial amount of ACV backlog compared to a typical usage of backlog in previous Q1s. As you may recall, during our Q4 earnings call, it was our belief that our ACV-based sales comp would put a renewed focus on new product sales, and not surprisingly, new products performed very well in Q1.  As Dheeraj noted, we had a record quarter of new ACV related to our new products with Calm, Era, Files, Flow and Objects, all delivering record ACV quarters. New products also played a role in improving our deal economics during the quarter. Furthermore, the benefit of subscription optionality clearly came into play during the quarter with more customers opting for the budget flexibility of 1-year deals. Our outperformance on 1-year deals in Q1 has added an incremental $20 million to $25 million to the renewals pool, that will come up in Q1 FY '22, which is over and above our previous plan. We expect these renewals to be more predictable and transacted at significantly less cost compared to our new and upsell business, which will drive leverage in our model.  As we look ahead, we are very optimistic about the setup for the balance of the fiscal year. In Q1, we experienced lower discounting that resulted in better deal economics, as well as some term compression, all as we expected. The specifics around the actual Q1 term compression also mirrored our previously communicated expectations, specifically that our new ACV-based sales comp plan with compressed terms and we would see a shift from 5-year deals to more 3-year and 1-year deals. And when terms did compress, existing customers would not experience any significant term compression, while new customers would potentially see larger amounts of term compression.  In Q1, average contract term decreased to 3.5 years compared to 3.8 years in Q4 '20, which was somewhat lower than our expectations. Federal completed several large 1-year deals, which contributed to the average decrease. Since our federal business is usually a much smaller percentage of our total business in Q2 versus Q1, we do not expect the federal business to have the same level of impact on average term in Q2. While we do not plan to disclose this level of detail every quarter, average contract term of existing customers, ex-renewals, decreased by one-tenth of a year, while average contract term of new customers declined by six-tenths of a year. Lastly, our go-to-market is showing consistent execution as evidenced by our top line outperformance over the last few quarters. Although we only have one quarter under our belt in FY '21, we are very encouraged with our progress to date.  Now, I'll move on to some specific Q1 financial highlights. ACV billings were $138 million, reflecting 10% growth year-over-year, well above our guidance range of $118 million to $121 million. Run rate ACV as of the end of Q1 was $1.29 billion, growing 29% year-over-year compared to our guidance of at least 20% growth.  Revenue, which as expected, was impacted by decreased average term length, was $313 million, down 1% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 81.9% versus our guidance of 81%. Operating expenses were $341 million, down 12% year-over-year and versus our guidance of $350 million to $360 million. End user computing, as a percent of total business was flat versus Q4 '20 as the spike in demand we saw at the beginning of COVID moderated.  During the quarter, we completed our previously announced $125 million stock buyback. We purchased 5.175 million shares at an average price of $24.15 per share. As a reminder, the stock buyback was executed with the intention of offsetting the additional dilution that we will incur related to the PIK, or paid-in-kind interest feature on the Bain convertible notes. Our non-GAAP net loss was $89 million for the quarter, or a loss of $0.44 per share.  Our free cash flow for Q1, which was aided by very good linearity was negative $16 million. This performance was significantly better than our internal expectations. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.32 billion versus $720 million in Q4 '20. The Q1 cash total includes $750 million from the Bain convertible note, less expenses and the $125 million stock buyback. And DSOs in Q1 were 54 days versus 68 days in Q4 '20, also driven by good linearity.  Now turning to our Q2 '21 guidance. ACV billings to be between $145 million and $148 million, representing year-over-year growth of 4% to 6%. Gross margin of approximately 81.5%. Operating expenses between $360 million and $370 million, representing year-over-year decline of 7% to 9%. Weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $202 million.  Now a few modeling assumptions. Our guidance for Q2 includes a slightly negative COVID impact, as we continue to be cautious in the light of the second and third waves of COVID that could create additional macro uncertainty. On a bookings basis, the implied year-over-year growth rate of our Q2 '21 ACV is expected to be substantially higher as we consumed backlog in Q2 '20. As a reminder, similar to what we have experienced over the last two years, we would expect Q3 to exhibit sequential seasonality, which suggests a slight decrease in ACV billings in Q3 versus Q2. And based on the Q2 '21 ACV billings guidance, we would expect run rate ACV to continue its strong growth trend and grow approximately 25% year-over-year. We are projecting a slight decrease in term length in Q2 compared to 3.5 years in Q1.  From a free cash flow perspective, we are not currently expecting Q2 linearity to mirror that of Q1, and therefore, we expect our cash usage to increase in Q2. Regardless of the exact amount of cash usage in Q2, we would expect free cash flow for the first half of FY '21 to exceed our internal plan set forth at the beginning of the fiscal year. While we maintain our focus on go-to-market efficiencies and we continue to benefit from lower travel costs, as we have previously communicated, we anticipate fiscal '21 operating expenses to be flat to slightly higher than last year as we continue to grow and invest in the business.  And finally, as we did last quarter to help with your modeling, included in our earnings presentation located on our IR website, our historical trends for ACV billings, run rate ACV, billings term length and a bridge how to model and convert our current and future ACV billings guidance to total billings.  With that, I'd like to pass it back to Dheeraj for additional remarks before we take questions. Thank you. Yes. I'll take a shot, and Dheeraj, feel free to jump in here, too. Jason, I would say there was very few, if any, real surprises. I think we had a -- which we talked about, we had an opinion and view going into Q1. And pretty much all those views played out as planned. We thought terms would decrease. We thought they decreased more in new customers, less on existing customers. We thought that, that would lead to higher deal economics. Deal economics improved. Optionality, we knew mattered. And it mattered not only for our customers, but for our sales reps because they have more tools now to offer as they go attack their quotas. So I can't really think of anything. Yes, it was maybe 1/10 lower or so in the terms than we expected, but that's not an exact science anyway. So there was just very little surprises that we hadn't thought through, quite honestly.  And I think the ACV from -- certainly from a sales comp, I think, played out better than probably we anticipated. And I think everybody has kind of rallied around that. And optionality, again, matters. And you saw what it delivered for a quarter and a good guide for Q2. Well, based on record pipeline, we were pretty pleased with -- especially in this environment. Obviously, it's not perfect. And the economy is not humming at full 100%, they impacted here. Yes, I think we were pretty pleased overall from that perspective, too. So, I -- sure. Go ahead, Dheeraj. Yes. No, what I'd add to that, Ittai, is that the whole thesis around this -- one of the main premise here around the move to ACV is leverage, right? And that's the exact point, all the renewal will not take aggressive hiring, right? Because that's going to be handled predominantly by a separate team. Now we have to go build up that separate team. But all these renewals will not be one-for-one sales rep adds. So that's where pretty much any subscription business gets a lot of their leverage. We just haven't had the renewals flow in yet. And you saw the impact from just the acceleration of 1-year deals in the quarter. We've added $20 million, $25 million to the pool in Q1 '21 -- '22. And that's not going to require new reps to go attack that. So that's the premise of the ACV move. Not dramatically. Federal played a role in some of the term compression in Q1. They won't be the same percent of the business in Q2. So there's some offsetting factors there. We've got this view of kind of low 3-year average somewhere at the end of the fiscal year. We'll see how that plays out. I think the more that our sales reps get used to this model and maybe to start to be the more customers get used to this model, with the optionality and things like that. Maybe we see a little bit bigger, but 1 quarter is too early to give a real opinionated view, especially because how federal kind of played into this a little bit. But certainly, we're encouraged from what we've seen from the first quarter anyway. Well, I was mentioning low -- again, we've got 1 quarter, but what I was referencing there, kind of in the low 3s at the end of fiscal '21. It's too early to tell, but we've got -- as Dheeraj said, you've got some older school customers that still will hang and cling to 5-year deals, too. So I think, again, 1 quarter, it's just too early to tell, but we're encouraged of everything that kind of we thought was going to happen pretty much happened. But give us another quarter and we'll give another, I think, a better opinion. I'll let you take the use cases, Dheeraj. And then just -- yes, just on the sales comp part, for the most part, it is something spread around. But for the most part, I believe it was the help -- it was certainly helped by the move to ACV because you got to remember, now $100,000 1-year deal for a new product is the same as it was the same as a $500,000 deal that they had to go try to do on a 5-year basis. So there's clearly more optionality, I said, not only on our customers' perspective, but with the sales reps to go use these different tools from an ACV perspective and go drive additional quota retirement with smaller terms.  And I will say this played well. There's obvious little things here and there, but it played well in all regions. I mean, all regions were above quota. Which we love to see, obviously. So that kind of gives you a little bit of feel of the power of optionality to. I'm sorry, Jim, on the last part of the question, was what again? Yes. I mean, churn in general within the sales organization isn't much different from what it has been over the last several quarters. Now there might have been some more selective and maybe some forced churn, the focus maybe on a little bit more software selling and things like that. But overall, the churn rates aren't significantly different. Now what Kris coders and team have done, though, in the field is they've certainly shifted to incremental leverage, how do we get more productivity out of the same reps. There's been some realignment with resources amongst regions and things like that. So that -- the real focus right now is that we have a reasonable lot of reps. How do you get them even more productive, certainly from an ACV perspective and things like that. So that's the main focus right now. We won't add a significant amount of reps this fiscal year. I'm so sorry. Yes, just in the near to midterm, hopefully, from a top line perspective, we're going to get most of that through leverage, increased rep productivity. So you won't see some great hiring surge to get incremental ACV growth. We should be able to get reasonable lot of incremental ACV growth with most of the resources we have currently now we need to continue higher here and there or whatever. But I wouldn't clearly put it as a surge of anything like that. I mean, we've got a fair amount of resources spread throughout the regions as it is here now.  So at some point, there's some things that we've just benefited from, clearly, and everybody else has, obviously, no travel, right? So at some point, some travel will come back online. But even when -- whatever things -- whatever normal is in the future, we won't spend -- hopefully, we won't spend nearly as much travel as we had in the past just because everybody's learned how to do things differently. So first and foremost, it's leverage, rep productivity and then selective hiring as we need realignment of resources as we need and to make sure, obviously, we're taking care of customers with products and support and things like that. So that's kind of the view here over the near to midterm. Yes. Again, we mentioned that we haven't gotten real aggressive with the Q2 outlook. We're concerned what's happening. Obviously, things are going in the wrong direction from a COVID perspective and shutdowns in second and third phases, so that's clearly encompassed in our billings. Obviously, to your point, we grew ACV billings 10% in Q1 year-over-year. We've guided 4% to 6%. Now again, though, if you look at it on a bookings basis, which we're not disclosing anymore, but that 4% to 6% growth rate is probably 2x, at least 2x there on a comparative bookings basis. So there's some pretty good growth when you look at it on a bookings base because, again, in Q2 '20, we brought -- actually used some backlog, which was a little unusual from that perspective. So I think the combination of -- on a bookings, it's quite a bit better. And again, we're a little -- again, we've got something baked in there from a COVID perspective to a certain degree. Yes. News. News headlines. It's not much different than our prior approach. I just think at this point, I think, to get very aggressive just doesn't make sense in this environment. Well, we need to get terms kind of compressed to where they're going to even out. And I don't know if that's three year, maybe a little bit above, maybe a little bit below. But we have to have that happen first. Because right now, we've got two offsetting factors is how fast will terms come down. So that takes out, obviously, billings and revenue. And then on the flip side, regardless of terms, how fast can we accelerate the ACV growth to kind of offset that. But we need some stabilization in the terms first to have a good view. Now we think that's probably as probably the first half maybe of FY '22. And then I think the combination of some more productivity and the prudent expense growth, products, all that stuff, it stepped up quite well after that point. But again, we need some stabilization and that's why I've always been of the view that, the quicker we get through the term compression, quite honestly, the better. Yes. We haven't given specifics on that, but the good news is, we've given you now quite a bit of data to go start modeling that on your own. You now have Q4 and Q1, ACV as a percent of ACV by term length. So, you know now, obviously, Q1 1-year deals will swap in four quarters. You've got the 3-year, the 5-year and things like that. So, we've disclosed quite a bit to do some pretty simple modeling from that perspective.  On a TCV basis, over the last 12 months, it's been roughly 10% or below renewals and things like that. And that will start to kick up. Again, we've already added $20 million, $25 million to Q1 '22, just based on what happened here in this quarter. And that will continue to accelerate. You'll see some more in '22. And then, again, we've talked about this in FY '23, you've got a pretty big tranche of 3-year deals that start to kick in now from the initial push to subscription a few years ago. Do you want to take that, Dheeraj? Sure. Again, Aaron, we've given you, I think, all the tools to go do that as far as working with ACV and TCV and doing where you think terms are going to come down. So all that is pretty easily doable with the tools that we've given you there. Again, with a tenth of a decline or two-tenths or whatever it might be, Q1 to Q2, you're not going to see massive movement. I don't think anyway, we'll see how the quarter plays out in those ratios. On the bill to revenue ratio in general, not talking -- see the total billings, total revenue, that's probably a little easier to talk about. With the term compression, you've got slower total revenue and total billings growth, but you still got a fair amount coming off the balance sheet a little bit higher rate. So that's why you saw the bill to revenue come down this quarter.  And I think probably going forward for a bid, it's probably 1.1 to 1.15, somewhere around there on that ratio. But again, the good news is, you've got a lot of tools there to go. You can go pick where you think terms are going to be and you can back into ACV and then total billings and all that stuff. So, it's a pretty good exercise. Yes. We broke that out for a few quarters or a couple of points at 15% or so of new ACV is coming from new products. And we've got, obviously, goal in '21 to accelerate that further. I don't think there's any reason why it shouldn't. We're off to a good start. Again, we've got all the tools to go focus on these products. So we've got a continued acceleration as a percent of new ACV built into the plan . Yes, it makes perfect sense. I'm not sure we have a normal yet with 1 quarter, obviously. But federal probably, it depends how you exactly look at it with renewals or ex-renewals or whatever. But 1/10, maybe you could get it to almost 2/10 of a year, but let's call it closer maybe to a 1/10. So that federal will obviously come down as a percent of the total business here in Q2, which it always does from Q1. And then do we get more knowledge with our sales force and more knowledge with the customer base going forward that you get some continued downward trend.  That's why we assume it's a slight decrease in Q2. I'd be surprised if it was a little more than -- it will be more than that. But again, I just -- there's no normal yet. Give us another quarter, we'll give you another opinion, as I said earlier. But again, I'd be surprised if there was any drastic movement. And again, it comes back to the new customer mix in the existing customer mix and new will go down faster, most likely, just like we saw in Q1. And just on the new business, by the way, 680 new logos. But on a percent of ACV, new business was actually up from Q4. So it was better than Q3, it was better than Q4. In -- I'm sorry, in Q1. So we saw some encouraging signs, anyway, as far as new customer ACV as a percent of total, going up a little bit quarter-over-quarter, too. So that's just a side note there. But that's kind of the view."

And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. Against a volatile macro backdrop, we delivered a good fourth quarter relative to the updated outlook we have provided on our third quarter call. We exceeded all our guided metrics and saw continued strong performance in our renewals business. Supply chain constraints with our server partners, while remaining a significant challenge in the quarter, were better than we had expected. While we are aware that the macro backdrop has grown incrementally more challenging for many businesses, in our fourth quarter, we continued to see solid demand for our Nutanix Cloud Platform with businesses continuing to spend on digital transformation, modernizing their data centers and adopting hybrid multi-cloud operating models. During the fourth quarter, I spent a lot of time on the road, meeting with customers in person. I was energized by the face-to-face engagement and struck by their enthusiasm for their overall experience on Nutanix products and the strong customer support they have received. These conversations reinforced my view that our unwavering focus on reducing the complexity and cost of IT environment as well as our obsession with customer delight is resonating with our customers. Taking a closer look at the fourth quarter, we delivered bookings well above our expectations, aided by a number of large expansion deals and the continued strong performance of our renewals business. This drove billings and revenue outperformance relative to our guidance. Top line outperformance, diligent expense management and better-than-expected linearity helped us achieve positive free cash flow in the quarter, which was substantially better than our expectations. Given the largely supply chain-driven headwinds that affected our fourth quarter, I believe looking at FY \u201822 in its entirety provides a better picture of the progress we made on our subscription business model transition. Specifically, we saw ACV billings growth accelerate to 27% year-over-year, up from 18% in FY \u201821. We also saw non-GAAP operating margin improved by 15 percentage points year-over-year to minus 5%. Finally, for the first time since 2018, we achieved positive free cash flow for the entire fiscal year. Beyond these financial accomplishments, we had other important achievements, including launching our simplified product portfolio, enhancing our leadership team, making progress with our partners and continuing to delight our customers as reflected in our high NPS scores and strong renewal performance. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our progress and financial performance in FY \u201822. As I noted, our fourth quarter was bolstered by a number of large expansion deals, including customers, both increasing their use of our Nutanix Cloud Platform and broadening their adoption of adjacent solutions in areas such as storage, Database as a Service and cloud management. A good example was an expansion deal with an existing customer who is a global Fortune 100 financial services firm that placed a double-digit million dollar order to broaden their usage of our core Nutanix Cloud Platform while standardizing on Nutanix Database Service for managing and deploying their databases throughout their organization. This customer also plans to utilize NC2 on AWS to enable bursting into the public cloud with their Nutanix-based workloads. We see this customer as a great example of how we are able to land and expand with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Our largest new customer win in the quarter was with an EMEA-based financial services provider that we\u2019re looking to modernize their 3-tier infrastructure with the aim of improving scalability, performance and management resources required to support future growth objectives while also providing a path for seamless access to the public cloud. They chose our Nutanix Cloud Platform full stack offering as well as Nutanix Cloud Management due to its simplicity and built-in automation for Infrastructure as a Service. They also added Nutanix Unified Storage and Nutanix Database Service for their storage and database automation needs, respectively. This win is a great example of customers seeing the benefits of adopting our full stack. On the product front, we were excited to announce that NC2 on Azure progressed to public preview during the quarter, which will significantly broaden the pool of customers for our cloud offerings. One of our first customers onboarded to NC2 on Azure is a leading global brewer based in EMEA that has standardized our Nutanix Cloud Platform for all of its business-critical applications and SQL travel workloads. This customer chose Nutanix due to its simplicity, performance, ease of management and ability to seamlessly burst into the public cloud of their choice. Another exciting product development was the recent release of AOS 6.5, a comprehensive and feature-packed release which reflects our continued investment and innovation in our platform. Release 6.5 has features focused on improving performance, security and integrated data services required for demanding database workloads and business-critical applications. Go-to-market leverage with partners is one of my top priorities, and we continue to see progress on this front during the fourth quarter. Our partnership with Red Hat, with whom we have a growing number of joint wins for both OpenShift and Red Hat Enterprise Linux workloads running on Nutanix Cloud Platform continues to show good momentum. One example of a joint win in Q4 is a central bank of a country in the EMEA region that shifted their business critical applications running on Red Hat OpenShift from a competing 3-tier solution to Nutanix Cloud Platform, including our AHV Hypervisor due to the resiliency, scalability and reduced total cost of ownership offered by our solutions. We are excited about the growing opportunity pipeline we see with Red Hat. Also on the partner front, we were pleased to be named 2022 HPE GreenLake Ecosystem Partner of the Year. We view this award as a testament to our growing partnership with HPE. Now I\u2019d like to comment on our recent sales leadership transition. Following Dom Delfino\u2019s decision to pursue an opportunity with another technology company, on August 1st, we appointed Andrew Brinded as our new Chief Revenue Officer. Andrew has been with us as a sales leader for over five years, most recently as our Senior Vice President and Worldwide Sales Chief Operating Officer, and has developed a deep understanding of our business model, go-to-market strategies and sales operations. Our sales organization is in excellent hands under Andrew\u2019s leadership, and I look forward to working closely with him in his new role. More broadly, I feel confident that we\u2019ve got the team in place to take Nutanix to its next stage of profitable growth. In closing, I\u2019d like to provide some thoughts on our priorities and outlook. First, our overarching priority remains driving towards sustainable, profitable growth. To enable this, we will continue to judiciously invest in the growth of the business, execute on our growing base of renewals and diligently manage expense levels. Towards this end, as part of our comprehensive review of our business and operating model and along with a number of other expense reduction actions, we made a difficult decision to reduce our headcount by approximately 4%. This is not a decision we made lightly, but it was important to ensuring that we could continue to drive towards profitable growth in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios. However, we\u2019re also seeing businesses continuing to prioritize digital transformation and believe the challenging macro backdrop is providing further incentive for them to optimize their IT and cloud spend. We see these dynamics as playing to the strength of our hybrid multi-cloud platform, which enables companies to reduce the complexity and cost of their IT environments. Finally, we see the business achieving positive non-GAAP operating income and continuing to be free cash flow positive in FY23. We plan to do this through a combination of strong continued top line growth and diligent expense management. We remain confident about the opportunity ahead of us and enter FY23 with a sense of excitement and cautious optimism. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv. The fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822 came in better than the expectations that we had set forth in our last earnings call, as indicated earlier this month. ACV billings for Q4 were $193 million, above our guidance range of $175 million to $185 million. The outperformance was due to both, renewals and the new ACV bookings coming in better than expected. Q4 also benefited from a few large deals, which are harder to forecast. New logo additions in Q4 were around 620. ARR at the end of Q4 was $1.202 billion and grew 37% year-over-year. Average contract duration was 3.2 years in Q4, flat from 3.2 years in Q3. Revenue for Q4 was $386 million, above our guidance range of $340 million to $360 million. As described during our last earnings call, the percentage of orders with future start dates was a key assumption in our Q4 guidance. This percentage came in higher than it was in Q3 \u201822, as expected, but not as high as our forecast. This also positively impacted ACV billings and revenue performance relative to guidance with a larger impact on revenue. While our largest server partner had almost no impact from supply chain challenges during our Q4, we did see a significant percentage of orders with future start dates from other server partners. Sales rep productivity increased year-over-year in Q4. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 82.6%, higher than our guidance range of 79% to 80% because of higher than expected revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses for Q4 came in at $356 million, better than our guidance range of $360 million to $365 million. Non-GAAP net loss for Q4 was $38 million or $0.17 per share. Billings linearity was good in Q4 and better than our forecast. DSOs were 30 days in Q4, down from 40 days in Q3. Free cash flow in Q4 was significantly better than expected at positive $23 million, while we have previously expected a significant use of cash. This was driven by three factors: one, our bookings and billings coming in higher than expected; two, linearity of billings was better than expected and in line with historical linearity; and three, diligent expense management. We closed the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.324 billion, up slightly from $1.3 billion in Q3 \u201822. Moving to full year fiscal year \u201822 results. ACV billings in fiscal year \u201822 was $756 million, representing strong growth of 27% year-over-year compared to year-over-year growth of 18% in fiscal year \u201821. New ACV billings grew year-over-year but came in below our expectations, largely due to the challenges identified in Q4, while renewals ACV billings outperformed our expectations. As we transition more fully to a subscription model with total ACV billings and revenue guidance, along with disclosure around metrics such as ARR, we no longer plan to share the breakdown between new ACV billings and renewals ACV billings. Our gross retention rate, or GRR, for fiscal year \u201822 continued to be within our 90% or greater target range. Net retention rate for fiscal year \u201822 was around 125%. Revenue for fiscal year \u201822 was $1.581 billion and grew at 13% year-over-year, returning to double-digit growth for the first time since the start of our subscription journey, despite the impact of increased future start dates in Q4 \u201822. Non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal year \u201822 was 83%, greater than our guidance of approximately 82%, largely due to revenue coming in higher than expected. We delivered meaningful operating leverage as non-GAAP operating margin went from negative 20% in fiscal year \u201821 to negative 5% in fiscal year \u201822. We generated free cash flow of approximately $18 million in fiscal year \u201822, the first year of positive free cash flow since fiscal year \u201818 and since the beginning of our subscription journey. Fiscal year \u201822 was a significant year as we saw the thesis around our subscription business model and diligent expense management start to bear fruit, with renewals performing better than expected and positive free cash flow for the year. As we have demonstrated over the last couple of years, we expect to continue to make steady progress each year towards continued top line growth and profitability. Now turning to Q1 guidance. The guidance for Q1 \u201823 is as follows: ACV billings of $210 million to $215 million, a year-over-year growth of 16% at the midpoint; revenue of $410 million to $415 million, year-over-year growth of 9% at the midpoint; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 82%; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately negative 6% with non-GAAP operating expenses of $360 million to $365 million; weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $229 million. I\u2019ll now provide some context around our Q1 guidance. First, the top-line guidance for Q1 assumes that supply chain dynamics would remain more or less the same compared to Q4 \u201822. It also assumes that contract durations stay approximately flat to slightly down in Q1 \u201823 compared to Q4 \u201822, given that Q1 is a seasonally strong U.S. federal quarter, which typically has lower contract duration. Second, in line with our stated priority of driving towards sustainable, profitable growth, we conducted detailed expense reviews as part of our annual planning process. Earlier this month, we made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by letting go of approximately 270 employees, about 4% of our total headcount which we expect to result in estimated annualized expense reduction of approximately $55 million to $60 million. Finally, we expect free cash flow to be around breakeven for Q1 \u201823 after factoring in approximately $20 million of onetime severance payments related to the headcount reductions in Q1. Excluding those onetime payments, free cash flow expectations for Q1 \u201823 would have been around $20 million. Moving to full year expectations. The guidance for fiscal year \u201823 is as follows: ACV billings of $895 million to $900 million, year-over-year growth of 19% at the midpoint; revenue of $1.77 billion to $1.78 billion, year-over-year growth of 12% at the midpoint; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 82%; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 2% with non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.41 billion to $1.42 billion. I\u2019ll now provide some color on our full year guidance. First, the guidance assumes that contract durations would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year \u201822. The fiscal year \u201823 revenue guidance also assumes that supply chain dynamics would remain more or less the same through the first half of fiscal year \u201823 and would start to ease modestly in the second half of the fiscal year. Growth in ACV billings is expected to be greater than growth in revenue because orders with future start dates that our billed are reflected in ACV billings, but revenue can only begin to be recognized in the quarter of the actual license start date. Second, while the demand for our solutions has remained solid, we have considered the uncertain macroeconomic environment in our guidance. Finally, we expect to deliver about $75 million to $100 million of free cash flow for fiscal year \u201823. We are also happy to reiterate the previously stated target of being sustainably free cash flow positive as of the first half of fiscal year \u201823, excluding the onetime severance payments. Moving on to add some color to fiscal year 2025 expectations. We expect free cash flow margin in fiscal year \u201825 to be around 10% to 15% of revenue, representing at least $300 million in free cash flow. We also expect to continue to make steady progress each year towards becoming a Rule of 40 company by driving growth and margins. With that, operator, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions, and congrats on a really good quarter and bounce back here as well as the reiteration of that $300 million of cash flow in the out year, really good to hear that. Rukmini, on the upside in the quarter and on the guide for fiscal \u201823, though, how much of that prior $90 million reduction for fiscal Q4 that you had a lower buy came back into fiscal Q4 versus how much of that really flows into that fiscal \u201823 number? And what\u2019s really driving your confidence around guiding that fiscal \u201823 revenue to that level, especially in the macro, the change in kind of leadership at the sales level and the headcount reduction that would, in theory, lower your capacity a little bit. And I know you\u2019re talking about easing supply chain dynamics in the second half of the fiscal year.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Jim, for the question. So, let me maybe share a little more context around how we thought about fiscal year \u201823. So, there are a few drivers here that we considered. First, there is -- when we think about our billings and revenue, we talk about both, renewals and our new and expansion business. So first, talking about renewals. As we\u2019ve talked about before, the renewals business continues to perform really well. And given the growing base of renewals, we expect renewals to grow strongly in fiscal year \u201823 as well. And renewals contribute a significant majority of the growth expected from \u201822 to \u201823. We\u2019re also expecting growth in new and expansion business. But when I alluded to the comments around the macroeconomic environment, that\u2019s where -- it\u2019s in the new and expansion business that we have factored in some conservatism as it relates to the macro environment. And then, we did exit Q4 and fiscal year \u201822 with record levels of backlog. And so, we\u2019re factoring that in as well into the fiscal year \u201823 guide. And all of that combined, especially the renewals and the strong and healthy backlog position, helps us to reduce the risk around the forecast. And I think supply chain, as we talked about, Jim, we expect will stay more or less the same for first half and then maybe start to ease modestly in the second half. But that again could evolve, and we\u2019ll keep everybody sort of updated what we see related to supply chain as we go here from quarter-to-quarter.\nJames Fish: Makes sense. I appreciate that color. And then, Rajiv, obviously, your major competitors having their user conference this week and release an updated version, and I know it\u2019s only been 24 hours in terms of the announcement. But from that new functionality that was announced, how does Nutanix actually stack up and what continues to differentiate Nutanix versus your primary competitor? Are you seeing a change in that competitive landscape already given concerns around VMware?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I\u2019ll give you a couple of points there first. Yes, there is definitely a higher level of engagement from VMware customers as a result of what\u2019s going on out there, and they\u2019re more open to discussions with us. They\u2019re also seeing more talent out there looking -- from VMware looking for new career opportunities. Now, with respect to the portfolio itself, we feel very good about where our portfolio is at this point. We have a complete cloud platform that -- and if you look at our fundamental differentiation, the platform provides a lot of simplicity. We make these problems really, really simple, right? And it\u2019s from the beginning -- we haven\u2019t put together 2 or 3 different products to build a solution actually. We\u2019ve engineered assets from the very beginning. That\u2019s number one, simplicity. The second is the freedom of choice that we provide to our customers, no lock in. The third is our focus on customer delight, which is becoming even more critical now these days in terms of how we support our customers for the long-term. And the last bit is about our architecture and how we manage all forms of data. So, from a portfolio perspective, we have a very competitive portfolio. Our win rates continue to increase related to our competition against both, our large competitors as well as our legacy 3-tier competition. So, we feel pretty good about the product side of this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.\nRod Hall: I guess, Rukmini, I wanted to come back to the impact of the cost reductions and just kind of make sure I understand what the timing on that impact is, how full impact we have in the guided quarter. I mean, is it some proportion of the total savings that you talked about of $55 million to $60 million a year, or is it the total amount for the whole quarter? So, that\u2019s my first question and then I have a follow-up to that. Thank you.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thanks for the question. So, the $55 million to $60 million is the expected annualized savings coming from those reductions. And we are through most of the notifications; several of the headcount reductions are complete. However, as we all know, we\u2019re a global company, and so there are some notifications and exits that are still due to happen. We expect them to be largely complete by the end of Q1. And then, we have a few that are outstanding for Q2, but that $55 million to $60 million is sort of an annualized number, Rod, but like I said, most of them are expected to be complete in Q1.\nRod Hall: Most complete in Q1. Okay. Thanks, Rukmini. So, then\u2026\nRukmini Sivaraman: And the -- yes, sorry, go ahead, finish your question.\nRod Hall: Oh no, please.\nRukmini Sivaraman: I was just going to add, Rod, that the annualized operating expense and operating margin guide factors in that $55 million to $60 million, of course, as you can imagine. So that factors in the actual impact and $55 million to $60 million is the annualized number.\nRod Hall: Okay, great. And the other thing that I was going to ask about this, Rukmini, is if I take the annualized number and divide by 4, even at the high end of the savings or it\u2019s $15 million a quarter, but your severance number is $20 million, which suggests you\u2019re doing more of this maybe overseas, not as much in the U.S. I\u2019m just kind of curious what the balance of that is and why that severance number is so high in the one quarter, given the quarterly savings you\u2019re kind of indicating here.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. So, approximately $20 million that I mentioned is a fully loaded number, right? So, it includes on-time earnings or salaries, any kind of bonuses that include -- it includes -- the 55 to 60 includes the benefit, it includes all of that, right? So, the 55 to 60 is a fully loaded number for the year, payroll taxes. It\u2019s a full number. And like I alluded to, it is a global action that we\u2019ve taken, depending on what we\u2019ve seen as our priorities and where we want to invest versus we don\u2019t want to or we\u2019ve sort of decided to optimize in certain areas. So, I\u2019m not providing sort of a breakdown by geography, Rod, but I think it is fair to assume that it was a global action.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. It\u2019s really good to see the cost reduction and the cash flow here, much better than what we expected as well. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pinjalim Bora with JP Morgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Congrats on a great quarter, much better than expected here. I wanted to ask you about, again, the ACV billings guidance. It seems like you took some conservatism into that for the new business, but seems like you might not have factored much into the renewals business. I\u2019m just trying to understand what exactly are you assuming? Are you assuming close rates to deteriorate? Are you assuming elongation of sales cycles? Maybe any context there would be helpful.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Pinjalim, thank you for the question. Yes. So, on renewals, I guess, we\u2019re not assuming anything sort of beyond what we\u2019ve actually delivered. So, I want to be clear on the renewal piece, they\u2019re continuing -- assuming continued performance in the renewals business. And to your question on the new and expansion business, what we\u2019re assuming is that this business will be impacted in some way by supply chain. Again, we\u2019re seeing solid demand so far, Pinjalim. So, it\u2019s not so much elongation. We haven\u2019t seen an elongation in deep cycles or anything like that so far. So, we\u2019re assuming that effectively the growth in new and expansion business will be -- may be impacted by macro conditions, should they happen. So, that\u2019s sort of what we factored in at this point. And the last piece that I talked about when thinking about the ACV billings guidance for the full year is the backlog piece, right, which -- it\u2019s a healthy backlog number. So, it gives us an additional sort of benefit of reduced stress thinking about fiscal \u201823?\nPinjalim Bora: Understood. One question for Rajiv. You introduced the pricing and packaging earlier in the year. You have noted some kind of full end-to-end customers adopting Nutanix. Are you starting with -- especially with the acquisition of one of your largest customers as a backdrop, I guess, are you seeing any meaningful change in customer conversations, turning more strategic to adopting Nutanix in a broader sense?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think this is -- it\u2019s a good question, Pinjalim. What I\u2019ll say is we\u2019ve definitely seen a much higher level of engagement with customers being much more open, and of course, they\u2019re concerned in terms of what might potentially happen. And so, the level of engagement has definitely gone up for us. Now, in terms of what we\u2019ve assumed on how quickly this stands and -- they\u2019re not assuming any meaningful benefit from this in our fiscal \u201823 outlook. We do expect to see some long-term benefits from this action [ph] as customers will look for alternatives. So, that\u2019s what I would say for the VMware Broadcom situation. Now, in terms of the portfolio itself -- to your question on the portfolio, we\u2019re certainly seeing good traction with our new portfolio. It\u2019s helping definitely upsize deals in the sense that we are seeing more of the portfolio being consumed. For example, especially Nutanix Cloud Management, we\u2019re seeing a much higher level of attach of Nutanix Cloud Management to Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure. And so, some of the larger deals with customers are actually being contracted using the new portfolio now, and we\u2019re seeing more of the portfolio, which has upsized our deals and potentially also makes these deals grow faster.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nDave Nwokonko: This is Dave Nwokonko on for Meta. Congrats on the quarter. Just with the CRO transition, I was wondering if you\u2019re seeing any major changes to the sales organization as a part of that transition. And then, I have a follow-up question.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. No, I think, look, Andrew, so as Dom moved on, we made Andrew Brinded our new CRO. And Andrew has been with us for over five years, he\u2019s had a variety of sales roles. He used to run the EMEA region for some period of time. And also most importantly, he\u2019s actually been in the throes of our subscription journey. He\u2019s -- for the last year or so, he\u2019s been our Chief Operating Officer inside of sales. And so, he\u2019s been driving the entire transformation of the sales organization. So he\u2019s very well set. We\u2019ve got a very good -- continue to hear and he understands the business. He understands the product portfolio. He understands our customer base. So, it\u2019s been a very smooth transition. The other thing we\u2019ll say, we just had our first annual sales kickoff in three years since 2019 in person last week. And the team left super energized and excited about the vision. We also invested a lot in training and enabling them to go sell. And we\u2019re also reinstating our annual, what we call circular excellence for our highest performing salespeople. So, all in all, I think we\u2019re in a good place from a sales perspective going into FY23.\nDave Nwokonko: Okay. So, it sounds like other than Andrew, not really any changes below that?\nRajiv Ramaswami: No, I wouldn\u2019t say there are no -- there are changes below that. We\u2019ve got some changes below that. We\u2019ve brought on the new person to run Americas for us. He came over from VMware as it turns out. He was from their enterprise business and we now lead for Americas team. So, there have been changes underneath for sure, but there is a lot of continuity and knowledge of the base as well. So, we feel very good about the sales leadership team that\u2019s in place right now. Not just at Andrew\u2019s level, but also the level below and a couple of levels deeper inside the organization.\nDave Nwokonko: Okay, great. And then, just the new reps that you\u2019re bringing on, has that been able to spend some of the turnover that you mentioned seeing last quarter? And do you happen to have, I guess, an estimate of their productivity time line?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think in the fourth quarter, we did see our rep retention improve. Our rep headcount was roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. In FY23, we do expect to grow our headcount modestly from current levels on the sales side, while also continuing to drive rep productivity. So, there is a significant focus on rep productivity. We talk about our new portfolio. We\u2019ve talked about solution selling. We\u2019ve refined our segmentation going in. We\u2019re investing in training and enabling our sellers and they\u2019re getting more leverage through the partners. So, that combination, all of which continues to improve our productivity and it\u2019s been going up consistently.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham.\nMike Cikos: Hi, team. Thanks for getting me on here. I guess for my first question, I know in your prepared remarks, you guys talked about the strong performance here and attributed that top line growth partially to the large -- I guess, a greater number of large expansion deals in the quarter, as well as strength in that renewals base. And I just wanted to see, could you help us parse through those different components as far as what they did contribute to the growth this quarter? How much was the large expansion deals versus the renewals? And the reason for the question is first, just want to see this -- the development of that renewals initiative that you guys keep pressing on. And then secondly, I think it would just help us think through our forecast when we think about potential upside that might have come in this quarter from a greater-than-expected number of those expansion deals. Does that make sense?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Let me try and take a shot at that, Mike. Thank you for the question. So, in Q4, as you alluded to and that we talked about in the scripted remarks, there were a few factors that led to the outperformance. And renewals for us is a business model, right? So, it\u2019s much more than initiative. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve sort of undertaken the last few years to fundamentally change how we operate, and that\u2019s -- we\u2019re starting to see all of that bear fruit, right, over the last several quarters, including in Q4. So, renewals did come in better than we expected, and we expect that performance to continue. The large deals we were referring to are really on the expansion side, they were not so much on the renewals side, but really on the new and expansion side. And those contributed to the outperformance on the new ACV side. And so, when I think about Q4, all of that kind of factored into Q4 outperformance. And as I alluded to, we are also entering fiscal year \u201823 with a healthy level of backlog. The only thing I\u2019ll add is more generally for \u201823, our renewals business continues to perform. Renewals, I will remind you is -- sort of the forecast for our renewals business is really built on what we\u2019ve already sold, right? So we looked at -- we look back at what we\u2019ve already sold to our customers. We know when those contracts are up for renewal. And that\u2019s what the renewals forecast is based on. And as we talked about, our GRR is in the 90% or greater target range. And so, that renewals forecast is very predictable as we look out to \u201823. And we have continued to invest in new ACV growth. Rajiv just talked about sales rep productivity and so on. And so, we do expect new ACV to grow in fiscal \u201823 as well, but that\u2019s -- we\u2019ve moderated our assumptions somewhat in light of the uncertain macro environment. So, realize, we\u2019re not quantifying it for you here, Mike, but hope that color helps.\nMike Cikos: It definitely does. Thank you for providing some more detail there, especially with the predictability of that renewals business, very important when we\u2019re going through our thesis on our side. If I could just ask another question, and I guess it\u2019s maybe more philosophical in perspective. But if I just think about this past year, there has been some turnover, obviously, when I think about the management team. We now have the new CFO with you sitting in the seat. We also have the announcements around the new Chief Marketing Officer, the new Head of Engineering, the new Chief Revenue Officer most recently, which we were talking about on this call. Can you just help us think through the leadership team at Nutanix? Do we have the pieces in place at this point, when we\u2019re looking at the guidance parameters set for this year? Is this a team that\u2019s going to get us to those free cash flow targets that you guys have been articulating now as we think about that fiscal \u201825 target?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Let me take that question here. The companies transition through different phases in their life cycle, as a public company. And as we do that, we think there\u2019s -- it\u2019s natural for there to be some transition in management. And we\u2019ve looked to capitalize on these and the talent market is also quite strong in terms of -- execs. So, we\u2019ve been quite excited about the caliber of executive talent that some that we have hired from the outside and others that we have promoted from within. We believe we have an exec team at this point that brings significant experience and domain knowledge that will serve us well, right, for our next stage where we\u2019re focused on profitable growth. And so that\u2019s, I think -- some of them, like I said, a very natural transition as the company evolves.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Koch [ph] with Raymond James.\nUnidentified Analyst: So specifically on the cost cuts, where are you guys targeting those cuts? Is it all coming on the G&A? Sorry if I missed that. And how do you -- is there some reinvestment that you think you can -- that an opportunity there, specifically with some of your competitors on the sales side? And then, I have a follow-up.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I\u2019ll just give you a high level view. We, of course, look at every function and then we look at benchmarks across every function, but the majority of the impact was in sales and marketing. And within sales, it was mostly non-quota-carrying salespeople. And then, of course, the rest was across all the other functional areas.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then secondly, like, where are you seeing the strength just given the macro weakness, is there specific verticals that you can point to that are holding up better?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Our products are fairly broad-based. So, I can\u2019t point to any single vertical here. But keep in mind, we have a very strong base of renewals. And the renewals business, of course, provides a good foundation. And renewals is already a business that we\u2019ve already sold and needs to be renewed and we renew that with higher renewal rates given the customer satisfaction and the NPS score that we have. So that provides a very good foundation. We, of course, -- this particular last quarter, we saw good strength in financials as a vertical, to your question on verticals. We saw great strength in some regions, of course. I think our Middle East has been a high-performing region consistently for a while, so -- but nothing that stands out.\nUnidentified Analyst: And I guess maybe I\u2019ll put one more in here. So, with this higher engagement that you\u2019re seeing, maybe you can talk about specifically where you think the biggest opportunity is for you guys, given VMware getting acquired? Like, what are you most optimistic about? That\u2019s it.\nRajiv Ramaswami: No. Again, I think -- look, we\u2019re already in a market that where we are doing relatively well in terms of gaining share and even before this news came on and with the portfolio and we are executing and we are very focused on this. Now with this news coming on board, there\u2019s just more customers who are concerned about what could potentially happen. And it\u2019s a very broad base of customers across the world, right? And they\u2019ve all seen what\u2019s happening. They\u2019ve all heard the public -- what\u2019s been said in public. And there\u2019s just more uncertainty, which means -- uncertainty equates to risk and risk means that consider -- our customers have to consider more alternatives. And so, that\u2019s what we see. And like I said earlier, it\u2019s a little too premature for us to comment on this in the sense that we\u2019re not factoring in any major upside from this in FY23 in what we guided and what we\u2019re planning. But in the long term, I think this should result in some tailwind for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nDan Bergstrom: It\u2019s Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking our question. On the supply chain challenges, sounded like it tracked better than expected. That\u2019s great to hear that. Last quarter, you noted they started very late in the quarter, just wondering about the timing of improvement this quarter. Was it -- was supply chain consistently better than you thought, or was there more of a gradual improvement through the quarter?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you for the question.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Go ahead, Rukmini. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. I\u2019ll start, Rajiv, and you can add in. I was going to say that I want to be clear that it did not improve in Q4 relative to Q3. It actually did get worse in Q4, as we expected. It just didn\u2019t get to be quite as bad as we thought, right? I think it\u2019s an important point that supply chain challenges that we saw, the percentage of orders that came in with future start date did increase in Q4 relative to Q3. To your question, I think your question was on linearity and how do we sort of see that play out throughout the quarter. I would say, we do have, just as a general practice, more of our bookings coming in, in the last month and in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. So, that\u2019s a natural linearity. So, it does tend to -- all of the trends are going to reflect that as well. So, I wouldn\u2019t say it was as back end sort of loaded as we saw in Q3, so it was more gradual than that. But it is -- I do want to point out that Q4, we did see a higher percentage with start dates come in, in Q4 than we did in Q3, but it wasn\u2019t quite as drastic in terms of the last couple of weeks, like we saw in Q3.\nDan Bergstrom: Great. Thanks for the clarification.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. And the one more point maybe I\u2019ll add to that is the linearity overall was better as well for Q4, as I alluded to in my remarks, which helps with things like free cash flow, which linearity impacts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Wang with Barclays.\nGeorge Wang: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I have two questions. The first question is any thoughts on the consumption-based model versus subscription? If you look at other software companies, more and more companies are adopting consumption base, which is based on usage versus sort of more fee-based. So just curious if you guys have existing contracts just based on consumption.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. We don\u2019t have much by way of consumption at all here yet. I would say that we do a subscription model. Some of our partners, of course, take there and deliver that consumption-based service. For example, we have a very small but hopefully growing managed service provider business. It\u2019s still really, I would call it, incubation small. But that business -- the MSPs could be selling that as a consumption business. Some of the business partners effectively might go that way. But our business is all just subscription at this point.\nGeorge Wang: Okay, great. So, the follow-up is kind of curious about the cadence of the term compression. You guys talked about kind of for FY \u201823, it\u2019s going to be slightly down. Just curious how that\u2019s tracking versus your target of 2.8 to 3.2 years.\nRukmini Sivaraman: George, I can take that. Thank you for the question. So I would say -- I think if I go back to what Duston had outlined at our Investor Day in fiscal year \u201821 -- and last year, actually in June of 2021, he had said that we expect to settle at about 2.8 to 3. \u201822, for fiscal year \u201822, we came in slightly higher than our internal expectations. We had some large deals that were of longer duration. So, it came slightly higher than we expected in fiscal year 2022. And so \u201823, we do expect term length to go down slightly, not by much, but slightly. And we\u2019ll watch this closely. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any -- will be around that three-year mark is our expectation at this point, and we\u2019ll see how it plays out. Because what we largely do is we let customers kind of choose what ultimately they would like to do, whether it\u2019s sort of a one-year or a three-year or a five-year term, obviously, making sure that economics work for us from our standpoint. But we want to make sure that that is being met while managing for making sure the economics are good, right? So, about three, I think, is what we\u2019d expect, not too different from what we said last year. And we\u2019ll keep everybody updated as that progresses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nJake Wilhelm: This is Jake on for Aaron. Congrats on the great quarter. Just starting out, I was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more color on the degree of macro slowdown you have embedded in the 2023 guide.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, I can take that. So, we\u2019re not assuming sort of a full-blown recession or deep recession or anything like that, Jake. But we are -- I think we believe it\u2019s prudent to consider the macroeconomic environment as we think about just how uncertain things are right now for -- as we all read in the newspaper. And so, I would say, I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve thought about our new ACV, new and expansion ACV and tempered that growth somewhat, right, to make sure that we are factoring that in. So that\u2019s how I\u2019d characterize kind of what we assumed in terms of macro.\nJake Wilhelm: Okay, great. And then, just as a follow-up, maybe could you give a little additional color around the backlog and when you see that drawing down?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Can you repeat that question, Jake? I heard backlog\u2026\nJake Wilhelm: Yes. I was just asking if you could give some additional color around the backlog and how you see that going into 2023.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Sure, sure. Yes, I can. And I think just to maybe finish out actually the answer to your previous question, I do want to reiterate this point about the significant growth in \u201823 since the majority of that growth is coming from actually our growing base of renewals, which we generally expect to be relatively resilient in a challenging macro environment, right? So, that\u2019s part of the thought process here as well. And then, I guess, we\u2019ll be taking into account some uncertainty in the macro as it relates to IT spending into our new ACV billings growth. And then, on the backlog point, we are -- we did exit Q4 with a record backlog, as I said, and we typically use backlog in Q1, and so we expect that to be the case this quarter as well. But overall, between the growing base of renewals and the backlog, which just provides a good foundation for our growth in \u201823 and help reduce the risk of our forecast.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP.\nErik Suppiger: Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on a good quarter. Most of my questions have been asked, but I\u2019m curious, I assume you\u2019re still targeting kind of mid-40s-percent of revenue for sales and marketing as you get into fiscal \u201825. What growth assumptions are you making for headcount as you start looking out?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Maybe I will answer that, Erik. Without giving a specific headcount growth assumptions because there\u2019s obviously a lot of variables go into that as we think about a global company and so on. But I will say that, look, we are committed to really improving our overall Rule of 40 score each year, right, by both focusing on growth and on free cash flow and operating margin, right? So, that\u2019s how we thought about investment. Clearly, we have already taken some actions here as it relates to our overall expense profile. As Rajiv said, the majority of the reductions that we did earlier this quarter were in sales and marketing. And so, we\u2019re going to invest prudently where we need to going forward, keeping in mind that overall sort of pieces are sustainable, profitable growth.\nRajiv Ramaswami: What I would say, just to add to that, we will continue to invest in innovation and R&D for innovation. We\u2019ll continue to focus on continuing improvement in productivity on sales and marketing. With the renewal cost base coming -- renewals growing up at a lower cost base, we do expect that sales and marketing as a function of revenue will continue to drop as we\u2019ve indicated in our last Investor Day. But we will continue to invest prudently for the future, right? We will manage our cost carefully. We will continue to innovate -- invest in innovation. And we will make sure that we are investing the appropriate amount in sales and marketing, but combine that with productivity and make sure that our percentage spend is going down as a function of revenue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.\nBen Bollin: Rajiv, I was hoping we could focus a little bit about -- into the share gain opportunity within hypervisor and hyperconverged infrastructure. How do you think about the longer-term potential from a net new customer perspective as well as wallet share expansion? And any thoughts on how this could influence future bundled sales opportunities? And then, I had a follow-up.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think, first of all that there\u2019s many levers here. It\u2019s not one instant lever, right? I think -- so first, if you look at the core HCI itself, the core -- there really software deference storage regardless of whether it\u2019s running on any hypervisor, right, whether it\u2019s a VMware hypervisor or our own Hypervisor AHV. We see a market opportunity for that continuing to grow as we continue to displace largely 3 tier and continue to improve our win rates versus, say, VMware or other players. So that market opportunity -- I mean there\u2019s still a lot of 3-tier there that can be converted to HCI and run more efficiently with better TCO. So, that\u2019s one piece of it. The second, of course, is we do see more. I mean, at this point, for the folks that use our HCS stack, more than half of them are converted over to AHV. And we will see that, I think, especially with -- now in terms of what\u2019s happening potentially, that will probably continue to go up. And once we get to that path in terms of customers coming to our own hypervisor. And by the way, our hypervisor is included in our offering in our cloud platform. We\u2019re not selling it separately. And when we do that, then we also get to attach the rest of the portfolio, take them to the public cloud. And so, they view that expansion opportunity. We get to attack on Nutanix Cloud Management, we\u2019ll attack Nutanix Unified Storage, our database service and then extend all of this into the public cloud. So, when you look at that sum total of the opportunity here, I think it\u2019s quite significant. And we -- today, we have a well-established position in HCI. But this is beyond HCI. This is for a full cloud platform, including all the other pieces where we don\u2019t have as much share. And I see a lot more opportunity for share gains in those areas as well, right, as we see this conversion happening. And again, I think now there\u2019s more -- given the -- whenever there\u2019s a disruption in the industry, and in this case, it happens to, I think, be somewhat favorable to us at least the long term, it\u2019s only going to help us accelerate this piece of it.\nBen Bollin: Okay. And that takes the second part. When you have a customer that makes the decision to transition from another party to yourselves, could you share any commonalities you\u2019ve seen from those experiences? Any thoughts on average duration? How long you think about that? How long that engineering effort, how big that lift might be, just so we have an idea of how long that tail could last? Thanks.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. We have been doing a lot of migrations over time from, say, EFX to AHV to be very specific there. And we\u2019ve gotten very good at the migration. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of tools to automate that. We have a tool called Move, which actually handles that piece of it. And so that means that customers, once they do the initial planning, they qualify the workloads that run -- they want to run on this platform and they make sure that we have the appropriate ecosystem support needed. Once that initial bit of qualification work is done, the actual move it serves is quite smooth. We can get that done within a couple of months usually. And that part of it is not difficult. Now, the other part that comes into play here is the automation and the scripts that they have potentially invested on top of their existing environment to integrate with the rest of their environment. So some customers don\u2019t do much of that. Other customers do a fair amount of custom work. And if they have done a lot of customizations, then we will have to invest in some services to help migrate all of that automation that they\u2019ve got over to our platform. But that\u2019s also doable, and we\u2019ve done that as well. So, there\u2019s no a lot of critics here that prevents this migration from happening. The degree of complexity can vary depending on, yes, it\u2019s just a simple hypervisor, and hypervisor migration, that\u2019s actually quite straightforward. If it\u2019s a lot of automation that they\u2019ve invested in, it takes a little bit more time and some services that were to make that migration happen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: It\u2019s actually Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. I have a couple of questions. First, Rukmini, you talked about how the percent of orders with future start dates positively impacted the ACV billings and had a larger impact on revenues. Is there a way to quantify what the benefit was versus the guidance ranges that you had given for ACV billings and revenue?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Hi. Thank you for the question. So, I would say that -- as we talked about last quarter, right, in general, revenue can only be recognized in the quarter in which the license start date happens, right, whereas ACV billings, if we do invoice it and collect soon after the bookings is received, right? So, that was my comment on sort of revenue being impacted more than ACV billings even looking forward, right, when you think about what you\u2019ve assumed for Q1 and fiscal \u201823. For Q4, specifically, we\u2019re not breaking that out, Ruplu, but I will say that when -- what we assumed as a percentage of future start dates for Q4, the actual percentage was lower, right, but it was sort of between what we saw in Q3 and what we assume for Q4, right? So it came in somewhere in between those two. And that\u2019s what you see reflected in kind of the revenue numbers and in the ACV billings number, but to a lesser degree.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: And then, can I ask you, looking at the fiscal \u201823 full year guidance, you\u2019re guiding gross margin to 82%, but you did 83% in fiscal \u201822. So, on higher revenues year-on-year, you\u2019re guiding 100 basis points lower on the gross margins. So, any -- how should we think about that? What are some of the drivers for gross margins this year?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. So, I\u2019d say on gross margins, our product gross margins have remained fairly steady, and we don\u2019t expect any changes to that. One of the things we are focused on, and it\u2019s interesting because Rajiv just mentioned services, right? One of the things that we are looking at is making sure that we are attaching services where it makes sense to do so, in situations like the one Rajiv just described, or for example, where there\u2019s a significant portfolio solutions that are deployed, and we want to make sure that our customers are adopting them and using them as they intend to. So, we might see a slight uptick in services as we go through fiscal \u201823 here. So, that\u2019s factored into that 82% guidance that we provided.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Got it. And if I can just sneak one more in for Rajiv. Rajiv, this quarter, you added 620 new customers. I think last year, in the fourth quarter, you added 700. And I think 700 was the average that you\u2019ve done traditionally. But then you\u2019ve also talked about focusing on quality of customers versus quantity. I mean, how do you think about new customer adds? And is this even a metric to focus on going forward? Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. It\u2019s a good question there. So, Q4 for us is seasonally stronger with respect to new customer adds -- than Q3. And we saw roughly in line with that historical seasonality just last quarter as well. Now to your point, we have been focused on higher quality, higher ASP, new logos, more so than just raw new logo count. And that continues. So, this quarter, again, we continue to see year-over-year new logo ASP growth in Q4 as well. So, now, as we go forward, in terms of the new logos, we do want to drive more of this by enabling more partner-based selling. We have this program internally that we call autonomy, which is really enabling partners to go drive business by themselves and also continuing to get some leverage to our strategic partners and making sure that we have the appropriate sales incentives in place. So, we are focused on, yes, continuing to add new logos for sure, but also making sure those are the right new logos coming in with higher ASPs and also with ones that we can continue to build on. So, that\u2019s probably the way to think about it. And so, our business always is going to have some portions with new logos. I mean, if you look at our entire slate, so it\u2019s -- there\u2019s a new business, a new and expansion and then there\u2019s renewals. The renewals business continues to grow. When it looks -- when you look at new and expansion, expansion is a big chunk, right, of what we do because in many cases, our land, first deal with customers who are small and then it continues to grow a lot with many of these customers. And then, the land provides the new fuel to fire over the long term, we continue to provide that. So, all are important. All these three legs of the stool: new logos; expansion at existing customers; and renewals are all equally important to the business model.\nOperator: Thank you. That ends today\u2019s question-and-answer session. And that concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. Against a volatile macro backdrop, we delivered a good fourth quarter relative to the updated outlook we have provided on our third quarter call. We exceeded all our guided metrics and saw continued strong performance in our renewals business. Supply chain constraints with our server partners, while remaining a significant challenge in the quarter, were better than we had expected. While we are aware that the macro backdrop has grown incrementally more challenging for many businesses, in our fourth quarter, we continued to see solid demand for our Nutanix Cloud Platform with businesses continuing to spend on digital transformation, modernizing their data centers and adopting hybrid multi-cloud operating models. During the fourth quarter, I spent a lot of time on the road, meeting with customers in person. I was energized by the face-to-face engagement and struck by their enthusiasm for their overall experience on Nutanix products and the strong customer support they have received. These conversations reinforced my view that our unwavering focus on reducing the complexity and cost of IT environment as well as our obsession with customer delight is resonating with our customers. Taking a closer look at the fourth quarter, we delivered bookings well above our expectations, aided by a number of large expansion deals and the continued strong performance of our renewals business. This drove billings and revenue outperformance relative to our guidance. Top line outperformance, diligent expense management and better-than-expected linearity helped us achieve positive free cash flow in the quarter, which was substantially better than our expectations. Given the largely supply chain-driven headwinds that affected our fourth quarter, I believe looking at FY \u201822 in its entirety provides a better picture of the progress we made on our subscription business model transition. Specifically, we saw ACV billings growth accelerate to 27% year-over-year, up from 18% in FY \u201821. We also saw non-GAAP operating margin improved by 15 percentage points year-over-year to minus 5%. Finally, for the first time since 2018, we achieved positive free cash flow for the entire fiscal year. Beyond these financial accomplishments, we had other important achievements, including launching our simplified product portfolio, enhancing our leadership team, making progress with our partners and continuing to delight our customers as reflected in our high NPS scores and strong renewal performance. Overall, I'm pleased with our progress and financial performance in FY \u201822. As I noted, our fourth quarter was bolstered by a number of large expansion deals, including customers, both increasing their use of our Nutanix Cloud Platform and broadening their adoption of adjacent solutions in areas such as storage, Database as a Service and cloud management. A good example was an expansion deal with an existing customer who is a global Fortune 100 financial services firm that placed a double-digit million dollar order to broaden their usage of our core Nutanix Cloud Platform while standardizing on Nutanix Database Service for managing and deploying their databases throughout their organization. This customer also plans to utilize NC2 on AWS to enable bursting into the public cloud with their Nutanix-based workloads. We see this customer as a great example of how we are able to land and expand with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Our largest new customer win in the quarter was with an EMEA-based financial services provider that we're looking to modernize their 3-tier infrastructure with the aim of improving scalability, performance and management resources required to support future growth objectives while also providing a path for seamless access to the public cloud. They chose our Nutanix Cloud Platform full stack offering as well as Nutanix Cloud Management due to its simplicity and built-in automation for Infrastructure as a Service. They also added Nutanix Unified Storage and Nutanix Database Service for their storage and database automation needs, respectively. This win is a great example of customers seeing the benefits of adopting our full stack. On the product front, we were excited to announce that NC2 on Azure progressed to public preview during the quarter, which will significantly broaden the pool of customers for our cloud offerings. One of our first customers onboarded to NC2 on Azure is a leading global brewer based in EMEA that has standardized our Nutanix Cloud Platform for all of its business-critical applications and SQL travel workloads. This customer chose Nutanix due to its simplicity, performance, ease of management and ability to seamlessly burst into the public cloud of their choice. Another exciting product development was the recent release of AOS 6.5, a comprehensive and feature-packed release which reflects our continued investment and innovation in our platform. Release 6.5 has features focused on improving performance, security and integrated data services required for demanding database workloads and business-critical applications. Go-to-market leverage with partners is one of my top priorities, and we continue to see progress on this front during the fourth quarter. Our partnership with Red Hat, with whom we have a growing number of joint wins for both OpenShift and Red Hat Enterprise Linux workloads running on Nutanix Cloud Platform continues to show good momentum. One example of a joint win in Q4 is a central bank of a country in the EMEA region that shifted their business critical applications running on Red Hat OpenShift from a competing 3-tier solution to Nutanix Cloud Platform, including our AHV Hypervisor due to the resiliency, scalability and reduced total cost of ownership offered by our solutions. We are excited about the growing opportunity pipeline we see with Red Hat. Also on the partner front, we were pleased to be named 2022 HPE GreenLake Ecosystem Partner of the Year. We view this award as a testament to our growing partnership with HPE. Now I'd like to comment on our recent sales leadership transition. Following Dom Delfino's decision to pursue an opportunity with another technology company, on August 1st, we appointed Andrew Brinded as our new Chief Revenue Officer. Andrew has been with us as a sales leader for over five years, most recently as our Senior Vice President and Worldwide Sales Chief Operating Officer, and has developed a deep understanding of our business model, go-to-market strategies and sales operations. Our sales organization is in excellent hands under Andrew's leadership, and I look forward to working closely with him in his new role. More broadly, I feel confident that we've got the team in place to take Nutanix to its next stage of profitable growth. In closing, I'd like to provide some thoughts on our priorities and outlook. First, our overarching priority remains driving towards sustainable, profitable growth. To enable this, we will continue to judiciously invest in the growth of the business, execute on our growing base of renewals and diligently manage expense levels. Towards this end, as part of our comprehensive review of our business and operating model and along with a number of other expense reduction actions, we made a difficult decision to reduce our headcount by approximately 4%. This is not a decision we made lightly, but it was important to ensuring that we could continue to drive towards profitable growth in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios. However, we're also seeing businesses continuing to prioritize digital transformation and believe the challenging macro backdrop is providing further incentive for them to optimize their IT and cloud spend. We see these dynamics as playing to the strength of our hybrid multi-cloud platform, which enables companies to reduce the complexity and cost of their IT environments. Finally, we see the business achieving positive non-GAAP operating income and continuing to be free cash flow positive in FY23. We plan to do this through a combination of strong continued top line growth and diligent expense management. We remain confident about the opportunity ahead of us and enter FY23 with a sense of excitement and cautious optimism. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini? Yes. I'll give you a couple of points there first. Yes, there is definitely a higher level of engagement from VMware customers as a result of what's going on out there, and they're more open to discussions with us. They're also seeing more talent out there looking -- from VMware looking for new career opportunities. Now, with respect to the portfolio itself, we feel very good about where our portfolio is at this point. We have a complete cloud platform that -- and if you look at our fundamental differentiation, the platform provides a lot of simplicity. We make these problems really, really simple, right? And it's from the beginning -- we haven't put together 2 or 3 different products to build a solution actually. We've engineered assets from the very beginning. That's number one, simplicity. The second is the freedom of choice that we provide to our customers, no lock in. The third is our focus on customer delight, which is becoming even more critical now these days in terms of how we support our customers for the long-term. And the last bit is about our architecture and how we manage all forms of data. So, from a portfolio perspective, we have a very competitive portfolio. Our win rates continue to increase related to our competition against both, our large competitors as well as our legacy 3-tier competition. So, we feel pretty good about the product side of this. Yes. I think this is -- it's a good question, Pinjalim. What I'll say is we've definitely seen a much higher level of engagement with customers being much more open, and of course, they're concerned in terms of what might potentially happen. And so, the level of engagement has definitely gone up for us. Now, in terms of what we've assumed on how quickly this stands and -- they're not assuming any meaningful benefit from this in our fiscal \u201823 outlook. We do expect to see some long-term benefits from this action [ph] as customers will look for alternatives. So, that's what I would say for the VMware Broadcom situation. Now, in terms of the portfolio itself -- to your question on the portfolio, we're certainly seeing good traction with our new portfolio. It's helping definitely upsize deals in the sense that we are seeing more of the portfolio being consumed. For example, especially Nutanix Cloud Management, we're seeing a much higher level of attach of Nutanix Cloud Management to Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure. And so, some of the larger deals with customers are actually being contracted using the new portfolio now, and we're seeing more of the portfolio, which has upsized our deals and potentially also makes these deals grow faster. Yes. No, I think, look, Andrew, so as Dom moved on, we made Andrew Brinded our new CRO. And Andrew has been with us for over five years, he's had a variety of sales roles. He used to run the EMEA region for some period of time. And also most importantly, he's actually been in the throes of our subscription journey. He's -- for the last year or so, he's been our Chief Operating Officer inside of sales. And so, he's been driving the entire transformation of the sales organization. So he's very well set. We've got a very good -- continue to hear and he understands the business. He understands the product portfolio. He understands our customer base. So, it's been a very smooth transition. The other thing we'll say, we just had our first annual sales kickoff in three years since 2019 in person last week. And the team left super energized and excited about the vision. We also invested a lot in training and enabling them to go sell. And we're also reinstating our annual, what we call circular excellence for our highest performing salespeople. So, all in all, I think we're in a good place from a sales perspective going into FY23. No, I wouldn't say there are no -- there are changes below that. We've got some changes below that. We've brought on the new person to run Americas for us. He came over from VMware as it turns out. He was from their enterprise business and we now lead for Americas team. So, there have been changes underneath for sure, but there is a lot of continuity and knowledge of the base as well. So, we feel very good about the sales leadership team that's in place right now. Not just at Andrew's level, but also the level below and a couple of levels deeper inside the organization. Yes. I think in the fourth quarter, we did see our rep retention improve. Our rep headcount was roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. In FY23, we do expect to grow our headcount modestly from current levels on the sales side, while also continuing to drive rep productivity. So, there is a significant focus on rep productivity. We talk about our new portfolio. We've talked about solution selling. We've refined our segmentation going in. We're investing in training and enabling our sellers and they're getting more leverage through the partners. So, that combination, all of which continues to improve our productivity and it's been going up consistently. Let me take that question here. The companies transition through different phases in their life cycle, as a public company. And as we do that, we think there's -- it's natural for there to be some transition in management. And we've looked to capitalize on these and the talent market is also quite strong in terms of -- execs. So, we've been quite excited about the caliber of executive talent that some that we have hired from the outside and others that we have promoted from within. We believe we have an exec team at this point that brings significant experience and domain knowledge that will serve us well, right, for our next stage where we're focused on profitable growth. And so that's, I think -- some of them, like I said, a very natural transition as the company evolves. Yes. I'll just give you a high level view. We, of course, look at every function and then we look at benchmarks across every function, but the majority of the impact was in sales and marketing. And within sales, it was mostly non-quota-carrying salespeople. And then, of course, the rest was across all the other functional areas. Our products are fairly broad-based. So, I can't point to any single vertical here. But keep in mind, we have a very strong base of renewals. And the renewals business, of course, provides a good foundation. And renewals is already a business that we've already sold and needs to be renewed and we renew that with higher renewal rates given the customer satisfaction and the NPS score that we have. So that provides a very good foundation. We, of course, -- this particular last quarter, we saw good strength in financials as a vertical, to your question on verticals. We saw great strength in some regions, of course. I think our Middle East has been a high-performing region consistently for a while, so -- but nothing that stands out. No. Again, I think -- look, we're already in a market that where we are doing relatively well in terms of gaining share and even before this news came on and with the portfolio and we are executing and we are very focused on this. Now with this news coming on board, there's just more customers who are concerned about what could potentially happen. And it's a very broad base of customers across the world, right? And they've all seen what's happening. They've all heard the public -- what's been said in public. And there's just more uncertainty, which means -- uncertainty equates to risk and risk means that consider -- our customers have to consider more alternatives. And so, that's what we see. And like I said earlier, it's a little too premature for us to comment on this in the sense that we're not factoring in any major upside from this in FY23 in what we guided and what we're planning. But in the long term, I think this should result in some tailwind for us. Go ahead, Rukmini. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yes. We don't have much by way of consumption at all here yet. I would say that we do a subscription model. Some of our partners, of course, take there and deliver that consumption-based service. For example, we have a very small but hopefully growing managed service provider business. It's still really, I would call it, incubation small. But that business -- the MSPs could be selling that as a consumption business. Some of the business partners effectively might go that way. But our business is all just subscription at this point. What I would say, just to add to that, we will continue to invest in innovation and R&D for innovation. We'll continue to focus on continuing improvement in productivity on sales and marketing. With the renewal cost base coming -- renewals growing up at a lower cost base, we do expect that sales and marketing as a function of revenue will continue to drop as we've indicated in our last Investor Day. But we will continue to invest prudently for the future, right? We will manage our cost carefully. We will continue to innovate -- invest in innovation. And we will make sure that we are investing the appropriate amount in sales and marketing, but combine that with productivity and make sure that our percentage spend is going down as a function of revenue. Yes. I think, first of all that there's many levers here. It's not one instant lever, right? I think -- so first, if you look at the core HCI itself, the core -- there really software deference storage regardless of whether it's running on any hypervisor, right, whether it's a VMware hypervisor or our own Hypervisor AHV. We see a market opportunity for that continuing to grow as we continue to displace largely 3 tier and continue to improve our win rates versus, say, VMware or other players. So that market opportunity -- I mean there's still a lot of 3-tier there that can be converted to HCI and run more efficiently with better TCO. So, that's one piece of it. The second, of course, is we do see more. I mean, at this point, for the folks that use our HCS stack, more than half of them are converted over to AHV. And we will see that, I think, especially with -- now in terms of what's happening potentially, that will probably continue to go up. And once we get to that path in terms of customers coming to our own hypervisor. And by the way, our hypervisor is included in our offering in our cloud platform. We're not selling it separately. And when we do that, then we also get to attach the rest of the portfolio, take them to the public cloud. And so, they view that expansion opportunity. We get to attack on Nutanix Cloud Management, we'll attack Nutanix Unified Storage, our database service and then extend all of this into the public cloud. So, when you look at that sum total of the opportunity here, I think it's quite significant. And we -- today, we have a well-established position in HCI. But this is beyond HCI. This is for a full cloud platform, including all the other pieces where we don't have as much share. And I see a lot more opportunity for share gains in those areas as well, right, as we see this conversion happening. And again, I think now there's more -- given the -- whenever there's a disruption in the industry, and in this case, it happens to, I think, be somewhat favorable to us at least the long term, it's only going to help us accelerate this piece of it. Yes. We have been doing a lot of migrations over time from, say, EFX to AHV to be very specific there. And we've gotten very good at the migration. We've gotten a lot of tools to automate that. We have a tool called Move, which actually handles that piece of it.

            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. The fourth quarter of fiscal \u201822 came in better than the expectations that we had set forth in our last earnings call, as indicated earlier this month. ACV billings for Q4 were $193 million, above our guidance range of $175 million to $185 million. The outperformance was due to both, renewals and the new ACV bookings coming in better than expected. Q4 also benefited from a few large deals, which are harder to forecast. New logo additions in Q4 were around 620. ARR at the end of Q4 was $1.202 billion and grew 37% year-over-year. Average contract duration was 3.2 years in Q4, flat from 3.2 years in Q3. Revenue for Q4 was $386 million, above our guidance range of $340 million to $360 million. As described during our last earnings call, the percentage of orders with future start dates was a key assumption in our Q4 guidance. This percentage came in higher than it was in Q3 \u201822, as expected, but not as high as our forecast. This also positively impacted ACV billings and revenue performance relative to guidance with a larger impact on revenue. While our largest server partner had almost no impact from supply chain challenges during our Q4, we did see a significant percentage of orders with future start dates from other server partners. Sales rep productivity increased year-over-year in Q4. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 82.6%, higher than our guidance range of 79% to 80% because of higher than expected revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses for Q4 came in at $356 million, better than our guidance range of $360 million to $365 million. Non-GAAP net loss for Q4 was $38 million or $0.17 per share. Billings linearity was good in Q4 and better than our forecast. DSOs were 30 days in Q4, down from 40 days in Q3. Free cash flow in Q4 was significantly better than expected at positive $23 million, while we have previously expected a significant use of cash. This was driven by three factors: one, our bookings and billings coming in higher than expected; two, linearity of billings was better than expected and in line with historical linearity; and three, diligent expense management. We closed the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.324 billion, up slightly from $1.3 billion in Q3 \u201822. Moving to full year fiscal year \u201822 results. ACV billings in fiscal year \u201822 was $756 million, representing strong growth of 27% year-over-year compared to year-over-year growth of 18% in fiscal year \u201821. New ACV billings grew year-over-year but came in below our expectations, largely due to the challenges identified in Q4, while renewals ACV billings outperformed our expectations. As we transition more fully to a subscription model with total ACV billings and revenue guidance, along with disclosure around metrics such as ARR, we no longer plan to share the breakdown between new ACV billings and renewals ACV billings. Our gross retention rate, or GRR, for fiscal year \u201822 continued to be within our 90% or greater target range. Net retention rate for fiscal year \u201822 was around 125%. Revenue for fiscal year \u201822 was $1.581 billion and grew at 13% year-over-year, returning to double-digit growth for the first time since the start of our subscription journey, despite the impact of increased future start dates in Q4 \u201822. Non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal year \u201822 was 83%, greater than our guidance of approximately 82%, largely due to revenue coming in higher than expected. We delivered meaningful operating leverage as non-GAAP operating margin went from negative 20% in fiscal year \u201821 to negative 5% in fiscal year \u201822. We generated free cash flow of approximately $18 million in fiscal year \u201822, the first year of positive free cash flow since fiscal year \u201818 and since the beginning of our subscription journey. Fiscal year \u201822 was a significant year as we saw the thesis around our subscription business model and diligent expense management start to bear fruit, with renewals performing better than expected and positive free cash flow for the year. As we have demonstrated over the last couple of years, we expect to continue to make steady progress each year towards continued top line growth and profitability. Now turning to Q1 guidance. The guidance for Q1 \u201823 is as follows: ACV billings of $210 million to $215 million, a year-over-year growth of 16% at the midpoint; revenue of $410 million to $415 million, year-over-year growth of 9% at the midpoint; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 82%; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately negative 6% with non-GAAP operating expenses of $360 million to $365 million; weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $229 million. I'll now provide some context around our Q1 guidance. First, the top-line guidance for Q1 assumes that supply chain dynamics would remain more or less the same compared to Q4 \u201822. It also assumes that contract durations stay approximately flat to slightly down in Q1 \u201823 compared to Q4 \u201822, given that Q1 is a seasonally strong U.S. federal quarter, which typically has lower contract duration. Second, in line with our stated priority of driving towards sustainable, profitable growth, we conducted detailed expense reviews as part of our annual planning process. Earlier this month, we made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by letting go of approximately 270 employees, about 4% of our total headcount which we expect to result in estimated annualized expense reduction of approximately $55 million to $60 million. Finally, we expect free cash flow to be around breakeven for Q1 \u201823 after factoring in approximately $20 million of onetime severance payments related to the headcount reductions in Q1. Excluding those onetime payments, free cash flow expectations for Q1 \u201823 would have been around $20 million. Moving to full year expectations. The guidance for fiscal year \u201823 is as follows: ACV billings of $895 million to $900 million, year-over-year growth of 19% at the midpoint; revenue of $1.77 billion to $1.78 billion, year-over-year growth of 12% at the midpoint; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 82%; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 2% with non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.41 billion to $1.42 billion. I'll now provide some color on our full year guidance. First, the guidance assumes that contract durations would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year \u201822. The fiscal year \u201823 revenue guidance also assumes that supply chain dynamics would remain more or less the same through the first half of fiscal year \u201823 and would start to ease modestly in the second half of the fiscal year. Growth in ACV billings is expected to be greater than growth in revenue because orders with future start dates that our billed are reflected in ACV billings, but revenue can only begin to be recognized in the quarter of the actual license start date. Second, while the demand for our solutions has remained solid, we have considered the uncertain macroeconomic environment in our guidance. Finally, we expect to deliver about $75 million to $100 million of free cash flow for fiscal year \u201823. We are also happy to reiterate the previously stated target of being sustainably free cash flow positive as of the first half of fiscal year \u201823, excluding the onetime severance payments. Moving on to add some color to fiscal year 2025 expectations. We expect free cash flow margin in fiscal year \u201825 to be around 10% to 15% of revenue, representing at least $300 million in free cash flow. We also expect to continue to make steady progress each year towards becoming a Rule of 40 company by driving growth and margins. With that, operator, please open up the line for questions. Thank you, Jim, for the question. So, let me maybe share a little more context around how we thought about fiscal year \u201823. So, there are a few drivers here that we considered. First, there is -- when we think about our billings and revenue, we talk about both, renewals and our new and expansion business. So first, talking about renewals. As we've talked about before, the renewals business continues to perform really well. And given the growing base of renewals, we expect renewals to grow strongly in fiscal year \u201823 as well. And renewals contribute a significant majority of the growth expected from \u201822 to \u201823. We're also expecting growth in new and expansion business. But when I alluded to the comments around the macroeconomic environment, that's where -- it's in the new and expansion business that we have factored in some conservatism as it relates to the macro environment. And then, we did exit Q4 and fiscal year \u201822 with record levels of backlog. And so, we're factoring that in as well into the fiscal year \u201823 guide. And all of that combined, especially the renewals and the strong and healthy backlog position, helps us to reduce the risk around the forecast. And I think supply chain, as we talked about, Jim, we expect will stay more or less the same for first half and then maybe start to ease modestly in the second half. But that again could evolve, and we'll keep everybody sort of updated what we see related to supply chain as we go here from quarter-to-quarter. Thanks for the question. So, the $55 million to $60 million is the expected annualized savings coming from those reductions. And we are through most of the notifications; several of the headcount reductions are complete. However, as we all know, we're a global company, and so there are some notifications and exits that are still due to happen. We expect them to be largely complete by the end of Q1. And then, we have a few that are outstanding for Q2, but that $55 million to $60 million is sort of an annualized number, Rod, but like I said, most of them are expected to be complete in Q1. And the -- yes, sorry, go ahead, finish your question. I was just going to add, Rod, that the annualized operating expense and operating margin guide factors in that $55 million to $60 million, of course, as you can imagine. So that factors in the actual impact and $55 million to $60 million is the annualized number. Yes. So, approximately $20 million that I mentioned is a fully loaded number, right? So, it includes on-time earnings or salaries, any kind of bonuses that include -- it includes -- the 55 to 60 includes the benefit, it includes all of that, right? So, the 55 to 60 is a fully loaded number for the year, payroll taxes. It's a full number. And like I alluded to, it is a global action that we've taken, depending on what we've seen as our priorities and where we want to invest versus we don't want to or we've sort of decided to optimize in certain areas. So, I'm not providing sort of a breakdown by geography, Rod, but I think it is fair to assume that it was a global action. Yes. Pinjalim, thank you for the question. Yes. So, on renewals, I guess, we're not assuming anything sort of beyond what we've actually delivered. So, I want to be clear on the renewal piece, they're continuing -- assuming continued performance in the renewals business. And to your question on the new and expansion business, what we're assuming is that this business will be impacted in some way by supply chain. Again, we're seeing solid demand so far, Pinjalim. So, it's not so much elongation. We haven't seen an elongation in deep cycles or anything like that so far. So, we're assuming that effectively the growth in new and expansion business will be -- may be impacted by macro conditions, should they happen. So, that's sort of what we factored in at this point. And the last piece that I talked about when thinking about the ACV billings guidance for the full year is the backlog piece, right, which -- it's a healthy backlog number. So, it gives us an additional sort of benefit of reduced stress thinking about fiscal \u201823? Let me try and take a shot at that, Mike. Thank you for the question. So, in Q4, as you alluded to and that we talked about in the scripted remarks, there were a few factors that led to the outperformance. And renewals for us is a business model, right? So, it's much more than initiative. It's something that we've sort of undertaken the last few years to fundamentally change how we operate, and that's -- we're starting to see all of that bear fruit, right, over the last several quarters, including in Q4. So, renewals did come in better than we expected, and we expect that performance to continue. The large deals we were referring to are really on the expansion side, they were not so much on the renewals side, but really on the new and expansion side. And those contributed to the outperformance on the new ACV side. And so, when I think about Q4, all of that kind of factored into Q4 outperformance. And as I alluded to, we are also entering fiscal year \u201823 with a healthy level of backlog. The only thing I'll add is more generally for \u201823, our renewals business continues to perform. Renewals, I will remind you is -- sort of the forecast for our renewals business is really built on what we've already sold, right? So we looked at -- we look back at what we've already sold to our customers. We know when those contracts are up for renewal. And that's what the renewals forecast is based on. And as we talked about, our GRR is in the 90% or greater target range. And so, that renewals forecast is very predictable as we look out to \u201823. And we have continued to invest in new ACV growth. Rajiv just talked about sales rep productivity and so on. And so, we do expect new ACV to grow in fiscal \u201823 as well, but that's -- we've moderated our assumptions somewhat in light of the uncertain macro environment. So, realize, we're not quantifying it for you here, Mike, but hope that color helps. Thank you for the question. Yes. I'll start, Rajiv, and you can add in. I was going to say that I want to be clear that it did not improve in Q4 relative to Q3. It actually did get worse in Q4, as we expected. It just didn't get to be quite as bad as we thought, right? I think it's an important point that supply chain challenges that we saw, the percentage of orders that came in with future start date did increase in Q4 relative to Q3. To your question, I think your question was on linearity and how do we sort of see that play out throughout the quarter. I would say, we do have, just as a general practice, more of our bookings coming in, in the last month and in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. So, that's a natural linearity. So, it does tend to -- all of the trends are going to reflect that as well. So, I wouldn't say it was as back end sort of loaded as we saw in Q3, so it was more gradual than that. But it is -- I do want to point out that Q4, we did see a higher percentage with start dates come in, in Q4 than we did in Q3, but it wasn't quite as drastic in terms of the last couple of weeks, like we saw in Q3. Yes. And the one more point maybe I'll add to that is the linearity overall was better as well for Q4, as I alluded to in my remarks, which helps with things like free cash flow, which linearity impacts. George, I can take that. Thank you for the question. So I would say -- I think if I go back to what Duston had outlined at our Investor Day in fiscal year \u201821 -- and last year, actually in June of 2021, he had said that we expect to settle at about 2.8 to 3. \u201822, for fiscal year \u201822, we came in slightly higher than our internal expectations. We had some large deals that were of longer duration. So, it came slightly higher than we expected in fiscal year 2022. And so \u201823, we do expect term length to go down slightly, not by much, but slightly. And we'll watch this closely. I don't think there's any -- will be around that three-year mark is our expectation at this point, and we'll see how it plays out. Because what we largely do is we let customers kind of choose what ultimately they would like to do, whether it's sort of a one-year or a three-year or a five-year term, obviously, making sure that economics work for us from our standpoint. But we want to make sure that that is being met while managing for making sure the economics are good, right? So, about three, I think, is what we'd expect, not too different from what we said last year. And we'll keep everybody updated as that progresses. Yes, I can take that. So, we're not assuming sort of a full-blown recession or deep recession or anything like that, Jake. But we are -- I think we believe it's prudent to consider the macroeconomic environment as we think about just how uncertain things are right now for -- as we all read in the newspaper. And so, I would say, I think that's why we've thought about our new ACV, new and expansion ACV and tempered that growth somewhat, right, to make sure that we are factoring that in. So that's how I'd characterize kind of what we assumed in terms of macro. Can you repeat that question, Jake? I heard backlog... Sure, sure. Yes, I can. And I think just to maybe finish out actually the answer to your previous question, I do want to reiterate this point about the significant growth in \u201823 since the majority of that growth is coming from actually our growing base of renewals, which we generally expect to be relatively resilient in a challenging macro environment, right? So, that's part of the thought process here as well. And then, I guess, we'll be taking into account some uncertainty in the macro as it relates to IT spending into our new ACV billings growth. And then, on the backlog point, we are -- we did exit Q4 with a record backlog, as I said, and we typically use backlog in Q1, and so we expect that to be the case this quarter as well. But overall, between the growing base of renewals and the backlog, which just provides a good foundation for our growth in \u201823 and help reduce the risk of our forecast. Yes. Maybe I will answer that, Erik. Without giving a specific headcount growth assumptions because there's obviously a lot of variables go into that as we think about a global company and so on. But I will say that, look, we are committed to really improving our overall Rule of 40 score each year, right, by both focusing on growth and on free cash flow and operating margin, right? So, that's how we thought about investment. Clearly, we have already taken some actions here as it relates to our overall expense profile. As Rajiv said, the majority of the reductions that we did earlier this quarter were in sales and marketing. And so, we're going to invest prudently where we need to going forward, keeping in mind that overall sort of pieces are sustainable, profitable growth. Yes. Hi. Thank you for the question. So, I would say that -- as we talked about last quarter, right, in general, revenue can only be recognized in the quarter in which the license start date happens, right, whereas ACV billings, if we do invoice it and collect soon after the bookings is received, right? So, that was my comment on sort of revenue being impacted more than ACV billings even looking forward, right, when you think about what you've assumed for Q1 and fiscal \u201823. For Q4, specifically, we're not breaking that out, Ruplu, but I will say that when -- what we assumed as a percentage of future start dates for Q4, the actual percentage was lower, right, but it was sort of between what we saw in Q3 and what we assume for Q4, right? So it came in somewhere in between those two. And that's what you see reflected in kind of the revenue numbers and in the ACV billings number, but to a lesser degree. Yes. So, I'd say on gross margins, our product gross margins have remained fairly steady, and we don't expect any changes to that. One of the things we are focused on, and it's interesting because Rajiv just mentioned services, right? One of the things that we are looking at is making sure that we are attaching services where it makes sense to do so, in situations like the one Rajiv just described, or for example, where there's a significant portfolio solutions that are deployed, and we want to make sure that our customers are adopting them and using them as they intend to. So, we might see a slight uptick in services as we go through fiscal \u201823 here. So, that's factored into that 82% guidance that we provided."

Lastly, Nutanix management will be participating in the 42nd Annual William Blair Growth Stock Conference on June 6th. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. Against a volatile macro backdrop, we delivered another solid quarter, exceeding all our guided metrics and seeing continued strong performance in our renewables business. We continue to see solid demand for our Nutanix cloud platform, driven by businesses looking to accelerate their digital transformation, modernize their data centers and adopt hybrid multi-cloud operating model. That said, the quarter didn't finish as we had expected. Late in the third quarter, when we typically book a significant portion of our orders, we saw an unexpected impact from challenges that limited our upside in the quarter and affected our outlook for the fourth quarter. Increased hardware supply chain delays resulted in an increasing percentage of our orders having start dates in future quarters, or in some cases being delayed, pending availability of hardware. This affected both our billings and revenue upside in Q3, and we expect this trend to continue in Q4. In addition, after seeing our attrition rate among sales improved for each of the prior two quarters. We saw it worsen in Q3, driving a lower than expected rep headcount entering Q4. Rukmini will discuss these issues in more detail in her prepared remarks. Overall, our third quarter reflected continued execution on our subscription model and was marked by solid topline and improving bottom line performance. We delivered ACV billings growth of 28%, bolstered by strong execution on our building base of renewables. Our revenue, which continues to be affected by term compression grew 17%. Topline growth, combined with diligent expense management and leverage from renewals drove a sharp year-over-year improvement in non-GAAP operating income. While timing of collections adversely impacted our free cash flow performance for the quarter. We continue to prioritize working towards sustainable free cash flow generation in FY '23.  Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter financial results. Our largest deal in the quarter reflected healthy adoption of our core Nutanix cloud infrastructure by customers looking to modernize their data centers and deploy hybrid cloud operating models, as well as good traction with adjacent solutions in storage, database-as-a-service and cloud management.  A good example is a seven-figure deal with a large North American based energy exploration and operations company that was looking to modernize their traditional 3-tier infrastructure while adding the flexibility of extending their workloads into the public cloud. This new customer has decided to adopt Nutanix cloud infrastructure, including Nutanix Cloud Cluster or NC2 for public cloud access, as well as Nutanix Cloud Manager for full stack self-service automation, application life cycle management and hybrid multi-cloud management capabilities. The Nutanix solution is expected to enable them to simplify their operations, reduce their support requirements and seamlessly extend their workloads into the public cloud. Another example is an EMEA-based online sports betting platform that are looking to quickly deploy their service in a new region. They used Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure with NC2 to extend their service to a regional AWS location in the Asia Pacific region. Going from proof of concept to live deployment in just two weeks. Using NC2, they were able to expand operations into a new region virtually overnight, while benefiting from the simplicity of a single unified control plane across private and public clouds. We recently launched our updated product portfolio that simplifies our packaging, metering and pricing and aligns our offerings with the solutions we saw our customers looking for.  Roughly one quarter in, we're very pleased with what we're seeing. It's streamlining the quoting process, increasing our competitiveness in all-flash configurations, enabling more high-velocity transactions for our full stack offerings comprising Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure and Nutanix Cloud Management and making it easier for customers to quickly identify solutions for their specific needs. Our largest win in the quarter, a multimillion-dollar order with an EMEA-based company in the financial services sector was a good example of a deal that benefited from the adoption of our updated portfolio pricing and packaging. This new customer, who was unhappy with the performance of their business-critical applications on their existing 3-tier infrastructure, chose our new Nutanix Cloud Platform full stack offering comprising both Cloud Infrastructure and Cloud Management. Due to its simplicity, built in automation for Infrastructure as a Service and total cost of ownership advantages versus competing alternatives. They also added Nutanix Unified Storage and Nutanix Database Service for their storage and database automation needs, respectively. Being impressed by their performance and seamless integration with the broader Nutanix platform. Go-to-market leverage with partners has been one of my top priorities, and we continue to see progress on this front during the third quarter. I'm especially pleased with the momentum with Red Hat as we've been seeing a building pipeline and growing number of joint wins for both OpenShift and Red Hat Enterprise Linux running on Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure. One example is a North American-based financial services provider that were looking to reduce the time and resources required to manage OpenShift on their bare metal servers. They decided to move their OpenShift environment, running their business-critical workloads to Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure, including its AHV Hypervisor, looking to benefit from the simplicity and compelling total cost of ownership advantages of our Nutanix Core platform versus their existing infrastructure. We are excited about the large and building opportunity pipeline that we see with Red Hat. In the third quarter, we continue to receive industry recognition for both our Core Platform and our unified storage solutions. Nutanix was recognized as a major player in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Distributed Scale-Out File System 2022 Vendor Assessment and was also named Customer's Choice in Gartner's Peer Insights program for both hyper-converged infrastructure and files in systems object stores. We are especially pleased with our strong performance in the customer revenue-driven Peer Insights program, which we see as a reflection of our obsession with delighting our customers. Now I'd like to talk about our recent progress on another one of my priorities, developing and attracting talent. First, following Duston Williams decision to join a pre-IPO startup after eight productive years with Nutanix. We promoted Rukmini Sivaraman, previously our Senior Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis to be our new CFO, effective May 1. In the five years with Nutanix, Rukmini has been instrumental in the company's growth and transformation while developing a unique understanding of our company and industry. I see Rukmini's appointment as a great example of the deep bench of talent we have cultivated at Nutanix and believe our financial, strategic, operational and human capital expertise will be a valuable asset, as we continue to execute towards our long-term growth and profitability goals. Please join me in welcoming Rukmini on her first earnings call in a new role. Second, I'd like to highlight the recent appointments of Mandy Dhaliwal, as our new Chief Marketing Officer; and Shyam Desirazu, as our new Head of Engineering. Both Mandy and Shyam are exceptional leaders with proven technological savvy and unique insight into what it takes to build and deliver industry-leading solutions. I see our ability to attract and develop such high-quality talent as reflecting belief in the opportunity that's in front of us and feel confident that we've got the team in place to take Nutanix to its next stage of profitable growth. In closing, in our third quarter, we delivered another quarter of solid growth, exceeding all of our guided metrics. We continue to see solid adoption of our Nutanix Cloud platform, from customers choosing Nutanix to modernize their infrastructure and enable their transition from on-prem to hybrid multi-cloud operating models. And we continue to execute well on a building base of subscription renewals, which we see as a reflection of both the strength of our team and our customers' high level of satisfaction with our products. While I'm disappointed with a weaker Q4 outlook, due to the aforementioned supply chain and sales rep headcount issues. We don't believe our reduced outlook is a reflection of any change in our market opportunity or demand for our solutions. That said, we are focused on mitigating the impact of these challenges and continuing to drive towards profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv. I am honored to join you all today for my first Nutanix earnings call. Getting directly to Q3 performance. Q3 was a solid quarter, and we beat all our guided metrics. ACV billings was $205 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 28%, exceeding our guidance range of $195 million to $200 million. Our renewals business continues to do well, and the ACV billings upside in Q3 was due to renewals performing better than expected. Gross retention rate, GRR, was in line with our expectations. Revenue for Q3 was $404 million, representing year-over-year growth of 17%, exceeding our guidance range of $395 million to $400 million. Growth in ACV billings was greater than growth in revenue, because orders with future start dates that are booked and collected are reflected in ACV billings, but revenue can only begin to be recognized in the quarter of the actual license start date and also because of slight term compression from 3.3 years in Q3 2021 to 3.2 years in Q3 2022. ARR at the end of Q3 was $1.114 billion, growing at 46% year-over-year. Q3 sales productivity was in line with our expectations. However, we ended Q3 with fewer reps than planned as the talent market remained highly competitive. As Rajiv mentioned, we saw rep attrition worse than in Q3, resulting in lower-than-expected rep headcount entering Q4. Under the leadership of our new Chief Revenue Officer, Dom Delfino, our sales leaders remain focused on getting rep headcount to our target level via both better retention and increased hiring efforts. Our overall company head count grew slightly in Q3. We added 586 new logos in Q3, which is largely in line with our historical seasonal trend in new logo additions from Q2 to Q3. As we've discussed in previous quarters, our sales teams continue to focus on higher-quality new logos, which was reflected in year-over-year growth in new logo ASP in Q3. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83.3% ahead of our guidance of approximately 82%. Non-GAAP operating expenses for Q3 were $342 million, lower than our guidance range of $365 million to $370 million. This is a result of continued diligence on expense management and hiring that was a bit slower than planned. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q3 was negative 1%, which reflects our continued focus on operating leverage as we progress toward our goal of achieving sustained operating profit. DSOs were 40 days in Q3, up from 36 days in Q2. Free cash flow in Q3 came in at a negative $20 million and was impacted by worse-than-expected linearity of billings. We closed the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, up slightly from $1.29 billion at the end of Q2. Before we move to Q4 guidance, I will make a few comments regarding the supply chain. Nutanix transformed that appliance model to a software model starting back in fiscal year 2018 and saw our non-GAAP gross margins grow from the low 60s to our current levels of around 83% in Q3. Our customers run our software on their choice of hardware, which they purchase from server providers, many of whom are our partners. Because we are an infrastructure software provider, customers often prefer to time their purchase of software from us with the purchase of the underlying server from hardware providers. This means that when there are delays in server availability from hardware providers, customers may choose to either: one, line-up the software subscription license stock base with the expected availability date for the servers, leading to us receiving orders with start dates in future quarters; or two, in some case cases, delay their orders until the hardware becomes available. During the last several quarters and until late in Q3, we have experienced minimal impact from supply chain issues. While we have not seen a change in the demand for our solutions, we saw these supply chain challenges impact us late in Q3, which limited our upside in Q3, and we expect these trends to continue in Q4. With that, the guidance for Q4 is as follows, ACV billings to be between $175 million and $185 million; revenue to be between $340 million and $360 million; non-GAAP gross margin between 79% and 80%; non-GAAP operating expenses between $360 million and $365 million; and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 225 million. The significant majority of the impact on our Q4 ACV billings guidance relative to our previously implied guidance for Q4 is due to the impact of increased supply chain challenges, which, as I described earlier, affects us in two ways; one, future start date, that is orders that customers book with us but that are not yet collected; and two, customers choosing to delay placing orders with us, pending the availability of hardware. Our guidance is also impacted by sales rep headcount going into Q4 being lower than planned. Because of the increased uncertainty in the macro supply chain environment we saw towards the end of Q3 and continuing into Q4 and how rapidly it is changing, we are widening our ranges to reflect that increased uncertainty. The guidance assumes that the supply chain challenges continue to worsen in Q4. Absent the supply chain issues, we believe that we would have likely been at or close to our previously implied Q4 ACV billings guidance range. The Q4 revenue guidance is more impacted than ACV billings guidance relative to their respective previously implied Q4 numbers because orders with future start dates that are booked and collected are reflected in ACV billings, but are only reflected in revenue in the quarter of the actual license start date. Our average contract term length is expected to be flattish in Q4. The Q4 operating expenses guidance is well below the previously implied Q4 guidance of approximately $400 million even though it includes about $6 million for an in-person sales enablement event that was moved into Q4 from Q3. Because of the billing dynamics and because we expect linearity in Q4 to remain challenging due to supply chain delays, we expect working capital needs to increase in Q4. As a result, we expect cash usage to be significant in Q4 and higher than the current Q4 Street consensus. Moving on to full year revenue, the guidance for fiscal year 2022 is as follows; ACV billings to be between $735 million and $745 million, representing year-over-year growth of 24% to 25%; revenue of $1.535 billion to $1.555 billion; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 82%; non-GAAP operating expenses of between $1.402 billion and $1.407 billion. As a reminder, full year ACV billings is not a straight summation of the four quarters ACV billings because of the adjustment required for transactions with less than one-year term length. The guidance above assumes that annual ACV billings guidance is 94% of the sum of the four quarters of ACV billings. While our Q4 outlook is lower than our prior implied guidance, we remain focused on profitable growth and continue to prioritize working towards sustainable free cash flow generation and non-GAAP operating margin breakeven in fiscal year 2023. We will look to provide more color on fiscal year 2023 expectations during our Q4 and fiscal year 2022 earnings call in August. With that, operator, could you please open up the call for questions, please? Thank you.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. It's Rutu [ph] filling in for Wamsi today. Rukmini congrats on the new role. Look forward to working with you. My first question is for Rajiv. The two things that impacted you in the quarter, you said were the attrition more than expected of the sales reps and the supply chain issues that impacted hardware availability. Rajiv, do you think these are things that will resolve in the fiscal fourth quarter, specifically when we think about sales rep, I'm assuming you're going to try and replace them. But given the labor shortages, do you think that you can make up the required sales reps in the quarter? And the same question on the supply chain delays, how long do you think this will last? And so should we expect that going into fiscal 2023, these effects linger on into fiscal 1Q as well? So just your thoughts on the timing on when you can replace the reps, as well as on the hardware issues that you're seeing?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So Rutu that -- so first of all, let me start with the supply chain because that was the biggest contributor, right? The vast majority of the lower outlook is because of supply chain hardware constraints. And we saw this really start to come in play very late in the last -- in Q3. Now if you look at that, I mean, until -- again, really until now, we were managing that, right? We didn't have -- we didn't experience any real issues from supply chain, but of course, late in Q3 just started to become much more significant with orders being delayed. Now with respect to the supply chain, we are working very closely with our hardware partners to try and improve the availability of hardware. But keep in mind that we have one step removed, right, because we don't directly supply the hardware. So the ability to influence them is somewhat limited. Now that said, based on what we are hearing from all the server manufacturers and the hardware partners, we expect that these challenges in the supply chain are likely to persist for multiple quarters. Now on the rep headcount, which was a smaller, much smaller component of the issues that we're facing. Now we've been affected by the broader industry trend of greater resignations across the board, right? And we noted in prior quarters that we were somewhat behind our rep headcount targets. Now in the third quarter, after two quarters of improving attrition, we saw a quarter-over-quarter increase in rep attrition. That led to a lower than expected headcount entering the fourth quarter. Now in terms of what we're doing about that, right? So specifically with our new CRO, Dom Delfino is very focused on three things, right, rep retention, productivity of the reps and hiring. Now on rep retention, we are continuing to refine our segmentation and coverage model. And what that will do is, it will result in improved territory coverage and higher level of quota attainment and that's in progress and we expect to really have that ready to go by the first part of \u2013 as we move into our next fiscal year. On the rep productivity, we are doubling down on training and enablement. We are leveraging partner-based selling, and of course, implementing the simplified product portfolio. On the hiring side, since Q3, we've increased our recruiting efforts even more about previous levels. And we are seeing early encouraging results, right, that in terms of getting us back to where we'd like to be in terms of the sales rep headcount. So, I think we're working on both of these issues, right? And I think the supply chain is going to last a few quarters, right? I don't know multiple quarters. We don't know yet, right? And on the rep headcount, we're working hard to get that remedy, asap.\nQ \u2013Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks for all the details, Rajiv. Maybe just another question for you. The new customer count this quarter was 580 new customers. I know in the past, you've talked about focusing more on quality versus quantity. I think the average, if I look at from Q2 to 3Q over the last couple of years, I think it's been around 700. So, I mean, are you happy with this level of customer additions? And given the issues with the sales force, should we focus less on the number of customers that are being added in the next couple of quarters? Do you think that becomes less meaningful of a metric? And should we focus more on things like ACV billings or some other metric?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So Q3 is seasonally weaker than Q2. And we saw a decline roughly in line with historical seasonality in the third quarter, when it came to new logos. Now as you indicated also, we have been focused on higher quality, higher ASP new logos more so than absolute new logo comp. And on that front, we saw a solid year-over-year new logo ASP growth in Q3, which is what we're driving for. So, if you look \u2013 go forward, right, we expect a new logo growth to be driven through enabling more partner-based selling, continuing to drive our partner autonomy program, trying to get more leverage from our strategic partners and by continuing to make sure that we have the right sales incentives in place. So yes, we are focused more on new \u2013 the quality of these logos going forward and the ASPs that we can capture.\nQ \u2013Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And let me just sneak one more in, if I could for Rukmini. I think you had guided average contract term to be flat. I think it went up a little bit from 3.1 to 3.2 years in 3Q. I think you're guiding flat again for fiscal 4Q. How do \u2013 how would you say that the growth in your renewables business, how would that be impacting both the ACV billings seasonality, as well as this \u2013 the average contract terms? And should we expect that after 4Q, 1Q average contract term will decline given that the federal business is a more significant part of your revenues in that quarter? So, any thoughts you have on the growth in the renewables business and how should we think about the seasonality of ACV billings, as well as the trend in the average contract term? Thank you.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Thank you for the question. So, on -- to first answer your question on the contract terms. So, I think this quarter in Q3, we had a couple of significant transactions that came in at higher terms, so that's probably sort of 3.2. But I think more generally, I'd say at this point, we are quite close to sort of what we think was where terms will eventually settle, which is around the 2.8 to 3 year mark, which we had laid out previously. So we're quite close to that level, right? So it fluctuates a little bit as you're seeing, I think, here and what we are projecting for Q4 as well. And we expect that to again maybe trend down slightly, but not too dramatically at this point, given where we are and how close we are to the sort of where we think we'll settle. I think your second question was on the seasonality as it relates to renewals and what that does for ACV billings, and what I'll say in renewals as we talked about, I think, on the \u2013 in the prepared remarks, right, renewals which is continues performed really well for us overall. And I think what it does is we do see the available to renew or ATR, which I think we talked about before on these calls, does go up in general over time, as the base of renewals continues to build. So I would say that, renewals in general is less seasonal than new ACV overall. But as you can imagine, right renewals is just at this point, outflow of when those orders came in going back, right? If the new business that we booked three years ago, two years ago, is \u2013 has that seasonality, the available to renew also has some of that seasonality, right? So it's not perfectly correlated, but I hope that answers your question that overall, I think our renewal business is doing really well. We're seeing slightly less seasonality in that business. But again, it follows the same pattern as what new business did few years ago, which is somewhat seasonal between the quarters, right? So \u2013 this is our first sort of full year of renewals, and so we'll continue to watch that closely.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for all the details. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks. I want to continue on the supply chain challenges. Is there \u2013 appreciate the color you just gave, but is there a way to think of the backlog you now have that should come in when supply comes back, or put another way, is your backlog up by roughly the $90 million that you had to guide down for fiscal Q4, understanding there's multiple ways here of how orders get booked or delayed. Are you expecting that $80 million, $90 million then to come in during all of fiscal 2023? And do you think the persistence of these issues actually persist long enough that puts your $300 million to $500 million free cash flow guiding the out year at risk.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Jim for that question. I can take that, Rajiv. So a couple of thoughts, and maybe I'll add a little more color to what we said about supply chain. So as you'll recall, one of the things we said was a significant majority of the Q4 ACV billings guidance relative to what was implied at our previous quarter when we guide for Q3 and for full year, the significant majority of that delta is coming from the supply chain challenges, and it shows up in two ways. One is orders that come in and have future start dates, they're booked, but have to start date, or they don't get booked because customers are waiting for the availability of the hardware. And the way we thought about trying to estimate Q4 is we looked at the percentage of our orders in Q3 that came in with future start dates. And as Rajiv talked about and I talked about, we saw late in Q3 that the percentage of those orders that came in with future start dates went up. And what we are modeling for Q4, we are modeling that percentage of our orders to come in future start dates to go up to increase or worsen compared to what it was in Q3. So that's how we \u2013 that's how we've approached estimating Q4. And I do want to make the point, I think, to your question, Jim, on the revenue piece, right? So, if it's booked and we're able to collect it, it does shows up in ACV billings, and we do, do that even with orders with future start dates. Whereas in revenue, even if we have booked and collected it, it doesn't show up in revenue until the actual date of the license starting. So, those are some of the sort of the nuances there. And to answer your question, Jim, on backlog and deferred and so on, right? So, because of this effect of these increased percentage of orders coming with delayed start dates, we do expect to build some deferred revenue and backlog. But until supply chain starts to improve and we see that percentage start to decrease, we would really not expect to sort of see that upside or that same margin would kind of show up in our topline just yet, right? So, that's how I would characterize thinking about backlog and deferred revenue.\nJames Fish: Got it. And just on that $300 million to $500 million free cash flow, is that still on the table here? I know that's far out, but--\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, thank you for reminding me of that. So I think what we're -- we are in the process of planning for fiscal 2023, as you can imagine. But we are anticipating exiting fiscal 2022, below our earlier expectations and all the increased uncertainty we're seeing in respect to the supply chain. So, what I'm in the position right now to affirm those targets we provided Jim, but we do plan to update our view more generally for 2023 specifically in the Q4 earnings call. However, I will say -- and I think it's worth emphasizing this that we remain focused on profitable growth and continue to prioritize working towards sustainable free cash flow generation and non-GAAP operating margin breakeven in fiscal 2023.\nJames Fish: Okay, fair enough. My follow-up would be on actually the new packaging modules. How should we think about the rank order of these new packaging modules that are being adopted? And after the primary one, what package or two are coming in second or third? I know it's very early, but in what kind of timeframe are you expecting to get that second or third add-on, especially you guys were one quarter into kind of the new packaging? Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So, Jim, I'll take that one. It's still early, but the initial rollout here has been pretty good, right? So, if you look at -- the largest deal of our quarter last quarter was from an EMEA-based financial services company. And this was presented by the use of our new solution-based pricing. And by the way, in that case, they essentially bought the entire portfolio, right? The full Nutanix Cloud Platform, all of it. Now, more specifically, a couple of things we've been seeing. First is more rapid closure of deals, utilizing this new power pricing and packaging. And second, to your question around add-ons, we are seeing a notably higher attach of our Nutanix Cloud Management solution to our Cloud Infrastructure solution. So, at least the new solution packaging continues to be adopted on an increased pace, we expect to see, again, higher velocity transactions and more attach of our portfolio products, which should help in the productivity of our sales reps and our partners.\nOperator: Thank you. The next comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. I wanted to just kind of briefly touch on stock-based compensation as a part of attrition. And just you noted that you were seeing kind of larger-than-expected attrition, was stock-based comp any part of that, just given the reset and valuations kind of across a lot of names, are there any efforts or adjustments that you guys are planning on making as part of, kind of increasing retention of sales reps? And then clearly, it sounds as if kind of the core underlying business is seeing some similar trends. But just whether in any region or any particular vertical, you've seen any kind of slowdown in activity just given macro would just be helpful? Thanks.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So I think on the first \u2013 the two questions, Meta. On the first one, look, I think it's an overall statement around compensation overall, right? That includes, of course, equity and it includes cash compensation. There's clearly some inflationary pressure on that, right? And stock price, of course, has a more salespeople very much are focused on quota-attainment. And a lot of it therefore is focused on enabling them to achieve quotas.  And so, we have -- that's the work that we talked about when it's going to a segmentation, better segmentation, better coverage models, better training, getting them leverage through partners, all of that helps from a retention perspective because ultimately, it gives them a much better shot at achieving or overachieving their quota, right? So, I think that's what we are really focused on there. We're also factoring in some degree of inflation in our wages. This has moved forward and factoring that into our conversation plans. The other thing that I do believe is that some of the companies that we compete with for talent, especially start-ups, maybe increasingly focused on conserving cash and slowing down hiring in this current environment, which should actually help us.  And the second question, I think, was on demand and whether we are seeing any changes in demand around verticals and so forth. I would say overall, our demand remains solid, but our ability to execute against it is being sustained by these supply chain issues, which are causing delayed start dates and delayed orders and to some extent, the shortage of reps as well that we need to focus on hiring back. Overall, on a demand perspective, we haven't seen any notable changes in customer spending. But we are watching the demand and macro backdrop quite closely. Our fundamental demand is driven by accelerating digital transformation, customers modernizing legacy 3-tier infrastructure, running all forms of workloads, including performance or into databases and mission-critical workloads on our platform and extending to the public cloud. So, we talked about a few customer wins during our compared remarks, right, that highlight these.\nMeta Marshall: Got it. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nNehal Chokshi: Yep, thank you. When in the quarter did you start to notice higher-than-expected sales attrition?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Nehal, could you repeat the question, please? I couldn't catch it.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. When in the quarter as you start to notice a higher-than-expected sales rep attrition rate?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Very, very late in the third quarter, literally the last couple of weeks in the quarter, Nehal.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. So, sales and marketing that expense line item was down 10% year and I think 9% below where I think most analysts were -- so would it be fair to say that your sales rep headcount ended up much lower than the 10%. I mean, where is your sales rep headcount relative to your expectations? Is it 10% lower or is it 20% lower 30% lower? Can you give us some indication here? What's the magnitude here is?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yeah. Nehal, we have not quantified exactly where we are at. We are \u2013 let's call it, we're slightly below where we would like to be. And we are doing everything we can to get it back up to where we want it to be going into next fiscal year.\nNehal Chokshi: Got it. Understood. Okay. The last question\u2026\nRukmini Sivaraman: The one thing that I would add \u2013 \nRajiv Ramaswami: Rukmini, go ahead.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Sorry, Nehal, I wanted to add one point there, if you were referring to just sort of the Q3 sales and marketing line item, I did mention this in my remarks, but in case, I just want to highlight that there was about $6 million in OpEx within that line item that was supposed to be in Q3, the sales enablement in-person event that got moved from Q3 to Q4. And so that's now in the Q4 number in the guidance we gave for Q4, but it was not in Q3. I just wanted to point that out as well.\nNehal Chokshi: Right. Yes, very good point. Okay. And then in terms of sales attrition often it is correlated to a weakened the demand outlook as salespeople tend to flock towards where there is demand and away from where there is a weak demand. So pushback on that natural correlation that tends to be out there.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yeah. I think, look, our \u2013 again, I think part of this is, like I said, focusing in terms of making \u2013 refining our coverage model, refining our segmentation, to make sure that our sales reps can hit that number, right? Basically, sales reps need's to hit their numbers and give them every ability to do that. I don't believe it's a reflection of demand, right? The environment is also competitive, right? We've had \u2013 our sales reps typically go, the ones at a trip end-up going in many cases, to these \u2013 start ups, right, in the promise of quick IPO riches. And some of that, of course, is starting to potentially moderate at this point as well. So I don't believe this has anything to do with the demand or the ability to \u2013 for them to go achieve their numbers.\nNehal Chokshi: Great. Great. Thank you for taking the questions.\nRukmini Sivaraman: And the thing \u2013 the other thing I'd add to that rep point is our rep productivity was in line with expectations in the quarter. And if you recall, in the past, you said we expect rep like to go up over time. So that was in line with what we expected, which means that our reps, our productive in terms of bringing in and closing deals. That said, we absolutely are keeping our ear to the ground on demand.\nNehal Chokshi: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nRod Hall: Yeah. Thank you for the question. Welcome aboard, Rukmini. Good to have you aboard or I guess, aboard with the markets anyway. So first question I had for you is your comment on the renewals and the deviation on ACV billings kind of representing upside to your expectations on renewals? I wonder, if you could say a little bit more about that. Are you talking about the high end of the ACV billings guidance range and then what you actually printed so $5 million? And then that, I'm just kind of trying to triangulate into the renewals number from that comment. I wonder, if you could give us a little bit more color on that. And then I have a follow-up question.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rod. I appreciate that. Yeah, so on \u2013 as we said, I think just to emphasize what we said, we said the outperformance in Q3 on ACV billings was due to our renewals performance, right. And I think as we've said, we said this last quarter, our business continues to do really well. And they have largely not been impacted by the challenges that we've talked about in this call, on the supply chain side and on overall rep headcount. Those are predominantly affecting our new ACV outlook. So, that all said, we don't provide the split of new ACV, which is renewals on a quarterly basis, so I won't give that, Rod. But hopefully, that gives you some color on what I meant when I said outperformance for Q3 and renewals doing well.\nRod Hall: Okay. Thanks Rukmini. And then following up that, I guess, just a little more color since there's not really an answer there. On ATR, we were modeling the lower seasonality, obviously, for the quarter. And we would guess that seasonality on ATR is about double -- a little bit more than double what it was. If you look at quarter-on-quarter development of ATR, a little more than double what it was this quarter, next quarter on quarter-on-quarter growth terms. Is that in the ballpark for ATR?\nRukmini Sivaraman: So, can you make sure I understand. So, what exactly is double in your estimate?\nRod Hall: The quarter-on-quarter growth rate. So, when we talk about seasonality, we're talking about ATR this quarter at fiscal Q3, over the quarter before. And so if we look at the Q4 over fiscal Q3, we'd say it's kind of a little more than double what it was in fiscal Q3, but I just -- I would like to triangulate that and make sure that we're kind of in the ballpark at least on that.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, it's not that high. The delta is not double. The growth is not double, Rod, right? There is, as I said, Q4 does have a higher ATR than we had going into -- but there's also, I think, the dynamics we talked about last quarter where there are some dynamics of early and so on, right? So, it's not nearly that large.\nRod Hall: Right. Right. That's a trouble with waterfalling this stuff out. And then I had -- thank you for that and Rajiv, I wanted to come back to you and just ask on the hardware attach. Can you guys -- can you quantify how much of the new software license you're selling are attached to hardware versus not? Is there any way to -- is it most all of it, or is there a proportion of it that really isn't attached to the necessity to ship a piece of hardware along with the software license?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. By the way, I mean, to be clear, we are not shipping the hardware, right? So, we're getting just a software.\nRod Hall: I know that. I'm saying for a customer to take delivery of the new piece of hardware along with the software license, just to be clear, we understand your model.\nRajiv Ramaswami: No, I understand your question, Rod. So, it's hard for us to actually have a pretty view on that. First of all, renewals are all software, right? Renewals are largely independent of hardware, pretty much. So, people, once they have a software license from us, they're likely go to renew that on the same hardware. So, that largely decoupled and our renewals business is not being impacted by all the supply chain or hardware issues. So, really, it comes down to the new orders, right? And out of those new orders, yes, some of those are tied to customers buying hardware, in fact, is a good chunk. And some of it is just them buying software and they may already have hardware available, right, and then is just buying software to go run in the hardware. So, it's hard for us to tease apart and make a clear pattern on much of that. It tends to vary also. So, we don't have a specific proportion that I can tell you, right, what portion gets to be just software-only independent of the hardware, what portion gets to be tied to the hardware. But what we can say is the other side of the hardware, we saw a significant impact it because of the delay in hardware availability.\nRod Hall: Okay, all right. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Please proceed.\nErik Suppiger: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I guess, I was just trying to understand, your customers have some pretty good flexibility in terms of the different platforms that they can choose from. Why weren't they able to migrate from one platform that had supply chain constraints to another?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. And by the way, this is a good question. And exactly look, until last quarter, this is exactly what we were managing, right? And people were -- had the flexibility. But the problem here is, essentially, we're seeing future started across many if not most the several platforms that we partner with. So it's not an isolated issue, and it's not like our customers can go to a different hardware supplier and get what they want. It's an across-the-board and at least with most of the hardware providers that we are partnered with, or how our customers running our software on.\nErik Suppiger: Can you give us a sense? I mean, is it the majority of hardware solutions at this point that are seeing constraints?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. And I would say, the constraints are different across different providers. It's not just one item that\u2019s causing supply chain issue across all the providers; different providers seem to have different constraints in their supply chain. But it seems to be pretty much across all our major partners we are seeing this.\nErik Suppiger: Okay. And is the largest partner at this point is still Supermicro?\nRajiv Ramaswami: We have -- the business at -- Supermicro is still very significant for us, but we do a fair amount of business with HP. We still do a fair amount with Dell, right, Lenovo. And then we have smaller players like Fujitsu and others.\nErik Suppiger: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nJake Wilhelm: Hi. This is Jake on for Aaron. Thanks for the question. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape and maybe what's giving you the confidence that you're not seeing some increased competitive dynamics versus likes of say, VMware or others are maybe a shift in applications in the public cloud.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So, first of all, in terms of win rates in 3Q, we saw actually a year-over improvement year -- improvement in our win rates, both against our largest competitor as well as against legacy three-tier solutions. So that I think is actually going well, right? And we are much more focused on that. Now, with respect to the cloud itself, I don't think the dynamics there have changed, right? I mean the people are continuing to use the cloud for new applications, but we also -- they're also looking at a world where that is hybrid and multi-cloud and workloads are running everywhere, right? And so, we don't -- I mean, the dynamic of moving to the cloud has been there for a while. And we don't think that's changed significantly in any sense recently. And we are participating in that, right, but some of the examples that we've been showing, right, with our solutions in AWS and soon to be in Azure. So we are participating in that cloud journey as well, with our customers. So we haven't seen any significant changes on that front. And on the on-prem side, I would say, our win rates have been continuing to increase year-over-year.\nJake Wilhelm: Okay, great. And then, maybe just as a follow-up, you guys noted demand remains pretty strong. What about visibility, especially in the enterprise space? Are you having any major changes in visibility?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I think the biggest question around visibility is, when we have a set of opportunities in the pipeline, when is that going to be realized in orders? And what is -- how much is it going to come in with future start dates. That's the part that we don't know, right? And we have been assuming that, that part of it is actually getting worse this quarter compared to last quarter. So, the fundamental -- like fundamental demand from our perspective has not changed. But what point can the demand be realized with these hardware issues on, is the question really.\nJake Wilhelm: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you had some thoughts as to whether or not the circumstances will cause your customers to accelerate public cloud adoption and potentially make opportunities for on-premise business for you essentially be reduced, given that if they're facing these kinds of challenges, just building out datacenters, regardless of who the supplier of the software is, does that accelerate public cloud adoption?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, that's a good question. First of all, I will also say that public cloud providers also have to deal with hardware issues, right? They have to deal with their own. But second, I think cloud is a strategic initiative for our customers. So, customers are thoughtful about figuring out what they want to do with the cloud. And it's not largely, we haven't seen them do so in a reactive manner just because they can't get hardware temporarily on-prem, right?  So clearly, people have been going to the cloud for new applications. And for customers who have the Nutanix platform, we provide a very quick and simple way for them to move to the cloud, right? And so, they have our platform, they can also move to the cloud using our platform, and run-on public cloud hardware, that's available in the public cloud.  And we haven't seen a lot of that happening yet, right? Because what customers decide \u2013 they decide what applications they are going to run on-prem and what applications they are going to run in the public cloud. And those applications that they are an on-prem, they have good reasons to run on prem, right? They might be systems of record or they might be mission-critical applications. So, they may have data privacy or locality issues. So, it's not easy for them to just take all of those and take it to the public cloud, right? So, they have been thoughtful. So, I think the answer to your question, Simon, is no, we haven't seen this as a reactive measure of people going more to the public cloud because they can't get hardware on-prem.\nSimon Leopold: Great. And then as a follow-up, when you're thinking about your strategy for rebuilding the sales reps, do you think about trying to essentially hire experienced sales reps, which potentially cost more money or alternatively grooming and developing new sales reps, which may cost less, but take more time. How do you think about that trade-off in the rebuilding process?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think it's a combination of both, right? I mean it's not one or the other. So clearly there\u2019s a combination of people we are having with the experience and with the skillsets. Last year, for example, we graduated many of our inside sales people to become accountant as part of their own career development. And so, that's another thing that we have done in the past and provide a career opportunity for our people to go from, whether they are inside sales, whether they're customer success, to potentially taking on a road as an account rep and training them and taking them there forward to combine with hiring. So, it's both together, it's not one or the other. Great. Thank you for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's Q&A session as well as today's call. Thank you for joining. Please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. Against a volatile macro backdrop, we delivered another solid quarter, exceeding all our guided metrics and seeing continued strong performance in our renewables business. We continue to see solid demand for our Nutanix cloud platform, driven by businesses looking to accelerate their digital transformation, modernize their data centers and adopt hybrid multi-cloud operating model. That said, the quarter didn't finish as we had expected. Late in the third quarter, when we typically book a significant portion of our orders, we saw an unexpected impact from challenges that limited our upside in the quarter and affected our outlook for the fourth quarter. Increased hardware supply chain delays resulted in an increasing percentage of our orders having start dates in future quarters, or in some cases being delayed, pending availability of hardware. This affected both our billings and revenue upside in Q3, and we expect this trend to continue in Q4. In addition, after seeing our attrition rate among sales improved for each of the prior two quarters. We saw it worsen in Q3, driving a lower than expected rep headcount entering Q4. Rukmini will discuss these issues in more detail in her prepared remarks. Overall, our third quarter reflected continued execution on our subscription model and was marked by solid topline and improving bottom line performance. We delivered ACV billings growth of 28%, bolstered by strong execution on our building base of renewables. Our revenue, which continues to be affected by term compression grew 17%. Topline growth, combined with diligent expense management and leverage from renewals drove a sharp year-over-year improvement in non-GAAP operating income. While timing of collections adversely impacted our free cash flow performance for the quarter. We continue to prioritize working towards sustainable free cash flow generation in FY '23.  Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter financial results. Our largest deal in the quarter reflected healthy adoption of our core Nutanix cloud infrastructure by customers looking to modernize their data centers and deploy hybrid cloud operating models, as well as good traction with adjacent solutions in storage, database-as-a-service and cloud management.  A good example is a seven-figure deal with a large North American based energy exploration and operations company that was looking to modernize their traditional 3-tier infrastructure while adding the flexibility of extending their workloads into the public cloud. This new customer has decided to adopt Nutanix cloud infrastructure, including Nutanix Cloud Cluster or NC2 for public cloud access, as well as Nutanix Cloud Manager for full stack self-service automation, application life cycle management and hybrid multi-cloud management capabilities. The Nutanix solution is expected to enable them to simplify their operations, reduce their support requirements and seamlessly extend their workloads into the public cloud. Another example is an EMEA-based online sports betting platform that are looking to quickly deploy their service in a new region. They used Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure with NC2 to extend their service to a regional AWS location in the Asia Pacific region. Going from proof of concept to live deployment in just two weeks. Using NC2, they were able to expand operations into a new region virtually overnight, while benefiting from the simplicity of a single unified control plane across private and public clouds. We recently launched our updated product portfolio that simplifies our packaging, metering and pricing and aligns our offerings with the solutions we saw our customers looking for.  Roughly one quarter in, we're very pleased with what we're seeing. It's streamlining the quoting process, increasing our competitiveness in all-flash configurations, enabling more high-velocity transactions for our full stack offerings comprising Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure and Nutanix Cloud Management and making it easier for customers to quickly identify solutions for their specific needs. Our largest win in the quarter, a multimillion-dollar order with an EMEA-based company in the financial services sector was a good example of a deal that benefited from the adoption of our updated portfolio pricing and packaging. This new customer, who was unhappy with the performance of their business-critical applications on their existing 3-tier infrastructure, chose our new Nutanix Cloud Platform full stack offering comprising both Cloud Infrastructure and Cloud Management. Due to its simplicity, built in automation for Infrastructure as a Service and total cost of ownership advantages versus competing alternatives. They also added Nutanix Unified Storage and Nutanix Database Service for their storage and database automation needs, respectively. Being impressed by their performance and seamless integration with the broader Nutanix platform. Go-to-market leverage with partners has been one of my top priorities, and we continue to see progress on this front during the third quarter. I'm especially pleased with the momentum with Red Hat as we've been seeing a building pipeline and growing number of joint wins for both OpenShift and Red Hat Enterprise Linux running on Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure. One example is a North American-based financial services provider that were looking to reduce the time and resources required to manage OpenShift on their bare metal servers. They decided to move their OpenShift environment, running their business-critical workloads to Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure, including its AHV Hypervisor, looking to benefit from the simplicity and compelling total cost of ownership advantages of our Nutanix Core platform versus their existing infrastructure. We are excited about the large and building opportunity pipeline that we see with Red Hat. In the third quarter, we continue to receive industry recognition for both our Core Platform and our unified storage solutions. Nutanix was recognized as a major player in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Distributed Scale-Out File System 2022 Vendor Assessment and was also named Customer's Choice in Gartner's Peer Insights program for both hyper-converged infrastructure and files in systems object stores. We are especially pleased with our strong performance in the customer revenue-driven Peer Insights program, which we see as a reflection of our obsession with delighting our customers. Now I'd like to talk about our recent progress on another one of my priorities, developing and attracting talent. First, following Duston Williams decision to join a pre-IPO startup after eight productive years with Nutanix. We promoted Rukmini Sivaraman, previously our Senior Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis to be our new CFO, effective May 1. In the five years with Nutanix, Rukmini has been instrumental in the company's growth and transformation while developing a unique understanding of our company and industry. I see Rukmini's appointment as a great example of the deep bench of talent we have cultivated at Nutanix and believe our financial, strategic, operational and human capital expertise will be a valuable asset, as we continue to execute towards our long-term growth and profitability goals. Please join me in welcoming Rukmini on her first earnings call in a new role. Second, I'd like to highlight the recent appointments of Mandy Dhaliwal, as our new Chief Marketing Officer; and Shyam Desirazu, as our new Head of Engineering. Both Mandy and Shyam are exceptional leaders with proven technological savvy and unique insight into what it takes to build and deliver industry-leading solutions. I see our ability to attract and develop such high-quality talent as reflecting belief in the opportunity that's in front of us and feel confident that we've got the team in place to take Nutanix to its next stage of profitable growth. In closing, in our third quarter, we delivered another quarter of solid growth, exceeding all of our guided metrics. We continue to see solid adoption of our Nutanix Cloud platform, from customers choosing Nutanix to modernize their infrastructure and enable their transition from on-prem to hybrid multi-cloud operating models. And we continue to execute well on a building base of subscription renewals, which we see as a reflection of both the strength of our team and our customers' high level of satisfaction with our products. While I'm disappointed with a weaker Q4 outlook, due to the aforementioned supply chain and sales rep headcount issues. We don't believe our reduced outlook is a reflection of any change in our market opportunity or demand for our solutions. That said, we are focused on mitigating the impact of these challenges and continuing to drive towards profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini? Yes. So Rutu that -- so first of all, let me start with the supply chain because that was the biggest contributor, right? The vast majority of the lower outlook is because of supply chain hardware constraints. And we saw this really start to come in play very late in the last -- in Q3. Now if you look at that, I mean, until -- again, really until now, we were managing that, right? We didn't have -- we didn't experience any real issues from supply chain, but of course, late in Q3 just started to become much more significant with orders being delayed. Now with respect to the supply chain, we are working very closely with our hardware partners to try and improve the availability of hardware. But keep in mind that we have one step removed, right, because we don't directly supply the hardware. So the ability to influence them is somewhat limited. Now that said, based on what we are hearing from all the server manufacturers and the hardware partners, we expect that these challenges in the supply chain are likely to persist for multiple quarters. Now on the rep headcount, which was a smaller, much smaller component of the issues that we're facing. Now we've been affected by the broader industry trend of greater resignations across the board, right? And we noted in prior quarters that we were somewhat behind our rep headcount targets. Now in the third quarter, after two quarters of improving attrition, we saw a quarter-over-quarter increase in rep attrition. That led to a lower than expected headcount entering the fourth quarter. Now in terms of what we're doing about that, right? So specifically with our new CRO, Dom Delfino is very focused on three things, right, rep retention, productivity of the reps and hiring. Now on rep retention, we are continuing to refine our segmentation and coverage model. And what that will do is, it will result in improved territory coverage and higher level of quota attainment and that's in progress and we expect to really have that ready to go by the first part of \u2013 as we move into our next fiscal year. On the rep productivity, we are doubling down on training and enablement. We are leveraging partner-based selling, and of course, implementing the simplified product portfolio. On the hiring side, since Q3, we've increased our recruiting efforts even more about previous levels. And we are seeing early encouraging results, right, that in terms of getting us back to where we'd like to be in terms of the sales rep headcount. So, I think we're working on both of these issues, right? And I think the supply chain is going to last a few quarters, right? I don't know multiple quarters. We don't know yet, right? And on the rep headcount, we're working hard to get that remedy, asap.\nQ \u2013Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks for all the details, Rajiv. Maybe just another question for you. The new customer count this quarter was 580 new customers. I know in the past, you've talked about focusing more on quality versus quantity. I think the average, if I look at from Q2 to 3Q over the last couple of years, I think it's been around 700. So, I mean, are you happy with this level of customer additions? And given the issues with the sales force, should we focus less on the number of customers that are being added in the next couple of quarters? Do you think that becomes less meaningful of a metric? And should we focus more on things like ACV billings or some other metric? Yes. So Q3 is seasonally weaker than Q2. And we saw a decline roughly in line with historical seasonality in the third quarter, when it came to new logos. Now as you indicated also, we have been focused on higher quality, higher ASP new logos more so than absolute new logo comp. And on that front, we saw a solid year-over-year new logo ASP growth in Q3, which is what we're driving for. So, if you look \u2013 go forward, right, we expect a new logo growth to be driven through enabling more partner-based selling, continuing to drive our partner autonomy program, trying to get more leverage from our strategic partners and by continuing to make sure that we have the right sales incentives in place. So yes, we are focused more on new \u2013 the quality of these logos going forward and the ASPs that we can capture.\nQ \u2013Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And let me just sneak one more in, if I could for Rukmini. I think you had guided average contract term to be flat. I think it went up a little bit from 3.1 to 3.2 years in 3Q. I think you're guiding flat again for fiscal 4Q. How do \u2013 how would you say that the growth in your renewables business, how would that be impacting both the ACV billings seasonality, as well as this \u2013 the average contract terms? And should we expect that after 4Q, 1Q average contract term will decline given that the federal business is a more significant part of your revenues in that quarter? So, any thoughts you have on the growth in the renewables business and how should we think about the seasonality of ACV billings, as well as the trend in the average contract term? Thank you. Yes. So, Jim, I'll take that one. It's still early, but the initial rollout here has been pretty good, right? So, if you look at -- the largest deal of our quarter last quarter was from an EMEA-based financial services company. And this was presented by the use of our new solution-based pricing. And by the way, in that case, they essentially bought the entire portfolio, right? The full Nutanix Cloud Platform, all of it. Now, more specifically, a couple of things we've been seeing. First is more rapid closure of deals, utilizing this new power pricing and packaging. And second, to your question around add-ons, we are seeing a notably higher attach of our Nutanix Cloud Management solution to our Cloud Infrastructure solution. So, at least the new solution packaging continues to be adopted on an increased pace, we expect to see, again, higher velocity transactions and more attach of our portfolio products, which should help in the productivity of our sales reps and our partners. Yes. So I think on the first \u2013 the two questions, Meta. On the first one, look, I think it's an overall statement around compensation overall, right? That includes, of course, equity and it includes cash compensation. There's clearly some inflationary pressure on that, right? And stock price, of course, has a more salespeople very much are focused on quota-attainment. And a lot of it therefore is focused on enabling them to achieve quotas.  And so, we have -- that's the work that we talked about when it's going to a segmentation, better segmentation, better coverage models, better training, getting them leverage through partners, all of that helps from a retention perspective because ultimately, it gives them a much better shot at achieving or overachieving their quota, right? So, I think that's what we are really focused on there. We're also factoring in some degree of inflation in our wages. This has moved forward and factoring that into our conversation plans. The other thing that I do believe is that some of the companies that we compete with for talent, especially start-ups, maybe increasingly focused on conserving cash and slowing down hiring in this current environment, which should actually help us.  And the second question, I think, was on demand and whether we are seeing any changes in demand around verticals and so forth. I would say overall, our demand remains solid, but our ability to execute against it is being sustained by these supply chain issues, which are causing delayed start dates and delayed orders and to some extent, the shortage of reps as well that we need to focus on hiring back. Overall, on a demand perspective, we haven't seen any notable changes in customer spending. But we are watching the demand and macro backdrop quite closely. Our fundamental demand is driven by accelerating digital transformation, customers modernizing legacy 3-tier infrastructure, running all forms of workloads, including performance or into databases and mission-critical workloads on our platform and extending to the public cloud. So, we talked about a few customer wins during our compared remarks, right, that highlight these. Nehal, could you repeat the question, please? I couldn't catch it. Very, very late in the third quarter, literally the last couple of weeks in the quarter, Nehal. Yeah. Nehal, we have not quantified exactly where we are at. We are \u2013 let's call it, we're slightly below where we would like to be. And we are doing everything we can to get it back up to where we want it to be going into next fiscal year. Rukmini, go ahead. Yeah. I think, look, our \u2013 again, I think part of this is, like I said, focusing in terms of making \u2013 refining our coverage model, refining our segmentation, to make sure that our sales reps can hit that number, right? Basically, sales reps need's to hit their numbers and give them every ability to do that. I don't believe it's a reflection of demand, right? The environment is also competitive, right? We've had \u2013 our sales reps typically go, the ones at a trip end-up going in many cases, to these \u2013 start ups, right, in the promise of quick IPO riches. And some of that, of course, is starting to potentially moderate at this point as well. So I don't believe this has anything to do with the demand or the ability to \u2013 for them to go achieve their numbers. Yes. By the way, I mean, to be clear, we are not shipping the hardware, right? So, we're getting just a software. No, I understand your question, Rod. So, it's hard for us to actually have a pretty view on that. First of all, renewals are all software, right? Renewals are largely independent of hardware, pretty much. So, people, once they have a software license from us, they're likely go to renew that on the same hardware. So, that largely decoupled and our renewals business is not being impacted by all the supply chain or hardware issues. So, really, it comes down to the new orders, right? And out of those new orders, yes, some of those are tied to customers buying hardware, in fact, is a good chunk. And some of it is just them buying software and they may already have hardware available, right, and then is just buying software to go run in the hardware. So, it's hard for us to tease apart and make a clear pattern on much of that. It tends to vary also. So, we don't have a specific proportion that I can tell you, right, what portion gets to be just software-only independent of the hardware, what portion gets to be tied to the hardware. But what we can say is the other side of the hardware, we saw a significant impact it because of the delay in hardware availability. Yes. And by the way, this is a good question. And exactly look, until last quarter, this is exactly what we were managing, right? And people were -- had the flexibility. But the problem here is, essentially, we're seeing future started across many if not most the several platforms that we partner with. So it's not an isolated issue, and it's not like our customers can go to a different hardware supplier and get what they want. It's an across-the-board and at least with most of the hardware providers that we are partnered with, or how our customers running our software on. Yes. And I would say, the constraints are different across different providers. It's not just one item that's causing supply chain issue across all the providers; different providers seem to have different constraints in their supply chain. But it seems to be pretty much across all our major partners we are seeing this. We have -- the business at -- Supermicro is still very significant for us, but we do a fair amount of business with HP. We still do a fair amount with Dell, right, Lenovo. And then we have smaller players like Fujitsu and others. Yes. So, first of all, in terms of win rates in 3Q, we saw actually a year-over improvement year -- improvement in our win rates, both against our largest competitor as well as against legacy three-tier solutions. So that I think is actually going well, right? And we are much more focused on that. Now, with respect to the cloud itself, I don't think the dynamics there have changed, right? I mean the people are continuing to use the cloud for new applications, but we also -- they're also looking at a world where that is hybrid and multi-cloud and workloads are running everywhere, right? And so, we don't -- I mean, the dynamic of moving to the cloud has been there for a while. And we don't think that's changed significantly in any sense recently. And we are participating in that, right, but some of the examples that we've been showing, right, with our solutions in AWS and soon to be in Azure. So we are participating in that cloud journey as well, with our customers. So we haven't seen any significant changes on that front. And on the on-prem side, I would say, our win rates have been continuing to increase year-over-year. I think the biggest question around visibility is, when we have a set of opportunities in the pipeline, when is that going to be realized in orders? And what is -- how much is it going to come in with future start dates. That's the part that we don't know, right? And we have been assuming that, that part of it is actually getting worse this quarter compared to last quarter. So, the fundamental -- like fundamental demand from our perspective has not changed. But what point can the demand be realized with these hardware issues on, is the question really. Yes, that's a good question. First of all, I will also say that public cloud providers also have to deal with hardware issues, right? They have to deal with their own. But second, I think cloud is a strategic initiative for our customers. So, customers are thoughtful about figuring out what they want to do with the cloud. And it's not largely, we haven't seen them do so in a reactive manner just because they can't get hardware temporarily on-prem, right?  So clearly, people have been going to the cloud for new applications. And for customers who have the Nutanix platform, we provide a very quick and simple way for them to move to the cloud, right? And so, they have our platform, they can also move to the cloud using our platform, and run-on public cloud hardware, that's available in the public cloud.  And we haven't seen a lot of that happening yet, right? Because what customers decide \u2013 they decide what applications they are going to run on-prem and what applications they are going to run in the public cloud. And those applications that they are an on-prem, they have good reasons to run on prem, right? They might be systems of record or they might be mission-critical applications. So, they may have data privacy or locality issues. So, it's not easy for them to just take all of those and take it to the public cloud, right? So, they have been thoughtful. So, I think the answer to your question, Simon, is no, we haven't seen this as a reactive measure of people going more to the public cloud because they can't get hardware on-prem. Yes. I think it's a combination of both, right? I mean it's not one or the other. So clearly there's a combination of people we are having with the experience and with the skillsets. Last year, for example, we graduated many of our inside sales people to become accountant as part of their own career development. And so, that's another thing that we have done in the past and provide a career opportunity for our people to go from, whether they are inside sales, whether they're customer success, to potentially taking on a road as an account rep and training them and taking them there forward to combine with hiring. So, it's both together, it's not one or the other. Great. Thank you for taking the questions."

            "name": "Rukmini Sivaraman",
            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. I am honored to join you all today for my first Nutanix earnings call. Getting directly to Q3 performance. Q3 was a solid quarter, and we beat all our guided metrics. ACV billings was $205 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 28%, exceeding our guidance range of $195 million to $200 million. Our renewals business continues to do well, and the ACV billings upside in Q3 was due to renewals performing better than expected. Gross retention rate, GRR, was in line with our expectations. Revenue for Q3 was $404 million, representing year-over-year growth of 17%, exceeding our guidance range of $395 million to $400 million. Growth in ACV billings was greater than growth in revenue, because orders with future start dates that are booked and collected are reflected in ACV billings, but revenue can only begin to be recognized in the quarter of the actual license start date and also because of slight term compression from 3.3 years in Q3 2021 to 3.2 years in Q3 2022. ARR at the end of Q3 was $1.114 billion, growing at 46% year-over-year. Q3 sales productivity was in line with our expectations. However, we ended Q3 with fewer reps than planned as the talent market remained highly competitive. As Rajiv mentioned, we saw rep attrition worse than in Q3, resulting in lower-than-expected rep headcount entering Q4. Under the leadership of our new Chief Revenue Officer, Dom Delfino, our sales leaders remain focused on getting rep headcount to our target level via both better retention and increased hiring efforts. Our overall company head count grew slightly in Q3. We added 586 new logos in Q3, which is largely in line with our historical seasonal trend in new logo additions from Q2 to Q3. As we've discussed in previous quarters, our sales teams continue to focus on higher-quality new logos, which was reflected in year-over-year growth in new logo ASP in Q3. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83.3% ahead of our guidance of approximately 82%. Non-GAAP operating expenses for Q3 were $342 million, lower than our guidance range of $365 million to $370 million. This is a result of continued diligence on expense management and hiring that was a bit slower than planned. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q3 was negative 1%, which reflects our continued focus on operating leverage as we progress toward our goal of achieving sustained operating profit. DSOs were 40 days in Q3, up from 36 days in Q2. Free cash flow in Q3 came in at a negative $20 million and was impacted by worse-than-expected linearity of billings. We closed the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, up slightly from $1.29 billion at the end of Q2. Before we move to Q4 guidance, I will make a few comments regarding the supply chain. Nutanix transformed that appliance model to a software model starting back in fiscal year 2018 and saw our non-GAAP gross margins grow from the low 60s to our current levels of around 83% in Q3. Our customers run our software on their choice of hardware, which they purchase from server providers, many of whom are our partners. Because we are an infrastructure software provider, customers often prefer to time their purchase of software from us with the purchase of the underlying server from hardware providers. This means that when there are delays in server availability from hardware providers, customers may choose to either: one, line-up the software subscription license stock base with the expected availability date for the servers, leading to us receiving orders with start dates in future quarters; or two, in some case cases, delay their orders until the hardware becomes available. During the last several quarters and until late in Q3, we have experienced minimal impact from supply chain issues. While we have not seen a change in the demand for our solutions, we saw these supply chain challenges impact us late in Q3, which limited our upside in Q3, and we expect these trends to continue in Q4. With that, the guidance for Q4 is as follows, ACV billings to be between $175 million and $185 million; revenue to be between $340 million and $360 million; non-GAAP gross margin between 79% and 80%; non-GAAP operating expenses between $360 million and $365 million; and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 225 million. The significant majority of the impact on our Q4 ACV billings guidance relative to our previously implied guidance for Q4 is due to the impact of increased supply chain challenges, which, as I described earlier, affects us in two ways; one, future start date, that is orders that customers book with us but that are not yet collected; and two, customers choosing to delay placing orders with us, pending the availability of hardware. Our guidance is also impacted by sales rep headcount going into Q4 being lower than planned. Because of the increased uncertainty in the macro supply chain environment we saw towards the end of Q3 and continuing into Q4 and how rapidly it is changing, we are widening our ranges to reflect that increased uncertainty. The guidance assumes that the supply chain challenges continue to worsen in Q4. Absent the supply chain issues, we believe that we would have likely been at or close to our previously implied Q4 ACV billings guidance range. The Q4 revenue guidance is more impacted than ACV billings guidance relative to their respective previously implied Q4 numbers because orders with future start dates that are booked and collected are reflected in ACV billings, but are only reflected in revenue in the quarter of the actual license start date. Our average contract term length is expected to be flattish in Q4. The Q4 operating expenses guidance is well below the previously implied Q4 guidance of approximately $400 million even though it includes about $6 million for an in-person sales enablement event that was moved into Q4 from Q3. Because of the billing dynamics and because we expect linearity in Q4 to remain challenging due to supply chain delays, we expect working capital needs to increase in Q4. As a result, we expect cash usage to be significant in Q4 and higher than the current Q4 Street consensus. Moving on to full year revenue, the guidance for fiscal year 2022 is as follows; ACV billings to be between $735 million and $745 million, representing year-over-year growth of 24% to 25%; revenue of $1.535 billion to $1.555 billion; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 82%; non-GAAP operating expenses of between $1.402 billion and $1.407 billion. As a reminder, full year ACV billings is not a straight summation of the four quarters ACV billings because of the adjustment required for transactions with less than one-year term length. The guidance above assumes that annual ACV billings guidance is 94% of the sum of the four quarters of ACV billings. While our Q4 outlook is lower than our prior implied guidance, we remain focused on profitable growth and continue to prioritize working towards sustainable free cash flow generation and non-GAAP operating margin breakeven in fiscal year 2023. We will look to provide more color on fiscal year 2023 expectations during our Q4 and fiscal year 2022 earnings call in August. With that, operator, could you please open up the call for questions, please? Thank you. Yes. Thank you for the question. So, on -- to first answer your question on the contract terms. So, I think this quarter in Q3, we had a couple of significant transactions that came in at higher terms, so that's probably sort of 3.2. But I think more generally, I'd say at this point, we are quite close to sort of what we think was where terms will eventually settle, which is around the 2.8 to 3 year mark, which we had laid out previously. So we're quite close to that level, right? So it fluctuates a little bit as you're seeing, I think, here and what we are projecting for Q4 as well. And we expect that to again maybe trend down slightly, but not too dramatically at this point, given where we are and how close we are to the sort of where we think we'll settle. I think your second question was on the seasonality as it relates to renewals and what that does for ACV billings, and what I'll say in renewals as we talked about, I think, on the \u2013 in the prepared remarks, right, renewals which is continues performed really well for us overall. And I think what it does is we do see the available to renew or ATR, which I think we talked about before on these calls, does go up in general over time, as the base of renewals continues to build. So I would say that, renewals in general is less seasonal than new ACV overall. But as you can imagine, right renewals is just at this point, outflow of when those orders came in going back, right? If the new business that we booked three years ago, two years ago, is \u2013 has that seasonality, the available to renew also has some of that seasonality, right? So it's not perfectly correlated, but I hope that answers your question that overall, I think our renewal business is doing really well. We're seeing slightly less seasonality in that business. But again, it follows the same pattern as what new business did few years ago, which is somewhat seasonal between the quarters, right? So \u2013 this is our first sort of full year of renewals, and so we'll continue to watch that closely. Thank you, Jim for that question. I can take that, Rajiv. So a couple of thoughts, and maybe I'll add a little more color to what we said about supply chain. So as you'll recall, one of the things we said was a significant majority of the Q4 ACV billings guidance relative to what was implied at our previous quarter when we guide for Q3 and for full year, the significant majority of that delta is coming from the supply chain challenges, and it shows up in two ways. One is orders that come in and have future start dates, they're booked, but have to start date, or they don't get booked because customers are waiting for the availability of the hardware. And the way we thought about trying to estimate Q4 is we looked at the percentage of our orders in Q3 that came in with future start dates. And as Rajiv talked about and I talked about, we saw late in Q3 that the percentage of those orders that came in with future start dates went up. And what we are modeling for Q4, we are modeling that percentage of our orders to come in future start dates to go up to increase or worsen compared to what it was in Q3. So that's how we \u2013 that's how we've approached estimating Q4. And I do want to make the point, I think, to your question, Jim, on the revenue piece, right? So, if it's booked and we're able to collect it, it does shows up in ACV billings, and we do, do that even with orders with future start dates. Whereas in revenue, even if we have booked and collected it, it doesn't show up in revenue until the actual date of the license starting. So, those are some of the sort of the nuances there. And to answer your question, Jim, on backlog and deferred and so on, right? So, because of this effect of these increased percentage of orders coming with delayed start dates, we do expect to build some deferred revenue and backlog. But until supply chain starts to improve and we see that percentage start to decrease, we would really not expect to sort of see that upside or that same margin would kind of show up in our topline just yet, right? So, that's how I would characterize thinking about backlog and deferred revenue. Yes, thank you for reminding me of that. So I think what we're -- we are in the process of planning for fiscal 2023, as you can imagine. But we are anticipating exiting fiscal 2022, below our earlier expectations and all the increased uncertainty we're seeing in respect to the supply chain. So, what I'm in the position right now to affirm those targets we provided Jim, but we do plan to update our view more generally for 2023 specifically in the Q4 earnings call. However, I will say -- and I think it's worth emphasizing this that we remain focused on profitable growth and continue to prioritize working towards sustainable free cash flow generation and non-GAAP operating margin breakeven in fiscal 2023. The one thing that I would add \u2013 Sorry, Nehal, I wanted to add one point there, if you were referring to just sort of the Q3 sales and marketing line item, I did mention this in my remarks, but in case, I just want to highlight that there was about $6 million in OpEx within that line item that was supposed to be in Q3, the sales enablement in-person event that got moved from Q3 to Q4. And so that's now in the Q4 number in the guidance we gave for Q4, but it was not in Q3. I just wanted to point that out as well. And the thing \u2013 the other thing I'd add to that rep point is our rep productivity was in line with expectations in the quarter. And if you recall, in the past, you said we expect rep like to go up over time. So that was in line with what we expected, which means that our reps, our productive in terms of bringing in and closing deals. That said, we absolutely are keeping our ear to the ground on demand. Thank you, Rod. I appreciate that. Yeah, so on \u2013 as we said, I think just to emphasize what we said, we said the outperformance in Q3 on ACV billings was due to our renewals performance, right. And I think as we've said, we said this last quarter, our business continues to do really well. And they have largely not been impacted by the challenges that we've talked about in this call, on the supply chain side and on overall rep headcount. Those are predominantly affecting our new ACV outlook. So, that all said, we don't provide the split of new ACV, which is renewals on a quarterly basis, so I won't give that, Rod. But hopefully, that gives you some color on what I meant when I said outperformance for Q3 and renewals doing well. So, can you make sure I understand. So, what exactly is double in your estimate? Yes, it's not that high. The delta is not double. The growth is not double, Rod, right? There is, as I said, Q4 does have a higher ATR than we had going into -- but there's also, I think, the dynamics we talked about last quarter where there are some dynamics of early and so on, right? So, it's not nearly that large."

And with that, I will turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich and good afternoon everyone. Before we begin, I want to spend a moment acknowledging the current situation in Ukraine. Our thoughts are with all of those who are personally impacted by the situation in the region. Now, turning to our second fiscal quarter, against the backdrop of an evolving COVID-19 pandemic, we delivered another solid quarter, exceeding all of our guided metrics and saw build momentum in our renewals business. We continue to see healthy demand for the Nutanix cloud platform, driven by businesses looking to accelerate their digital transformation, modernize their data centers and adopt hybrid multi-cloud operating models. Taking a closer look, our second quarter reflected continued execution on our subscription model and was marked by strong top and bottom line performance. We delivered record ACV billings, which grew 37% year-over-year, our highest growth rate in 3 years. Our revenue also grew 19% year-over-year despite seeing expected term competition. Once again, we saw good linearity, which combined with diligent expense management, enabled us to generate positive free cash flow for the first time since we started our transition to subscription, approximately 3 years ago, putting us well on track to achieving our target of sustainable positive free cash flow by the second half of calendar year 2022. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter financial results. During the second fiscal quarter, Nutanix published its fourth Global Enterprise Cloud Index Report based on a survey of 1,700 IT decision-makers around the world. Respondents noted that they are strategically choosing right around workloads based on security, cost and performance parameters. We see this cloud smart approach as a driver of hybrid multi-cloud adoption. As such, we are not surprised that 83% of respondents agree that hybrid multi-cloud was the ideal operating model. The results of the survey reinforce our view that the simplicity and performance, enabled by the Nutanix cloud platform for deploying and managing workloads across a variety of on-prem and public cloud environments, is what the market is looking for. Recently, we took another important step forward on our strategic priority of making our products easier to sell and consume, with the global launch of our hybrid multi-cloud solution portfolio. With this launch, we simplified our packaging, metering and pricing and aligned our portfolio with the hybrid multi-cloud solutions our customers are consuming, supported by validated designs and deployment best practices. While it\u2019s still early, the initial response to the rollout from customers, partners, sales reps and industry analysts has been encouraging. We saw numerous wins in the quarter in which new and existing customers adopted Nutanix cloud clusters or as we recently renamed it, NC2 to extend our platform into the public cloud with an emphasis on disaster recovery and flexible capacity use cases. RBL Bank in India, an existing customer who is already using the Nutanix cloud platform, including Nutanix unified storage and database service solutions, added NC2 on AWS to its existing deployment as a disaster recovery solution for their mission-critical applications, going from proof-of-concept to live deployment in just 3 weeks. They found the simplicity, ease of deployment and seamless failover from on-prem to public cloud set us apart from alternative solutions. Another win saw a government ministry in the EMEA region consolidate workloads from its regional branches on to the Nutanix cloud platform to improve performance, cost and security while using NC2 on AWS to seamlessly support seasonal spikes in demand. In the second quarter, we continue to receive industry recognition for our unified storage solutions. Nutanix Files was named a leader and outperformer in GigaOm\u2019s Scale-Out File Systems Radar Report. Spending on recognition received last quarter, in which Nutanix was named a visionary in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for Distributed Files and Object Storage for the first time. Our win with a U.S. based sporting goods distributor in the quarter demonstrated the increasing traction we are seeing with Nutanix unified storage and our broader platform. This customer was unhappy with the performance of a competing HCI product and replaced it with the Nutanix cloud platform, including Nutanix cloud infrastructure and unified storage solutions. They also adopted Nutanix database service to automate the administration of existing and new databases and facilitate migration to more modern databases. Another win with a European-based energy services provider demonstrated the growing momentum we are seeing with Red Hat, an important strategic partner. This joint customer shifted their container base, big data workloads that were running on OpenShift on a competing HCI solution to the Nutanix cloud platform, including our AHV hypervisor. We also saw a American-based retailer deploy their business-critical workloads on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or RHEL, running on the Nutanix cloud platform. In both of these wins, our joint customers were able to see improved performance and meaningful cost savings by running on our AHV Hypervisor, assured by the recent certification of both OpenShift and RHEL on AHV. We are excited about the large and building opportunity pipeline that we see with Red Hat. As we continue to strive for progress across all aspects of ESG, we had two important announcements on the governance front during this quarter. First, we eliminated our dual-class stock structure, simplifying the company\u2019s capital structure and ensuring that all shares have equal voting rights. We think this shareholder-friendly move could improve our chances of being included in additional index funds and broaden our shareholder base of both active and passive investors. Second, we also announced that we strengthened our Board of Directors with the appointment of Gayle Sheppard, who currently serves as Corporate Vice President and Head of Global Expansion and Digital Transformation for Microsoft Cloud and AI. Gayle works closely with Microsoft\u2019s largest customers that are implementing multiyear digital innovation and modernization strategies and with governments and countries around the world, driving Azure\u2019s regional expansion. We believe Gayle\u2019s combination of public cloud experience and running businesses at scale is a great fit for our business. And I look forward to benefiting from our insights. In closing, I am pleased with the results of our second quarter. We delivered another quarter of strong growth, exceeded all of our guided metrics and generated positive free cash flow for the first time since the beginning of our transition to a subscription model. We made important progress on transitioning our hybrid multi-cloud platform towards solutions, which we think will make it easier for us to sell and for our customers to adopt. And we are starting to see the benefits of our building base of subscription renewals, which we expect will help us deliver consistent growth and substantial sales and marketing leverage. This progress makes me optimistic about our ability to deliver against the vast opportunity ahead of us. And with that, I will hand it over to Duston Williams. Duston?\nDuston Williams: Thank you, Rajiv. I will get right into some of the specific Q2 highlights. ACV billings for Q2 were $218 million, reflecting 37% growth year-over-year, significantly above our guidance range of $195 million to $200 million and ahead of the Street consensus number of $198 million. Our renewals team is starting to hit their stride and the renewals business performed much better than expected, accounting for the ACV billings upside in the quarter. Both LOD support renewals and term-based license renewals exceeded our plans which resulted in a higher mix of renewal business. In any given quarter, our renewals performance is comprised of a certain percentage of late renewals that are executed after the renewal date, on-time renewals and early renewals that are executed before the renewal date. We forecast renewals based on the ATR, or available to renew and apply an estimated retention rate. We also estimate the percentage of renewals that will be transacted as late, on-time and early. In Q2, we processed more early renewals than expected, which led us to exceed our renewals projection. Revenue for Q2 was $413 million, reflecting 19% growth year-over-year, above our guidance range of $400 million to $410 million and ahead of the Street consensus number of $407 million. The revenue outperformance for the quarter was a bit more muted than the ACV billings outperformance as early renewals did not impact current quarter revenue. Additionally, revenue for LOD support renewals is recognized ratably over the term length and the outperformance on LOD support renewals was not immediately reflected in the current quarter revenue. Our average contract term lengths overall stayed steady at 3.1%, the same as in Q1 \u201822. We previously thought we would see a slight uptick in term lengths during the quarter since our federal business, which has a seasonal high in Q1 has lower term length, but the higher renewal mix impacted the average contract term length in the quarter. ARR as of the end of Q2 was $1.04 billion, growing 55% year-over-year. We have now fully rolled out our new solutions offerings globally. And as we have previously stated, overall emerging product comparisons to prior periods are becoming less meaningful. However, Era and Files, two of our historically largest emerging products, which have relatively clean comparisons to prior periods, both saw healthy year-over-year growth and record levels of total bookings in the quarter. Q2 sales rep productivity was in line with our forecast and net sales reps were flat in Q2. We are pleased with the addition of approximately 700 new logos in Q2 \u201822 versus the Q1 \u201822 new logo count of 560 and the Q2 \u201821 new logo count of 730. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83.8% versus our guidance of 82% to 82.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $347 million, lower than our guidance of $360 million to $365 million. This is a result of continued diligence on expense management, hiring that has been a bit slower than planned and a slower return to post-COVID normalcy. Our non-GAAP net loss was $6 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.03 per share. This was our lowest non-GAAP net loss since the company began shipping products. Q2 linearity remained good. DSOs in Q2 were 36 days, up from 28 days in Q1 \u201822. Our free cash flow was once again aided by good linearity in collections coming in at a positive $17 million, over $40 million better than the Street consensus. Although we might not quite be at the point that we will consistently generate positive free cash flow on a quarterly basis, we generated positive free cash flow for the first time in over 3 years and we are very pleased with the progress we have made. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.29 billion, up from $1.28 billion in Q1 \u201822. Now, turning to our guidance, the guidance for Q3 is as follows: ACV billings to be between $195 million and $200 million, representing year-over-year growth of 22% to 25%; revenue of $395 million to $400 million; gross margin of approximately 82%; operating expenses between $365 million and $370 million; and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $222 million. The Q3 ACV billings guidance, which calls for year-over-year growth of 22% to 25%, compares to the actual growth of 18% in Q3 \u201821 and the Street consensus growth of 21% for Q3 \u201822. Our average contract term length will most likely be flattish in Q3. LOD support renewals should stay somewhat elevated in Q3. The elevated LOD support renewals, which have ratable revenue recognition, combined with a somewhat higher overall renewal mix, will have a small impact on revenue growth in Q3. From a Q3 free cash flow perspective, we would expect a small usage of cash, which is better than the current consensus estimates of negative $25 million. The guidance for FY \u201822 is as follows: ACV billings to be between $760 million and $765 million, representing year-over-year growth of 28% to 29%, revenue of $1.625 billion to $1.63 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 82.5%, and non-GAAP operating expenses between $1.465 billion and $1.47 billion. The ACV billings guidance of $760 million to $765 million compares to the previous guidance range of $740 million to $750 million and versus the current consensus estimates of $750 million. The revenue guidance of $1.625 billion to $1.63 billion compares with the previous guidance range of $1.615 billion to $1.63 billion and versus the previous consensus estimate of $1.626 billion. With that operator, could you please open the call up for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Jason, your line is open.\nJason Ader: Thank you. Hi, guys. A couple of quick ones for me. First, Duston, are you going to disclose the percentage of ACE that came from renewals in the quarter? And if you are not going to disclose it specifically, could you give us a sense of, I don\u2019t know, was it a few percentage points better than you expected when you talked about being better than expected?\nDuston Williams: Yes. So Jason, maybe the easiest way to talk about being better than expected. What we said is that basically the entire upside for the quarter. So we guided $195 million to $200 million on ACV billings. We printed $218 million. So effectively, that $18 million was the renewal upside in the quarter, which implies that new ACV was basically at the guide that was assumed in that $195 million to $200 million.\nJason Ader: Okay, perfect. And \u2013 but you\u2019re not going to disclose quarterly right, the percentage, correct?\nDuston Williams: Correct.\nJason Ader: Okay. Alright. And then, Rajiv, just want to understand the new solutions offering and the motivation there. Was it something that where \u2013 you had spent time with the sales reps and channels and the feedback was that there still has work to do in terms of the simplification? Because I know that\u2019s something that the company has been striving towards over the last couple of years to really kind of create bundles and simplification. But is this sort of think \u2013 is the right way to think about this is the culmination of that multiyear effort, and you feel really confident about this being a sort of go-forward picture just because it can get confusing for reps and channels and customers when you\u2019re constantly changing how the product portfolio looks?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Jason, that\u2019s a very good question here. Yes, we talked about this at our last Investor Day in terms of changing our go-to-market from 15, 20 individual products with different pricing metering etcetera to moving towards a more solution-oriented portfolio. And if you recall, we said we were tireless in about 10 regions. We did that earlier in the year. And now most recently, we went GA with it across the world. And so with this, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve simplified our packaging, our metering and pricing. We\u2019ve aligned the portfolio to the solutions that our customers want and they are consuming, and we\u2019ve provided validated designs and deployment best practices to help them. Now it\u2019s still early, but the initial response from the rollout, this is actually quite encouraging from customers, from partners, from our own sellers and the industry analysts. We\u2019ve seen a more rapid closure for some deals, utilizing the new simplified pricing and packaging. We\u2019ve seen customers already taking advantage of these new packaging to quickly purchase more complete solutions to meet their needs. And in general, we expect to see more high-velocity transactions like these with both our own sales set as well as with our partners.\nJason Ader: And the renewals \u2013 just to be clear, the renewals that you are doing for something, which doesn\u2019t line up with how the customer previously bought it in your new solutions? How does that work?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So we will keep both the old and the new available for a period of time, and we will gradually, over time, migrate to the new. And that goes for both new bookings as well as any renewals that we do.\nJason Ader: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from James Fish from Piper Sandler. James, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJames Fish: Thanks, guys. I know a lot of us say congrats on results all the time but really congrats on these great results. It\u2019s very nice to see. I do want to build off of Jason\u2019s question there. When you talk about, Duston, that $18 million of renewal upside in the quarter, you broke it down to that we had good renewal activity overall, but we also had a pull-in of early renewals. Can you break down how much of it of $18 million was just outright early renewal activity instead of just better cross-sell, upsell that resulted in probably a better net retention rate against your Analyst Day targets?\nDuston Williams: Yes. So as far as retention rate, we\u2019re in, obviously, within that range that we laid out there. So that\u2019s clearly one point there. And as far as the upside goes, most of that were early renewals. Now little bit more LOD maybe, but effectively, almost all of that was early renewals. And I wouldn\u2019t label it a pull-in. This is more of our renewals team kind of refining their processes and back office things and we provide quotes out in advance, obviously, the renewal date and some customers opt to just to transact those renewals early. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing there. And in this case, not only did we process the renewal early, but they actually paid for those renewals early also.\nJames Fish: Understood. And just a follow-up on the operational side. I know you guys are not likely to change your Analyst Day goalpost given it\u2019s only been a few quarters. But as we think about that out your guide of $300 million to $500 million free cash flow and you\u2019re showing much stronger cash flow than anticipated with all the efficiencies being implemented and just really strong execution. I guess what would prevent even the lower end of that range from potentially be pulled forward into fiscal \u201824? For example, when linearity has been really good for the last few quarters, and it seems to be holding and operationally, it does seem like you\u2019re going to get more and more renewals here until \u201823 and fiscal \u201824?\nDuston Williams: Yes. No, we\u2019re really happy with the execution all around actually. Linearity, as you mentioned, continues to be good. The operating expense discipline continues to be good, and renewals are kind of playing out as planned. There is been a lot of work done there. A lot of heavy lifting with the renewals team. They have done an outstanding job, still doing work to do there. So we\u2019ve got with the backdrop, obviously, of have a great product and now with these solution offerings that should accelerate things into the future. just come on board as a new CRO. So we\u2019ve got a lot of things pointed in the right direction. But the reality is we\u2019re only a few quarters away from that Investor Day. And we will see how things play out, but we\u2019re really pleased with how things are going so far.\nJames Fish: Outstanding. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Matt, please go ahead.\nDan Bergstrom: Hey, it\u2019s Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. So new customer growth in the quarter was up nicely versus the first quarter. I know we\u2019ve been kind of focusing more on the quality of new customers. Any change to the new customer profile here in the quarter? Or did you just simply acquire more of those quality new customers?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I\u2019ll...\nDuston Williams: Go ahead, Rajiv. Yes. Go ahead.\nRajiv Ramaswami: No, I was going to say \u2013 yes, we were \u2013 we have been focused for the last several quarters on better quality and what that translates into a somewhat newer higher ASPs for new logos. And typically, between Q2 and Q3, we do get more new logos in \u2013 compared to Q1 \u2013 in Q2, sorry, and we did that this time as well. We\u2019re quite happy with the fact that we are now again back around 700 or so new logos and they are of good quality. Duston, do you want to add anything?\nDuston Williams: No. Perfect. Yes, I wouldn\u2019t add anything.\nDan Bergstrom: Great for both of you. Thank you. And then on the new product portfolio, just to be clear, are there other emerging products that are still out there to be rolled into new solution offerings, we should be thinking about over the second half of the year? Or have we largely simplified that packaging and pricing at this point?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, we are done. So this is it. This includes all the portfolio products. They are all part of the solution. We have Nutanix cloud infrastructure, cloud management, unified storage, database service, right, and in user computing. And that represents the entirety of our portfolio.\nDan Bergstrom: That\u2019s great to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPinjalim Bora: So great. Hello. I will echo my congrats on the quarter as well. Good to see. Duston, just a follow-up renewals uplift that you\u2019re seeing there. Does that \u2013 the early renewals part, does that change the seasonality for Q4 in any way? Or do you say you continue to see a big jump from Q3 to Q4?\nDuston Williams: Not meaningful. No. I mean we\u2019re always going to have quarters with early renewals. So from that perspective, the ATR from Q3 to Q4 does go up, and that\u2019s not materially changed.\nPinjalim Bora: Got it. Rajiv, could you maybe talk about the general demand environment from a new business standpoint heading into 2022 compared to last year? Do you feel like IT modernization projects are kind of coming back on the table and might accelerate in the new year?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think the demand environment continues to be still healthy. We are seeing customers continue to focus on using IT as an enabler. They are focused on continuing to modernize their infrastructure, go to the public cloud and of course, continuing to drive their remote workforce. So we haven\u2019t seen that \u2013 their fundamental dynamics are still pretty much intact. In that context, what I would say is that we are a pure-play provider focused on that HCI market and transitioning legacy 3-tier storage architectures to HCI, right, and then extending that to the public cloud. So we haven\u2019t seen anything significant from a demand change at all and customers continue to be investing at this point.\nPinjalim Bora: Got it. Lastly, if I can. The pricing and packaging obviously has lower pricing and metering, I think you said. Is there an underlying uplift in unit price for like-for-like if somebody is renewing?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, that\u2019s a very good question. And that was not our intent, right? So our intent here with this new launch is really around \u2013 it wasn\u2019t intended to be either a price increase or a price decrease. But it was really to make it easier for our customers to consume our portfolio and for our reps to quote our products in a way that matches their needs. Now I\u2019ll give you some specific examples. We did simplify the metering, and we moved entirely to core-based pricing for our core offerings. Now one impact of the change is that it makes our core offering much more competitive, on all-flash configurations that the customers are increasingly favoring compared to hybrid with flash and disk. We\u2019ve also introduced, for example, a new middle tier in our cloud management offering. And that\u2019s catering very specifically for customers looking at a hybrid cloud operating model that includes operations, self-service and cost governance. And you \u2013 buy this thing all across in the past would have required you to actually buy more products than before, right? So we have a very custom solution now that\u2019s geared towards this particular use case. So overall, I\u2019d say that we made it easier for customers to buy these multi-product solutions to address their specific needs. And this will help them consume more of our portfolio and for our sales reps to be more of our protective. And then the feedback so far from both customers and partners best is out.\nPinjalim Bora: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Wamsi, your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi. Yes, thank you. Duston on OpEx, you guys have been showing very strong results relative to your guide for several quarters, not at least for the past four quarters. And those efficiencies seem to be increasing in magnitude or maybe said another way, you\u2019re coming in much lower than your guide on OpEx? Can you talk about what of that is structural versus what is more a function of maybe difficulties in the labor market and adding headcount at the pace you had anticipated? And I have a follow-up.\nDuston Williams: Yes. Wamsi, we continue to have very good discipline on the OpEx, and that will continue. There is no doubt about that. On the hiring front, we wish we had a few more heads. It\u2019s tough for everybody where Nutanix is no exception on the hiring front. So there is clearly some underspend going on head count that we wish would get plug here going forward. A little bit of just getting back to normal travel is still down quite a bit, and that hasn\u2019t returned. We assumed that would return a little bit there. But the efficiencies that we continue to look on, obviously, is taking a hard look continuing at sales. Even though we\u2019ve done a pretty good job there, who\u2019s got some thoughts of how we can get even more efficient from a sales perspective. So I think if you look at the assumed guide \u2013 for the guide for Q3 and then the assumed inherent guide for Q4 because that\u2019s the only quarter we haven\u2019t officially guided for, we have a step up there. So we\u2019re again assuming some return to normalcy here in Q4, and I think some increased hiring.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then I could back to renewals. You noted these early renewals, how early are the early renewals? And why are customers choosing to do this? And I wasn\u2019t very clear why that doesn\u2019t have somewhat of a pull-in or pull-forward impact? Is it just that \u2013 maybe you can shed some color on that? Thank you.\nDuston Williams: Sure. So the impact that it has, when we do in early, as long as we collect cash as it does accelerate ACV billings, and it does accelerate billings, total billings. But the revenue is always going to be recognized in the quarter that the renewal terms, right, or it starts again. So you\u2019re never going to recognize revenue early on an early renewal. But as long as we collect cash, that will go into ACV billings and total billings from that perspective. Now your question on, I think, how much was from Q3, which kind of gets into scores about Q3 guidance and things, roughly probably $10 million or so came from Q3. And so then you think about the difference, what\u2019s the difference related to? And a lot of that mostly relates to co-terming because the beauty of our business, we\u2019re always upselling. But that leaves the customer with a bunch of different renewal dates. And so if a customer has a fair amount of renewals in this case in Q2, and they have got renewal in Q3 and a bunch of renewals in Q4, what they may opt to do is co-term all those and just bring them to Q2, have a common term date, makes it easier for them. It makes it easier for us. So that\u2019s mostly related to some of the other renewals there that are outside of Q3.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Just wanted to get a sense of whether underlying supply chain challenges with some OEM kind of partners and whether that means not any impact to kind of demand or ability to close new customers during the quarter? And then maybe second, just kind of building on one of question and your kind of answer to Duston, just getting a nice sense of what percentage of your customers are kind of an overall size of the revenue base that has co-term contracts at this point? Thanks.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Okay. And Meta, Rajiv here. I\u2019ll take the first question and on the supply chain, Duston can do the second. On the supply chain, we\u2019ve noted in the past that our software runs on a variety of hardware platforms. And it\u2019s not necessarily tied one-on-one to new hardware sales. So supply chain impact so far in our business today has been relatively modest, including in this quarter. We\u2019ve seen a few customers pulling forward orders in some cases to get early access hardware. We\u2019ve also seen some other customers that have delayed placing orders to confirm with expected late deliveries or hardware. So, we certainly expect hardware procurement to remain challenging over the near-term. What I would say though is to this, given the choice and flexibility that we provide with our software, the net effect on our business so far has been minimal. We will, of course, continue to watch this very, very carefully as we go forward.\nDuston Williams: And then just on the...\nRajiv Ramaswami: Duston?\nDuston Williams: Yes, on the percentage of co-terms, just by definition, where we\u2019re so early into the \u2013 certainly into the term-based renewals, as far as starting to get into volume. It\u2019s not. I suspect we will see more and more of this as these renewals start to come up, and a customer has all these different renewal dates they are going to want simplicity. We\u2019re going to want simplicity. So I would suspect we will see more and more of these as the ATR, in general, continues to elevate over the next several quarters.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Rod, please go ahead.\nRod Hall: Yes. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the question. I want to come back to renewals and the renewal rate and to see what you\u2019re observing. It sounds like you\u2019re a little bit deeper into renewals now. You\u2019ve done some of these co-term deals. What do you think the renewal rate is sort of running up to this point? I know you\u2019re early stage in it, but I\u2019m just curious what that rate is running? And then I have a follow-up.\nDuston Williams: Yes. Sure, it\u2019s Duston. At Investor Day, we had put a target out there from a GRR perspective of 90% or greater. And we are within that range currently. So, there was no real difference really than what we have seen over the last couple of quarters. We have a bigger sample size, of course, now. And we are happy where the core is. We are focusing on adoption of the total product portfolio. But so far, there has been really no meaningful change there.\nRod Hall: Okay. Great. And then the other thing I wanted to ask is how many, like \u2013 so of the renewals that were available, I guess, what proportion of them did this co-terming? And is that representative of what you expect to see going forward, or I think we are all trying to get a handle on how much of this catering might come through in the renewals and how much the renewals kind of just will happen, I don\u2019t know, without the co-terms? So, I don\u2019t know if you can give us any help on that observation?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. It\u2019s probably a little early to talk about this at this point. I think if you look at somewhat of a majority was just playing early. And then anything out of Q3 would have more tilt or some would have more tilt to the co-terming just because of the extension of outside of Q3. So, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s too early to tell. And this is all customer preference too. We don\u2019t want to force a customer to do anything. We wouldn\u2019t force a customer to do something with that economics on our side. So, I think this is just something we are going to have to monitor going forward. But I think just by the elevation of the ATR, we will probably see some more of this certainly with, I suspect the bigger customers.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos from Needham. Please go ahead.\nMike Cikos: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. Just wanted to go through the billings, and I know it seems like it\u2019s the topic of the day here. But if I am looking at the $18 million of revenue upside \u2013 sorry, billings upside you reported this quarter, we are seeing that is almost entirely coming from the early renewals and about $10 million of that was from this co-terming maybe pull-in from Q3. If I normalize for that in Q2 results, and then normalize for that in the Q3 guide, it implies that your billings would be flat sequentially instead of, I guess you have typically seen 3% to 4% sequential declines. And I am just curious is there anything that you can point us to, which is helping, I guess reduce that typical seasonality would see in the ACV billings going from Q2 to Q3?\nDuston Williams: Sure. Let me take a shot at that. One of the thesis that we laid out at Investor Day was predictability of renewals. Because the company was always built on new and up-sell, and we weren\u2019t afforded the luxury to have renewals and the two traits of renewals that we laid out. First, that they were very cost-effective and they added leverage to the business model. And secondly, they added predictability, right. And so now, we are starting to have a revenue stream that has a much higher level of predictability. Now, I wouldn\u2019t layer that too much into your comment about Q2, Q3. But clearly, as the ATR goes up, we are going to have a different profile of the business that\u2019s not dominated by new and up-sell. And finally, this is what we have been talking about for the last 2 years or 3 years. Finally, the business starts to change and morph into a somewhat more predictable, better leverage business.\nMike Cikos: Very helpful. And I think this probably leads into my second question, but you guys materially outperformed on the gross margin, well ahead of that 82% to 82.5% that you had guided to versus the 83.8% that you delivered. Was a solid chunk of that derived from this \u2013 from the renewals here, or is there anything else a day that helped that gross margin outperform where we were previously modeling?\nDuston Williams: Well, I mean, any time you have got increasing top line, obviously, revenue in this case, it\u2019s going to help the margin. But we also quite honestly got a little favorableness for some under-spend on headcount and support. That wasn\u2019t necessarily by design. So, that accounted for a little bit of it, but clearly, we are \u2013 I think if you look at the gross margin trend over the last many, many quarters, it\u2019s been in that 82%, 83% range. And we continue, I think to do a pretty good job managing within that range. So, it popped up probably a little higher than what we expected. And primarily the reason we are bringing it down in Q3 as the revenue base naturally shrinks a little bit as we go out from Q2 to Q3.\nMike Cikos: Understood. Thank you very much for the timing. We appreciate it.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Aaron, please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I can as well. So, maybe first of all, I just wanted to ask about the competitive landscape and how that\u2019s evolved now that your biggest competitor is completely spun off from Dell? And I think in that same context, how has the company evolved from a partner ecosystem perspective? Can you comment on HP? Any incremental engagements with Dell post that spin, etcetera?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Sure. So Aaron, let me take a crack at that. So, first on the competitive environment and then the partners. So, we haven\u2019t seen a major change in market dynamics from a competitive perspective. I will say, fundamentally from the market view HCI continued to grow with basic traditional architectures, while it becomes a foundation for hybrid multi-cloud. And like I said earlier, it\u2019s capable of handling all these \u2013 all virtualized enterprise workloads, including same-size databases that are very performance-sensitive. Now, from a competitive angle, if you look at some of the other players without naming names here, so many of the other places in the market have offerings in both traditional storage and HCI. And so they tend to be not \u2013 they maybe be less aggressive in pushing HCI as they seek to protect margins in their traditional business. And then if you look at other classes of competitors, they had a broader portfolio that includes things like developers and security offerings without a focused go-to-market effort in just HCI. So, from that perspective, we are a pure play. We are continuing to win our fair share more of the market because of the platform, the robustness, the scale, the simplicity, the flexibility and freedom of choice that we offer and of course, our focus on customer delight. So, that\u2019s the competitive angle. Now, when it comes to the partners, again, I think we have talked about OEM partners and then our \u2013 and then the traditional vendors when we talked about our ecosystem and in the cloud. So, on the OEM side, we continue to grow the partnership with HPE. There \u2013 as you can see from their own earnings, they had a big focus on GreenLake. We are part of their GreenLake solutions, both our core platform as well as our database and service platform \u2013 era I am sorry, as part of their GreenLake offerings. GreenLake is small but growing rapidly. And the teams are working together in the field and continue to win deals together. So, that partnership continues to develop. Lenovo is a steady state with us. We have been working together with Lenovo for a long time. And then when we come to the ecosystem side of it. The two that we are very focused on right now Red Hat and Citrix. And with Red Hat we have had now, we are now two-plus quarters into \u2013 since we announced the partnership, we continue to do very well under the Red Hat fund side. There is a number of engagements. We continue to get new wins every quarter here. For example, this quarter, there were a couple of minutes that I can talk about like that continue to build on the momentum we had. One was around OpenShift running on top of the Nutanix platform. There was this a European energy services provider that to call their container-based big data workloads that were already running on OpenShift, but on a competing HCI solution and moved it to the Nutanix cloud platform, including our own hypervisor. We had another retailer customer who deployed their business-critical workloads on Red Hat Linux moving to the Nutanix cloud platform. So, that has relationship continues to grow. With Citrix, we have had a long-standing relationship that just got formalized recently. So, there is just a number of joint customer engagements and wins together around engine computing and virtual desktop. That happened every quarter. This quarter, that continues and that momentum in Citrix is very much there. The last piece was the cloud piece. There again, I think we have had our solution with AWS up for a while. We talked about some more examples of Win Stack this quarter in terms of customer usage. We are continuing to work jointly with Microsoft Azure to get our hybrid cloud solution out to market. We are in private preview on that. So, these partnerships are all continuing to build, and we expect to get more and more from them as we progress.\nAaron Rakers: That\u2019s great. And then as a quick follow-up, Duston, I am curious back to Wamsi\u2019s question, you have clearly not only executed well in OpEx, but you have underperformed or you had OpEx below the guided range for the past several quarters. Given that, that\u2019s reflective of some not yet back to office fully and some slower hiring, should we expect over the next couple of quarters that there could be a quarter where that catches back up given how much you have relative to guide under spent over these last couple of quarters?\nDuston Williams: Well, I mean we guide to a range that we expect to come close to. In this case, we guided $365 million to $370 million. You have some just one-off things like FICA taxes reset. So, that\u2019s millions of dollars in the first part of the calendar year. And we have a bigger step up in Q4, and this is the inherent you can do the calc for the guide for $160 million, $165 million \u2013 or $146 million to $165 million for the year. So eventually, we would like to hire more folks. We would like to hire. We are not massively off the target of sales reps, but we would like to hire a few more sales reps. We would like to hire the more R&D folks. We like to hire some more support folks. And I think we will do that over time. It\u2019s just a question of when will that happen. Now again, we have laid out an expense structure not only for this year with this guide, but we have laid it out \u201823 and \u201825. So, regardless of what we end up hiring, we are still \u2013 the total company still marching to those parameters.\nAaron Rakers: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Duston.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you. Appreciate getting a question here. I wanted to ask you about the full year forecast for ACV billings. If I am thinking about this correctly, you have put up about $200 million on average per quarter between the two quarters you reported and the April quarter you forecast, which seems to imply you are expecting a decline in ACV billings in your fourth quarter in July. I just wanted a little bit of help understanding what the thought process might be there?\nDuston Williams: Well, that\u2019s not correct, Simon. So, let me kind of state the facts. So, as you recall, we have \u2013 we have talked about this in earnings calls, I think for the last three times we didn\u2019t this time, because we talked about so much is that the four quarters of our ACV billing guidance don\u2019t equal the year. And the reason why that doesn\u2019t equate is because less than 1-year deals, if we do a six-month million-dollar deal, in the quarter, we would count that as ACV of $2 million. And so you can\u2019t simply add. It\u2019s been \u2013 historically, it\u2019s been about a 6%, 7% discount. Again, we have laid this out in earnings call. So, I think if you do all that math, it would certainly not suggest a decrease in ACV billings in Q4.\nSimon Leopold: Yes. No, I recall you talking about it before, but I think it certainly bears repeating. It\u2019s a point you should continue to be making.\nDuston Williams: Yes. So, there is \u2013 again, it\u2019s simple math to do. I don\u2019t want to talk specially about Q4 because we don\u2019t guide to Q4 at this point. But if you do that math, it would certainly suggest an uptick in ACV billings in Q4.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks. And then just as a follow-up. In terms of the operating expenses, have you seen a change in wage inflation in the last quarter? Obviously, you have guided to a slightly lower expense for the year. Just want an update on what you are thinking about wage inflation in that equation? Thank you.\nDuston Williams: Yes. I think everything has gone up and salaries are certainly one of those things that have gone up. So, we have built that into the forecast. We are monitoring it effectively daily, weekly. And the assumptions there is that those wages are increasing. And we have tweaked up the assumption or we will end up tweaking the assumption for FY \u201823 also. And this isn\u2019t just us, obviously, this is everybody. But again, regardless of what that is, we will still operate within the expense structure we have laid out.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. But that\u2019s definitely the only thing I may add to that \u2013 yes. I might just add that what that practically means is instead of hiring 100 people, we might have 90 people or something like that, right, if the wages are going up and we still came at another OpEx month.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Thanks and congratulations on awesome ACV results. It sounds like you are adjusting up the expected percent renewals are available when on you, say, one quarter or two quarters out on a go-forward basis. But not as much as what you experienced in the January quarter. Is that what\u2019s going on between the differential between the year-over-year growth that you just put up on ACV billings and what you are guiding to for the April quarter?\nDuston Williams: I am not sure I quite understood the question, Nehal. I am sorry.\nNehal Chokshi: Alright. Let me try again. So, what went into the beat for the January quarter was a greater percent of renewals that renewed earlier than expected, while you expect a certain percent to renew, it was a higher percent than typically expected.\nDuston Williams: Yes.\nNehal Chokshi: And typically, this would represent a pull forward, but that\u2019s not what your guidance represents because you are actually raising for April quarter ACV billings guidance relative to work. And so I guess but it\u2019s not as much as the January quarter peak. So, I guess what I am trying to say is that the percent that was more than usual renewal raising that, but not as much as what you had experienced in the January quarter. Is that essentially what\u2019s happening here?\nDuston Williams: That\u2019s fair. Yes. We would not expect at this point, the amount of early renewals sort of on a percentage basis or you can do a dollar basis that we experienced in Q2.\nNehal Chokshi: Alright. Great.\nDuston Williams: It\u2019s also got LOD renewals playing in here too that have been a little bit stronger than what we had previously assumed on the same port piece. Yes.\nNehal Chokshi: Great. And then there has also been a lot of questions around OpEx and whether or not this understanding is going to negatively impact future ACV billings growth. So, maybe another way to address this is that where are you in terms of your new ACV per sales team\u2019s targets today? Do you see still plenty of runaway for improving that?\nDuston Williams: We do. We were on target this quarter, and there is a lot of different things going on. Dom and team are working away and whether that\u2019s channel and \u2013 channel work there, channel autonomy, which we have talked about a lot, leveraging partners, a lot more training for the sales force and then you have the solution selling. And again, the whole \u2013 Rajiv has talked about this a lot, but the whole \u2013 one of the big concepts on the solutions offering. [Abrupt End]",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich and good afternoon everyone. Before we begin, I want to spend a moment acknowledging the current situation in Ukraine. Our thoughts are with all of those who are personally impacted by the situation in the region. Now, turning to our second fiscal quarter, against the backdrop of an evolving COVID-19 pandemic, we delivered another solid quarter, exceeding all of our guided metrics and saw build momentum in our renewals business. We continue to see healthy demand for the Nutanix cloud platform, driven by businesses looking to accelerate their digital transformation, modernize their data centers and adopt hybrid multi-cloud operating models. Taking a closer look, our second quarter reflected continued execution on our subscription model and was marked by strong top and bottom line performance. We delivered record ACV billings, which grew 37% year-over-year, our highest growth rate in 3 years. Our revenue also grew 19% year-over-year despite seeing expected term competition. Once again, we saw good linearity, which combined with diligent expense management, enabled us to generate positive free cash flow for the first time since we started our transition to subscription, approximately 3 years ago, putting us well on track to achieving our target of sustainable positive free cash flow by the second half of calendar year 2022. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter financial results. During the second fiscal quarter, Nutanix published its fourth Global Enterprise Cloud Index Report based on a survey of 1,700 IT decision-makers around the world. Respondents noted that they are strategically choosing right around workloads based on security, cost and performance parameters. We see this cloud smart approach as a driver of hybrid multi-cloud adoption. As such, we are not surprised that 83% of respondents agree that hybrid multi-cloud was the ideal operating model. The results of the survey reinforce our view that the simplicity and performance, enabled by the Nutanix cloud platform for deploying and managing workloads across a variety of on-prem and public cloud environments, is what the market is looking for. Recently, we took another important step forward on our strategic priority of making our products easier to sell and consume, with the global launch of our hybrid multi-cloud solution portfolio. With this launch, we simplified our packaging, metering and pricing and aligned our portfolio with the hybrid multi-cloud solutions our customers are consuming, supported by validated designs and deployment best practices. While it's still early, the initial response to the rollout from customers, partners, sales reps and industry analysts has been encouraging. We saw numerous wins in the quarter in which new and existing customers adopted Nutanix cloud clusters or as we recently renamed it, NC2 to extend our platform into the public cloud with an emphasis on disaster recovery and flexible capacity use cases. RBL Bank in India, an existing customer who is already using the Nutanix cloud platform, including Nutanix unified storage and database service solutions, added NC2 on AWS to its existing deployment as a disaster recovery solution for their mission-critical applications, going from proof-of-concept to live deployment in just 3 weeks. They found the simplicity, ease of deployment and seamless failover from on-prem to public cloud set us apart from alternative solutions. Another win saw a government ministry in the EMEA region consolidate workloads from its regional branches on to the Nutanix cloud platform to improve performance, cost and security while using NC2 on AWS to seamlessly support seasonal spikes in demand. In the second quarter, we continue to receive industry recognition for our unified storage solutions. Nutanix Files was named a leader and outperformer in GigaOm's Scale-Out File Systems Radar Report. Spending on recognition received last quarter, in which Nutanix was named a visionary in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Distributed Files and Object Storage for the first time. Our win with a U.S. based sporting goods distributor in the quarter demonstrated the increasing traction we are seeing with Nutanix unified storage and our broader platform. This customer was unhappy with the performance of a competing HCI product and replaced it with the Nutanix cloud platform, including Nutanix cloud infrastructure and unified storage solutions. They also adopted Nutanix database service to automate the administration of existing and new databases and facilitate migration to more modern databases. Another win with a European-based energy services provider demonstrated the growing momentum we are seeing with Red Hat, an important strategic partner. This joint customer shifted their container base, big data workloads that were running on OpenShift on a competing HCI solution to the Nutanix cloud platform, including our AHV hypervisor. We also saw a American-based retailer deploy their business-critical workloads on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or RHEL, running on the Nutanix cloud platform. In both of these wins, our joint customers were able to see improved performance and meaningful cost savings by running on our AHV Hypervisor, assured by the recent certification of both OpenShift and RHEL on AHV. We are excited about the large and building opportunity pipeline that we see with Red Hat. As we continue to strive for progress across all aspects of ESG, we had two important announcements on the governance front during this quarter. First, we eliminated our dual-class stock structure, simplifying the company's capital structure and ensuring that all shares have equal voting rights. We think this shareholder-friendly move could improve our chances of being included in additional index funds and broaden our shareholder base of both active and passive investors. Second, we also announced that we strengthened our Board of Directors with the appointment of Gayle Sheppard, who currently serves as Corporate Vice President and Head of Global Expansion and Digital Transformation for Microsoft Cloud and AI. Gayle works closely with Microsoft's largest customers that are implementing multiyear digital innovation and modernization strategies and with governments and countries around the world, driving Azure's regional expansion. We believe Gayle's combination of public cloud experience and running businesses at scale is a great fit for our business. And I look forward to benefiting from our insights. In closing, I am pleased with the results of our second quarter. We delivered another quarter of strong growth, exceeded all of our guided metrics and generated positive free cash flow for the first time since the beginning of our transition to a subscription model. We made important progress on transitioning our hybrid multi-cloud platform towards solutions, which we think will make it easier for us to sell and for our customers to adopt. And we are starting to see the benefits of our building base of subscription renewals, which we expect will help us deliver consistent growth and substantial sales and marketing leverage. This progress makes me optimistic about our ability to deliver against the vast opportunity ahead of us. And with that, I will hand it over to Duston Williams. Duston? Jason, that's a very good question here. Yes, we talked about this at our last Investor Day in terms of changing our go-to-market from 15, 20 individual products with different pricing metering etcetera to moving towards a more solution-oriented portfolio. And if you recall, we said we were tireless in about 10 regions. We did that earlier in the year. And now most recently, we went GA with it across the world. And so with this, what we've done is we've simplified our packaging, our metering and pricing. We've aligned the portfolio to the solutions that our customers want and they are consuming, and we've provided validated designs and deployment best practices to help them. Now it's still early, but the initial response from the rollout, this is actually quite encouraging from customers, from partners, from our own sellers and the industry analysts. We've seen a more rapid closure for some deals, utilizing the new simplified pricing and packaging. We've seen customers already taking advantage of these new packaging to quickly purchase more complete solutions to meet their needs. And in general, we expect to see more high-velocity transactions like these with both our own sales set as well as with our partners. Yes. So we will keep both the old and the new available for a period of time, and we will gradually, over time, migrate to the new. And that goes for both new bookings as well as any renewals that we do. Yes, I'll... No, I was going to say \u2013 yes, we were \u2013 we have been focused for the last several quarters on better quality and what that translates into a somewhat newer higher ASPs for new logos. And typically, between Q2 and Q3, we do get more new logos in \u2013 compared to Q1 \u2013 in Q2, sorry, and we did that this time as well. We're quite happy with the fact that we are now again back around 700 or so new logos and they are of good quality. Duston, do you want to add anything? Yes, we are done. So this is it. This includes all the portfolio products. They are all part of the solution. We have Nutanix cloud infrastructure, cloud management, unified storage, database service, right, and in user computing. And that represents the entirety of our portfolio. Yes. I think the demand environment continues to be still healthy. We are seeing customers continue to focus on using IT as an enabler. They are focused on continuing to modernize their infrastructure, go to the public cloud and of course, continuing to drive their remote workforce. So we haven't seen that \u2013 their fundamental dynamics are still pretty much intact. In that context, what I would say is that we are a pure-play provider focused on that HCI market and transitioning legacy 3-tier storage architectures to HCI, right, and then extending that to the public cloud. So we haven't seen anything significant from a demand change at all and customers continue to be investing at this point. Yes, that's a very good question. And that was not our intent, right? So our intent here with this new launch is really around \u2013 it wasn't intended to be either a price increase or a price decrease. But it was really to make it easier for our customers to consume our portfolio and for our reps to quote our products in a way that matches their needs. Now I'll give you some specific examples. We did simplify the metering, and we moved entirely to core-based pricing for our core offerings. Now one impact of the change is that it makes our core offering much more competitive, on all-flash configurations that the customers are increasingly favoring compared to hybrid with flash and disk. We've also introduced, for example, a new middle tier in our cloud management offering. And that's catering very specifically for customers looking at a hybrid cloud operating model that includes operations, self-service and cost governance. And you \u2013 buy this thing all across in the past would have required you to actually buy more products than before, right? So we have a very custom solution now that's geared towards this particular use case. So overall, I'd say that we made it easier for customers to buy these multi-product solutions to address their specific needs. And this will help them consume more of our portfolio and for our sales reps to be more of our protective. And then the feedback so far from both customers and partners best is out. Okay. And Meta, Rajiv here. I'll take the first question and on the supply chain, Duston can do the second. On the supply chain, we've noted in the past that our software runs on a variety of hardware platforms. And it's not necessarily tied one-on-one to new hardware sales. So supply chain impact so far in our business today has been relatively modest, including in this quarter. We've seen a few customers pulling forward orders in some cases to get early access hardware. We've also seen some other customers that have delayed placing orders to confirm with expected late deliveries or hardware. So, we certainly expect hardware procurement to remain challenging over the near-term. What I would say though is to this, given the choice and flexibility that we provide with our software, the net effect on our business so far has been minimal. We will, of course, continue to watch this very, very carefully as we go forward. Duston? Yes. It's probably a little early to talk about this at this point. I think if you look at somewhat of a majority was just playing early. And then anything out of Q3 would have more tilt or some would have more tilt to the co-terming just because of the extension of outside of Q3. So, I think it's just \u2013 it's too early to tell. And this is all customer preference too. We don't want to force a customer to do anything. We wouldn't force a customer to do something with that economics on our side. So, I think this is just something we are going to have to monitor going forward. But I think just by the elevation of the ATR, we will probably see some more of this certainly with, I suspect the bigger customers. Sure. So Aaron, let me take a crack at that. So, first on the competitive environment and then the partners. So, we haven't seen a major change in market dynamics from a competitive perspective. I will say, fundamentally from the market view HCI continued to grow with basic traditional architectures, while it becomes a foundation for hybrid multi-cloud. And like I said earlier, it's capable of handling all these \u2013 all virtualized enterprise workloads, including same-size databases that are very performance-sensitive. Now, from a competitive angle, if you look at some of the other players without naming names here, so many of the other places in the market have offerings in both traditional storage and HCI. And so they tend to be not \u2013 they maybe be less aggressive in pushing HCI as they seek to protect margins in their traditional business. And then if you look at other classes of competitors, they had a broader portfolio that includes things like developers and security offerings without a focused go-to-market effort in just HCI. So, from that perspective, we are a pure play. We are continuing to win our fair share more of the market because of the platform, the robustness, the scale, the simplicity, the flexibility and freedom of choice that we offer and of course, our focus on customer delight. So, that's the competitive angle. Now, when it comes to the partners, again, I think we have talked about OEM partners and then our \u2013 and then the traditional vendors when we talked about our ecosystem and in the cloud. So, on the OEM side, we continue to grow the partnership with HPE. There \u2013 as you can see from their own earnings, they had a big focus on GreenLake. We are part of their GreenLake solutions, both our core platform as well as our database and service platform \u2013 era I am sorry, as part of their GreenLake offerings. GreenLake is small but growing rapidly. And the teams are working together in the field and continue to win deals together. So, that partnership continues to develop. Lenovo is a steady state with us. We have been working together with Lenovo for a long time. And then when we come to the ecosystem side of it. The two that we are very focused on right now Red Hat and Citrix. And with Red Hat we have had now, we are now two-plus quarters into \u2013 since we announced the partnership, we continue to do very well under the Red Hat fund side. There is a number of engagements. We continue to get new wins every quarter here. For example, this quarter, there were a couple of minutes that I can talk about like that continue to build on the momentum we had. One was around OpenShift running on top of the Nutanix platform. There was this a European energy services provider that to call their container-based big data workloads that were already running on OpenShift, but on a competing HCI solution and moved it to the Nutanix cloud platform, including our own hypervisor. We had another retailer customer who deployed their business-critical workloads on Red Hat Linux moving to the Nutanix cloud platform. So, that has relationship continues to grow. With Citrix, we have had a long-standing relationship that just got formalized recently. So, there is just a number of joint customer engagements and wins together around engine computing and virtual desktop. That happened every quarter. This quarter, that continues and that momentum in Citrix is very much there. The last piece was the cloud piece. There again, I think we have had our solution with AWS up for a while. We talked about some more examples of Win Stack this quarter in terms of customer usage. We are continuing to work jointly with Microsoft Azure to get our hybrid cloud solution out to market. We are in private preview on that. So, these partnerships are all continuing to build, and we expect to get more and more from them as we progress. Yes. But that's definitely the only thing I may add to that \u2013 yes. I might just add that what that practically means is instead of hiring 100 people, we might have 90 people or something like that, right, if the wages are going up and we still came at another OpEx month."

            "name": "Duston Williams",
            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. I will get right into some of the specific Q2 highlights. ACV billings for Q2 were $218 million, reflecting 37% growth year-over-year, significantly above our guidance range of $195 million to $200 million and ahead of the Street consensus number of $198 million. Our renewals team is starting to hit their stride and the renewals business performed much better than expected, accounting for the ACV billings upside in the quarter. Both LOD support renewals and term-based license renewals exceeded our plans which resulted in a higher mix of renewal business. In any given quarter, our renewals performance is comprised of a certain percentage of late renewals that are executed after the renewal date, on-time renewals and early renewals that are executed before the renewal date. We forecast renewals based on the ATR, or available to renew and apply an estimated retention rate. We also estimate the percentage of renewals that will be transacted as late, on-time and early. In Q2, we processed more early renewals than expected, which led us to exceed our renewals projection. Revenue for Q2 was $413 million, reflecting 19% growth year-over-year, above our guidance range of $400 million to $410 million and ahead of the Street consensus number of $407 million. The revenue outperformance for the quarter was a bit more muted than the ACV billings outperformance as early renewals did not impact current quarter revenue. Additionally, revenue for LOD support renewals is recognized ratably over the term length and the outperformance on LOD support renewals was not immediately reflected in the current quarter revenue. Our average contract term lengths overall stayed steady at 3.1%, the same as in Q1 \u201822. We previously thought we would see a slight uptick in term lengths during the quarter since our federal business, which has a seasonal high in Q1 has lower term length, but the higher renewal mix impacted the average contract term length in the quarter. ARR as of the end of Q2 was $1.04 billion, growing 55% year-over-year. We have now fully rolled out our new solutions offerings globally. And as we have previously stated, overall emerging product comparisons to prior periods are becoming less meaningful. However, Era and Files, two of our historically largest emerging products, which have relatively clean comparisons to prior periods, both saw healthy year-over-year growth and record levels of total bookings in the quarter. Q2 sales rep productivity was in line with our forecast and net sales reps were flat in Q2. We are pleased with the addition of approximately 700 new logos in Q2 \u201822 versus the Q1 \u201822 new logo count of 560 and the Q2 \u201821 new logo count of 730. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83.8% versus our guidance of 82% to 82.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $347 million, lower than our guidance of $360 million to $365 million. This is a result of continued diligence on expense management, hiring that has been a bit slower than planned and a slower return to post-COVID normalcy. Our non-GAAP net loss was $6 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.03 per share. This was our lowest non-GAAP net loss since the company began shipping products. Q2 linearity remained good. DSOs in Q2 were 36 days, up from 28 days in Q1 \u201822. Our free cash flow was once again aided by good linearity in collections coming in at a positive $17 million, over $40 million better than the Street consensus. Although we might not quite be at the point that we will consistently generate positive free cash flow on a quarterly basis, we generated positive free cash flow for the first time in over 3 years and we are very pleased with the progress we have made. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.29 billion, up from $1.28 billion in Q1 \u201822. Now, turning to our guidance, the guidance for Q3 is as follows: ACV billings to be between $195 million and $200 million, representing year-over-year growth of 22% to 25%; revenue of $395 million to $400 million; gross margin of approximately 82%; operating expenses between $365 million and $370 million; and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $222 million. The Q3 ACV billings guidance, which calls for year-over-year growth of 22% to 25%, compares to the actual growth of 18% in Q3 \u201821 and the Street consensus growth of 21% for Q3 \u201822. Our average contract term length will most likely be flattish in Q3. LOD support renewals should stay somewhat elevated in Q3. The elevated LOD support renewals, which have ratable revenue recognition, combined with a somewhat higher overall renewal mix, will have a small impact on revenue growth in Q3. From a Q3 free cash flow perspective, we would expect a small usage of cash, which is better than the current consensus estimates of negative $25 million. The guidance for FY \u201822 is as follows: ACV billings to be between $760 million and $765 million, representing year-over-year growth of 28% to 29%, revenue of $1.625 billion to $1.63 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 82.5%, and non-GAAP operating expenses between $1.465 billion and $1.47 billion. The ACV billings guidance of $760 million to $765 million compares to the previous guidance range of $740 million to $750 million and versus the current consensus estimates of $750 million. The revenue guidance of $1.625 billion to $1.63 billion compares with the previous guidance range of $1.615 billion to $1.63 billion and versus the previous consensus estimate of $1.626 billion. With that operator, could you please open the call up for questions? Thank you. Yes. So Jason, maybe the easiest way to talk about being better than expected. What we said is that basically the entire upside for the quarter. So we guided $195 million to $200 million on ACV billings. We printed $218 million. So effectively, that $18 million was the renewal upside in the quarter, which implies that new ACV was basically at the guide that was assumed in that $195 million to $200 million. Correct. Yes. So as far as retention rate, we're in, obviously, within that range that we laid out there. So that's clearly one point there. And as far as the upside goes, most of that were early renewals. Now little bit more LOD maybe, but effectively, almost all of that was early renewals. And I wouldn't label it a pull-in. This is more of our renewals team kind of refining their processes and back office things and we provide quotes out in advance, obviously, the renewal date and some customers opt to just to transact those renewals early. So that's what you're seeing there. And in this case, not only did we process the renewal early, but they actually paid for those renewals early also. Yes. No, we're really happy with the execution all around actually. Linearity, as you mentioned, continues to be good. The operating expense discipline continues to be good, and renewals are kind of playing out as planned. There is been a lot of work done there. A lot of heavy lifting with the renewals team. They have done an outstanding job, still doing work to do there. So we've got with the backdrop, obviously, of have a great product and now with these solution offerings that should accelerate things into the future. just come on board as a new CRO. So we've got a lot of things pointed in the right direction. But the reality is we're only a few quarters away from that Investor Day. And we will see how things play out, but we're really pleased with how things are going so far. Go ahead, Rajiv. Yes. Go ahead. No. Perfect. Yes, I wouldn't add anything. Not meaningful. No. I mean we're always going to have quarters with early renewals. So from that perspective, the ATR from Q3 to Q4 does go up, and that's not materially changed. Yes. Wamsi, we continue to have very good discipline on the OpEx, and that will continue. There is no doubt about that. On the hiring front, we wish we had a few more heads. It's tough for everybody where Nutanix is no exception on the hiring front. So there is clearly some underspend going on head count that we wish would get plug here going forward. A little bit of just getting back to normal travel is still down quite a bit, and that hasn't returned. We assumed that would return a little bit there. But the efficiencies that we continue to look on, obviously, is taking a hard look continuing at sales. Even though we've done a pretty good job there, who's got some thoughts of how we can get even more efficient from a sales perspective. So I think if you look at the assumed guide \u2013 for the guide for Q3 and then the assumed inherent guide for Q4 because that's the only quarter we haven't officially guided for, we have a step up there. So we're again assuming some return to normalcy here in Q4, and I think some increased hiring. Sure. So the impact that it has, when we do in early, as long as we collect cash as it does accelerate ACV billings, and it does accelerate billings, total billings. But the revenue is always going to be recognized in the quarter that the renewal terms, right, or it starts again. So you're never going to recognize revenue early on an early renewal. But as long as we collect cash, that will go into ACV billings and total billings from that perspective. Now your question on, I think, how much was from Q3, which kind of gets into scores about Q3 guidance and things, roughly probably $10 million or so came from Q3. And so then you think about the difference, what's the difference related to? And a lot of that mostly relates to co-terming because the beauty of our business, we're always upselling. But that leaves the customer with a bunch of different renewal dates. And so if a customer has a fair amount of renewals in this case in Q2, and they have got renewal in Q3 and a bunch of renewals in Q4, what they may opt to do is co-term all those and just bring them to Q2, have a common term date, makes it easier for them. It makes it easier for us. So that's mostly related to some of the other renewals there that are outside of Q3. And then just on the... Yes, on the percentage of co-terms, just by definition, where we're so early into the \u2013 certainly into the term-based renewals, as far as starting to get into volume. It's not. I suspect we will see more and more of this as these renewals start to come up, and a customer has all these different renewal dates they are going to want simplicity. We're going to want simplicity. So I would suspect we will see more and more of these as the ATR, in general, continues to elevate over the next several quarters. Yes. Sure, it's Duston. At Investor Day, we had put a target out there from a GRR perspective of 90% or greater. And we are within that range currently. So, there was no real difference really than what we have seen over the last couple of quarters. We have a bigger sample size, of course, now. And we are happy where the core is. We are focusing on adoption of the total product portfolio. But so far, there has been really no meaningful change there. Sure. Let me take a shot at that. One of the thesis that we laid out at Investor Day was predictability of renewals. Because the company was always built on new and up-sell, and we weren't afforded the luxury to have renewals and the two traits of renewals that we laid out. First, that they were very cost-effective and they added leverage to the business model. And secondly, they added predictability, right. And so now, we are starting to have a revenue stream that has a much higher level of predictability. Now, I wouldn't layer that too much into your comment about Q2, Q3. But clearly, as the ATR goes up, we are going to have a different profile of the business that's not dominated by new and up-sell. And finally, this is what we have been talking about for the last 2 years or 3 years. Finally, the business starts to change and morph into a somewhat more predictable, better leverage business. Well, I mean, any time you have got increasing top line, obviously, revenue in this case, it's going to help the margin. But we also quite honestly got a little favorableness for some under-spend on headcount and support. That wasn't necessarily by design. So, that accounted for a little bit of it, but clearly, we are \u2013 I think if you look at the gross margin trend over the last many, many quarters, it's been in that 82%, 83% range. And we continue, I think to do a pretty good job managing within that range. So, it popped up probably a little higher than what we expected. And primarily the reason we are bringing it down in Q3 as the revenue base naturally shrinks a little bit as we go out from Q2 to Q3. Well, I mean we guide to a range that we expect to come close to. In this case, we guided $365 million to $370 million. You have some just one-off things like FICA taxes reset. So, that's millions of dollars in the first part of the calendar year. And we have a bigger step up in Q4, and this is the inherent you can do the calc for the guide for $160 million, $165 million \u2013 or $146 million to $165 million for the year. So eventually, we would like to hire more folks. We would like to hire. We are not massively off the target of sales reps, but we would like to hire a few more sales reps. We would like to hire the more R&D folks. We like to hire some more support folks. And I think we will do that over time. It's just a question of when will that happen. Now again, we have laid out an expense structure not only for this year with this guide, but we have laid it out \u201823 and \u201825. So, regardless of what we end up hiring, we are still \u2013 the total company still marching to those parameters. Well, that's not correct, Simon. So, let me kind of state the facts. So, as you recall, we have \u2013 we have talked about this in earnings calls, I think for the last three times we didn't this time, because we talked about so much is that the four quarters of our ACV billing guidance don't equal the year. And the reason why that doesn't equate is because less than 1-year deals, if we do a six-month million-dollar deal, in the quarter, we would count that as ACV of $2 million. And so you can't simply add. It's been \u2013 historically, it's been about a 6%, 7% discount. Again, we have laid this out in earnings call. So, I think if you do all that math, it would certainly not suggest a decrease in ACV billings in Q4. Yes. So, there is \u2013 again, it's simple math to do. I don't want to talk specially about Q4 because we don't guide to Q4 at this point. But if you do that math, it would certainly suggest an uptick in ACV billings in Q4. Yes. I think everything has gone up and salaries are certainly one of those things that have gone up. So, we have built that into the forecast. We are monitoring it effectively daily, weekly. And the assumptions there is that those wages are increasing. And we have tweaked up the assumption or we will end up tweaking the assumption for FY \u201823 also. And this isn't just us, obviously, this is everybody. But again, regardless of what that is, we will still operate within the expense structure we have laid out. I am not sure I quite understood the question, Nehal. I am sorry. Yes. That's fair. Yes. We would not expect at this point, the amount of early renewals sort of on a percentage basis or you can do a dollar basis that we experienced in Q2. It's also got LOD renewals playing in here too that have been a little bit stronger than what we had previously assumed on the same port piece. Yes. We do. We were on target this quarter, and there is a lot of different things going on. Dom and team are working away and whether that's channel and \u2013 channel work there, channel autonomy, which we have talked about a lot, leveraging partners, a lot more training for the sales force and then you have the solution selling. And again, the whole \u2013 Rajiv has talked about this a lot, but the whole \u2013 one of the big concepts on the solutions offering. [Abrupt End]"

Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter was a good start to fiscal 2022, building on the momentum we established in our prior fiscal year. Despite ongoing challenges from COVID-19, we delivered another solid quarter, exceeding all our guided metrics, seeing better-than-expected free cash flow, delivering significant new product innovations and making progress with our strategic partnerships. We saw healthy demand for Nutanix's cloud platform, driven by businesses looking to accelerate their digital transformation, modernize their data centers and adopt hybrid multi-cloud operating models, while ongoing supply chain challenges have made it more difficult for our customers and partners to procure their hardware. Thus far, we have seen minimal impact on our business, but we continue to watch the situation closely.  Taking a closer look. Our fiscal first quarter reflected continued execution on our ACV-based model and was marked by strong top and bottom-line performance. We saw record ACV billings, which grew 33% year-over-year, our highest growth rate in over 2.5 years. We also grew revenue 21% year-over-year, our highest growth rate in over 3 years despite seeing expected term compression. Once again, we saw excellent linearity, which combined with diligent expense management, enabled us to nearly achieve free cash flow breakeven in the quarter, putting us well on track to achieving our target of sustainable positive free cash flow by the second half of calendar year 2022. We achieved these results while continuing to add to our backlog. Overall, we are pleased with our fiscal first quarter financial results and believe we remain on track to achieving our target of 25% plus annualized ACV billings growth through fiscal year 2025. We continue to see strong adoption of our hybrid multi-cloud portfolio and solutions during the quarter. Our first quarter is typically a strong one for our federal business, and this one was no exception. Our largest customer in the quarter what a federal civilian agency that substantially expanded their usage of Nutanix' cloud platform, including our unified storage and database automation solutions.  This customer is using clusters on AWS to burst additional resource capacity to the public cloud to quickly augment their on-prem environment. Having a unified environment between on-prem and public cloud allows them to leverage the same team to manage both environments and more readily meet their business service level agreements. In another example, national retailer lands and purchased our Nutanix cloud platform, including clusters on AWS to enable bursting of their virtual desktop into the public cloud during the peak holiday selling season. They are also utilizing our platform to run CPU intensive CRM applications more efficiently and support their security and compliance needs. We see last end as a great example of the natural fit of our clusters offering for businesses with seasonal workloads. Finally, during the quarter, a European-based multinational pharmaceutical company substantially expanded their usage of our hybrid multi-cloud platform including our unified storage and database automation solutions to run a number of virtualized applications and enable virtual desktops in their branch offices. In September, Nutanix customers prospects and partners from all over the world joined us for our .NEXT digital experience. We were pleased with the attendance and engagement at our signature event, where we saw a record number of new Nutanix provision certifications and viewership for our keynotes and breakout sessions. We made several announcements at .NEXT, starting with the launch of a major release of our cloud platform, AOS 6.0 with new integrated Zero Trust Security, disaster recovery and virtual networking innovations. We also introduced new capabilities that make it easier for our customers to simplify data management and optimize database and big data workload performance on a Nutanix cloud platform.  Finally, we announced a new partnership with Citrix, through which the 2 companies will deliver remote work solutions that can be deployed across private and public clouds, combining the simplicity of the Nutanix cloud platform with Citrix virtual apps and desktop services to provide secure on-demand and elastic access to apps, desktops and data from any device in any location at any scale. Nutanix is now a preferred choice for HCI and hybrid multi-cloud solutions for Citrix virtual apps and desktop services. And Citrix is a preferred choice for enterprise end-user computing on the Nutanix cloud platform. The 2 companies will also partner on customer support and product road maps to ensure a seamless customer experience and timely validation and interoperability, respectively. Finally, our go-to-market teams will partner to sell to new and existing customers and enable channel partners. We see this partnership as another proof point in our strategy of furthering customer choice and enhancing our platform by partnering with other best-in-class providers. We are pleased with the industry recognition we continue to receive for our solutions. Earlier today, Nutanix was named as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Hyperconverged Infrastructure for the fifth time in a row. And in a testament to the growing breadth of our platform, the company was also recently named for the first time as a visionary in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for distributed file and object storage.  I am excited about our recent announcement that Dominick Delfino will be joining Nutanix as our Chief Revenue Officer on December 6. Dom brings deep and relevant domain knowledge, as well as go-to-market experience at scale. He will be a great spokesperson for us with customers, partners and the industry at large. And we expect him to hit the ground running when he joins us in a couple of weeks. As I approach my 1-year anniversary as CEO and reflect on an eventful year, the journey so far has been unquestionably gratifying. And I'm proud of what we've been able to achieve against a challenging backdrop. We unveiled our new vision, share our multiyear strategy and financial plan and delivered significant enhancements to our Nutanix cloud platform while reshaping it with a focus on solutions. We also made significant progress on our strategic partnerships, signing new or expanded agreements with Red Hat, Lenovo, HPE and Citrix. Finally, we began to see the benefits of our subscription transition in the form of consistent delivery of whistles ahead of expectations, and accelerating top line and a meaningfully improving bottom line.  As I look forward, I'm excited by what's ahead. We address large and growing markets, which are benefiting from the secular tailwind of an increasingly digital world. We have a strong hybrid multi-cloud platform to address this opportunity. Our subscription business model positions us to continue to deliver strong growth with the opportunity for substantial sales and marketing expense leverage as renewals become a larger portion of our business. We are focused on disciplined and purposeful spending to help us reach our profitability goals. Through it all, we continue to delight our customers, and they continue to love us.  In closing, I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter and optimistic about our ability to continue to deliver against the vast opportunity ahead of us.  And with that, I will hand it over to Duston Williams, Duston?\nDuston Williams: Thank you, Rajiv. Rajiv provided a good overview for the quarter, so I'll get right into some of the specific Q1 highlights. ACV billings for Q1 were $183 million, reflecting 33% growth year-over-year, above our guidance range of $172 million to $177 million and ahead of the Street consensus number of $175 million. Our renewals business performed as expected. ARR as of the end of Q1 was $0.95 billion, growing 67% year-over-year, slightly ahead of our expectation of 65% growth. Run rate ACV as of the end of Q1 was $1.59 billion, growing 23% year-over-year.  As expected, our average contract term lengths decreased to 3.1 years versus 3.4 years in Q4 '21, driven by our usual Q1 surge and federal business. On average, our federal customers typically have much shorter contract term lengths.  Revenue was $379 million, growing 21% from Q1 '21, above the Street consensus number of $369 million. We added approximately 560 new logos in Q1 '22 versus the Q4 '21 new logo count of 700 in and versus the Q1 '21 new logo count of 680. In the prior 3 fiscal years, our Q1 new logo count on average dropped by 115 new logos versus Q4. This year, we experienced a drop of 140 new logos from Q4 to Q1, slightly higher than the prior 3-year average of 115. We'd note that our new logo average selling prices continued to rise, which is in line with our strategy over the last year or so to focus on the quality and efficiency of new logo ads as measured by ASP per new logo. In fact, in FY '21, a year that was influenced by the pandemic, we saw our average selling prices per new logo increase by almost 25%. Our new logo average selling prices were also up in Q1 '22 versus Q1 '21 and versus Q4 '21. In short, we are generating more new logo ACV bookings with less new logos. Coming off a difficult prior year comparison of 86% year-over-year growth and following a very strong Q4 '21 emerging product new ACV bookings grew 11% year-over-year in Q1 '22. We expect significant growth in emerging products, new ACV bookings in Q2 '22 although the year-over-year comps will remain difficult. In Q1, on a limited basis, we started to roll out our new solution offerings. As we have previously stated, many emerging products will morph into these new solutions as we move through the current fiscal year, and therefore, any year-over-year comparisons will become less relevant. We have also adjusted our compensation plans accordingly no longer providing bonuses for selling most stand-alone emerging products. The emerging products attach rate was 42%. We are mindful of the importance of quality new logo additions and emerging products, and we will continue to keep the appropriate focus on them, including adjusting our incentive plans as required. The Q1 sales rep productivity exceeded our forecast, and we increased our total net sales reps in Q1. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.1% versus our guidance of 81.5%. Operating expenses were $353 million, lower than our guidance of $365 million to $370 million. Our non-GAAP net loss was $47 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.22 per share. Our Q1 linearity remained very good and receivable collections were excellent. DSOs in Q1 were 28 days, down from 43 days in Q4 '21. Our Q1 free cash flow was once again aided by the good linearity and collections coming in at a negative $2 million over $40 million better than the Street consensus. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.28 billion, up from $1.21 billion in Q4 '21. Now turning to our guidance. With the continued progress we've made on our subscription model, we believe it's now appropriate to provide annual guidance. Additionally, having gained a better understanding of potential fluctuations in our average contract term lengths. We are guiding to revenue on both a quarterly and annual basis.  The guidance for Q2 is as follows. ACV billings to be between $195 million and $200 million, representing year-over-year growth of 23% to 26%; revenue of $400 million to $410 million; gross margin of approximately 82% to 82.5%; operating expenses between $360 million and $365 million; and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $218 million.  The Q2 ACV billings guidance, which calls for year-over-year growth of 23% to 26% compared to the actual growth of 14% in Q2 '21 and Street consensus growth of 21% for Q2 '22. We expect a considerable quarter-over-quarter increase in emerging products new ACV bookings in Q2. Our average contract term length will most likely increase slightly in Q2 as our federal business will return to a lower percentage of the overall business mix.  Also, just a quick modeling reminder regarding our Q3 top line performance. In Q3, over the last 3 years, we have averaged a small sequential decline in ACV billings of approximately 3% to 4%. We would expect a similar trend for Q3 '22 for both ACV billings and revenue. We will use a bit of cash in Q2, mostly related to a slight buildup in receivables associated with higher projected Q2 billings. From a free cash flow perspective, we would expect something close to the current consensus estimate of a usage of approximately $25 million. The guide for FY '22 is as follows. ACV billings to be between $740 million and $750 million, representing year-over-year growth of 25% to 26%; revenue of $1.615 billion to $1.630 billion; gross margin of approximately 82%; and operating expenses between $1.48 billion to $1.49 billion. And one last reminder about the annual ACV billings guide. As we have often mentioned, our total fiscal year ACV billings are not derived from the simple addition of the 4 fiscal quarters. For our reported quarterly ACV billings, we annualize any deal that is less than 1 year in term length and our yearly ACV billings calculations eliminate any duplication that happens with the renewal of a deal that occurs within the period and is less than 1 year in duration.  Based on this methodology, over the last 3 fiscal years, the sum of the 4 fiscal quarters of ACV billings have exceeded the adjusted annual ACV billings by 6% to 7%. Some analysts have applied the required adjustment to their annual FY '22 billings estimates and others have not, resulting in an inflated FY '22 ACV billings consensus. That said, if you apply this methodology to the sum of the pre-earnings call quarterly ACV billings census numbers, it suggests a current FY '22 ACV billings consensus of approximately $720 million to $725 million. We would once again encourage investors to account for this distinction during the modeling process. With that, operator, could you please open the call up for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Great quarter. I appreciate all the details on guide moving forward, Duston. Maybe, Rajiv, I want to go back to your comments around the supply chain. A lot of push and pull from others around just the indirect supply chain impacts. I guess how much push or pull are you guys seeing? And if you -- it sounds like you guys were pretty insulated to it. Why do you think this was the case that hyperconverged and specifically Nutanix really moved up in the priority list here?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Jim. So thank you for the question. First of all, I think in our case, we run our software on a variety of hardware platforms. So our customers have a lot of choice, including, by the way, hardware platforms on AWS and soon to be Azure. So while there's certainly supply chain issues out there that we are all aware of, our customers so far have been able to get what they need by the choice that we provide. So as a result, we've seen some pull-ins and some pushouts, but the net impact is nil so far. So we are comfortable with our forecast. We'll continue to monitor the situation in terms of supply chain. But so far, so good, Jim.\nJames Fish: That's great. And maybe just on the go-to-market guys, why the decision to no longer incentivize the sales team to sell those stand-alone emerging products? And any update as to how that -- the early leads on the Red Hat partnership are going?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Sure. So let me do that at first, and then I'll go to the emerging products. So Red Hat was a partnership is going, I would say, really well. We got good momentum in the first quarter, which is really our first full quarter of the strategic partnership it's resulted in wins for both Red Hat Linux running on top of the Nutanix cloud platform as well as OpenShift on the Nutanix cloud platform. And we are going forward, we are expanding our go-to-market collaboration, including bringing in channel global systems integrators and our OEM partners. I'll give you 2 specific examples. So one example this last quarter, that a fintech customer who adopted OpenShift running on the Nutanix cloud platform to deliver banking software as a service. This is a SaaS company. So that's one example of OpenShift on our Nutanix Cloud platform. Another example here was a large bank for running their mission-critical applications.  One of the important things they wanted to make sure was that application runs on rail that had Linux on Nutanix. And the fact that we had a combined certified solution made them very comfortable to run that mission-critical applications on our platform. So that is a win that we got purely because of this relationship. So we're seeing good traction there. Now 2-year question on the emerging products and the space there and so forth. So first of all, as we said earlier in the call, we had some difficult year-over-year comparisons in fiscal '21. We had an 86% comp in Q1 '20. And as you know, Jim, we're transitioning to social selling, and we're also changing some of the incentives, I'll tell you why. As such, we were expecting a deceleration to approximately 20% this quarter. Now in fiscal '21, we had a sales accelerator that was tied exclusively to sales of emerging products. Now we removed that because we wanted to focus on not just selling them separately, but selling them first as part of our solutions portfolio, and we wanted to drive both sales and consumption of these solutions. Now perhaps we should have run a more gradual transition, our emerging product incentives. In Q2, we're implementing a revised incentive program, which will be more targeted. It will include a deployment component. And that said, we continue to be excited by the market opportunity overall for our solution portfolio.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Jack Andrews with Needham.\nJack Andrews: Congratulations on the results. So Rajiv, when we think about your software alliances now, you've got Red Hat, Citrix, AWS, Microsoft, what other areas do you think could be of interest? Do you think that there's anything missing from, we'll call it, a Nutanix platform story perspective?\nRajiv Ramaswami: So Jack, good question here. Obviously, we have a lot of work ahead in terms of continuing to grow those partnerships that you just mentioned. Now in addition, I think there's more opportunities for us to do more work with our global semintegrator. We continue to use them, especially in larger accounts, where I think we can get a lot more leverage through the GSIs. And again, I think the rest of it really is on expanding these partnerships in multiple vectors. We've done that this year with many of our partnerships. We expanded our HPE partnership.  We expanded our Lenovo partnership. And now with Citrix and that had, we are at the starting early stages Azure again, I think we've got great potential here, lots of customer interest. So a lot of execution ahead of us on these partnerships. And in terms of new ones, I look forward to doing more with Global System Integrators.\nJack Andrews: And just as a follow-up question, is there any update you can provide in terms of just traction with era in particular and around the database opportunity?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Indeed, I think this is one of our big bets as we\u2019ve talked about, very excited. We had a big quarter for ERA in Q4. And we are actually renewing \u2013 doubling down our investment on both R&D and go-to-market for era. We have a full 360 plan that we\u2019re executing to. I\u2019m still very excited about the potential for this because Truly\u2019s vision is, it\u2019s a multi-cloud database as a service offering that can work with a range of database engines. So we\u2019ve got good product market fit. We\u2019ve got large customers who have bet on this platform in a pretty substantial way. And so we are excited about the market opportunity, continuing to invest in it and driving very hard.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Pinjalim Bora with JP Morgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Great. Congrats guys on the quarter. Staying on that topic of ERA, it was -- we picked up the data point in doing our channel work that ERA is starting to drive 8-figure deals on its own might be an outlier, but I mean, I don't think people are really thinking of era to drive such big deals. Is that -- is that what your -- I mean, is that a norm? Or do you feel like those could be large outliers?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think what we see with ERA, there's certainly potential of large deals. And last quarter, we talked about a large financial services company betting big on ERA. Typically, these wins start out smaller, of course, Pinjalim, so they'll start out by looking at a particular use case for one database, and it won't be the most mission-critical database that they have, but something below that. And once they establish the use case and then they actually go down and buy a lot more. And so usually, it's our second deal or the third deal with a customer that's going to be bigger, right? The initial deals are going to be -- let me try this out for one use case, see how it works. And if I like it, I'm going to go big. So we are excited about the potential for ERA.  And the other thing is, as you go further up the stack, it's worth more from an ACV per core that we can get, right? So there's a lot of value that we can extract from the solution. It's -- and the use cases are very strong because customers are -- they have a huge number of databases that they manage and simplifying the operation of those databases is a massive value proposition and making that work in future in a multi-cloud world is another added value proposition on top of that. So I think Pinjalim I'm excited about it and continue to invest and believe in its prospects.\nPinjalim Bora: Got it. And just taking a step back, I guess, when I look at the ACV growth, obviously really good. You are trying \u2013 I think when you guided to it, you kind of guided a sequential dip in Q1. When I look at the actuals now, it seems like the sequential is even better than 2 years ago. What surprised you in the quarter? Is there anything that went much more positive than you thought in any particular areas to highlight?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I would say \u2013 go ahead, Duston.\nDuston Williams: Yes. No. I think basically, things came in as planned. A couple of things ran a little bit ahead, federal as we expect in Q1 had a good quarter, which helped things out. And the renewals remain very much on track, which is good. We continue to grow and mature that team internally. And we had some significant upsell business, as you might expect in the quarter 2. So I think it was a little bit of everything clearly as we expected, though, like every Q1 led by Federal.\nRajiv Ramaswami: The only other thing I would add there is I think we came close to breakeven on free cash flow. Again, that was a little better than we expected.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nDan Bergstrom : It's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. Really like the guidance around revenue and for the full year. Could you expand upon that decision? What gave you the confidence and guidance and why now?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Sure. Yes. No, I'll be happy to. From a guidance perspective, we actually talked last quarter about doing it a little bit earlier internally, and I just felt comfortable getting one more quarter under our belt before we kind of went back to annual guidance. But again, as we're coming through the subscription transition so much more is known. We've done a pretty good job of estimating where terms fluctuate as they do a little bit quarter-over-quarter. So we're clearly more comfortable. With that, the renewals have started to play out as planned, which add predictability. And I think with the backdrop of that, at some point, when we talk about all the improvements that's happened to the business. And as we believe it gets more predictable, I think it becomes a bit awkward not to give annual guidance, quite honestly. And so that's what we've done. We also heard it loud and clear from investors that they were tired of doing a little math, which I completely understand.  And I say with the term stabilizing a little bit, a big ask from the investment community was revenue. guidance and don't have as to the math just give us the revenue guidance. So we also did that not only on a quarterly basis but an annual basis. So we hope that helps out shows our confidence in the business, and we'll continue to that level of guidance throughout the fiscal year.\nDan Bergstrom : Yes, that\u2019s great, Duston. And then could you drill down into a little bit what you saw from the federal vertical in the quarter with fiscal year-end sounded positive from the prepared remarks. It\u2019s been mentioned a few times, but just more details there would be helpful.\nDuston Williams: Yes. Again, federal always comes in strong. We saw a nice new customer wins, a lot of upsell business there also. Again, pretty much as we expected, brought terms down. Federal usually has shorter terms that played out basically exactly as we had expected there. But overall, a good federal performance. And I should also mention in the quarter that EMEA, although typically not Q1 always, but EMEA showed really well in the quarter. So really our top performing region in the quarter. So that was nice to see, especially I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d add anything, Rajiv, about the federal business or not.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. Yes. I mean, Q1 is always a strong quarter for federal. Now one thing I would say is we are seeing the federal business also starting to use our cloud offerings. So one of the largest deals this quarter was with that federal agency that we talked about on the call earlier. And again, they are using clusters on AWS. For again, temporary capacity expansions, right, when they need it. So we\u2019re starting to see the multi-cloud adoption, our hybrid multi-cloud platform as such being adopted in federal agencies as well.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. Could you provide any color or maybe quantification of possible and what your backlog currently looks like?\nDuston Williams: We usually don\u2019t do that. We give a qualitative version. Rajiv mentioned that it went up quarter-over-quarter, which we were pleased in Q1 because that\u2019s not always the case. Q1 is use a little soft and Q3 is usually a little bit soft from a seasonality perspective. But we were pleased to add a little backlog in the quarter, and it\u2019s been several quarters now. That we\u2019ve been able to add some backlog. So we\u2019re happy with that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And just looking into 2022, I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about the overall demand backdrop in terms of just enterprise spending environment? There\u2019s ongoing server CPU refresh cycle. I\u2019m just curious if that impacts Nutanix to what degree?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I\u2019ll take that. In general, I think we have a good backdrop here. As customers continue to come out of COVID and invest in their strategic initiatives. They\u2019re investing in digital transformation. They\u2019re investing in modernizing their infrastructure and looking at cloud use cases. And -- so all of these, in general, I think, bode well to what we do. And the last bit, of course, is everybody is now in a hybrid work environment as well, and that will continue into next year as well. So all of these lineups quite well with what we sell from a solutions perspective. And so I expect the demand environment to continue to be healthy.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.\nRajagopal Kamesh: This is RK on behalf of Rod. And congrats on the nice results. question, could you give us an idea of how much Red Hat related revenues you saw in the quarter? And Rajiv, can you talk about your strategy on how you approach the broader highway cloud software market between your own products versus partnerships?\nDuston Williams: Yes, I'll let Rajiv, why don't you take the Red Hat piece there.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So look, the Red Hat partnership is pretty early, right? And what we're really doing is core selling together in specific accounts, and the go-to-market most really just started. What I would say is it's still early days. This was our first full quarter. And as you can see, the wins are starting to come in now. We talked about 2 wins here early days there. But again, those 2 categories are quite solid, right? One is just comfort with running mainstream applications on Renatlinax on our cloud platform with our hypervisor. So that's very clear. That's an immediate opportunity here. We can go out there and prosecute that independently almost. And then the second, really, where we do a lot of co-work with that had is around OpenShift and Nutanix cloud platform providing a best-of-breed total tax solution. And both of those, I think, are solutions are worthy of and we're seeing good starting great go-to-market engagement in the feed at this point. It's only the first quarter here, right? So of the partnership really in motion. To your second question around hybrid cloud and how we think of hybrid cloud software. Again, I think we look at this as us providing a runtime foundation, right? Infrastructure as a Service foundation with our hybrid cloud infrastructure, hybrid cloud management. And then on top of that, once storage and then database solution, soda-based automation solutions. That's our stack when it comes to a hybrid multi-cloud. And not all of it is available on every cloud today. Our base platform is available on AWS, soon to be Azure. And while some of the database solutions are largely today on our platform and not quite yet in native public clouds yet. But that's our vision. Now how do we complement that? For example, Red Hat delivers a fast platform, platform subscribers with OpenShift in a hybrid multi-cloud world. So Red Hat as Nutanix delivered a complete stack, PaaS and IS, right, platform and infrastructure as is all the way in a multi-cloud world. Then we have ecosystem partners that are doing added value functions, things like backup, for example, that we partner with and they decide along with our platform. and those also play in a hybrid multi-cloud world. We're looking at disaster recovery and working with potentially service for the partners, right, to go bring some of those capabilities to market as well. So there is a broad ecosystem. and we continue to leverage that quite in addition to providing our own stack.\nRajagopal Kamesh: Could you also talk about which emerging products you are most excited about for Q2?\nA \u2013 Rajiv Ramaswami: Well, I think, look, fundamentally, we piloted our new solutions offering this quarter in select regions. And I look forward to continuing to drive that into the marketplace, right, hybrid cloud infrastructure, hybrid cloud management, unified storage, database automation solutions, right? So I\u2019m excited about actually getting the solution sales rolling on a broader basis and really driving that into the marketplace. Because when we do that, we sell more of our products, it\u2019s easy for our customers to consume them. And as we\u2019ve talked about before, database, I mean, ERA is a big bet for us. I\u2019m excited about that opportunity and driving growth there over as perhaps one of the big bets that we are taking.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital.\nNehal Chokshi : Congrats on the very strong results, impressively dealing acceleration well above your long-term model be on that. In that context, why are you guiding to 24% midpoint year-over-year growth on the ACV billings given that you just accelerated way above your target model here?\nDuston Williams: Yes, Nehal, Duston. Yes, I've got a little different number, I think, somewhere around 25% to 26% is the number I have there so we can reconcile that offline. But that's right in line with what we've been saying -- we said it compounded through 25. We didn't really we actually gave, I think, for '22, a little bit lower expectation at Investor Day. So now we're happy to provide that level of guidance and that growth rate year-over-year.\nNehal Chokshi : Okay. Great. And then you mentioned renewals did really well. Can you dive that up between life of device maintenance and term-based licenses?\nDuston Williams: Yes. We've got the 2 pieces there, both going in opposite directions. Life of device starts to get phased out over time, and that's getting phased out. not quite as fast, quite honestly, as we thought in the plan, but that's getting phased out. And as we've talked about, certainly as we get in the second half of this fiscal year, the subscription renewals start to come in. And we saw a good traction in Q2. That will continue into Q3. And then we've got a bump up in Q4. So basically, both on track and performing as expected. We still have some back-office systems work that we're doing, and we'll continue to do that. But overall, the renewals are basically playing out as planned and the LOD support not quite going away as fast but definitely coming down.\nNehal Chokshi : Any thoughts on why the LOD is not fading as fast as you thought it might?\nA \u2013 Duston Williams: We had to kind of estimate in the plan as far as how that would transition and how fast people will do it, and some folks want to it sooner, some folks wait. And obviously, they have the optionality of increasing support 1 year, for instance, if they want, so they can run the hardware a little bit longer if they want to. But it\u2019s not all that different, but just a little bit stronger.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yes. Quick one for Duston. Did I miss this. I've been jumping around, but did you quantify renewal ACVs in the first quarter?\nDuston Williams: We didn't, Jason. We said we would during Investor Day on that disclosure sheet there that we would do that on an annual basis. but well within our -- ran well within our expectations.\nJason Ader: Perfect. Okay. And can you remind us kind of roughly where that is as a percentage of total ACV right now?\nDuston Williams: Well, we did that for the fiscal year, but we're not, again, breaking that out on a quarterly basis.\nJason Ader: We're -- it ended at what percentage the year?\nDuston Williams: Would have to get the exact -- would have to get the exact percentage. Yes, we can just reference the Investor Day there.\nJason Ader: Yes. Okay. And then Rajiv, have you noticed any changes in the competitive environment with VMware/Dell now that Dell has spun off VMware? Is that changing any of the dynamics around competing with VxRail?\nA \u2013 Rajiv Ramaswami: Not really at this point, I would say, Jason. I would say things are about the same as they were. We continue to focus on our value proposition with our customers and continuing to work with all the partners that we talk about, right? So HP, Lenovo, et cetera, and Fujitsu and many others that we continue to work. So I haven\u2019t seen much so far in terms of change. And again, you saw the Magic Quadrant come up, and we continue to be a leader there for the time. And then you saw the new Magic Quadrant on Pfizer objects, and we were thrilled to be visionary there. So I would say, at this point, really no change in our \u2013 in the competitive landscape. We continue to see a higher win ratio for us. Are partly perhaps because our pipeline discipline has gone better, and we are much more disciplined in terms of our execution. But really largely no change yet.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: It\u2019s actually Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Congrats on the quarter and on giving annual guidance. I have one for Rajiv and a couple for Duston. Rajiv, sounded \u2013 in the prepared remarks, it sounded like new logo adds this quarter were a little bit weaker than expected. Is there any dynamic to that? What \u2013 and what caused that? And how do you expect that to trend over the next couple of quarters?\nA \u2013 Rajiv Ramaswami: Yes. Sure. Duston, do you want to take that? You\u2019ve got a detail?\nA \u2013 Duston Williams: Yes. As we mentioned in the call, typically, over the last 3 years, you just average them, it bounced around a little bit, but average them Q1 new logos, as I said, came down roughly 115 on average. We came down 140. So it\u2019s not that much different from the prior Q1 \u2013 Q4 to Q1 transition there. And then also, we\u2019ve been, over the last year or more, really focusing again on the efficiency of adding new logos and the quality of new logos and that shows pretty clearly when you look at the \u2013 just the ASPs on new logos going up 25% year-over-year in \u201821 versus \u201820. So you can see there that we\u2019re focused.  We\u2019re again, basically driving more new logo ACV dollars per logo there. So we\u2019re happy about that, and we\u2019ll continue to have that focus. But again, we\u2019ll continue to look at new logos and adjust comp plans. We always do that more outside of the company more pits and bonuses. We\u2019re always moving those around a little bit to reflect what we need to do in the business, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. And I think the other question I had was Q2 and what that looks like potentially from a new logo perspective. So both tell you is that I believe every Q1 to Q2 new logos have increased. We\u2019ll see how this Q2 plays out. But every other Q1 to Q2, we\u2019ve seen an increase sequentially in new logos.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Can I ask you on free cash flow? I mean, you were almost breakeven even this quarter in fiscal 1Q. So why is the guidance still that you\u2019ll get to breakeven by the end of the fiscal year or by calendar second half of \u201822. What are the dynamics happening in free cash flow over the next couple of quarters?\nDuston Williams: Sure. Clearly, this performance and the performance over the last couple of quarters gives us more confidence in our projection of the second half of the calendar to reach free cash flow positive. But again, we\u2019ve done an outstanding job on 2 fronts there, linearity and collections and the combination of those 2 things are really a killer from a free cash flow perspective in a positive manner. And so this quarter, we hit both of them really nice and collections were great. And if you go back to a year ago. We brought AR down, I believe, somewhere around 35% year-over-year, while billings have gone up 20%. So we can\u2019t continue to keep that type of performance. We\u2019ll continue to do very well on both those metrics. But in Q2, just because we expect increase in just total billings, naturally, ARR is going to go up a little bit, so we\u2019re going to pump a little bit back into the working capital that\u2019s going to use a little cash and then that kind of bounces around. But again, this combined with the overall performance of the business just gives us more confidence in that, again, the second half \u201822 calendar projection of reaching free cash flow positive.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Got it. If I can just sneak one more in. I wanted to ask you about seasonality of ACV billings in the sense that, I guess, you talked about 3Q being down 3% to 4% sequentially. And I think in the last earnings call, you talked about 4Q being sequentially up primarily because of the renewals business. So I wanted to ask you, as that renewals business grows, should we expect that seasonality to become more pronounced, like would 3Q be lower more sequentially in the coming years and then 4Q sees a more expanded recovery or not. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on how the ACV billing seasonality trends as your renewals business increases?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. It\u2019s a good question. And it doesn\u2019t really change it that much. The only reason why we\u2019re seeing a pop up in Q4. It\u2019s just the \u2013 it\u2019s the initial wave, if you will, of renewals coming in. And there\u2019s nothing magical about Q4. There\u2019s \u2013 at this point, we\u2019re not co-terming a bunch of stuff to make sure it goes into Q4. It\u2019s just where the ATR resides, are they available to renew on kind of the initial flow of renewals. So this isn\u2019t a change in seasonality. It\u2019s just how the renewals are flowing. And eventually, once we get into a rhythm here with renewals, that kind of starts to even out use you\u2019d see a natural progression upwards and a little bit more linear manner, probably.\nOperator: And your last question is from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities.\nErik Suppiger : Congrats on a good quarter. Curious about hardware constraints. You had said they didn\u2019t have much impact in the quarter, but I\u2019m curious if your partners, if your hardware partners have some of them been constrained and customers are shifting from one platform to another? Or have you been pretty free of any constraints across your \u2013 across all of your partners?\nRajiv Ramaswami: No. I would say, Eric, that\u2019s again a good question. We\u2019ve certainly seen customers having to pay more attention to managing their hardware supply chain for sure, right? And so if they can\u2019t get what they need from one vendor, they go to another vendor and try to get what they need, right? And \u2013 so definitely, the fact that we\u2019ve got some flexibility in terms of hardware choices helps us bridge the gap or be the situation. And our customers as well get to leverage a variety of commodity servers, right? At the end of the day, the hardware that our star runs on is a standard server. And so they have a lot of choice. And they will certainly pick \u2013 increasingly, they might pick one that\u2019s available versus one that may be from a preferred vendor for us. So I think the customers definitely are paying more attention to managing their supply chain for the hardware and we see that like we said earlier in the call, it hasn\u2019t really impacted us from a software perspective in any way yet.\nErik Suppiger : Do you anticipate \u2013 or did it get worse during the course of the quarter in terms of the constraints? And what do you anticipate in terms of constraints through the end of the year or through early next year?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I mean it\u2019s \u2013 so not for us, Erik. I mean, I think for us, it\u2019s been essentially \u2013 we\u2019ve seen some pull, some push for the most part the business impact has been minimal. Now it\u2019s hard for me to predict here. Clearly, there\u2019s significant supply chain constraints out there in the hardware space. No doubt about it. So we are comfortable with our second quarter, I can tell you that for sure. And we\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation here as we go by. And of course, you saw that we provided annual guidance as well, and we have confidence in the to go ahead growth as well.\nOperator: If there are no more questions, we will now end the call. Thank you, everyone, for joining. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter was a good start to fiscal 2022, building on the momentum we established in our prior fiscal year. Despite ongoing challenges from COVID-19, we delivered another solid quarter, exceeding all our guided metrics, seeing better-than-expected free cash flow, delivering significant new product innovations and making progress with our strategic partnerships. We saw healthy demand for Nutanix's cloud platform, driven by businesses looking to accelerate their digital transformation, modernize their data centers and adopt hybrid multi-cloud operating models, while ongoing supply chain challenges have made it more difficult for our customers and partners to procure their hardware. Thus far, we have seen minimal impact on our business, but we continue to watch the situation closely.  Taking a closer look. Our fiscal first quarter reflected continued execution on our ACV-based model and was marked by strong top and bottom-line performance. We saw record ACV billings, which grew 33% year-over-year, our highest growth rate in over 2.5 years. We also grew revenue 21% year-over-year, our highest growth rate in over 3 years despite seeing expected term compression. Once again, we saw excellent linearity, which combined with diligent expense management, enabled us to nearly achieve free cash flow breakeven in the quarter, putting us well on track to achieving our target of sustainable positive free cash flow by the second half of calendar year 2022. We achieved these results while continuing to add to our backlog. Overall, we are pleased with our fiscal first quarter financial results and believe we remain on track to achieving our target of 25% plus annualized ACV billings growth through fiscal year 2025. We continue to see strong adoption of our hybrid multi-cloud portfolio and solutions during the quarter. Our first quarter is typically a strong one for our federal business, and this one was no exception. Our largest customer in the quarter what a federal civilian agency that substantially expanded their usage of Nutanix' cloud platform, including our unified storage and database automation solutions.  This customer is using clusters on AWS to burst additional resource capacity to the public cloud to quickly augment their on-prem environment. Having a unified environment between on-prem and public cloud allows them to leverage the same team to manage both environments and more readily meet their business service level agreements. In another example, national retailer lands and purchased our Nutanix cloud platform, including clusters on AWS to enable bursting of their virtual desktop into the public cloud during the peak holiday selling season. They are also utilizing our platform to run CPU intensive CRM applications more efficiently and support their security and compliance needs. We see last end as a great example of the natural fit of our clusters offering for businesses with seasonal workloads. Finally, during the quarter, a European-based multinational pharmaceutical company substantially expanded their usage of our hybrid multi-cloud platform including our unified storage and database automation solutions to run a number of virtualized applications and enable virtual desktops in their branch offices. In September, Nutanix customers prospects and partners from all over the world joined us for our .NEXT digital experience. We were pleased with the attendance and engagement at our signature event, where we saw a record number of new Nutanix provision certifications and viewership for our keynotes and breakout sessions. We made several announcements at .NEXT, starting with the launch of a major release of our cloud platform, AOS 6.0 with new integrated Zero Trust Security, disaster recovery and virtual networking innovations. We also introduced new capabilities that make it easier for our customers to simplify data management and optimize database and big data workload performance on a Nutanix cloud platform.  Finally, we announced a new partnership with Citrix, through which the 2 companies will deliver remote work solutions that can be deployed across private and public clouds, combining the simplicity of the Nutanix cloud platform with Citrix virtual apps and desktop services to provide secure on-demand and elastic access to apps, desktops and data from any device in any location at any scale. Nutanix is now a preferred choice for HCI and hybrid multi-cloud solutions for Citrix virtual apps and desktop services. And Citrix is a preferred choice for enterprise end-user computing on the Nutanix cloud platform. The 2 companies will also partner on customer support and product road maps to ensure a seamless customer experience and timely validation and interoperability, respectively. Finally, our go-to-market teams will partner to sell to new and existing customers and enable channel partners. We see this partnership as another proof point in our strategy of furthering customer choice and enhancing our platform by partnering with other best-in-class providers. We are pleased with the industry recognition we continue to receive for our solutions. Earlier today, Nutanix was named as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Hyperconverged Infrastructure for the fifth time in a row. And in a testament to the growing breadth of our platform, the company was also recently named for the first time as a visionary in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for distributed file and object storage.  I am excited about our recent announcement that Dominick Delfino will be joining Nutanix as our Chief Revenue Officer on December 6. Dom brings deep and relevant domain knowledge, as well as go-to-market experience at scale. He will be a great spokesperson for us with customers, partners and the industry at large. And we expect him to hit the ground running when he joins us in a couple of weeks. As I approach my 1-year anniversary as CEO and reflect on an eventful year, the journey so far has been unquestionably gratifying. And I'm proud of what we've been able to achieve against a challenging backdrop. We unveiled our new vision, share our multiyear strategy and financial plan and delivered significant enhancements to our Nutanix cloud platform while reshaping it with a focus on solutions. We also made significant progress on our strategic partnerships, signing new or expanded agreements with Red Hat, Lenovo, HPE and Citrix. Finally, we began to see the benefits of our subscription transition in the form of consistent delivery of whistles ahead of expectations, and accelerating top line and a meaningfully improving bottom line.  As I look forward, I'm excited by what's ahead. We address large and growing markets, which are benefiting from the secular tailwind of an increasingly digital world. We have a strong hybrid multi-cloud platform to address this opportunity. Our subscription business model positions us to continue to deliver strong growth with the opportunity for substantial sales and marketing expense leverage as renewals become a larger portion of our business. We are focused on disciplined and purposeful spending to help us reach our profitability goals. Through it all, we continue to delight our customers, and they continue to love us.  In closing, I am pleased with our performance in the first quarter and optimistic about our ability to continue to deliver against the vast opportunity ahead of us.  And with that, I will hand it over to Duston Williams, Duston? Yes, Jim. So thank you for the question. First of all, I think in our case, we run our software on a variety of hardware platforms. So our customers have a lot of choice, including, by the way, hardware platforms on AWS and soon to be Azure. So while there's certainly supply chain issues out there that we are all aware of, our customers so far have been able to get what they need by the choice that we provide. So as a result, we've seen some pull-ins and some pushouts, but the net impact is nil so far. So we are comfortable with our forecast. We'll continue to monitor the situation in terms of supply chain. But so far, so good, Jim. Sure. So let me do that at first, and then I'll go to the emerging products. So Red Hat was a partnership is going, I would say, really well. We got good momentum in the first quarter, which is really our first full quarter of the strategic partnership it's resulted in wins for both Red Hat Linux running on top of the Nutanix cloud platform as well as OpenShift on the Nutanix cloud platform. And we are going forward, we are expanding our go-to-market collaboration, including bringing in channel global systems integrators and our OEM partners. I'll give you 2 specific examples. So one example this last quarter, that a fintech customer who adopted OpenShift running on the Nutanix cloud platform to deliver banking software as a service. This is a SaaS company. So that's one example of OpenShift on our Nutanix Cloud platform. Another example here was a large bank for running their mission-critical applications.  One of the important things they wanted to make sure was that application runs on rail that had Linux on Nutanix. And the fact that we had a combined certified solution made them very comfortable to run that mission-critical applications on our platform. So that is a win that we got purely because of this relationship. So we're seeing good traction there. Now 2-year question on the emerging products and the space there and so forth. So first of all, as we said earlier in the call, we had some difficult year-over-year comparisons in fiscal '21. We had an 86% comp in Q1 '20. And as you know, Jim, we're transitioning to social selling, and we're also changing some of the incentives, I'll tell you why. As such, we were expecting a deceleration to approximately 20% this quarter. Now in fiscal '21, we had a sales accelerator that was tied exclusively to sales of emerging products. Now we removed that because we wanted to focus on not just selling them separately, but selling them first as part of our solutions portfolio, and we wanted to drive both sales and consumption of these solutions. Now perhaps we should have run a more gradual transition, our emerging product incentives. In Q2, we're implementing a revised incentive program, which will be more targeted. It will include a deployment component. And that said, we continue to be excited by the market opportunity overall for our solution portfolio. So Jack, good question here. Obviously, we have a lot of work ahead in terms of continuing to grow those partnerships that you just mentioned. Now in addition, I think there's more opportunities for us to do more work with our global semintegrator. We continue to use them, especially in larger accounts, where I think we can get a lot more leverage through the GSIs. And again, I think the rest of it really is on expanding these partnerships in multiple vectors. We've done that this year with many of our partnerships. We expanded our HPE partnership.  We expanded our Lenovo partnership. And now with Citrix and that had, we are at the starting early stages Azure again, I think we've got great potential here, lots of customer interest. So a lot of execution ahead of us on these partnerships. And in terms of new ones, I look forward to doing more with Global System Integrators. Indeed, I think this is one of our big bets as we've talked about, very excited. We had a big quarter for ERA in Q4. And we are actually renewing \u2013 doubling down our investment on both R&D and go-to-market for era. We have a full 360 plan that we're executing to. I'm still very excited about the potential for this because Truly's vision is, it's a multi-cloud database as a service offering that can work with a range of database engines. So we've got good product market fit. We've got large customers who have bet on this platform in a pretty substantial way. And so we are excited about the market opportunity, continuing to invest in it and driving very hard. Yes. I think what we see with ERA, there's certainly potential of large deals. And last quarter, we talked about a large financial services company betting big on ERA. Typically, these wins start out smaller, of course, Pinjalim, so they'll start out by looking at a particular use case for one database, and it won't be the most mission-critical database that they have, but something below that. And once they establish the use case and then they actually go down and buy a lot more. And so usually, it's our second deal or the third deal with a customer that's going to be bigger, right? The initial deals are going to be -- let me try this out for one use case, see how it works. And if I like it, I'm going to go big. So we are excited about the potential for ERA.  And the other thing is, as you go further up the stack, it's worth more from an ACV per core that we can get, right? So there's a lot of value that we can extract from the solution. It's -- and the use cases are very strong because customers are -- they have a huge number of databases that they manage and simplifying the operation of those databases is a massive value proposition and making that work in future in a multi-cloud world is another added value proposition on top of that. So I think Pinjalim I'm excited about it and continue to invest and believe in its prospects. I would say \u2013 go ahead, Duston. The only other thing I would add there is I think we came close to breakeven on free cash flow. Again, that was a little better than we expected. Sure. Yes. No, I'll be happy to. From a guidance perspective, we actually talked last quarter about doing it a little bit earlier internally, and I just felt comfortable getting one more quarter under our belt before we kind of went back to annual guidance. But again, as we're coming through the subscription transition so much more is known. We've done a pretty good job of estimating where terms fluctuate as they do a little bit quarter-over-quarter. So we're clearly more comfortable. With that, the renewals have started to play out as planned, which add predictability. And I think with the backdrop of that, at some point, when we talk about all the improvements that's happened to the business. And as we believe it gets more predictable, I think it becomes a bit awkward not to give annual guidance, quite honestly. And so that's what we've done. We also heard it loud and clear from investors that they were tired of doing a little math, which I completely understand.  And I say with the term stabilizing a little bit, a big ask from the investment community was revenue. guidance and don't have as to the math just give us the revenue guidance. So we also did that not only on a quarterly basis but an annual basis. So we hope that helps out shows our confidence in the business, and we'll continue to that level of guidance throughout the fiscal year. Yes. Yes. I mean, Q1 is always a strong quarter for federal. Now one thing I would say is we are seeing the federal business also starting to use our cloud offerings. So one of the largest deals this quarter was with that federal agency that we talked about on the call earlier. And again, they are using clusters on AWS. For again, temporary capacity expansions, right, when they need it. So we're starting to see the multi-cloud adoption, our hybrid multi-cloud platform as such being adopted in federal agencies as well. Yes. I'll take that. In general, I think we have a good backdrop here. As customers continue to come out of COVID and invest in their strategic initiatives. They're investing in digital transformation. They're investing in modernizing their infrastructure and looking at cloud use cases. And -- so all of these, in general, I think, bode well to what we do. And the last bit, of course, is everybody is now in a hybrid work environment as well, and that will continue into next year as well. So all of these lineups quite well with what we sell from a solutions perspective. And so I expect the demand environment to continue to be healthy. Yes. So look, the Red Hat partnership is pretty early, right? And what we're really doing is core selling together in specific accounts, and the go-to-market most really just started. What I would say is it's still early days. This was our first full quarter. And as you can see, the wins are starting to come in now. We talked about 2 wins here early days there. But again, those 2 categories are quite solid, right? One is just comfort with running mainstream applications on Renatlinax on our cloud platform with our hypervisor. So that's very clear. That's an immediate opportunity here. We can go out there and prosecute that independently almost. And then the second, really, where we do a lot of co-work with that had is around OpenShift and Nutanix cloud platform providing a best-of-breed total tax solution. And both of those, I think, are solutions are worthy of and we're seeing good starting great go-to-market engagement in the feed at this point. It's only the first quarter here, right? So of the partnership really in motion. To your second question around hybrid cloud and how we think of hybrid cloud software. Again, I think we look at this as us providing a runtime foundation, right? Infrastructure as a Service foundation with our hybrid cloud infrastructure, hybrid cloud management. And then on top of that, once storage and then database solution, soda-based automation solutions. That's our stack when it comes to a hybrid multi-cloud. And not all of it is available on every cloud today. Our base platform is available on AWS, soon to be Azure. And while some of the database solutions are largely today on our platform and not quite yet in native public clouds yet. But that's our vision. Now how do we complement that? For example, Red Hat delivers a fast platform, platform subscribers with OpenShift in a hybrid multi-cloud world. So Red Hat as Nutanix delivered a complete stack, PaaS and IS, right, platform and infrastructure as is all the way in a multi-cloud world. Then we have ecosystem partners that are doing added value functions, things like backup, for example, that we partner with and they decide along with our platform. and those also play in a hybrid multi-cloud world. We're looking at disaster recovery and working with potentially service for the partners, right, to go bring some of those capabilities to market as well. So there is a broad ecosystem. and we continue to leverage that quite in addition to providing our own stack. Yes. It's a good question. And it doesn't really change it that much. The only reason why we're seeing a pop up in Q4. It's just the \u2013 it's the initial wave, if you will, of renewals coming in. And there's nothing magical about Q4. There's \u2013 at this point, we're not co-terming a bunch of stuff to make sure it goes into Q4. It's just where the ATR resides, are they available to renew on kind of the initial flow of renewals. So this isn't a change in seasonality. It's just how the renewals are flowing. And eventually, once we get into a rhythm here with renewals, that kind of starts to even out use you'd see a natural progression upwards and a little bit more linear manner, probably. No. I would say, Eric, that's again a good question. We've certainly seen customers having to pay more attention to managing their hardware supply chain for sure, right? And so if they can't get what they need from one vendor, they go to another vendor and try to get what they need, right? And \u2013 so definitely, the fact that we've got some flexibility in terms of hardware choices helps us bridge the gap or be the situation. And our customers as well get to leverage a variety of commodity servers, right? At the end of the day, the hardware that our star runs on is a standard server. And so they have a lot of choice. And they will certainly pick \u2013 increasingly, they might pick one that's available versus one that may be from a preferred vendor for us. So I think the customers definitely are paying more attention to managing their supply chain for the hardware and we see that like we said earlier in the call, it hasn't really impacted us from a software perspective in any way yet. I mean it's \u2013 so not for us, Erik. I mean, I think for us, it's been essentially \u2013 we've seen some pull, some push for the most part the business impact has been minimal. Now it's hard for me to predict here. Clearly, there's significant supply chain constraints out there in the hardware space. No doubt about it. So we are comfortable with our second quarter, I can tell you that for sure. And we'll continue to monitor the situation here as we go by. And of course, you saw that we provided annual guidance as well, and we have confidence in the to go ahead growth as well."

            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. Rajiv provided a good overview for the quarter, so I'll get right into some of the specific Q1 highlights. ACV billings for Q1 were $183 million, reflecting 33% growth year-over-year, above our guidance range of $172 million to $177 million and ahead of the Street consensus number of $175 million. Our renewals business performed as expected. ARR as of the end of Q1 was $0.95 billion, growing 67% year-over-year, slightly ahead of our expectation of 65% growth. Run rate ACV as of the end of Q1 was $1.59 billion, growing 23% year-over-year.  As expected, our average contract term lengths decreased to 3.1 years versus 3.4 years in Q4 '21, driven by our usual Q1 surge and federal business. On average, our federal customers typically have much shorter contract term lengths.  Revenue was $379 million, growing 21% from Q1 '21, above the Street consensus number of $369 million. We added approximately 560 new logos in Q1 '22 versus the Q4 '21 new logo count of 700 in and versus the Q1 '21 new logo count of 680. In the prior 3 fiscal years, our Q1 new logo count on average dropped by 115 new logos versus Q4. This year, we experienced a drop of 140 new logos from Q4 to Q1, slightly higher than the prior 3-year average of 115. We'd note that our new logo average selling prices continued to rise, which is in line with our strategy over the last year or so to focus on the quality and efficiency of new logo ads as measured by ASP per new logo. In fact, in FY '21, a year that was influenced by the pandemic, we saw our average selling prices per new logo increase by almost 25%. Our new logo average selling prices were also up in Q1 '22 versus Q1 '21 and versus Q4 '21. In short, we are generating more new logo ACV bookings with less new logos. Coming off a difficult prior year comparison of 86% year-over-year growth and following a very strong Q4 '21 emerging product new ACV bookings grew 11% year-over-year in Q1 '22. We expect significant growth in emerging products, new ACV bookings in Q2 '22 although the year-over-year comps will remain difficult. In Q1, on a limited basis, we started to roll out our new solution offerings. As we have previously stated, many emerging products will morph into these new solutions as we move through the current fiscal year, and therefore, any year-over-year comparisons will become less relevant. We have also adjusted our compensation plans accordingly no longer providing bonuses for selling most stand-alone emerging products. The emerging products attach rate was 42%. We are mindful of the importance of quality new logo additions and emerging products, and we will continue to keep the appropriate focus on them, including adjusting our incentive plans as required. The Q1 sales rep productivity exceeded our forecast, and we increased our total net sales reps in Q1. Our non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.1% versus our guidance of 81.5%. Operating expenses were $353 million, lower than our guidance of $365 million to $370 million. Our non-GAAP net loss was $47 million for the quarter or a loss of $0.22 per share. Our Q1 linearity remained very good and receivable collections were excellent. DSOs in Q1 were 28 days, down from 43 days in Q4 '21. Our Q1 free cash flow was once again aided by the good linearity and collections coming in at a negative $2 million over $40 million better than the Street consensus. We closed the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.28 billion, up from $1.21 billion in Q4 '21. Now turning to our guidance. With the continued progress we've made on our subscription model, we believe it's now appropriate to provide annual guidance. Additionally, having gained a better understanding of potential fluctuations in our average contract term lengths. We are guiding to revenue on both a quarterly and annual basis.  The guidance for Q2 is as follows. ACV billings to be between $195 million and $200 million, representing year-over-year growth of 23% to 26%; revenue of $400 million to $410 million; gross margin of approximately 82% to 82.5%; operating expenses between $360 million and $365 million; and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $218 million.  The Q2 ACV billings guidance, which calls for year-over-year growth of 23% to 26% compared to the actual growth of 14% in Q2 '21 and Street consensus growth of 21% for Q2 '22. We expect a considerable quarter-over-quarter increase in emerging products new ACV bookings in Q2. Our average contract term length will most likely increase slightly in Q2 as our federal business will return to a lower percentage of the overall business mix.  Also, just a quick modeling reminder regarding our Q3 top line performance. In Q3, over the last 3 years, we have averaged a small sequential decline in ACV billings of approximately 3% to 4%. We would expect a similar trend for Q3 '22 for both ACV billings and revenue. We will use a bit of cash in Q2, mostly related to a slight buildup in receivables associated with higher projected Q2 billings. From a free cash flow perspective, we would expect something close to the current consensus estimate of a usage of approximately $25 million. The guide for FY '22 is as follows. ACV billings to be between $740 million and $750 million, representing year-over-year growth of 25% to 26%; revenue of $1.615 billion to $1.630 billion; gross margin of approximately 82%; and operating expenses between $1.48 billion to $1.49 billion. And one last reminder about the annual ACV billings guide. As we have often mentioned, our total fiscal year ACV billings are not derived from the simple addition of the 4 fiscal quarters. For our reported quarterly ACV billings, we annualize any deal that is less than 1 year in term length and our yearly ACV billings calculations eliminate any duplication that happens with the renewal of a deal that occurs within the period and is less than 1 year in duration.  Based on this methodology, over the last 3 fiscal years, the sum of the 4 fiscal quarters of ACV billings have exceeded the adjusted annual ACV billings by 6% to 7%. Some analysts have applied the required adjustment to their annual FY '22 billings estimates and others have not, resulting in an inflated FY '22 ACV billings consensus. That said, if you apply this methodology to the sum of the pre-earnings call quarterly ACV billings census numbers, it suggests a current FY '22 ACV billings consensus of approximately $720 million to $725 million. We would once again encourage investors to account for this distinction during the modeling process. With that, operator, could you please open the call up for questions? Thank you. Yes. No. I think basically, things came in as planned. A couple of things ran a little bit ahead, federal as we expect in Q1 had a good quarter, which helped things out. And the renewals remain very much on track, which is good. We continue to grow and mature that team internally. And we had some significant upsell business, as you might expect in the quarter 2. So I think it was a little bit of everything clearly as we expected, though, like every Q1 led by Federal. Yes. Again, federal always comes in strong. We saw a nice new customer wins, a lot of upsell business there also. Again, pretty much as we expected, brought terms down. Federal usually has shorter terms that played out basically exactly as we had expected there. But overall, a good federal performance. And I should also mention in the quarter that EMEA, although typically not Q1 always, but EMEA showed really well in the quarter. So really our top performing region in the quarter. So that was nice to see, especially I don't know if you'd add anything, Rajiv, about the federal business or not. We usually don't do that. We give a qualitative version. Rajiv mentioned that it went up quarter-over-quarter, which we were pleased in Q1 because that's not always the case. Q1 is use a little soft and Q3 is usually a little bit soft from a seasonality perspective. But we were pleased to add a little backlog in the quarter, and it's been several quarters now. That we've been able to add some backlog. So we're happy with that. Yes, I'll let Rajiv, why don't you take the Red Hat piece there. Yes, Nehal, Duston. Yes, I've got a little different number, I think, somewhere around 25% to 26% is the number I have there so we can reconcile that offline. But that's right in line with what we've been saying -- we said it compounded through 25. We didn't really we actually gave, I think, for '22, a little bit lower expectation at Investor Day. So now we're happy to provide that level of guidance and that growth rate year-over-year. Yes. We've got the 2 pieces there, both going in opposite directions. Life of device starts to get phased out over time, and that's getting phased out. not quite as fast, quite honestly, as we thought in the plan, but that's getting phased out. And as we've talked about, certainly as we get in the second half of this fiscal year, the subscription renewals start to come in. And we saw a good traction in Q2. That will continue into Q3. And then we've got a bump up in Q4. So basically, both on track and performing as expected. We still have some back-office systems work that we're doing, and we'll continue to do that. But overall, the renewals are basically playing out as planned and the LOD support not quite going away as fast but definitely coming down. We didn't, Jason. We said we would during Investor Day on that disclosure sheet there that we would do that on an annual basis. but well within our -- ran well within our expectations. Well, we did that for the fiscal year, but we're not, again, breaking that out on a quarterly basis. Would have to get the exact -- would have to get the exact percentage. Yes, we can just reference the Investor Day there. Sure. Clearly, this performance and the performance over the last couple of quarters gives us more confidence in our projection of the second half of the calendar to reach free cash flow positive. But again, we've done an outstanding job on 2 fronts there, linearity and collections and the combination of those 2 things are really a killer from a free cash flow perspective in a positive manner. And so this quarter, we hit both of them really nice and collections were great. And if you go back to a year ago. We brought AR down, I believe, somewhere around 35% year-over-year, while billings have gone up 20%. So we can't continue to keep that type of performance. We'll continue to do very well on both those metrics. But in Q2, just because we expect increase in just total billings, naturally, ARR is going to go up a little bit, so we're going to pump a little bit back into the working capital that's going to use a little cash and then that kind of bounces around. But again, this combined with the overall performance of the business just gives us more confidence in that, again, the second half \u201822 calendar projection of reaching free cash flow positive."

Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich and good afternoon everyone. We delivered a good fourth quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance, capping off a strong fiscal 2023. The uncertain macro backdrop that we saw in our fourth quarter was largely unchanged compared with the prior quarter and we continue to see steady demand for our solutions in Q4. This was driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership. Taking a closer look at the fourth quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all of our guided metrics. We delivered strong ACV billings growth and record quarterly revenue of $494 million, a nearly $2 billion annualized run-rate. We also had another quarter of good free cash flow generation despite some expected one-time payments. Overall, our fourth quarter financial performance was a strong finish to our fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2023 results demonstrate the progress we\u2019ve made with our subscription model. Specifically, we delivered healthy year-over-year ACV billings growth of 27%, led by outperformance of our renewals business. We also delivered our first year of non-GAAP profitability in the company\u2019s history with a non-GAAP operating margin of 9%. Finally, despite the impact of several one-time payments, we generated free cash flow in excess of $200 million, a roughly tenfold increase compared to our prior fiscal year. Beyond the financials, we made significant progress across all aspects of our business in fiscal 2023. On the product front, we delivered general availability of NC2 on Microsoft Azure, announced meaningful new products in areas such as Kubernetes, data services and cloud management and defined our data services vision with Project Beacon to enable companies to build portable applications. We also enhanced our corporate governance profile through amendments to our bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Finally, on the go-to-market front, we closed multiple large deals with major enterprise and government customers. These wins demonstrate the strategic relevance of our platform to our customers\u2019 key transformation initiatives and the success of our focus on landing these larger, more strategic transactions. Overall, for fiscal 2023, we demonstrated consistent execution, solid top line growth, strong renewables performance, sharp improvements in profitability and free cash flow and continued progress on our longer-term strategic priorities. Moving on, gaining sales leverage by our partners has been a priority since I joined as CEO. We said we would focus on deepening our partnerships to provide more impact in how we go to market as well as provide more opportunities within larger accounts. This week, we made a milestone announcement on this front with a global strategic partnership with Cisco. This partnership is about combining the best of breed between our two companies. Cisco will combine the Nutanix cloud platform, along with their UCS compute and cloud management, deeply integrated with their networking and security. It\u2019s a fully integrated solution with joint engineering and interoperability and expanded support that will be sold by Cisco. We are excited about working with Cisco on this partnership and having themselves our leading hybrid multi-cloud software, leveraging their extensive go-to-market reach. Now I\u2019d like to talk about our customer wins this quarter, which demonstrate the success we\u2019ve been having in landing large multimillion-dollar ACV deals. A good example is a significant expansion we won in Q4 with the UK\u2019s Department for Work and Pensions, or DWP, the UK\u2019s biggest public service department. This win demonstrated the value customers are seeing in the broader capabilities of our platform. DWP has already adopted our cloud platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management and Nutanix Unified Storage to run its business critical workloads and was looking for a way to extend its footprint into the public cloud. In Q4, DWP chose NC2 to enable the shift of workloads from the private cloud to the public cloud. In their words, \u201cNutanix NC2 allows DWP to seamlessly extend our on-premise footprint into public cloud, while avoiding the cost traditionally associated with lift and shift migrations. Furthermore, NC2\u2019s cost effectiveness and ease of use enable us to maintain a layer of abstraction for our most critical workloads that avoids both platform and vendor lock-in.\u201d We couldn\u2019t have said this better ourselves and are grateful for the opportunity to partner with DWP on their cloud journey. Another notable win in the quarter was as a service provider partner in the EMEA region that was implementing a nationwide electronic health record or EHR system for a government health ministry. This partner chose Nutanix cloud platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management and our AHV hypervisor to host critical EHR applications across 20 strategically located sites. They also chose Nutanix Unified Storage for managing the data on GPU-based image servers associated with the project. We see this win as a testament to the value our customers see in adopting our full stack offering and the growing contribution we are seeing from our service provider partners. Now, I\u2019d like to talk about AI and what it means to Nutanix now and in the future. Today, we already have customers using our platform to deploy AI, often for inferencing on video or sensor data who are seeing the same agility, performance and TCO benefits from our platform as customers running other workloads. They are deploying us for use cases ranging from faster checkout and retail applications, ensuring compliance with safety protocols at construction sites, to quality assurance and manufacturing applications. However, we see an emerging opportunity in the surging demand for generative AI. To-date, there has been a lot of investment in large language models or LLMs running in the public cloud. However, as AI models become more compact and organizations become concerned with issues such as intellectual property leakage, compliance and privacy, we expect there will be more demand to fine-tune and run models on premises and at the edge. We believe there is an opportunity to provide a turnkey solution for those looking to jumpstart these AI initiatives. That\u2019s why we recently launched GPT-in-a-Box. This is a full stack, software-defined AI-ready platform along with services to help our customers size and configure hardware and software to deploy a curated set of LLMs using the leading open source AI frameworks on our platform. It allows customers to easily deploy AI-ready infrastructure to fine-tune and run generative pre-trained transformers or GPTs, while maintaining control of their data and applications. While it\u2019s still early, we are pleased with the initial interest we have seen to-date in GPT-in-a-Box. Moving on, I\u2019d like to highlight the recent addition of Mark Templeton to our Board of Directors. Mark\u2019s previous tenure as a public company CEO combined with the strong domain knowledge of both cloud and data center infrastructure software makes him an excellent fit for Nutanix. I look forward to working with him closely as we execute on our hybrid multi-cloud vision. Finally, on the back of our strong free cash flow performance in FY \u201823 and in conjunction with our earnings release, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a $350 million share repurchase authorization. We see this repurchase program as a reflection of confidence in the company\u2019s long-term market opportunity and financial outlook and an important milestone in our subscription journey. In closing, we are encouraged with the compelling value proposition of our cloud platform and the strength of our business model enable us to provide an initial outlook for fiscal \u201824 that calls for continued solid top line growth, improving profitability and solid free cash flow growth from a strong fiscal 2023 level. We look forward to providing an update on our strategic priorities and longer term financial outlook at our Investor Day in September. And we remain focused on delighting our customers while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv. I will first provide commentary on our Q4 \u201823 results and fiscal year \u201823 results, followed by our outlook for Q1 \u201824 and fiscal year \u201824. Q4 \u201823 was a good quarter in which we exceeded all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q4, was $279 million, higher than our guidance of $240 million to $250 million. Revenue in Q4 was $494 million, higher than our guidance of $470 million to $480 million. ARR at the end of Q4 was $1.562 billion, a year-over-year growth of 30%. Similar to last quarter, we saw a modest elongation of sales cycles likely due to increased deal inspection. New logo additions were about 500 in Q4. Average contract duration in Q4 was 3 years, flat quarter-over-quarter as expected. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 85.8%, higher than our expectations because of higher revenue than expected, certain non-recurring savings and timing of hiring. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 were $361 million. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 13%, higher than our guidance of 9% to 10%. Non-GAAP net income was $68 million or EPS of $0.24 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 286 million shares. Billings linearity was good and DSOs were 29 days in Q4. Free cash flow in Q4 was $46 million, implying free cash flow margin of 9%, higher than our expectations, largely due to better-than-expected billings and collections. We ended Q4 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.437 billion, up from $1.358 billion in Q3 \u201823. Looking at our full year financial results, we exceeded all guided metrics for fiscal year \u201823 as well. ACV billings in fiscal year \u201823 were $957 million, higher than our guidance of $915 million to $925 million and representing a year-over-year growth of 27%. A reminder that the annual ACV billings is slightly lower than the sum of the ACV billings from the four quarters due to adjustments for deals with duration of less than a year. Revenue in fiscal year \u201823 was $1.863 billion, higher than our guidance of $1.84 billion to $1.85 billion and representing a year-over-year growth of 18%. A reminder that revenue in fiscal year \u201823 benefited from the normalization of orders with future start dates, resulting from our partner supply chain challenges. Largely because of this dynamic, fiscal year \u201823 revenue included the benefit of approximately $23 million in deferred license revenue that would have been recognized in late fiscal year \u201822 instead. We ended fiscal year \u201823 with an ARR of $1.562 billion, as mentioned earlier, a year-over-year growth of 30%. GRR or gross retention rate at the end of fiscal year \u201823 was 90-plus percent, and NRR, or net retention rate was 123%. Our fiscal year new and expansion ACV performance was impacted by some of the macro uncertainty we have previously discussed and performed slightly below our expectations entering the year and below what we believe its longer term potential is. The renewals business continues to perform well and it tends to be at a lower aggregate average contract duration compared to our new and expansion business. Our relative economics and renewals have also continued to improve over time as the renewal team has improved their execution. Average contract duration in fiscal year \u201823 was 3 years, lower than the 3.2 years in fiscal year \u201822 as expected. Non-GAAP gross margin in fiscal year \u201823 was 84.6%. Non-GAAP operating expenses in fiscal year \u201823 were $1.414 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal year \u201823 was 9%, representing our first year of non-GAAP operating profit. Non-GAAP net income was $169 million, or EPS of $0.60 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 282 million shares. Free cash flow in fiscal year \u201823 was $207 million, implying free cash flow margin of 11%, representing a free cash flow margin expansion of 10 percentage points year-over-year. Overall, fiscal year \u201823 was a significant year, marking our first year with a positive non-GAAP operating margin at 9%, significant free cash flow generation of over $200 million while growing ARR at 30% and growing revenue at 18% year-over-year, all in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Moving on to Q1. The outlook for Q1 \u201824 is as follows: ACV billings of $260 million to $270 million, revenue of $495 million to $505 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84%, non-GAAP operating margin of 9% to 11%. The guidance for full year fiscal year \u201824 is as follows: ACV billings of $1.075 billion to $1.095 billion, exceeding the $1 billion threshold and representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint; revenue of $2.085 billion to $2.115 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint of the range; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84%; non-GAAP operating margin of 11% to 12%; and free cash flow of $280 million to $300 million. I will now provide some commentary regarding our fiscal year \u201824 guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of sales cycles. Our fiscal year \u201824 new and expansion ACV performance outlook assumes some impact from these macro dynamics. Second, the guidance assumes that our renewal business will continue to perform well. And while our available to renew or ACR pool continues to grow year-over-year, it is growing at a slower pace in fiscal year \u201824, but is expected to reaccelerate in fiscal year \u201825 based on our current view. Third, the full year guidance assumes that the average contract duration would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year \u201823 as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings. And regarding our bottom line guidance, we will continue to make targeted and prudent investments into our go-to-market and innovation engine to continue to invest in growth, while improving our profitability and free cash flow margin year-over-year. Overall, we remain confident in our view around a large and growing market for our solutions combined with a growing mix of renewals as a significant driver of both billings growth and margin expansion over a multiyear period. We also announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $350 million. We remain focused on investing in our business to support profitable growth and on delivering strong returns for our shareholders. This share repurchase program is consistent with these objectives and a reflection of the confidence we have in our long-term market opportunity and financial outlook. In closing, we are pleased that our fiscal year \u201823 results reflect our continued execution towards our stated objective of sustainable, profitable growth, and we expect to continue that focus. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nPinjalim Bora: Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking questions. Rajiv, I wanted to talk about AI. The GPT-in-a-Box, help us understand, is that largely kind of integrated offering, kind of with a bundled pricing? Or is there any new functionality that you have developed. And it seems like it\u2019s spend across hardware, software and services. How are you kind of thinking of going to market with it?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nRajiv Ramaswami: Pinjalim, can you hear me now?\nPinjalim Bora: Yes. I can hear.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Okay, sorry. Yes. So first of all, in terms of the platform, it\u2019s the same Nutanix cloud platform integrated with standard server platforms with NVIDIA DPUs as part of the solution, okay? And on top of that, what we add is a curated set of MLOps software and LLMs, largely open source models, and we put that all together with the services offering that helps customers deploy this out of the box. Now what do they use it for? So what we see with generative AI is there\u2019s been a lot of focus about training these large LLM models in the public cloud. But when it comes to the actual usage of these, what you\u2019re going to see is companies need to run these AI models where their data is. And in a lot of applications, enterprise applications, sensitive data is stored on-prem or at edge locations where they\u2019re actually gathering the data in the first place. So with GPT-in-a-Box, they can run their AI applications, their applications by fine-tuning these large LLM models that have been changed in the public cloud using what we call foundational models and public data. They can find tune this, make them more compact to run with their own data and use it on-prem. So that\u2019s the offering. Now in terms of go-to-market, we have a small tiger team that\u2019s very focused on working with our customers as we put use cases together. We are also building an ecosystem of ISVs and SI partners that can help us take this to market and expand our scale. So it\u2019s still early days, but I\u2019m excited about where this is going.\nPinjalim Bora: Yes, understood. Thank you. And one for Rukmini. Rukmini, you talked about ATR slowing this year. Maybe help us understand why would that be the case? Is that just because that ACV was a little bit slower this year? Is that kind of adding up to it? And then are you baking in any upside from the VMware opportunity in the guidance?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi, Pinjalim, thank you for the question. So on the first question on ATR. So we expect continued growth in our renewal ACV business in fiscal year \u201824 and our GRR continues to be good at 90% plus. But as you noted and as we said in our prepared remarks, we do expect that the renewal ACV will \u2013 is expected to grow at a slower rate in fiscal \u201824 than in \u201823 due to the shifting of some renewals from \u201824 to \u201823, largely due to co-terming and some natural variation, right, that we see, the timing of renewals as customers choose to renew based on their budget cycles or other factors.  In fiscal year \u201825, we expect renewals to go to reaccelerate based on our current view of our available to renew or ATR. And I think it\u2019s important to emphasize also that we continue to believe that this growing mix of renewals over time as a proportion of our total billings continues to be a driver of both billings growth and margin expansion over a multiyear period. And I think your second question, Pinjalim, was around have we baked in any benefit from VMware spending acquisition by Broadcom, and so we continue to see significant engagement and opportunities related to potential concerns around that transaction. And in Q4, we did see a few of these opportunities close including a 7-figure ACV deal with the 1400 company. So while it\u2019s difficult to predict the timing of these wins as we\u2019ve talked about before, just because of some of the dynamics in the market, we do expect some benefit from these deals influenced by this transaction and have factored that into our guidance.\nPinjalim Bora: Got it. Thank you very much.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Jim Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nJim Fish: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Nice guide. I\u2019d also see the new customers pick up again, understanding there is some seasonality here. But was anything causing that in particular in this environment to see the 500 net new customers, including anything on the competitive front to the last question and I appreciate the details on the net retention rate in the quarter here. But can you walk us through kind of how we should be thinking about net retention into next year, given kind of what\u2019s going on with retention rates? And does this mean with the cash flow guide being close to $300 million of this year that we could be thinking about well north of $300 million for fiscal \u201825 or is that just an Analyst Day item that we should be patient for?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think there are three questions there, Jim. Maybe I\u2019ll take the first two, which is around new logos and the competitive outlook, and then Rukmini can focus on the financial questions. So on the new logos, we continue to focus on these higher quality, higher ASP new logos. Most of them just new logo account. But seasonally, of course, Q4 is a strong quarter for us and vis-\u00e0-vis earlier that you saw the strength and new logos there, relatively speaking. It\u2019s also we\u2019re focusing on larger, more strategic transactions, and we are seeing success on that front, certainly. So that\u2019s the new logo piece. From a competitive perspective, you already talked about the VMware dynamic there. Clearly, we\u2019ve seen the engagement level grow there. Clearly, we\u2019ve seen some deals starting to close. And there is still a lot of variability in terms of how the pendulum is going to swing on this one from customers who might just use us to get at a lower price from VMware to customers who truly see us about bringing a second [indiscernible], reducing their risk with an alternative provider. So we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. The hydro cloud piece is really starting to work in terms of customers using more of us in the public cloud. So that piece of it is working well. Our partnership with the hyperscalers is actually coming through actually also nicely in that regard. So we feel good about our competitive positioning as we get into FY \u201824. Rukmini, you can perhaps address the NRR and other questions?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Yes. Hi, Jim, so on NRR, we were happy with the 1.3% that we reported for fiscal year \u201823. And in terms of fiscal year \u201824, Jim, what I say is I think you should still assume that part or sort of new and expansion business, the majority does come from expansion, like we talked about that before. We\u2019re not giving out a specific number today, Jim, but more color to come on that at our Investor Day. And similarly, on free cash flow, yes, we\u2019re happy to sort of guide to $280 million to $300 million for fiscal year \u201824 and again, more to comment at Investor Day. What I will say, though, is we continue to be focused on all elements of that profitable growth piece, which means that we do intend to continue to evolve our \u2013 grow our margins, free cash flow margins over time, while growing the top line, right? So that continues to be the intent, but I\u2019ll sort of hold on any specific free cash flow outlook beyond \u201824 for our Investor Day.\nJim Fish: Fair enough. Just last one for me, Rajiv, on that Cisco partnership, I mean, how much demand were you getting for this? Just nice to have as Cisco UCS is a much smaller shareholder of that server market relative to some of your other partners and understanding Cisco has one of the best sales motions out there with this. But are there any minimums to think about or how should we expect the impact probably more for fiscal \u201825, but any impact for fiscal \u201824?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So again, let me pass it out there. So Jim, first of all, yes, we have seen customer requests in the past for customers. There are many large customers with UCS deployments. They would like to see this joint solution from us and Cisco. So we\u2019re happy that we\u2019re able to announce that. Also importantly for us, the fact is Cisco has a go-to-market machine that\u2019s much bigger than ours. We today have about 20 \u2013 call it about 25,000 customers roughly but our addressable market in terms of customers are at least 100,000. And so Cisco\u2019s broad market reach could help us get those initial entries. And again, we\u2019re going to work, co-sell with Cisco. Cisco is going to be the front in terms of selling this but we\u2019re going to be helping them along the way. And just I look at this as an expansion opportunity for us with a much larger customer base. Good for the customer in terms of them buying an integrated solution for everything they need in the data center, right? There\u2019s a virtual platform, cloud platform from us, hardware from Cisco, both in terms of servers and storage as well as the networking features and the security aspects of this. So we are excited about this. Now in terms of the numbers, what we expect is we just literally announced it here. And we \u2013 there\u2019s a whole process of training, enabling the fee etcetera. So we are factoring in a small amount in the later half of this year, like more likely in our Q4, but we certainly expect the momentum to build here over time.\nJim Fish: Congrats, guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe just as a first question, understanding kind of the new customer cohort you guys have said is kind of a focus on higher quality and larger customers. Is there any way to quantify, just in terms of what that cohort \u2013 just in terms of kind of initial deal size or anything that kind of makes the point on that metric? And then just on kind of the re-acceleration and kind of general elongation of sales cycles right now, do you think that, that is kind of a the catalyst for that reverting in fiscal \u201825 is purely macro? Do you need to kind of see more multi-cloud spending? Like what is it, just a matter of macro? Or what kind of do you think is the main catalyst for that re-acceleration? Thanks.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Let me take a crack at the first part and Rukmini can add on. So our new ASP for these new logo ASPs are certainly up year-over-year for us given the focus. We haven\u2019t put a number on it, but perhaps one of the things we could do, take that as an action for our Investor Day to come back to you with looking at, for example, how many customers we have with over $1 million, for example of ARR. So we \u2013 it\u2019s a good question, we will come back to you with more color. But in general, yes, new logo ASPs have been going up as a result of our focus. Rukmini, do you want to take the rest?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Sure. Yes. Meta, thanks for the question. So I think you had a couple of things in the \u2013 woven into your question, Meta. So one was, I think, around just sort of sales cycles, right, which as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, continues to \u2013 we continue to see a modest elongation there, and that is really affecting only our sort of new and expansion business, right? And so that\u2019s sort of what we continue to see and some of those macro factors are factored into our \u201824 outlook in the new and expansion portion. Now \u2013 and then you referenced the acceleration that we talked about in \u201824 as it relates to our renewal ACV growth rate. So just again, to reemphasize, the renewals ACV will continue to grow year-over-year for a while as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. What we said was at \u201824, renewal ACV growth is at a slower pace than \u201823 because of the some timing variations between \u201823 and \u201824 due to some co-terming, but also largely due to just some timing as it relates to when customers choose to make their purchases because of their budget cycles and so on. And so we view that as effect in \u201824. But when we look at the available to renewal pool for \u201825, we see that reacceleration in \u201825. So that\u2019s what we were referencing. And I just wanted to make sure I was clear on the new and expansion portion versus the renewals, which I hope that answers your question.\nMeta Marshall: Yes. No, that\u2019s perfect. Thank you.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham. Your line is now open.\nMike Cikos: Thank you. Thanks for getting me on the line here. I did want to come back to the ACV billings for a second. And I know that \u2013 congrats on the outperformance on the guidance. I believe you guys have cited outperformance stemming from specifically renewals when I think about the ACV billings. What drove that outperformance? Can you put some finer parameters around it, whether it would be \u2013 it sounds like macro was relatively stable, but was it just better execution, potentially conservatism for the guide? Like how do we view the different pieces that contributed to the outperformance you guys were able to generate?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi Mike. Thanks for the question. So, there were maybe a couple of components that I will talk to, and I welcome Rajiv to add anything else that you would like. So, the first one is that around renewals, right, what we say when we mean renewals outperformed is that we see some core earnings, as we have talked about before, which is sometimes more difficult to forecast. And we are also seeing continued improving discipline around renewals economics, which is what we transact the renewals as compared to sort of what the original transaction was, right. So, those are the ones that are contributing to improvement in renewals outperformance. And so that was a big driver, I would say, Mike, the outperformance in ACV billings. So, that was really the largest driver of outperformance for Q4 ACV billings.\nMike Cikos: Great. And I guess a two quarter on a follow-up. One, kind of fees-up the ACV billings again. But if I think about the guidance that we have today for Q1 ACV billings, it\u2019s actually down sequentially. And if I look over the most recent 2 years, you have gone up from Q4 to Q1. Can you help us think about why it would be down sequentially, maybe part of it has to do with this co-terming effect or maybe some of those deals that came in, in Q4 from let\u2019s say, the VMware deal that we cited earlier, that can you guys \u2013 that\u2019s the first question, as far as the ACV billing guide being down in Q1 sequentially. The second is gross margins. I know we cited a benefit from non-recurring savings and the timing of hiring. Can you help us unpack what \u2013 or quantify what the non-recurring savings were or what that dollar figure was and then the timing of hiring, I guess we should expect for you guys to hire into that in the out year, or is this \u2013 this is hiring that\u2019s been \u2013 you guys can actually prove more efficient versus what you had initially anticipated?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Okay. Thank you, Mike. Let me take that one-by-one. So, on the Q4 to Q1, our typical seasonality is actually Q1 being lower than Q4, Mike, typically, because Q4 is a seasonally high quarter for us given it\u2019s the year-end, right. And it\u2019s sort of \u2013 sellers are motivated, right, to go and have a good Q4. Last year was a bit of an anomaly, right. Because if you recall in Q4 \u201822, we saw some of this impact from supply chain disruptions that were affecting our partners and therefore, are also impacting us to some degree, right. So, the Q4 \u201822 number was actually probably artificially lower, which led to a sequential increase last year. This is more normal, is how I would characterize that, Mike. And then to your question on gross margin, so we said a few things there. So, one was revenue higher than expected, I think that\u2019s straightforward. And your question was on the other two. So, what we say when we mean timing of hiring is as sort of attrition happens, normal levels of attrition, but sometimes it takes time to backfill and so on, right. So, that can sometimes cross quarter boundaries. And so we saw some of that in Q4. Those people we would expect to be hired and backfill in short order here, right, so really probably in Q1. And the non-recurring savings were not huge amounts, Mike. But just remember that I think Q4 also is a high gross margin here as well because COGS and operating expenses don\u2019t fluctuate as much over the year, but Q2 and Q4 are seasonally higher top line quarters for us, right. So, you will see that those margins tick up higher in Q2 and Q4 and take a little bit lower in Q1 and Q3, which is why if you look at our overall fiscal year \u201824 guide, we are saying gross margin is approximately in that 84% range.\nMike Cikos: Thank you very much. I really appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from George Wang from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Wang: Hey guys. Congrats on the quarter. I just want to ask about any update on the repatriation trends, especially given definitely macro, are you guys seeing sort of increased repatriation to on-prem, which may benefit your tenants?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So, George, I can\u2019t say that we have seen increased repatriation as well. We have certainly seen instances of repatriation. What I would say is interesting is that we have also seen stuff in the other direction, which is people have committed to some of these large public cloud spend commitments. And what they are saying, they are not able to get their applications really to public cloud as quickly as they would like to see and so they are now stuck with saying, I have to spend this much money in the public cloud because I committed to it already. And so we have seen that come to us because now they are looking at this saying, we are available through the marketplace of Azure and AWS. And we have seen people purchasing our software through the Azure and AWS marketplace, which help them retire some of their commitment in public spend. So, yes, I think we see the world being hybrid, some work loads are being repatriated from the public cloud. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s necessarily a wholesale trend, we see that in spots versus a systemic trend yet at this point. But the world is very much hybrid, people are being much more conscious about how much to put in the public cloud in the first place.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Great. Just a quick follow-up, if I can, we simplified portfolio kind of platform approach. Can you talk about kind of the tax rate to Nutanix Cloud Platform, Cloud Manager and the kind of maybe high-level commentary on cross-sell and up-sell?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So, I think two questions there. On the attach rate of the portfolio, for sure, the biggest change that we have seen since we launched our revised portfolio with much higher attach for cloud management along with our cloud infrastructure. In fact, that is the easiest attach sale, really, right. Everybody who built the cloud also wants to operate the cloud. So, naturally attaching cloud operations, cloud management to our infrastructure. That\u2019s the best we have seen. We have also seen, of course, NC2, which is our public cloud extension is a natural extension, natural attach and it\u2019s really \u2013 it ties together with our cloud platform very nicely. So, that\u2019s another attach that is still relatively small for us, but growing every quarter in terms of customers, number of customers and customer accounts. Unified storage is the other element of the portfolio that we see reasonable attach with as well. The one that we have to actually really work with a specialist team to sell is our Nutanix database portfolio because that\u2019s largely sold a level up in the stack to the people who are either managing databases or at developers that requires more specialist skills, and that\u2019s much more of a specialist.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Great. Thanks. Congrats again.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to your fiscal year \u201824 guide. If I just take the midpoint, it seems like OpEx would need to grow by 7% and I understand you honestly, it\u2019s coming, but would the collaboration or the deal with Cisco actually help? Is some of these OpEx growth assumptions built into the model, or does that order be bake into account, or do that account for any cost savings as Cisco scales your product\u2026?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi Mehdi. Thank you for that question. So, let me first address the OpEx point, then we will talk about any potential impact from Cisco. So, if you look at our operating expense profile over the last several years, since about 3 years ago, it was about $1.5 billion and last year it was $1.4 billion, right. It was actually, we have kind of really kept it sort of flat to down over the last 3 years, while of course continuing to grow ACV billings, the ARR revenue and so on since over that time. So, we have been really sort of cautious about OpEx and then focusing on improved efficiency and productivity. Where we are now is that we are making some very prudent, I would say and targeted investments in our go-to-market and in our innovation engine. As we talked about, our market, we believe is large and growing in order to go and capitalize on that. So, we are making some targeted investments on that front. Now, on the Cisco piece, I think what we expect the Cisco partnership for us to do is to continue to help sort of our productivity go up and really be additive to our overall top line, right. So, that\u2019s how we should think about operating expenses relative to last year, but also relative to any potential impact on Cisco.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. And one follow-up for Rajiv, I just want to go back to your prepared remarks. And I am just trying to better understand, I kind of agree with you that security, privacy, compliance would actually bode well for enterprises to scale AI. But as you think about the train models moving from a cloud infrastructure into on-prem, would that actually require your existing or prospective customer with additional one-time CapEx investment or no?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So, that depends on what they have \u2013 I mean obviously, this AI requires compute resources, right. It requires several platforms with GPUs attached to it. So clearly, these are new workloads for the customer, they are going to have to buy new hardware, right, so \u2013 and put our software on it. What they would do, just to clarify what they would do, the models likely are combinational models that are trained on publicly available data in the public cloud. But then when they bring it on-prem, they are going to fine tune this, and potentially make it more compact with their own specific data. A good example just to see how this works, maybe it\u2019s \u2013 take support as an example, even after the support, in terms of support, we have a lot of internal documentation that we don\u2019t put in the public cloud, internal design documents as well. So, imagine using a generative AI back end to be able to go through all of that and quickly try and arrive at root cause or try and arrive at answers to customer support questions. So, we want to run that on-prem or in a secure location where our data is stored. And so we will typically run that on, again, standard servers with GPU accelerators, running DJI models with our stack.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you. Is that where Cisco could come in and actually become a partner to facilitate that additional investment required?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I think the Cisco piece, by the way, just let me \u2013 I think we should decouple that, right, because this AI piece works with everybody servers. So, customers can buy servers from Dell or HP or Lenovo or any of server partners and we have a wide variety of them, and we have been supporting GPUs for multiple years. So, we don\u2019t necessarily need this to be only Cisco. So, they can buy that from whoever they like their server partners. What we expect with Cisco is a significant expansion in terms of our go-to-market reach, right, with their go-to-market, their ability to sell into a much broader customer base and their footprint, we should be able to benefit from that in the long-term.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\nErik Suppiger: Yes. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter. First off, on the GPT-in-a-Box, are those customers developing their own large language model or are they using third-party software on that box? And then secondly, in the \u2013 go ahead.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Erik, I think the answer that most of them would not build their own large language models. They would use foundation models that are available. For example, there is new ones coming out like Lama 2 [ph] that are open source. They could, of course, use GPT if they like as well. But there are much of the models. Most customers in the enterprise, I don\u2019t think will develop their own models, but use what\u2019s available out there. They would probably fine tune it with the data that they have.\nErik Suppiger: Okay. That makes sense. And then secondly, in the partnership with Cisco, are the Cisco sales getting comped on selling the Nutanix software?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, they are getting compensated just as if they were selling Cisco products, so 100% compensation for their service.\nErik Suppiger: Very good. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. It\u2019s Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. I had one question for Rajiv and one for Rukmini. Rajiv, can you comment on a couple of things to specifically demand by vertical. You talked about some share gains this quarter. How is the pricing environment? Is that holding steady, or are you seeing any pricing pressure? And then can you talk about your view on the backlog heading into fiscal \u201824, has that normalized now, or is it still elevated?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So, on the pricing, we haven\u2019t seen any significant change in pricing this quarter compared to our last quarter. And in general, as we, for example, attach more of our products with our portfolio towards these, ASPs tend to go up, right, because we are simply attaching more of the portfolio. So, we haven\u2019t seen any shift or big change in our pricing dynamics. Now, on the backlog and with respect to verticals, again, I can\u2019t say that there is any significant difference. I think it\u2019s more a function of volume and deal size that dictates discounts and rather than any particular vertical related factors for us. Now, with respect to the backlog, I am going to let Rukmini comment on that.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Thank you, Rajiv and hi Ruplu. So, on backlog, as we talked about I think last year for fiscal year \u201823, backlog, it did move around as expected during the course of fiscal year \u201823. Despite that, we ended \u201823 actually with a slight increase and that should impact backlog dollars year-over-year. And we are factoring that into the outlook for fiscal year \u201824. So, we expect some backlog to be consumed over the course of this year. But as is to be expected in an uncertain macro environment like the one we are in, I think the range of possible outcomes are just wider than before. And more generally, as we continue to grow, the absolute dollar number of backlog could also continue to increase over time.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for the details there. If I can ask you, looking at the guidance for fiscal 1Q versus the full year fiscal \u201824, it looks like there is operating margin improvement as you go through the year. So, what are the drivers for that? And then if you can talk about the seasonality you expect in ACV billings. Again, looking to \u2013 should we think that going from 2Q to 3Q, should we expect the same level of decline, your renewables business is growing. So, just any thoughts on how should we model ACV billings in fiscal \u201824? Thank you.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Okay. So, there were a couple of questions there. I think the first one was on Q1 operating margin versus full year and so I think I will just remind folks that, again, Q2 and Q4 are seasonally in general, seasonally a stronger quarter for us. Q2 because you have December in there, which is annual budget flush for many customers. And so Q2 is stronger for that reason and Q4 is our fiscal year-end. And so Q2 and Q4 seasonally strong quarters, which means that margins, although operating expenses and cost of goods sold don\u2019t vary as much, the top line does look stronger in Q2 and Q4, and therefore, margins in general also tend to look stronger in Q2 and Q4 compared to Q1 and Q3, right. So, that\u2019s sort of one call out on the margin piece on the full year versus 1Q. And then on seasonality, I think was your second question, Ruplu. More generally, I would just say, I think as I have said, you should expect some seasonality in top line for a slight decline between 2Q to 3Q and that follows sort of a new and expansion. Therefore, generally, renewals ATR also does follow that pattern as well. And to the extent we expect any variation in that, we will make sure to call that out. But as of now, you should still expect somewhat fairly normal patterns we can talk to that.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for the details.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you and congrats on a strong quarter, you had another one. That\u2019s fantastic. And nice to see the buyback being announced, could you talk about what is the priority of allocating capital to buyback growth to, say, paying down debt?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, sure. So, I will just talk more generally and our focus continues to be on sustainable profitable growth, as we have said and we continue to make prudent and thoughtful investments into our go-to-market innovation engine, as I have said earlier, in response to another question. We are happy to have generated over $200 million of cash \u2013 of cash flow last year and have $1.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. And so we think of this share repurchase authorization as a reflection of the confidence in our long-term financial outlook by returning capital to shareholders while ensuring that we have optionality to continue to invest in growth and to our other strategic priorities. And to your question on paying down debt and how we do take a look at that, of course we look at all of the alternative uses of our cash before making any decision. And our public convert, we pay 25 basis points on those, and they are not due for another few years. And so it made sense for us to think about that more holistically and sort of we believe that doing the share repurchase authorization is sort of the best use of our cash, given all of the other options available to us.\nNehal Chokshi: So, what\u2019s your anticipation of the pace of utilization of that buyback authorization then?\nRukmini Sivaraman: We have not given a specific timeframe, Nehal, and authorization does not have an expiration date. And so the timing and amounts will depend on a variety of factors, as you can imagine, right, including just business conditions, stock prices and other factors and so I will leave that there.\nNehal Chokshi: Would it be fair to say that you want to return a certain percentage of free cash flow on a go-forward basis?\nRukmini Sivaraman: We are not giving out sort of a certain percentage at this point, Nehal. But we will just talk more generally about capital allocation and how we plan to use our cash at our Investor Day as well, right. So, I would be happy to sort of take more \u2013 we talk more about that then. But at this point, we are not committing to a specific percentage.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. Great. Thank you and congrats.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich and good afternoon everyone. We delivered a good fourth quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance, capping off a strong fiscal 2023. The uncertain macro backdrop that we saw in our fourth quarter was largely unchanged compared with the prior quarter and we continue to see steady demand for our solutions in Q4. This was driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership. Taking a closer look at the fourth quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all of our guided metrics. We delivered strong ACV billings growth and record quarterly revenue of $494 million, a nearly $2 billion annualized run-rate. We also had another quarter of good free cash flow generation despite some expected one-time payments. Overall, our fourth quarter financial performance was a strong finish to our fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2023 results demonstrate the progress we've made with our subscription model. Specifically, we delivered healthy year-over-year ACV billings growth of 27%, led by outperformance of our renewals business. We also delivered our first year of non-GAAP profitability in the company's history with a non-GAAP operating margin of 9%. Finally, despite the impact of several one-time payments, we generated free cash flow in excess of $200 million, a roughly tenfold increase compared to our prior fiscal year. Beyond the financials, we made significant progress across all aspects of our business in fiscal 2023. On the product front, we delivered general availability of NC2 on Microsoft Azure, announced meaningful new products in areas such as Kubernetes, data services and cloud management and defined our data services vision with Project Beacon to enable companies to build portable applications. We also enhanced our corporate governance profile through amendments to our bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Finally, on the go-to-market front, we closed multiple large deals with major enterprise and government customers. These wins demonstrate the strategic relevance of our platform to our customers' key transformation initiatives and the success of our focus on landing these larger, more strategic transactions. Overall, for fiscal 2023, we demonstrated consistent execution, solid top line growth, strong renewables performance, sharp improvements in profitability and free cash flow and continued progress on our longer-term strategic priorities. Moving on, gaining sales leverage by our partners has been a priority since I joined as CEO. We said we would focus on deepening our partnerships to provide more impact in how we go to market as well as provide more opportunities within larger accounts. This week, we made a milestone announcement on this front with a global strategic partnership with Cisco. This partnership is about combining the best of breed between our two companies. Cisco will combine the Nutanix cloud platform, along with their UCS compute and cloud management, deeply integrated with their networking and security. It's a fully integrated solution with joint engineering and interoperability and expanded support that will be sold by Cisco. We are excited about working with Cisco on this partnership and having themselves our leading hybrid multi-cloud software, leveraging their extensive go-to-market reach. Now I'd like to talk about our customer wins this quarter, which demonstrate the success we've been having in landing large multimillion-dollar ACV deals. A good example is a significant expansion we won in Q4 with the UK's Department for Work and Pensions, or DWP, the UK's biggest public service department. This win demonstrated the value customers are seeing in the broader capabilities of our platform. DWP has already adopted our cloud platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management and Nutanix Unified Storage to run its business critical workloads and was looking for a way to extend its footprint into the public cloud. In Q4, DWP chose NC2 to enable the shift of workloads from the private cloud to the public cloud. In their words, \u201cNutanix NC2 allows DWP to seamlessly extend our on-premise footprint into public cloud, while avoiding the cost traditionally associated with lift and shift migrations. Furthermore, NC2's cost effectiveness and ease of use enable us to maintain a layer of abstraction for our most critical workloads that avoids both platform and vendor lock-in.\u201d We couldn't have said this better ourselves and are grateful for the opportunity to partner with DWP on their cloud journey. Another notable win in the quarter was as a service provider partner in the EMEA region that was implementing a nationwide electronic health record or EHR system for a government health ministry. This partner chose Nutanix cloud platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management and our AHV hypervisor to host critical EHR applications across 20 strategically located sites. They also chose Nutanix Unified Storage for managing the data on GPU-based image servers associated with the project. We see this win as a testament to the value our customers see in adopting our full stack offering and the growing contribution we are seeing from our service provider partners. Now, I'd like to talk about AI and what it means to Nutanix now and in the future. Today, we already have customers using our platform to deploy AI, often for inferencing on video or sensor data who are seeing the same agility, performance and TCO benefits from our platform as customers running other workloads. They are deploying us for use cases ranging from faster checkout and retail applications, ensuring compliance with safety protocols at construction sites, to quality assurance and manufacturing applications. However, we see an emerging opportunity in the surging demand for generative AI. To-date, there has been a lot of investment in large language models or LLMs running in the public cloud. However, as AI models become more compact and organizations become concerned with issues such as intellectual property leakage, compliance and privacy, we expect there will be more demand to fine-tune and run models on premises and at the edge. We believe there is an opportunity to provide a turnkey solution for those looking to jumpstart these AI initiatives. That's why we recently launched GPT-in-a-Box. This is a full stack, software-defined AI-ready platform along with services to help our customers size and configure hardware and software to deploy a curated set of LLMs using the leading open source AI frameworks on our platform. It allows customers to easily deploy AI-ready infrastructure to fine-tune and run generative pre-trained transformers or GPTs, while maintaining control of their data and applications. While it's still early, we are pleased with the initial interest we have seen to-date in GPT-in-a-Box. Moving on, I'd like to highlight the recent addition of Mark Templeton to our Board of Directors. Mark's previous tenure as a public company CEO combined with the strong domain knowledge of both cloud and data center infrastructure software makes him an excellent fit for Nutanix. I look forward to working with him closely as we execute on our hybrid multi-cloud vision. Finally, on the back of our strong free cash flow performance in FY \u201823 and in conjunction with our earnings release, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a $350 million share repurchase authorization. We see this repurchase program as a reflection of confidence in the company's long-term market opportunity and financial outlook and an important milestone in our subscription journey. In closing, we are encouraged with the compelling value proposition of our cloud platform and the strength of our business model enable us to provide an initial outlook for fiscal \u201824 that calls for continued solid top line growth, improving profitability and solid free cash flow growth from a strong fiscal 2023 level. We look forward to providing an update on our strategic priorities and longer term financial outlook at our Investor Day in September. And we remain focused on delighting our customers while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini? Pinjalim, can you hear me now? Okay, sorry. Yes. So first of all, in terms of the platform, it's the same Nutanix cloud platform integrated with standard server platforms with NVIDIA DPUs as part of the solution, okay? And on top of that, what we add is a curated set of MLOps software and LLMs, largely open source models, and we put that all together with the services offering that helps customers deploy this out of the box. Now what do they use it for? So what we see with generative AI is there's been a lot of focus about training these large LLM models in the public cloud. But when it comes to the actual usage of these, what you're going to see is companies need to run these AI models where their data is. And in a lot of applications, enterprise applications, sensitive data is stored on-prem or at edge locations where they're actually gathering the data in the first place. So with GPT-in-a-Box, they can run their AI applications, their applications by fine-tuning these large LLM models that have been changed in the public cloud using what we call foundational models and public data. They can find tune this, make them more compact to run with their own data and use it on-prem. So that's the offering. Now in terms of go-to-market, we have a small tiger team that's very focused on working with our customers as we put use cases together. We are also building an ecosystem of ISVs and SI partners that can help us take this to market and expand our scale. So it's still early days, but I'm excited about where this is going. Yes. I think there are three questions there, Jim. Maybe I'll take the first two, which is around new logos and the competitive outlook, and then Rukmini can focus on the financial questions. So on the new logos, we continue to focus on these higher quality, higher ASP new logos. Most of them just new logo account. But seasonally, of course, Q4 is a strong quarter for us and vis-a\u0300-vis earlier that you saw the strength and new logos there, relatively speaking. It's also we're focusing on larger, more strategic transactions, and we are seeing success on that front, certainly. So that's the new logo piece. From a competitive perspective, you already talked about the VMware dynamic there. Clearly, we've seen the engagement level grow there. Clearly, we've seen some deals starting to close. And there is still a lot of variability in terms of how the pendulum is going to swing on this one from customers who might just use us to get at a lower price from VMware to customers who truly see us about bringing a second [indiscernible], reducing their risk with an alternative provider. So we'll have to see how that plays out. The hydro cloud piece is really starting to work in terms of customers using more of us in the public cloud. So that piece of it is working well. Our partnership with the hyperscalers is actually coming through actually also nicely in that regard. So we feel good about our competitive positioning as we get into FY \u201824. Rukmini, you can perhaps address the NRR and other questions? Yes. So again, let me pass it out there. So Jim, first of all, yes, we have seen customer requests in the past for customers. There are many large customers with UCS deployments. They would like to see this joint solution from us and Cisco. So we're happy that we're able to announce that. Also importantly for us, the fact is Cisco has a go-to-market machine that's much bigger than ours. We today have about 20 \u2013 call it about 25,000 customers roughly but our addressable market in terms of customers are at least 100,000. And so Cisco's broad market reach could help us get those initial entries. And again, we're going to work, co-sell with Cisco. Cisco is going to be the front in terms of selling this but we're going to be helping them along the way. And just I look at this as an expansion opportunity for us with a much larger customer base. Good for the customer in terms of them buying an integrated solution for everything they need in the data center, right? There's a virtual platform, cloud platform from us, hardware from Cisco, both in terms of servers and storage as well as the networking features and the security aspects of this. So we are excited about this. Now in terms of the numbers, what we expect is we just literally announced it here. And we \u2013 there's a whole process of training, enabling the fee etcetera. So we are factoring in a small amount in the later half of this year, like more likely in our Q4, but we certainly expect the momentum to build here over time. Let me take a crack at the first part and Rukmini can add on. So our new ASP for these new logo ASPs are certainly up year-over-year for us given the focus. We haven't put a number on it, but perhaps one of the things we could do, take that as an action for our Investor Day to come back to you with looking at, for example, how many customers we have with over $1 million, for example of ARR. So we \u2013 it's a good question, we will come back to you with more color. But in general, yes, new logo ASPs have been going up as a result of our focus. Rukmini, do you want to take the rest? Yes. So, George, I can't say that we have seen increased repatriation as well. We have certainly seen instances of repatriation. What I would say is interesting is that we have also seen stuff in the other direction, which is people have committed to some of these large public cloud spend commitments. And what they are saying, they are not able to get their applications really to public cloud as quickly as they would like to see and so they are now stuck with saying, I have to spend this much money in the public cloud because I committed to it already. And so we have seen that come to us because now they are looking at this saying, we are available through the marketplace of Azure and AWS. And we have seen people purchasing our software through the Azure and AWS marketplace, which help them retire some of their commitment in public spend. So, yes, I think we see the world being hybrid, some work loads are being repatriated from the public cloud. I wouldn't say it's necessarily a wholesale trend, we see that in spots versus a systemic trend yet at this point. But the world is very much hybrid, people are being much more conscious about how much to put in the public cloud in the first place. Yes. So, I think two questions there. On the attach rate of the portfolio, for sure, the biggest change that we have seen since we launched our revised portfolio with much higher attach for cloud management along with our cloud infrastructure. In fact, that is the easiest attach sale, really, right. Everybody who built the cloud also wants to operate the cloud. So, naturally attaching cloud operations, cloud management to our infrastructure. That's the best we have seen. We have also seen, of course, NC2, which is our public cloud extension is a natural extension, natural attach and it's really \u2013 it ties together with our cloud platform very nicely. So, that's another attach that is still relatively small for us, but growing every quarter in terms of customers, number of customers and customer accounts. Unified storage is the other element of the portfolio that we see reasonable attach with as well. The one that we have to actually really work with a specialist team to sell is our Nutanix database portfolio because that's largely sold a level up in the stack to the people who are either managing databases or at developers that requires more specialist skills, and that's much more of a specialist. Thank you. Yes. So, that depends on what they have \u2013 I mean obviously, this AI requires compute resources, right. It requires several platforms with GPUs attached to it. So clearly, these are new workloads for the customer, they are going to have to buy new hardware, right, so \u2013 and put our software on it. What they would do, just to clarify what they would do, the models likely are combinational models that are trained on publicly available data in the public cloud. But then when they bring it on-prem, they are going to fine tune this, and potentially make it more compact with their own specific data. A good example just to see how this works, maybe it's \u2013 take support as an example, even after the support, in terms of support, we have a lot of internal documentation that we don't put in the public cloud, internal design documents as well. So, imagine using a generative AI back end to be able to go through all of that and quickly try and arrive at root cause or try and arrive at answers to customer support questions. So, we want to run that on-prem or in a secure location where our data is stored. And so we will typically run that on, again, standard servers with GPU accelerators, running DJI models with our stack. I think the Cisco piece, by the way, just let me \u2013 I think we should decouple that, right, because this AI piece works with everybody servers. So, customers can buy servers from Dell or HP or Lenovo or any of server partners and we have a wide variety of them, and we have been supporting GPUs for multiple years. So, we don't necessarily need this to be only Cisco. So, they can buy that from whoever they like their server partners. What we expect with Cisco is a significant expansion in terms of our go-to-market reach, right, with their go-to-market, their ability to sell into a much broader customer base and their footprint, we should be able to benefit from that in the long-term. Yes, Erik, I think the answer that most of them would not build their own large language models. They would use foundation models that are available. For example, there is new ones coming out like Lama 2 [ph] that are open source. They could, of course, use GPT if they like as well. But there are much of the models. Most customers in the enterprise, I don't think will develop their own models, but use what's available out there. They would probably fine tune it with the data that they have. Yes, they are getting compensated just as if they were selling Cisco products, so 100% compensation for their service. Yes. So, on the pricing, we haven't seen any significant change in pricing this quarter compared to our last quarter. And in general, as we, for example, attach more of our products with our portfolio towards these, ASPs tend to go up, right, because we are simply attaching more of the portfolio. So, we haven't seen any shift or big change in our pricing dynamics. Now, on the backlog and with respect to verticals, again, I can't say that there is any significant difference. I think it's more a function of volume and deal size that dictates discounts and rather than any particular vertical related factors for us. Now, with respect to the backlog, I am going to let Rukmini comment on that."

            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. I will first provide commentary on our Q4 \u201823 results and fiscal year \u201823 results, followed by our outlook for Q1 \u201824 and fiscal year \u201824. Q4 \u201823 was a good quarter in which we exceeded all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q4, was $279 million, higher than our guidance of $240 million to $250 million. Revenue in Q4 was $494 million, higher than our guidance of $470 million to $480 million. ARR at the end of Q4 was $1.562 billion, a year-over-year growth of 30%. Similar to last quarter, we saw a modest elongation of sales cycles likely due to increased deal inspection. New logo additions were about 500 in Q4. Average contract duration in Q4 was 3 years, flat quarter-over-quarter as expected. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 85.8%, higher than our expectations because of higher revenue than expected, certain non-recurring savings and timing of hiring. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 were $361 million. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 13%, higher than our guidance of 9% to 10%. Non-GAAP net income was $68 million or EPS of $0.24 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 286 million shares. Billings linearity was good and DSOs were 29 days in Q4. Free cash flow in Q4 was $46 million, implying free cash flow margin of 9%, higher than our expectations, largely due to better-than-expected billings and collections. We ended Q4 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.437 billion, up from $1.358 billion in Q3 \u201823. Looking at our full year financial results, we exceeded all guided metrics for fiscal year \u201823 as well. ACV billings in fiscal year \u201823 were $957 million, higher than our guidance of $915 million to $925 million and representing a year-over-year growth of 27%. A reminder that the annual ACV billings is slightly lower than the sum of the ACV billings from the four quarters due to adjustments for deals with duration of less than a year. Revenue in fiscal year \u201823 was $1.863 billion, higher than our guidance of $1.84 billion to $1.85 billion and representing a year-over-year growth of 18%. A reminder that revenue in fiscal year \u201823 benefited from the normalization of orders with future start dates, resulting from our partner supply chain challenges. Largely because of this dynamic, fiscal year \u201823 revenue included the benefit of approximately $23 million in deferred license revenue that would have been recognized in late fiscal year \u201822 instead. We ended fiscal year \u201823 with an ARR of $1.562 billion, as mentioned earlier, a year-over-year growth of 30%. GRR or gross retention rate at the end of fiscal year \u201823 was 90-plus percent, and NRR, or net retention rate was 123%. Our fiscal year new and expansion ACV performance was impacted by some of the macro uncertainty we have previously discussed and performed slightly below our expectations entering the year and below what we believe its longer term potential is. The renewals business continues to perform well and it tends to be at a lower aggregate average contract duration compared to our new and expansion business. Our relative economics and renewals have also continued to improve over time as the renewal team has improved their execution. Average contract duration in fiscal year \u201823 was 3 years, lower than the 3.2 years in fiscal year \u201822 as expected. Non-GAAP gross margin in fiscal year \u201823 was 84.6%. Non-GAAP operating expenses in fiscal year \u201823 were $1.414 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal year \u201823 was 9%, representing our first year of non-GAAP operating profit. Non-GAAP net income was $169 million, or EPS of $0.60 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 282 million shares. Free cash flow in fiscal year \u201823 was $207 million, implying free cash flow margin of 11%, representing a free cash flow margin expansion of 10 percentage points year-over-year. Overall, fiscal year \u201823 was a significant year, marking our first year with a positive non-GAAP operating margin at 9%, significant free cash flow generation of over $200 million while growing ARR at 30% and growing revenue at 18% year-over-year, all in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Moving on to Q1. The outlook for Q1 \u201824 is as follows: ACV billings of $260 million to $270 million, revenue of $495 million to $505 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84%, non-GAAP operating margin of 9% to 11%. The guidance for full year fiscal year \u201824 is as follows: ACV billings of $1.075 billion to $1.095 billion, exceeding the $1 billion threshold and representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint; revenue of $2.085 billion to $2.115 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint of the range; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84%; non-GAAP operating margin of 11% to 12%; and free cash flow of $280 million to $300 million. I will now provide some commentary regarding our fiscal year \u201824 guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of sales cycles. Our fiscal year \u201824 new and expansion ACV performance outlook assumes some impact from these macro dynamics. Second, the guidance assumes that our renewal business will continue to perform well. And while our available to renew or ACR pool continues to grow year-over-year, it is growing at a slower pace in fiscal year \u201824, but is expected to reaccelerate in fiscal year \u201825 based on our current view. Third, the full year guidance assumes that the average contract duration would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year \u201823 as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings. And regarding our bottom line guidance, we will continue to make targeted and prudent investments into our go-to-market and innovation engine to continue to invest in growth, while improving our profitability and free cash flow margin year-over-year. Overall, we remain confident in our view around a large and growing market for our solutions combined with a growing mix of renewals as a significant driver of both billings growth and margin expansion over a multiyear period. We also announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $350 million. We remain focused on investing in our business to support profitable growth and on delivering strong returns for our shareholders. This share repurchase program is consistent with these objectives and a reflection of the confidence we have in our long-term market opportunity and financial outlook. In closing, we are pleased that our fiscal year \u201823 results reflect our continued execution towards our stated objective of sustainable, profitable growth, and we expect to continue that focus. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Hi, Pinjalim, thank you for the question. So on the first question on ATR. So we expect continued growth in our renewal ACV business in fiscal year \u201824 and our GRR continues to be good at 90% plus. But as you noted and as we said in our prepared remarks, we do expect that the renewal ACV will \u2013 is expected to grow at a slower rate in fiscal \u201824 than in \u201823 due to the shifting of some renewals from \u201824 to \u201823, largely due to co-terming and some natural variation, right, that we see, the timing of renewals as customers choose to renew based on their budget cycles or other factors.  In fiscal year \u201825, we expect renewals to go to reaccelerate based on our current view of our available to renew or ATR. And I think it's important to emphasize also that we continue to believe that this growing mix of renewals over time as a proportion of our total billings continues to be a driver of both billings growth and margin expansion over a multiyear period. And I think your second question, Pinjalim, was around have we baked in any benefit from VMware spending acquisition by Broadcom, and so we continue to see significant engagement and opportunities related to potential concerns around that transaction. And in Q4, we did see a few of these opportunities close including a 7-figure ACV deal with the 1400 company. So while it's difficult to predict the timing of these wins as we've talked about before, just because of some of the dynamics in the market, we do expect some benefit from these deals influenced by this transaction and have factored that into our guidance. Thank you. Yes. Yes. Hi, Jim, so on NRR, we were happy with the 1.3% that we reported for fiscal year \u201823. And in terms of fiscal year \u201824, Jim, what I say is I think you should still assume that part or sort of new and expansion business, the majority does come from expansion, like we talked about that before. We're not giving out a specific number today, Jim, but more color to come on that at our Investor Day. And similarly, on free cash flow, yes, we're happy to sort of guide to $280 million to $300 million for fiscal year \u201824 and again, more to comment at Investor Day. What I will say, though, is we continue to be focused on all elements of that profitable growth piece, which means that we do intend to continue to evolve our \u2013 grow our margins, free cash flow margins over time, while growing the top line, right? So that continues to be the intent, but I'll sort of hold on any specific free cash flow outlook beyond \u201824 for our Investor Day. Sure. Yes. Meta, thanks for the question. So I think you had a couple of things in the \u2013 woven into your question, Meta. So one was, I think, around just sort of sales cycles, right, which as we've talked about in the past, continues to \u2013 we continue to see a modest elongation there, and that is really affecting only our sort of new and expansion business, right? And so that's sort of what we continue to see and some of those macro factors are factored into our \u201824 outlook in the new and expansion portion. Now \u2013 and then you referenced the acceleration that we talked about in \u201824 as it relates to our renewal ACV growth rate. So just again, to reemphasize, the renewals ACV will continue to grow year-over-year for a while as we've talked about in the past. What we said was at \u201824, renewal ACV growth is at a slower pace than \u201823 because of the some timing variations between \u201823 and \u201824 due to some co-terming, but also largely due to just some timing as it relates to when customers choose to make their purchases because of their budget cycles and so on. And so we view that as effect in \u201824. But when we look at the available to renewal pool for \u201825, we see that reacceleration in \u201825. So that's what we were referencing. And I just wanted to make sure I was clear on the new and expansion portion versus the renewals, which I hope that answers your question. Thank you. Hi Mike. Thanks for the question. So, there were maybe a couple of components that I will talk to, and I welcome Rajiv to add anything else that you would like. So, the first one is that around renewals, right, what we say when we mean renewals outperformed is that we see some core earnings, as we have talked about before, which is sometimes more difficult to forecast. And we are also seeing continued improving discipline around renewals economics, which is what we transact the renewals as compared to sort of what the original transaction was, right. So, those are the ones that are contributing to improvement in renewals outperformance. And so that was a big driver, I would say, Mike, the outperformance in ACV billings. So, that was really the largest driver of outperformance for Q4 ACV billings. Okay. Thank you, Mike. Let me take that one-by-one. So, on the Q4 to Q1, our typical seasonality is actually Q1 being lower than Q4, Mike, typically, because Q4 is a seasonally high quarter for us given it's the year-end, right. And it's sort of \u2013 sellers are motivated, right, to go and have a good Q4. Last year was a bit of an anomaly, right. Because if you recall in Q4 \u201822, we saw some of this impact from supply chain disruptions that were affecting our partners and therefore, are also impacting us to some degree, right. So, the Q4 \u201822 number was actually probably artificially lower, which led to a sequential increase last year. This is more normal, is how I would characterize that, Mike. And then to your question on gross margin, so we said a few things there. So, one was revenue higher than expected, I think that's straightforward. And your question was on the other two. So, what we say when we mean timing of hiring is as sort of attrition happens, normal levels of attrition, but sometimes it takes time to backfill and so on, right. So, that can sometimes cross quarter boundaries. And so we saw some of that in Q4. Those people we would expect to be hired and backfill in short order here, right, so really probably in Q1. And the non-recurring savings were not huge amounts, Mike. But just remember that I think Q4 also is a high gross margin here as well because COGS and operating expenses don't fluctuate as much over the year, but Q2 and Q4 are seasonally higher top line quarters for us, right. So, you will see that those margins tick up higher in Q2 and Q4 and take a little bit lower in Q1 and Q3, which is why if you look at our overall fiscal year \u201824 guide, we are saying gross margin is approximately in that 84% range. Thank you, Mike. Hi Mehdi. Thank you for that question. So, let me first address the OpEx point, then we will talk about any potential impact from Cisco. So, if you look at our operating expense profile over the last several years, since about 3 years ago, it was about $1.5 billion and last year it was $1.4 billion, right. It was actually, we have kind of really kept it sort of flat to down over the last 3 years, while of course continuing to grow ACV billings, the ARR revenue and so on since over that time. So, we have been really sort of cautious about OpEx and then focusing on improved efficiency and productivity. Where we are now is that we are making some very prudent, I would say and targeted investments in our go-to-market and in our innovation engine. As we talked about, our market, we believe is large and growing in order to go and capitalize on that. So, we are making some targeted investments on that front. Now, on the Cisco piece, I think what we expect the Cisco partnership for us to do is to continue to help sort of our productivity go up and really be additive to our overall top line, right. So, that's how we should think about operating expenses relative to last year, but also relative to any potential impact on Cisco. Yes. Thank you, Rajiv and hi Ruplu. So, on backlog, as we talked about I think last year for fiscal year \u201823, backlog, it did move around as expected during the course of fiscal year \u201823. Despite that, we ended \u201823 actually with a slight increase and that should impact backlog dollars year-over-year. And we are factoring that into the outlook for fiscal year \u201824. So, we expect some backlog to be consumed over the course of this year. But as is to be expected in an uncertain macro environment like the one we are in, I think the range of possible outcomes are just wider than before. And more generally, as we continue to grow, the absolute dollar number of backlog could also continue to increase over time. Okay. So, there were a couple of questions there. I think the first one was on Q1 operating margin versus full year and so I think I will just remind folks that, again, Q2 and Q4 are seasonally in general, seasonally a stronger quarter for us. Q2 because you have December in there, which is annual budget flush for many customers. And so Q2 is stronger for that reason and Q4 is our fiscal year-end. And so Q2 and Q4 seasonally strong quarters, which means that margins, although operating expenses and cost of goods sold don't vary as much, the top line does look stronger in Q2 and Q4, and therefore, margins in general also tend to look stronger in Q2 and Q4 compared to Q1 and Q3, right. So, that's sort of one call out on the margin piece on the full year versus 1Q. And then on seasonality, I think was your second question, Ruplu. More generally, I would just say, I think as I have said, you should expect some seasonality in top line for a slight decline between 2Q to 3Q and that follows sort of a new and expansion. Therefore, generally, renewals ATR also does follow that pattern as well. And to the extent we expect any variation in that, we will make sure to call that out. But as of now, you should still expect somewhat fairly normal patterns we can talk to that. Thank you. Yes, sure. So, I will just talk more generally and our focus continues to be on sustainable profitable growth, as we have said and we continue to make prudent and thoughtful investments into our go-to-market innovation engine, as I have said earlier, in response to another question. We are happy to have generated over $200 million of cash \u2013 of cash flow last year and have $1.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. And so we think of this share repurchase authorization as a reflection of the confidence in our long-term financial outlook by returning capital to shareholders while ensuring that we have optionality to continue to invest in growth and to our other strategic priorities. And to your question on paying down debt and how we do take a look at that, of course we look at all of the alternative uses of our cash before making any decision. And our public convert, we pay 25 basis points on those, and they are not due for another few years. And so it made sense for us to think about that more holistically and sort of we believe that doing the share repurchase authorization is sort of the best use of our cash, given all of the other options available to us. We have not given a specific timeframe, Nehal, and authorization does not have an expiration date. And so the timing and amounts will depend on a variety of factors, as you can imagine, right, including just business conditions, stock prices and other factors and so I will leave that there. We are not giving out sort of a certain percentage at this point, Nehal. But we will just talk more generally about capital allocation and how we plan to use our cash at our Investor Day as well, right. So, I would be happy to sort of take more \u2013 we talk more about that then. But at this point, we are not committing to a specific percentage. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Rich Valera, Nutanix's VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRichard Valera: Good afternoon, and welcome to today's conference call to discuss the results of our third quarter of 2023. Joining me today are Rajiv Ramaswami, Nutanix's President and CEO; and Rukmini Sivaraman, Nutanix's CFO.

Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. Against an uncertain macro backdrop, we delivered a solid third quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance and saw continued strong performance in our renewals business. With respect to the macro backdrop, in our third quarter, we continued to see businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and data center modernization initiative with a strong focus on total cost of ownership, which plays to the strength of our platform. However, we also continue to see some increased inspection of deals by customers, which we believe is related to the more uncertain macro backdrop, and this is driving a modest elongation in sales cycles. We consider this dynamic in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Supply chain constraints with our server partners appear to have normalized at this point and are now having minimal impact on our business. In conjunction with the release of our fiscal third quarter earnings tonight, we also announced the conclusion of the Audit Committee investigation related to third-party software usage and the subsequent filing of our 10-Q for our fiscal second quarter. As a result of this process, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and are working on remedial measures to address the identified weakness and help prevent this from happening again. We have also held the responsible employees accountable. This matter had no material impact on our historical financials, and we believe it will have minimal impact going forward. While Rukmini will provide more details, we are pleased the investigation has been completed. Taking a closer look at the third quarter, we delivered solid topline growth, including 17% year-over-year ACV billings growth, driven by continued strong performance of our renewals business. Our ongoing focus on expense management helped us generate $42 million of free cash flow, continuing our strong year-to-date free cash flow performance. Overall, I'm pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter results reflect the value new and existing customers are seeing in both our core cloud platform and our solutions based portfolio as they look to modernize while carefully managing their costs. A good example of this is our largest deal in the quarter with a Fortune 500 semiconductor provider that was looking to accelerate its digital transformation. This customer decided to deploy their containerized manufacturing applications on Red Hat's OpenShift on our Nutanix cloud platform to optimize their infrastructure resources, and operationalize their private cloud environment in their numerous manufacturing facilities around the world. They expect this will meaningfully reduce their costs, while also enabling enhanced agility in deploying new products and responding to changing market demand. We see this win as a testament to the performance, scalability, and total cost of ownership benefits delivered by our platform and our ability to expand our footprint within some of the world's largest companies. Another notable win in the quarter was with the leading payment solutions provider in the EMEA region, who was looking to improve their IT total cost of ownership by modernizing their infrastructure and implementing a multi-cloud architecture operating across several countries. They chose our Nutanix Cloud Platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management to run their business critical applications, leveraging its simplicity and built-in automation for Infrastructure-as-a-Service. They also adopted Nutanix Database Service for managing and deploying their databases throughout their organization and Nutanix Unified Storage to service their unstructured data needs. By adopting the full Nutanix stack, this customer anticipates lowering their annual IT operating cost by 45%. We are also seeing customers take advantage of the capabilities of Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2 to rapidly and efficiently optimize their workload distribution across on-prem and public clouds. An example in the third quarter was a government agency in the EMEA region that was looking to shift a variety of on-prem workloads running on Nutanix Cloud Platform to public cloud in keeping with a government cloud-first mandate. They initially chose to shift the workloads to Azure using NC2 for what they thought would be a contingency plan for workload migration. However, given the speed and simplicity afforded by NC2 for quickly transitioning workloads without refactoring, as well as the cost effectiveness they found running workloads on NC2 on Azure, they decided to make NC2 their primary solution for public cloud migration. This win demonstrates how our customers appreciate the ability to rapidly and seamlessly shift their workloads from their private clouds to the largest public cloud provider with the consistent management, governance and data services provided by the Nutanix Cloud Platform without the time and expense of refactoring their workloads and with lower ongoing operating costs. Moving on, in early May, we held our first in-person .NEXT user conference in almost four years and saw strong attendance and engagement from our customers and partners. In conjunction with .NEXT, we made several important product-related innovation announcements, reflecting our continued investment into the hybrid multi-cloud platform. First, we announced new data services, including Nutanix Data Services for Kubernetes, which will bring the full power of Nutanix's enterprise class storage, snapshots, and disaster recovery to Kubernetes applications. And we introduced multi-cloud snapshot technology, which will deliver cross-cloud data mobility by enabling snapshots directly to cloud native storage, starting with AWS' S3 object storage service. We also announced Nutanix Central, a cloud-delivered management solution that will enable a truly universal cloud operating model by providing a single console for visibility, monitoring and management across public cloud, on-prem, hosted or edge environments. Finally, we introduced Project Beacon, our vision for Hybrid Multicloud Platform-as-a-Service, a multi-year effort to deliver data-centric Platform-as-a-Service offerings natively on Nutanix or on native public cloud. With the goal of decoupling the application and its data from the underlying infrastructure, Project Beacon aims to enable developers to build applications once and run them anywhere. In closing, while the macro environment remains uncertain, we are encouraged that the compelling value proposition of our cloud platform and the strength of our business model enable us to raise our fiscal year topline outlook and bottom line outlook. We remain focused on delivering innovation for our customers now and in the future, while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv. Before I discuss our financial result and outlook, I would like to first provide a summary of the Audit Committee's completed review of our third-party software usage and the resulting implications. Upon completion of the investigation, the Audit Committee found that evaluation software from two of our third-party providers was used in a non-compliant manner for interoperability testing, validation, customer proof-of-concept, training and customer support over a multi-year period. In addition, the Audit Committee concluded that certain employees engaged in intentional misconduct to conceal use of evaluation software with respect to one of our third-party providers in violation of our code of business conduct and ethics and other policies. We have terminated employment for certain employees who were found to be primarily responsible for the intentional misconduct. Through the investigation, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we determined that our controls did not effectively provide the information and communication necessary to identify non-compliant use of third-party software. To address this material weakness, we are implementing or will implement several remedial measures, including enhanced internal processes, enhanced training and continued communication regarding the importance of integrity and raising concerns in a timely manner. We have accounted for the estimated financial impact of this issue by recording cumulative estimated expenses of $11 million as of Q2 2023, which represents the estimable amount of future payments for past non-compliant usage of software from these two vendors accrued over a multi-year period. We have accordingly also corrected the prior period financials shown in the 10-Q filed earlier today. We expect the incremental ongoing annual impact to operating expenses of this third-party software usage to be approximately in the low single-digit millions of dollars. You can find additional information, including our complete Q2 2023 results and information about the estimated financial impact and remedial measures related to the third-party software review in our 10-Q quarterly report for Q2 2023 that we filed earlier today with the SEC. We are pleased that this investigation has been completed. I will now provide commentary on our Q3 2023 results, followed by the outlook for Q4 2023 and the full-year 2023. Q3 was a good quarter during which we beat all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q3 was $240 million higher than our guidance of $220 million to $225 million, and representing a year-over-year growth of 17%. Revenue in Q3 was $449 million higher than our guidance of $430 million to $440 million and a year-over-year growth of 11%. ARR at the end of Q3 was $1.467 billion, a year-over-year growth of 32%. New logo additions were about 430 in Q3. Average contract duration in Q3 was three years flat quarter-over-quarter as expected. As described previously, the percentage of orders with future start dates likely due to partner supply chain constraints continue to be an assumption in our Q3 guidance. Q3 revenue benefited approximately $5 million from the reduction in percentage of future start dates over time as more license revenue was recognized in quarter than deferred in line with the $5 million estimate we had provided on our last earnings call. As supply chain challenges faced by our server partners appear to have normalized, we expect its impact on our business to normalize as well. As a result, going forward, we will not continue to provide this quantification of revenue impact from orders with future start dates. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 84%. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 were $369 million. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 2%, including the impact of about $10 million in non-recurring tax obligations related to a portion of our employee RSUs that vested in Q3 and approximately $9 million of non-recurring legal and advisory expenses, both of which related to the third-party software review and the delay in our 10-Q filing for Q2. Excluding these one-time items, non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 would have been approximately 6%. Non-GAAP net income in Q3 was $12 million or EPS of $0.04 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 282 million shares. Billings linearity was good and DSOs were 28 days in Q3. Free cash flow in Q3 was $42 million, implying free cash flow margin of 9%. A few additional notes on Q3 free cash flow. One, the approximately $31 million payment for the settlement of the previously outstanding securities class action litigation, which is the amount inclusive of legal fees and expenses and net of our expected recovery under our D&O insurance is now expected to be paid and settled in Q4 rather than in Q3 as previously expected. The change in timing is due to routine process. Two, the $42 million of free cash flow in Q3 includes the impact of approximately $10 million of cash usage in Q3 for non-recurring tax obligations related to a portion of our employee RSUs that vested in March as expected and mentioned on our last earnings call and caused by the delay in our Q2 10-Q filing. Three, the delay in our Q2 10-Q filing also meant that we paused our ESPP program, delaying an estimated $20 million of net cash outflow related to ESPP, which would normally occur in Q3 to Q4. And four, free cash flow in Q3 was also impacted by approximately $6 million of payments for non-recurring legal and advisory expenses related to the third-party software review. We ended Q3 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.358 billion, up slightly from $1.311 billion in Q2 2023. Moving on to Q4. The guidance for Q4 fiscal 2023 is as follows: ACV billings of $240 million to $250 million, revenue of $470 million to $480 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84% and non-GAAP operating margin of 9% to 10%. Moving on to the full-year outlook with one quarter left. The guidance for fiscal year 2023 is as follows: ACV billings of $915 million to $925 million, a year-over-year growth of 22% at the midpoint of the range; revenue of $1.84 billion to $1.85 billion, a year-over-year growth of 17% at the midpoint; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84%; non-GAAP operating margin of 6% to 7%, a year-over-year improvement of over 10 points of margin at the midpoint; free cash flow of $125 million to $135 million, implying a free cash flow margin of 7% at the midpoint. I will now provide some color on our full-year guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as Rajiv mentioned, and similar to last quarter, we have seen a modest elongation of sales cycles likely due to increased deal inspection. Our fiscal year 2023 new and expansion ACV performance remains impacted by some of these macro dynamics and is performing slightly below our expectations entering the year and what we believe is longer term potential is. We have considered this dynamic in our updated guidance. The renewal business continues to perform well. However, it tends to be at a lower aggregate average contract duration compared to our new and expansion business. Our relative economics on renewals have also continued to improve over time as the renewals team has improved their execution. Second, similar to our comments last quarter, the full-year guidance assumes that contract duration would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year 2022. Third, as stated previously, non-GAAP operating margin outlook for fiscal year 2023 is 6% to 7%. Excluding the one-time expenses related to the third-party software review, this range would have been 7% to 8%. Finally, the updated free cash flow guidance of $125 million to $135 million includes the impact of the following non-recurring items totaling about $65 million. Approximately $10 million of cash usage in Q3 for non-recurring tax obligations related to a portion of our employee RSUs vesting, which is non-recurring because it was due to the delayed filing of our 10-Q. Approximately $31 million in net cash outflow expected in Q4 from the previously mentioned litigation settlement. Approximately $15 million for legal and advisory fees related to the third-party software review across Q3 and Q4. And finally, an $11 million estimated payment in Q4 for the potential resolution with the third-party software vendors. In closing, we are pleased that our Q3 results reflect our continued execution towards our stated objective of sustainable, profitable growth, and we expect to continue that focus. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Jim Fish of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJames Fish: Hey guys. Nice quarter and congrats on getting the investigation behind you and being a fairly minimal impact as we kind of all talked about here. Maybe just starting off on the assumptions around guide and what you guys are seeing with sales cycles. Obviously, we've talked about elongated sales cycle for some time now. We're hearing it from others in kind of this space. I guess how much have elongated sales cycle slowed or hindered that expansion rate with existing customers? And I know you're not going to give the exact, but are net retention rates closer to essentially 120 now than where we were kind of before entering this year? Or as it actually gets a bit lower just given the macro economy?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Jim, let me start with some qualitative comments there and Rukmini can give you some numbers there. So first of all, I think you talked about NRR, when you look at our renewals, by the way, renewals, first of all, is solid, okay? No issues really from the macro piece. Now when you look at the macro itself in terms of the impact, it impacts both new logos as well as expansion business with our existing customers. Now the impact is similar to what we saw last quarter, which is \u2013 takes longer in terms of deals are inspected more by some customers. And what we've seen is, therefore, the sales cycle has gotten modestly longer. Now the other factor here, which is common during this kind of an environment is that some customers at least can tend to sweat their existing assets in the current environment which, of course, has an impact in terms of both new and expansion business for us. They might continue to run as long as they can before they spend more money. So if you look at that, the impact is on our FY2023 new and expansion ACV because of these dynamics. And what I'd say overall, qualitative color for that is that, that new and expansion business for us is performing slightly below our expectations entering the year and also below what we believe is long-term potential. Rukmini, do you want to add anything?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. And Jim, thanks for the question on NRR. And as you noted, we don't really disclose that on a quarterly basis, Jim. But what I will say is that it's sort of still in the range that I think we had talked about at our last Investor Day in that 121%, 125% range. And so I'll leave it at that with regard to NRR specifically.\nJames Fish: Yes. That's helpful Rukmini and Rajiv. I appreciate that. And maybe Rajiv, for you, your favorite question. Any impact yet from your vantage point with the ongoing acquisition of really your top competitor and outside of that direct competition, I guess, what are you seeing from native hyperscaler offerings and the traditional raise? Obviously, you just alluded to some sweating of assets. Just trying to understand the competitive landscape here as you guys are still putting up solid growth. Thanks.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think, Jim, first of all, not a whole lot of change compared to last quarter on that. So clearly, on the Broadcom piece in terms of the acquisition, we're certainly seeing that higher level of engagement, continuing to do that with many customers around the world who are looking to look at their options, manage potential risks associated with this acquisition. Now as we talked about our sales cycles tend to be nine to 12 months. And so we haven't quite seen factoring in meaningful benefit from this in FY2023. Now on the other side of the equation from a competitive dynamic, it's the cloud native or hyperscaler piece of it. What I would say is, if anything, I think our customers have gotten much more careful about what to put in the public cloud versus simply going all to the public cloud. So we see much more focus in terms of what should I be running on-prem, what should have been using in the public cloud? How can I look at optimizing that? And that's actually playing to our strength and certainly helping us \u2013 our whole strategy around helping our customers operate in a hybrid multi-cloud world is helping us at this time.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham. Your line is open.\nMichael Cikos: Hey guys. Thanks for getting me on here. And I'll echo similar comments to my peer here as far as congrats on getting the Audit Committee investigation behind you in the \u2013 moving on to the next chapter. I wanted to highlight the strength that you guys called out this quarter and then the uptick in guide. Can you help us think through how the quarter played out, maybe more from a linearity perspective as each progressive month worked through the quarter? Was it building? Or was the outperformance snowballing over the course of the quarter? Or is it really more dedicated to a specific month within the quarter as far as how trends played out? And then my follow-up, I'll just ask it now. But \u2013 good to see the slight uptick on gross margins as well. Is there anything you can do to help us wrap our heads around, what's driving that uptick in gross margins and how sustainable that is as we think about the longevity of the business? Thank you again.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Mike. So first, a question on linearity. So linearity I would say was largely as expected. There wasn't any significant unusual trends compared to typical Q3, Mike? So that's on the linearity. And then on gross margin, what I would say is we continue to be really focused on efficiency and all of that. So in terms of, I think, how sustainable this is, I think, was your question, we think that we will be in that low 80s range, right, maybe move around a little bit. One of the things we are focused on is continuing to make sure that we are attaching professional services where it makes sense, especially for some of the newer parts of our portfolio to make sure customers are adopting them effectively, and we're helping them do so. So it might move around a little bit here and there, but we saw the guide for the full-year as well, which factors in all of those moving pieces at this point.\nMichael Cikos: Makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much Rukmini.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPinjalim Bora: Great. Hey guys. Congrats on the quarter and great to hear the conclusion of the investigation. Rajiv, it seems like a lot of innovation is coming out of Nutanix in the .NEXT, you talked about Project Beacon. It seems like a holy grail. I think VMware has kind of tried it as well. Talk to us about kind of where are the building blocks of the technology around that, a multi-hybrid cloud PaaS platform? And what \u2013 where are we? How long is it going to take for us to kind of see a product launch GA?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So if you look at the Project Beacon and just a quick recap of that is, let\u2019s say multi-cloud Platform-as-a-Service focused on data offerings to help companies build an app once using the set of services and be truly able to run them anywhere, completely portable on any underlying substrate, whether it be a cloud native on any public cloud or whether it be on-prem. So that's the quick recap of the vision. Now if you look at \u2013 this is clearly what we said at .NEXT, is that this is a multi-year journey for us, and it happens in multiple steps. If you look at where we are, we have a foundation for that today with our Nutanix database service, we today offer that on-prem on a Nutanix underlying substrate and help companies manage databases in a consistent way \u2013 a variety of databases. We are on a path to make that offering available on top of native public cloud substrates. So that will be the first step in the road map. And we will comment on that in terms of specific execution when we get closer to releasing it. And then beyond that will be other services, for example, things like messaging, streaming, cashing, et cetera, that we would over time add on. Some of these could also be done in partnerships. So we \u2013 like I said, we started with our Nutanix database offering and over multiple years, we will get to that journey. And I also expect that there will be a broader ecosystem of people like us who are like-minded in terms of establishing this truly hybrid vision for building apps and being able to run them everywhere.\nPinjalim Bora: Understood. Thank you for that. And Rukmini, maybe my math is wrong here or maybe I'm getting the numbers wrong. It seems like there's a little bit of cautious sentiment going forward. But when I look at the guidance, I think you're raising the revenue guidance by $40 million, and you beat by something like 13 or 14, if I read that correctly. Help me \u2013 what gives you confidence if the macro is actually getting a little bit worse?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Pinjalim, for that question. So I'll guide has a few pieces, right. So let me start with I know your question was on revenue. But if I just start with ACV billings here for a second, we did take that guide up as well, right, from 915 to 925 and as you pointed out, we took revenue up as well. So one is that we feel good given all the caveats right, to the point about the modest elongation of sales cycles, in some cases, which you touched upon earlier, I believe, in terms if it's a new logo, we see customers choosing to sort of stretch their assets out a little longer. So some of those dynamics are playing out. But I think a few things that we believe sort of bolsters that overall guidance is our renewals business, as we said from day one from when we started the year, has continued to perform well, right. And with that mix growing over time, that helps us form a pretty strong foundation for the guide overall. And then the one other point I'll make is ACV billings is more of a transactional sort of quarter-over-quarter number, right, if things that are built in the quarter, but revenue obviously flows in as a waterfall over time. So there's also the net revenue benefit we are seeing, and we've talked about this each quarter this year from recognizing more license revenue, right, from the future start date orders than we were deferring which is a boost that seem more on the revenue side than a seed on the billing side. So those are some of the things that are driving that guide, Pinjalim.\nPinjalim Bora: Can I kind of one follow-up lastly. Did you bring your assumption on that start date for Q4 guidance kind of down?\nRukmini Sivaraman: So we haven't specifically diverse what those assumptions are Pinjalim, but I think it's fair to say that overall, we have seen the supply chain dynamics normalize for our server partners going in, we had assumed that things would be better, right, towards the end of the year, but we hadn\u2019t assumed it could be completely normal, right. But at this point, it does seem like those are largely normalized.\nPinjalim Bora: Got it. Thank you very much.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of George Wang of Barclays. Your line is open.\nGeorge Wang: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter and the successful competition of the investigation. I have two questions. First of all, do you have any comments on the channel partners, especially on the service providers, especially against this Broadcom backdrop and the VMware, hopefully, post merger, you guys can get more love from service providers. Any thoughts on that?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Absolutely, George. I'll tell you, I mean, that's the larger large untapped opportunity for us because that's a route to market that historically we have not spent a lot of time on and only recently have really started engaging with service provider partners. In fact, and it's already bearing fruit for us. I think last quarter or the quarter before, some of the largest deals in the quarter came through the service provider channel. So we keep adding to our service providers set of partners. We actually have high hopes in terms of that being a strong channel for us going forward. What I would still say is that we are still in the first inning of a baseball game to put that analogy when it comes to our service providers in terms of billings that out of market. And to your point, I think, clearly, there's a very large established service provider channel with the Investor Day and we're only now building ours and I think some of those channel partners, service providers are going to be certainly more inclined to work with us more so going forward.\nGeorge Wang: Great. Also, Rajiv, a quick follow-up. In terms of the land expand, are you seeing kind of increasing attach to the whole survey stack and especially given kind of a more mature kind of business model and the kind of some of the additional use cases. Maybe you can unpack quantify so the attach kind of growing over time for the entire platform?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, there's no doubt. I mean I think if you recall, we came out with our simplified solution-oriented product portfolio a while ago. And we have now seen an increasing portion of our deals, of course, coming through that new portfolio. Now as part of that, the very specific things that we've seen is Nutanix cloud management, notably higher attach for Nutanix cloud management as part of what we sell today. So whenever we sell Nutanix cloud infrastructure, there's a very logical attach of cloud management, and we see that certainly happening impact. And then I think on the other pieces, I think Nutanix database service tends to be somewhat more of a specialized cell because it is targeting database admins and developers versus the core infrastructure. So that's not as much of an attach, although we are trying to attach that more with database workloads running on our platform. And then unified storage, which is the last component of our portfolio there. Certainly, I think is also seeing a good attach. So we are actually quite happy with how this revised portfolio is going and being adopted in the market. And customers are certainly wanting to adopt more and more of the entire portfolio. So it's \u2013 when people want to build a cloud, it's like I said, very common for them to consider you're taking the whole thing, whole stack, which would be NCI and CM plus some in the U.S.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Great. And thanks again, I will go back to the queue.\nOperator: Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. I appreciate it. Congrats on the quarter, guys. Maybe you guys have commented on sort of cloud optimization projects or data center modernization projects clearly a theme across multiple names over the past few quarters. Just where do you think customers are on that journey of kind of figuring out what the end state of what their data centers are looking like? And does that kind of involve \u2013 you just spoke about kind of deeper adoption of the portfolio, but I guess I'm just wondering, does that involve kind of a deeper conversation about what Nutanix products could be used kind of upfront? So maybe just kind of where are we in figuring out kind of their end state on hybrid cloud? And just does that involve kind of more services upfront from Nutanix?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think that's a very good question, Meta. So in fact, I'm just \u2013 I had a conversation on this only yesterday with one of our large enterprise customers. What I would say is I think they were five years ago there were a set of customers who said, we are going to go to the public cloud period, the cloud first. And now it's much more about a cloud operating model, which is they like what the cloud offers in terms of agility, self-service, rich set of services and sometimes an OpEx model instead of a CapEx model in terms of consumption. They like that, but not necessarily a location, right. So if you just go and do everything in the public cloud, they realize that cost optimization is a growing and important part of what they have to deal with today. So what we are seeing right now is much more discussion around this hybrid multi-cloud. People wanted to run workloads across both locations. And for us, one of the things that we are working hard to do is to actually build awareness within our customer base about the fact that we do actually have offerings that are very relevant to them in terms of enabling them to operate across all of this because if you recall, our own history as a company, we started out most people \u2013 customers know us as a HCI company, right, hyperconverged infrastructure. And we've been working hard to get our narrative out in terms of what we can do for them today. And when we talked about how we can actually help them operate across both these environments very well, very efficiently. I think the conversation becomes much more strategic with our customers and they start using more of our portfolio and certainly more of our services as well that to implement some of the capabilities there. So I would say, again, for us, the \u2013 there's a lot of, I think, still opportunity here that this whole hybrid operations and mindset from our customers is opening up.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. And maybe just Rukmini, I\u2019m doing this back of the envelope, but it would seem as if OpEx stepped down quarter-on-quarter on the guide. Is that all just from onetime impacts that you kind of saw in fiscal Q3 and so underlying OpEx to actually relatively stable? Or is there anything that I'm just missing there? Thanks.\nRukmini Sivaraman: No, that's exactly right, Meta. The underlying OpEx when you back out some of these one-time nonrecurring items that I talked about, relatively stable. I mean, there's some moving pieces, but really small. So you are correct that if you back those out Q3 to Q4 should be relatively stable.\nMeta Marshall: Okay. Perfect. Thanks.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: Yes. Thank you. I wanted to just follow up on that last question asked to Rajiv. In terms of what you've seen over the last five years, let's say, the kind of the pace of customers shifting workloads to the public cloud, refactoring applications, a lot of initiatives around that over the last five years. In this environment of cost optimization, have you seen enterprises sort of take a step back and say, you know what, maybe we were moving a little bit too quickly and give things a little more evaluation and thought and you talked about TCO, so maybe just kind of paint a picture for us in terms of this last, I don't know, 12 months versus what you've seen in the prior four years?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Jason, I will say this dialogue has definitely changed over the last year on this topic. I think they've got a set of customers who said, we are going to refactor, let's go move everything to the public cloud. And I think they ran into two issues. One was that it actually was pretty expensive for them to refactor in the first place. And then second, once they did refactor and ran everything into the public cloud, and they're starting to operate at scale, I mean, it's an easy on ramp, right, in the sense that upfront is very easy, you like the ease of use and so forth. But then as you start using a lot of the services, then you start seeing your bill going up and you soon realize that there's a significant premium there compared to what you were doing before. And so that consciousness is now very much cost optimization is very much a key part of many of our customers thinking. And so now like I mentioned to Meta's question, there is definitely \u2013 it's not a close my eyes, let me refactor everything more to the public cloud. That's no longer the conversation at all, right. I think it's much more about, okay, I'm going to have a process for figuring out what I'm going to go footwear. And in fact, I heard one customer mention that as they're establishing a target state architecture approach for every app that they have in their portfolio, and they're going to then decide what to do about that app. It is going to be running the data center. Does it make sense to refactor it et cetera. So I think people are being much more careful about managing their application portfolio now than they were before.\nJason Ader: Got you. And then just as a quick follow-up on that. As I think about things like NC2 and VMware and AWS, the pushback that we always got on that as well, that's great and it's an easy lift and shift, but it's sort of a stop gap, right? Ultimately, you want to have the app refactored. And I guess if a customer does go that route and use NC2, what's the risk in your mind that refactoring is just sort of an inevitable step on that app and then potentially you lose the app?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think first of all, two points. Yes, customers can lift and ship and take it easily to the public cloud Jason, no doubt about it. Now as they refactor and start creating a cloud-native version of the app, one of the things that's a little less understood about NC2 is that even in that scenario, we can actually help run that app very efficiently, right. Even for a pure cloud-native app, you can take our cloud native app that's been fully refactored and run it on NC2 on bare metal say, in AWS or Azure and get significant advantages, both in terms of potentially cost savings, but also in terms of ease of management, and the ability to have one team manage their on-prem and their cloud environments with a single set of tools. So those are sustainable. We've also seen examples of where we can deliver depending on the application itself, quite substantial cost savings in terms of ongoing runtime costs as well. So that combination plus as we look at our future, when you look at things like Project Beacon, where people cannot build these cloud-native apps using a portable set of center data services, and then they can decide where they want to land them. So for us, we don't think of NC2 as a temporary, hey, migrate and then you're out of the picture. We actually think is migrate and operate. And if you also look at it from a cloud provider's perspective, if you're an AWS on Amazon or Azure, what you really care about is customers consuming our services. It doesn't matter whether they're using Nutanix or not, as long as those apps are running in the hyperscaler environment. So there's not a \u2013 so this combination is what makes NC2 quite sticky over time.\nJason Ader: Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on demand maybe by vertical? Do you see anything different, particularly in financial services or government or healthcare this quarter? And what trends are you seeing currently in those verticals?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Hey, Wamsi. So yes, both financial services and healthcare are important verticals for us. I will say we have not seen any significant changes. I mean, I know people talk about what's been happening in the banking world. But we have not seen any significant changes in demand patterns. If anything from some of the larger banks, we are seeing more engagement now with us than before. And so nothing significant for us to report in terms of changes.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Rajiv. And as a follow-up, I mean, your gross margins, obviously very strong, but the broader demand environment is kind of weak and there are lots of pockets in the overall market that have gotten more competitive. And frankly, increased levels of discounting across many areas of the data center. So I was wondering if you saw any of those kind of trends. And if you didn't part take, did you leave revenue on the table or billings went table?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. And of course, as you can imagine, we look at that very closely and manage that, and our ASPs have been quite steady. Part of the reason is most of our selling is the value sell. We look at \u2013 we have a team of cloud economists who actually build economic models for almost any of the significant deals we have and talk about \u2013 and showcase the TCO benefits that a customer gets by using our solution. And that's how we justify the pricing. So yes, of course, there's a competitive environment out there, but we haven't seen anything significant yet that's impacting our gross margins.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you. And if I could sneak one last one in. Can you maybe just help us think through what impact backlog drawdown is having on fiscal 2023? And sort of what kind of a headwind that might pose for fiscal 2024?\nRukmini Sivaraman: I'll take that one. Thank you for the question, Wamsi. So I think as we've said from the beginning of this fiscal year, right, both revenue growth and ACV billings have benefited from the strong backlog level with which we entered the year. And revenue, specifically has also benefited from this dynamic of recognition of deferred license revenue from the future start date orders as we've talked about in the past, right? So the full-year results, we expect will reflect a benefit from both of these Wamsi, but just as a software company, we don't typically kind of specify or guide to backlog or anything like that. But yes, entering this year, we did have a record level of backlog, which is benefiting growth for this year on both revenue and ACV billings.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you very much.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from Dan Bergstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDaniel Bergstrom: Hey. It's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for squeezing us in here. Maybe to build on a previous question and the positive outlook despite some macros with guidance for the fourth quarter, did anything change around the level of conservatism in the outlook? Or are you using a consistent approach versus the third quarter?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi, Dan. I'll take that question. We have been pretty consistent in our approach. So we haven't necessarily become more or less conservative for Q4 as related to Q3, which I believe was your question. Did I get the question correctly?\nDaniel Bergstrom: Yes. Perfect. Thanks. And then maybe to verify on free cash flow for the fourth quarter from the prepared remarks. Sounds like there's a $31 million and $20 million outflow that may have been expected in the third quarter but will be in the fourth quarter. Is that correct?\nRukmini Sivaraman: That is correct. And if I can just take a minute to maybe talk a little bit about Q4 free cash flow, right? So for the full-year, we provided a guide of 125 to 135. And we also said that there is about $65 million of onetime outflow, right? So if you add that, you are now at a $190 million to $200 million free cash flow for the year. And that less the $150-or-so million that we've already done year-to-date would be a reasonable way to think about a normalized Q4 free cash flow with some normal quarter-to-quarter adjustments.\nDaniel Bergstrom: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger of JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nErik Suppiger: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on the quarter and the audit. With regards to the software compliance issue, can you tell us how you learned about that? And are you continuing to use the software from the two vendors that you had to do to work with on this?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think I can take that, Erik. So yes, we discovered it, management discovered it, and it was discovered as part of a software purchase review. And yes, we are continuing to use the software. But again, for the non-production use cases that we talked about.\nRukmini Sivaraman: And the only thing I would add is we are in contact with both of those vendors at this time and are working towards a commercial resolution.\nErik Suppiger: All right. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.  I'm showing no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. Against an uncertain macro backdrop, we delivered a solid third quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance and saw continued strong performance in our renewals business. With respect to the macro backdrop, in our third quarter, we continued to see businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and data center modernization initiative with a strong focus on total cost of ownership, which plays to the strength of our platform. However, we also continue to see some increased inspection of deals by customers, which we believe is related to the more uncertain macro backdrop, and this is driving a modest elongation in sales cycles. We consider this dynamic in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Supply chain constraints with our server partners appear to have normalized at this point and are now having minimal impact on our business. In conjunction with the release of our fiscal third quarter earnings tonight, we also announced the conclusion of the Audit Committee investigation related to third-party software usage and the subsequent filing of our 10-Q for our fiscal second quarter. As a result of this process, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and are working on remedial measures to address the identified weakness and help prevent this from happening again. We have also held the responsible employees accountable. This matter had no material impact on our historical financials, and we believe it will have minimal impact going forward. While Rukmini will provide more details, we are pleased the investigation has been completed. Taking a closer look at the third quarter, we delivered solid topline growth, including 17% year-over-year ACV billings growth, driven by continued strong performance of our renewals business. Our ongoing focus on expense management helped us generate $42 million of free cash flow, continuing our strong year-to-date free cash flow performance. Overall, I'm pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter results reflect the value new and existing customers are seeing in both our core cloud platform and our solutions based portfolio as they look to modernize while carefully managing their costs. A good example of this is our largest deal in the quarter with a Fortune 500 semiconductor provider that was looking to accelerate its digital transformation. This customer decided to deploy their containerized manufacturing applications on Red Hat's OpenShift on our Nutanix cloud platform to optimize their infrastructure resources, and operationalize their private cloud environment in their numerous manufacturing facilities around the world. They expect this will meaningfully reduce their costs, while also enabling enhanced agility in deploying new products and responding to changing market demand. We see this win as a testament to the performance, scalability, and total cost of ownership benefits delivered by our platform and our ability to expand our footprint within some of the world's largest companies. Another notable win in the quarter was with the leading payment solutions provider in the EMEA region, who was looking to improve their IT total cost of ownership by modernizing their infrastructure and implementing a multi-cloud architecture operating across several countries. They chose our Nutanix Cloud Platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management to run their business critical applications, leveraging its simplicity and built-in automation for Infrastructure-as-a-Service. They also adopted Nutanix Database Service for managing and deploying their databases throughout their organization and Nutanix Unified Storage to service their unstructured data needs. By adopting the full Nutanix stack, this customer anticipates lowering their annual IT operating cost by 45%. We are also seeing customers take advantage of the capabilities of Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2 to rapidly and efficiently optimize their workload distribution across on-prem and public clouds. An example in the third quarter was a government agency in the EMEA region that was looking to shift a variety of on-prem workloads running on Nutanix Cloud Platform to public cloud in keeping with a government cloud-first mandate. They initially chose to shift the workloads to Azure using NC2 for what they thought would be a contingency plan for workload migration. However, given the speed and simplicity afforded by NC2 for quickly transitioning workloads without refactoring, as well as the cost effectiveness they found running workloads on NC2 on Azure, they decided to make NC2 their primary solution for public cloud migration. This win demonstrates how our customers appreciate the ability to rapidly and seamlessly shift their workloads from their private clouds to the largest public cloud provider with the consistent management, governance and data services provided by the Nutanix Cloud Platform without the time and expense of refactoring their workloads and with lower ongoing operating costs. Moving on, in early May, we held our first in-person .NEXT user conference in almost four years and saw strong attendance and engagement from our customers and partners. In conjunction with .NEXT, we made several important product-related innovation announcements, reflecting our continued investment into the hybrid multi-cloud platform. First, we announced new data services, including Nutanix Data Services for Kubernetes, which will bring the full power of Nutanix's enterprise class storage, snapshots, and disaster recovery to Kubernetes applications. And we introduced multi-cloud snapshot technology, which will deliver cross-cloud data mobility by enabling snapshots directly to cloud native storage, starting with AWS' S3 object storage service. We also announced Nutanix Central, a cloud-delivered management solution that will enable a truly universal cloud operating model by providing a single console for visibility, monitoring and management across public cloud, on-prem, hosted or edge environments. Finally, we introduced Project Beacon, our vision for Hybrid Multicloud Platform-as-a-Service, a multi-year effort to deliver data-centric Platform-as-a-Service offerings natively on Nutanix or on native public cloud. With the goal of decoupling the application and its data from the underlying infrastructure, Project Beacon aims to enable developers to build applications once and run them anywhere. In closing, while the macro environment remains uncertain, we are encouraged that the compelling value proposition of our cloud platform and the strength of our business model enable us to raise our fiscal year topline outlook and bottom line outlook. We remain focused on delivering innovation for our customers now and in the future, while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini? Jim, let me start with some qualitative comments there and Rukmini can give you some numbers there. So first of all, I think you talked about NRR, when you look at our renewals, by the way, renewals, first of all, is solid, okay? No issues really from the macro piece. Now when you look at the macro itself in terms of the impact, it impacts both new logos as well as expansion business with our existing customers. Now the impact is similar to what we saw last quarter, which is \u2013 takes longer in terms of deals are inspected more by some customers. And what we've seen is, therefore, the sales cycle has gotten modestly longer. Now the other factor here, which is common during this kind of an environment is that some customers at least can tend to sweat their existing assets in the current environment which, of course, has an impact in terms of both new and expansion business for us. They might continue to run as long as they can before they spend more money. So if you look at that, the impact is on our FY2023 new and expansion ACV because of these dynamics. And what I'd say overall, qualitative color for that is that, that new and expansion business for us is performing slightly below our expectations entering the year and also below what we believe is long-term potential. Rukmini, do you want to add anything? Yes. I think, Jim, first of all, not a whole lot of change compared to last quarter on that. So clearly, on the Broadcom piece in terms of the acquisition, we're certainly seeing that higher level of engagement, continuing to do that with many customers around the world who are looking to look at their options, manage potential risks associated with this acquisition. Now as we talked about our sales cycles tend to be nine to 12 months. And so we haven't quite seen factoring in meaningful benefit from this in FY2023. Now on the other side of the equation from a competitive dynamic, it's the cloud native or hyperscaler piece of it. What I would say is, if anything, I think our customers have gotten much more careful about what to put in the public cloud versus simply going all to the public cloud. So we see much more focus in terms of what should I be running on-prem, what should have been using in the public cloud? How can I look at optimizing that? And that's actually playing to our strength and certainly helping us \u2013 our whole strategy around helping our customers operate in a hybrid multi-cloud world is helping us at this time. Yes. So if you look at the Project Beacon and just a quick recap of that is, let's say multi-cloud Platform-as-a-Service focused on data offerings to help companies build an app once using the set of services and be truly able to run them anywhere, completely portable on any underlying substrate, whether it be a cloud native on any public cloud or whether it be on-prem. So that's the quick recap of the vision. Now if you look at \u2013 this is clearly what we said at .NEXT, is that this is a multi-year journey for us, and it happens in multiple steps. If you look at where we are, we have a foundation for that today with our Nutanix database service, we today offer that on-prem on a Nutanix underlying substrate and help companies manage databases in a consistent way \u2013 a variety of databases. We are on a path to make that offering available on top of native public cloud substrates. So that will be the first step in the road map. And we will comment on that in terms of specific execution when we get closer to releasing it. And then beyond that will be other services, for example, things like messaging, streaming, cashing, et cetera, that we would over time add on. Some of these could also be done in partnerships. So we \u2013 like I said, we started with our Nutanix database offering and over multiple years, we will get to that journey. And I also expect that there will be a broader ecosystem of people like us who are like-minded in terms of establishing this truly hybrid vision for building apps and being able to run them everywhere. Absolutely, George. I'll tell you, I mean, that's the larger large untapped opportunity for us because that's a route to market that historically we have not spent a lot of time on and only recently have really started engaging with service provider partners. In fact, and it's already bearing fruit for us. I think last quarter or the quarter before, some of the largest deals in the quarter came through the service provider channel. So we keep adding to our service providers set of partners. We actually have high hopes in terms of that being a strong channel for us going forward. What I would still say is that we are still in the first inning of a baseball game to put that analogy when it comes to our service providers in terms of billings that out of market. And to your point, I think, clearly, there's a very large established service provider channel with the Investor Day and we're only now building ours and I think some of those channel partners, service providers are going to be certainly more inclined to work with us more so going forward. Yes, there's no doubt. I mean I think if you recall, we came out with our simplified solution-oriented product portfolio a while ago. And we have now seen an increasing portion of our deals, of course, coming through that new portfolio. Now as part of that, the very specific things that we've seen is Nutanix cloud management, notably higher attach for Nutanix cloud management as part of what we sell today. So whenever we sell Nutanix cloud infrastructure, there's a very logical attach of cloud management, and we see that certainly happening impact. And then I think on the other pieces, I think Nutanix database service tends to be somewhat more of a specialized cell because it is targeting database admins and developers versus the core infrastructure. So that's not as much of an attach, although we are trying to attach that more with database workloads running on our platform. And then unified storage, which is the last component of our portfolio there. Certainly, I think is also seeing a good attach. So we are actually quite happy with how this revised portfolio is going and being adopted in the market. And customers are certainly wanting to adopt more and more of the entire portfolio. So it's \u2013 when people want to build a cloud, it's like I said, very common for them to consider you're taking the whole thing, whole stack, which would be NCI and CM plus some in the U.S. Yes. I think that's a very good question, Meta. So in fact, I'm just \u2013 I had a conversation on this only yesterday with one of our large enterprise customers. What I would say is I think they were five years ago there were a set of customers who said, we are going to go to the public cloud period, the cloud first. And now it's much more about a cloud operating model, which is they like what the cloud offers in terms of agility, self-service, rich set of services and sometimes an OpEx model instead of a CapEx model in terms of consumption. They like that, but not necessarily a location, right. So if you just go and do everything in the public cloud, they realize that cost optimization is a growing and important part of what they have to deal with today. So what we are seeing right now is much more discussion around this hybrid multi-cloud. People wanted to run workloads across both locations. And for us, one of the things that we are working hard to do is to actually build awareness within our customer base about the fact that we do actually have offerings that are very relevant to them in terms of enabling them to operate across all of this because if you recall, our own history as a company, we started out most people \u2013 customers know us as a HCI company, right, hyperconverged infrastructure. And we've been working hard to get our narrative out in terms of what we can do for them today. And when we talked about how we can actually help them operate across both these environments very well, very efficiently. I think the conversation becomes much more strategic with our customers and they start using more of our portfolio and certainly more of our services as well that to implement some of the capabilities there. So I would say, again, for us, the \u2013 there's a lot of, I think, still opportunity here that this whole hybrid operations and mindset from our customers is opening up. Yes, Jason, I will say this dialogue has definitely changed over the last year on this topic. I think they've got a set of customers who said, we are going to refactor, let's go move everything to the public cloud. And I think they ran into two issues. One was that it actually was pretty expensive for them to refactor in the first place. And then second, once they did refactor and ran everything into the public cloud, and they're starting to operate at scale, I mean, it's an easy on ramp, right, in the sense that upfront is very easy, you like the ease of use and so forth. But then as you start using a lot of the services, then you start seeing your bill going up and you soon realize that there's a significant premium there compared to what you were doing before. And so that consciousness is now very much cost optimization is very much a key part of many of our customers thinking. And so now like I mentioned to Meta's question, there is definitely \u2013 it's not a close my eyes, let me refactor everything more to the public cloud. That's no longer the conversation at all, right. I think it's much more about, okay, I'm going to have a process for figuring out what I'm going to go footwear. And in fact, I heard one customer mention that as they're establishing a target state architecture approach for every app that they have in their portfolio, and they're going to then decide what to do about that app. It is going to be running the data center. Does it make sense to refactor it et cetera. So I think people are being much more careful about managing their application portfolio now than they were before. Yes. I think first of all, two points. Yes, customers can lift and ship and take it easily to the public cloud Jason, no doubt about it. Now as they refactor and start creating a cloud-native version of the app, one of the things that's a little less understood about NC2 is that even in that scenario, we can actually help run that app very efficiently, right. Even for a pure cloud-native app, you can take our cloud native app that's been fully refactored and run it on NC2 on bare metal say, in AWS or Azure and get significant advantages, both in terms of potentially cost savings, but also in terms of ease of management, and the ability to have one team manage their on-prem and their cloud environments with a single set of tools.

It doesn't matter whether they're using Nutanix or not, as long as those apps are running in the hyperscaler environment. So there's not a \u2013 so this combination is what makes NC2 quite sticky over time. Hey, Wamsi. So yes, both financial services and healthcare are important verticals for us. I will say we have not seen any significant changes. I mean, I know people talk about what's been happening in the banking world. But we have not seen any significant changes in demand patterns. If anything from some of the larger banks, we are seeing more engagement now with us than before. And so nothing significant for us to report in terms of changes. Yes.

And that's how we justify the pricing. So yes, of course, there's a competitive environment out there, but we haven't seen anything significant yet that's impacting our gross margins. Yes. I think I can take that, Erik. So yes, we discovered it, management discovered it, and it was discovered as part of a software purchase review. And yes, we are continuing to use the software. But again, for the non-production use cases that we talked about."

            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. Before I discuss our financial result and outlook, I would like to first provide a summary of the Audit Committee's completed review of our third-party software usage and the resulting implications. Upon completion of the investigation, the Audit Committee found that evaluation software from two of our third-party providers was used in a non-compliant manner for interoperability testing, validation, customer proof-of-concept, training and customer support over a multi-year period. In addition, the Audit Committee concluded that certain employees engaged in intentional misconduct to conceal use of evaluation software with respect to one of our third-party providers in violation of our code of business conduct and ethics and other policies. We have terminated employment for certain employees who were found to be primarily responsible for the intentional misconduct. Through the investigation, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we determined that our controls did not effectively provide the information and communication necessary to identify non-compliant use of third-party software. To address this material weakness, we are implementing or will implement several remedial measures, including enhanced internal processes, enhanced training and continued communication regarding the importance of integrity and raising concerns in a timely manner. We have accounted for the estimated financial impact of this issue by recording cumulative estimated expenses of $11 million as of Q2 2023, which represents the estimable amount of future payments for past non-compliant usage of software from these two vendors accrued over a multi-year period. We have accordingly also corrected the prior period financials shown in the 10-Q filed earlier today. We expect the incremental ongoing annual impact to operating expenses of this third-party software usage to be approximately in the low single-digit millions of dollars. You can find additional information, including our complete Q2 2023 results and information about the estimated financial impact and remedial measures related to the third-party software review in our 10-Q quarterly report for Q2 2023 that we filed earlier today with the SEC. We are pleased that this investigation has been completed. I will now provide commentary on our Q3 2023 results, followed by the outlook for Q4 2023 and the full-year 2023. Q3 was a good quarter during which we beat all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q3 was $240 million higher than our guidance of $220 million to $225 million, and representing a year-over-year growth of 17%. Revenue in Q3 was $449 million higher than our guidance of $430 million to $440 million and a year-over-year growth of 11%. ARR at the end of Q3 was $1.467 billion, a year-over-year growth of 32%. New logo additions were about 430 in Q3. Average contract duration in Q3 was three years flat quarter-over-quarter as expected. As described previously, the percentage of orders with future start dates likely due to partner supply chain constraints continue to be an assumption in our Q3 guidance. Q3 revenue benefited approximately $5 million from the reduction in percentage of future start dates over time as more license revenue was recognized in quarter than deferred in line with the $5 million estimate we had provided on our last earnings call. As supply chain challenges faced by our server partners appear to have normalized, we expect its impact on our business to normalize as well. As a result, going forward, we will not continue to provide this quantification of revenue impact from orders with future start dates. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 84%. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 were $369 million. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 2%, including the impact of about $10 million in non-recurring tax obligations related to a portion of our employee RSUs that vested in Q3 and approximately $9 million of non-recurring legal and advisory expenses, both of which related to the third-party software review and the delay in our 10-Q filing for Q2. Excluding these one-time items, non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 would have been approximately 6%. Non-GAAP net income in Q3 was $12 million or EPS of $0.04 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 282 million shares. Billings linearity was good and DSOs were 28 days in Q3. Free cash flow in Q3 was $42 million, implying free cash flow margin of 9%. A few additional notes on Q3 free cash flow. One, the approximately $31 million payment for the settlement of the previously outstanding securities class action litigation, which is the amount inclusive of legal fees and expenses and net of our expected recovery under our D&O insurance is now expected to be paid and settled in Q4 rather than in Q3 as previously expected. The change in timing is due to routine process. Two, the $42 million of free cash flow in Q3 includes the impact of approximately $10 million of cash usage in Q3 for non-recurring tax obligations related to a portion of our employee RSUs that vested in March as expected and mentioned on our last earnings call and caused by the delay in our Q2 10-Q filing. Three, the delay in our Q2 10-Q filing also meant that we paused our ESPP program, delaying an estimated $20 million of net cash outflow related to ESPP, which would normally occur in Q3 to Q4. And four, free cash flow in Q3 was also impacted by approximately $6 million of payments for non-recurring legal and advisory expenses related to the third-party software review. We ended Q3 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.358 billion, up slightly from $1.311 billion in Q2 2023. Moving on to Q4. The guidance for Q4 fiscal 2023 is as follows: ACV billings of $240 million to $250 million, revenue of $470 million to $480 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84% and non-GAAP operating margin of 9% to 10%. Moving on to the full-year outlook with one quarter left. The guidance for fiscal year 2023 is as follows: ACV billings of $915 million to $925 million, a year-over-year growth of 22% at the midpoint of the range; revenue of $1.84 billion to $1.85 billion, a year-over-year growth of 17% at the midpoint; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84%; non-GAAP operating margin of 6% to 7%, a year-over-year improvement of over 10 points of margin at the midpoint; free cash flow of $125 million to $135 million, implying a free cash flow margin of 7% at the midpoint. I will now provide some color on our full-year guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as Rajiv mentioned, and similar to last quarter, we have seen a modest elongation of sales cycles likely due to increased deal inspection. Our fiscal year 2023 new and expansion ACV performance remains impacted by some of these macro dynamics and is performing slightly below our expectations entering the year and what we believe is longer term potential is. We have considered this dynamic in our updated guidance. The renewal business continues to perform well. However, it tends to be at a lower aggregate average contract duration compared to our new and expansion business. Our relative economics on renewals have also continued to improve over time as the renewals team has improved their execution. Second, similar to our comments last quarter, the full-year guidance assumes that contract duration would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year 2022. Third, as stated previously, non-GAAP operating margin outlook for fiscal year 2023 is 6% to 7%. Excluding the one-time expenses related to the third-party software review, this range would have been 7% to 8%. Finally, the updated free cash flow guidance of $125 million to $135 million includes the impact of the following non-recurring items totaling about $65 million. Approximately $10 million of cash usage in Q3 for non-recurring tax obligations related to a portion of our employee RSUs vesting, which is non-recurring because it was due to the delayed filing of our 10-Q. Approximately $31 million in net cash outflow expected in Q4 from the previously mentioned litigation settlement. Approximately $15 million for legal and advisory fees related to the third-party software review across Q3 and Q4. And finally, an $11 million estimated payment in Q4 for the potential resolution with the third-party software vendors. In closing, we are pleased that our Q3 results reflect our continued execution towards our stated objective of sustainable, profitable growth, and we expect to continue that focus. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. And Jim, thanks for the question on NRR. And as you noted, we don't really disclose that on a quarterly basis, Jim. But what I will say is that it's sort of still in the range that I think we had talked about at our last Investor Day in that 121%, 125% range. And so I'll leave it at that with regard to NRR specifically. Thank you, Mike. So first, a question on linearity. So linearity I would say was largely as expected. There wasn't any significant unusual trends compared to typical Q3, Mike? So that's on the linearity. And then on gross margin, what I would say is we continue to be really focused on efficiency and all of that. So in terms of, I think, how sustainable this is, I think, was your question, we think that we will be in that low 80s range, right, maybe move around a little bit. One of the things we are focused on is continuing to make sure that we are attaching professional services where it makes sense, especially for some of the newer parts of our portfolio to make sure customers are adopting them effectively, and we're helping them do so. So it might move around a little bit here and there, but we saw the guide for the full-year as well, which factors in all of those moving pieces at this point. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Pinjalim, for that question. So I'll guide has a few pieces, right. So let me start with I know your question was on revenue. But if I just start with ACV billings here for a second, we did take that guide up as well, right, from 915 to 925 and as you pointed out, we took revenue up as well. So one is that we feel good given all the caveats right, to the point about the modest elongation of sales cycles, in some cases, which you touched upon earlier, I believe, in terms if it's a new logo, we see customers choosing to sort of stretch their assets out a little longer. So some of those dynamics are playing out. But I think a few things that we believe sort of bolsters that overall guidance is our renewals business, as we said from day one from when we started the year, has continued to perform well, right. And with that mix growing over time, that helps us form a pretty strong foundation for the guide overall. And then the one other point I'll make is ACV billings is more of a transactional sort of quarter-over-quarter number, right, if things that are built in the quarter, but revenue obviously flows in as a waterfall over time. So there's also the net revenue benefit we are seeing, and we've talked about this each quarter this year from recognizing more license revenue, right, from the future start date orders than we were deferring which is a boost that seem more on the revenue side than a seed on the billing side. So those are some of the things that are driving that guide, Pinjalim. So we haven't specifically diverse what those assumptions are Pinjalim, but I think it's fair to say that overall, we have seen the supply chain dynamics normalize for our server partners going in, we had assumed that things would be better, right, towards the end of the year, but we hadn't assumed it could be completely normal, right. But at this point, it does seem like those are largely normalized. Thank you. No, that's exactly right, Meta. The underlying OpEx when you back out some of these one-time nonrecurring items that I talked about, relatively stable. I mean, there's some moving pieces, but really small. So you are correct that if you back those out Q3 to Q4 should be relatively stable. Thank you. I'll take that one. Thank you for the question, Wamsi. So I think as we've said from the beginning of this fiscal year, right, both revenue growth and ACV billings have benefited from the strong backlog level with which we entered the year. And revenue, specifically has also benefited from this dynamic of recognition of deferred license revenue from the future start date orders as we've talked about in the past, right? So the full-year results, we expect will reflect a benefit from both of these Wamsi, but just as a software company, we don't typically kind of specify or guide to backlog or anything like that. But yes, entering this year, we did have a record level of backlog, which is benefiting growth for this year on both revenue and ACV billings. Thank you. Hi, Dan. I'll take that question. We have been pretty consistent in our approach. So we haven't necessarily become more or less conservative for Q4 as related to Q3, which I believe was your question. Did I get the question correctly? That is correct. And if I can just take a minute to maybe talk a little bit about Q4 free cash flow, right? So for the full-year, we provided a guide of 125 to 135. And we also said that there is about $65 million of onetime outflow, right? So if you add that, you are now at a $190 million to $200 million free cash flow for the year. And that less the $150-or-so million that we've already done year-to-date would be a reasonable way to think about a normalized Q4 free cash flow with some normal quarter-to-quarter adjustments. And the only thing I would add is we are in contact with both of those vendors at this time and are working towards a commercial resolution."

Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. Against an uncertain macro backdrop, we delivered a solid second quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance and saw continued strong performance in our renewals business. With respect to the macro backdrop, in our second quarter, we continue to see businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and data center modernization initiative enabled by our platform. However, we have seen some increased inspection of deals by customers, which we believe is likely related to the more uncertain macro backdrop, and this is driving a modest elongation in sales cycles. We consider this dynamic in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Supply chain constraints with our several partners improved compared with the prior quarter. I'd like to comment on the investigation mentioned in our press release. We recently discovered that evaluation software from one of our third-party providers was instead being used for interoperability testing, validation and customer proof of concept over a multiyear period. Our Audit Committee commenced an investigation into this matter, which is still ongoing with the assistance of outside counsel. Rukmini will provide more details on the near-term reporting implications of this matter, but I'd like to emphasize that we do not believe it will have a significant impact on the fundamentals of our business and overall prospects. Taking a closer look at the second quarter, we delivered solid top-line growth, including 23% year-over-year ACV billings growth, driven by continued strong performance in our renewals business. We again demonstrated good expense management, which helped us generate $63 million of free cash flow, continuing our strong recent free cash flow performance. Overall, I'm pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter. Our second quarter results reflect the value our customers are seeing in both our core cloud platform and in adjacent solutions in our portfolio with particular strength in Nutanix cloud management. A good example is our largest new customer win in the quarter, which was with a Federal agency looking to modernize their infrastructure. They replaced their legacy 3-tier environment with Nutanix's cloud platform, including Nutanix cloud management, to run their business-critical applications, leveraging its simplicity and building automation for Infrastructure as a Service. They also added Nutanix unified storage to service their unstructured data needs. We see this as a good example of a customer adopting our full stack offering to modernize and automate their IT infrastructure. Another notable win in the quarter was with the bank in the APAC region, who had been running a key business-critical applications in the public cloud on Red Hat's OpenShift. However, they were having performance issues and were unhappy with the incident response times of their public cloud service providers. So following an evaluation of multiple on-prem and public cloud options, the customer chose to run OpenShift and their critical applications on-prem on the Nutanix cloud platform, including our AHV hypervisors, concluding that it was the alternative that could deliver the best performance and total cost of ownership. This deal reinforces our view that cloud is an operating model, not a destination and that our Nutanix cloud platform is ideally suited to enabling the hybrid multi-cloud operating model, increasingly favored by IT professionals. Following the general availability of NC2 on Microsoft Azure late in our first quarter, we saw solid momentum with NC2 in the second quarter. A good example is a win we had with an EMEA headquartered provider of global transportation services, looking to accelerate their migration to the public cloud, reduce their data center footprint and optimize their public cloud spend. Following a rigorous evaluation of alternatives, including native public cloud, this customer chose NC2 on Azure, which they found enabled a roughly 4x faster migration, lower migration costs and significantly lower operating costs. This win demonstrates how our customers appreciate the ability to rapidly and seamlessly shift their workloads from their private clouds to the largest public cloud provider with the consistent management, governance and data services provided by the Nutanix cloud platform without the time and expense of refactoring their workloads and with lower ongoing operating costs. On the product front, during the second quarter, we delivered meaningful upgrades to our core platform with the release of AOS 6.6, which offers enhanced data services and a number of networking and security-related features, further strengthening its capabilities to support business-critical applications. In closing, I'd like to provide some thoughts on our priorities and outlook. First, our overarching priority remains delivering sustainable, profitable growth through judicious investment in the business, execution on a growing base of renewals and diligent expense management. Our strong free cash flow, along with solid top-line growth in the second quarter, reflects the progress we made to date towards this objective. While the macro environment remains uncertain, we are encouraged that the strength of our business model underpinned by a growing base of renewals and our ongoing focus on profitability, allow us to raise our fiscal year top-line outlook and reaffirm our free cash flow outlook. I remain confident in our ability to continue to capitalize on the vast opportunity in front of us while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman : Thank you, Rajiv. I would first like to note that with respect to the investigation Rajiv mentioned, we are in the process of assessing the financial reporting impact, and it is likely that additional costs would be incurred to address the use cases previously noted. As a result, we have not provided financial information regarding expenses in our second quarter preliminary results or our outlook for the third quarter or full fiscal year 2023. While we are working diligently to address this matter and finalize our financials as soon as possible, we do not expect to be able to file our 10-Q on time or following the 5-day prescribed extension period allowed under 12b-25. Relatedly, we are rescheduling our Investor Day we had intended to hold on April 4, 2023 to summer of 2023 and will provide a specific date once it is confirmed. With that said, I will now move on to talk through our Q2 results, followed by our outlook for Q3; and then finally, provide an update on our fiscal year '23 outlook. Q2 '23 was a solid quarter with results that came in better than our guidance. ACV billings in Q2 was $268 million, higher than our guidance of $245 million to $250 million and representing a year-over-year growth of 23%. The significant majority of that growth came from growth in renewals billings. Revenue in Q2 was $486 million, higher than our guidance of $460 million to $470 million and a year-over-year growth rate of 18%. ARR at the end of Q2 was $1.378 billion, a year-over-year growth of 32%. New logo additions were about 480 in Q2. Contract duration stayed flat quarter-over-quarter at three years as expected.  As described previously, the percentage of orders with future start dates likely due to partner supply chain constraints continue to be a key assumption in our Q2 guidance. This percentage came in lower than it was in Q1 '23 and below our expectations. Q2 revenue also benefited approximately $11 million from the improvement in percentage of future start dates as more license revenue was recognized in quarter than deferred, slightly more than the $10 million estimate we had provided on our last earnings call. Billings linearity was good, and DSOs were 28 days in Q2. Free cash flow in Q2 was $63 million, implying record free cash flow margin of 13%. A couple of additional notes on Q2: One, we retired the remaining principal amount on our January 2023 convertible notes of approximately $146 million with cash from the balance sheet. Two, last month, we reached an agreement to settle the outstanding securities class actions litigation, which is subject to documentation, notice to class members and court approval. We recorded a net charge of approximately $38 million for the settlement. This is the amount, inclusive of legal fees and expenses, net of our expected recovery under our D&O insurance. We expect approximately $33 million to be paid and settled in Q3, while the remainder was already paid for legal defense costs in previous quarters. We ended Q2 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.311 billion, down slightly from $1.388 billion in Q1 '23. Moving on to Q3 outlook. The guidance for Q3 '23 is as follows: ACV billings of $220 million to $225 million and revenue of $430 million to $440 million.  I'll now provide some more context around our guidance. First, the top-line guidance for Q3 assumes that supply chain dynamics for our server partners would remain more or less the same compared to Q2 '23. It also assumes that contract durations would stay approximately flat to slightly down in Q3 '23 compared to Q2 '23. Second, the revenue guidance includes approximately $5 million of revenue benefit from the decline in percentage of orders with future start dates over the last few months. Said differently, we expect to recognize more license revenue in Q3 than is deferred, similar to the dynamic we saw in Q2. Over time, as our partner supply chain constraints resolves and our future start date percentages normalize, we would expect this dynamic to normalize as well. I will now provide an update on our full year 2023 guidance. We have had a solid first half and our renewals business continues to provide a strong foundation for growth and efficiency. Those factors, combined with our continued focus on disciplined expense management, allow us to raise our ACV billings and revenue outlook for the year while reaffirming our prior free cash flow outlook. Our updated guidance for full year fiscal year '23 is as follows: ACV billings of $905 million to $915 million, year-over-year growth of 20% at the midpoint; revenue guidance of $1.8 billion to $1.81 billion, year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint; and free cash flow of $100 million to $125 million.  I'll now provide some additional color on our full year guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as Rajiv mentioned, we have seen a modest elongation of sales cycles likely due to increased deal inspection. We have considered this dynamic in our updated guidance. We continue to expect that the significant majority of our growth in ACV billings for fiscal year '23 will come from growth in renewals ACV billings with the uncertainty in the macro environment factored into our expectations for new and expansion ACV billings. A reminder that ACV billings for the full year is not simply the summation of four quarters ACV billings because of deals with less than one year in contract duration. We expect that full year ACV billings is discounted by approximately 5% relative to the sum of ACV billings from the four quarters.  Second, similar to our comments last quarter, the full year guidance assumes that contract durations would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year '22. The fiscal year '23 revenue guidance also assumes that the percentage of orders with future start dates would ease slightly in the second half of the fiscal year compared to the first half.  Third, the reaffirmed free cash flow guidance of $100 million to $125 million includes the impact of approximately $33 million in net cash outflow expected in Q3 from the previously mentioned litigation settlement. It also includes the impact of approximately $12 million of cash usage in Q3 for nonrecurring tax obligations related to a portion of our employee RSUs vesting this month and other anticipated cash outflows. These cash outflows were not included in our prior guidance for annual fiscal year '23 free cash flow.  Finally, I'd like to note that we continue to expect to generate at least $300 million of free cash flow in fiscal year 2025. In closing, we are pleased that our Q2 results reflect our continued execution towards our stated objective of sustainable, profitable growth, and we expect to continue that focus. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora : Congrats. It seems like a pretty good quarter. I just wanted to go back to the investigation that you were talking about. Could you maybe explain it in a little bit of a leaner what happened exactly? And it sounds like it's like an underpayment to a vendor. Am I understanding it right? Or what -- help us understand a little bit in less legal terms.\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. Let me start and Rukmini, you can explain the details here, right? But the one thing -- the first thing I want to say is that the fundamentals of our business are unchanged. So this matter doesn't impact our market opportunity or the demand for our solutions. And we are working diligently to resolve it as quickly as possible, and we are very focused on driving sustainable profitable growth. Now with respect to that specific matter, Rukmini, maybe you can just explain the details behind it and what we're doing.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Sure. Yes. Pinjalim. So what we discovered was that certain eval software, evaluation software, from one of our third-party providers, so somebody who provides us software, which is intended for evaluation purposes was instead used for validation, interoperable, testing and proof of concept over a multiyear period. So that is a -- we discovered that, and as we said on the call, that matter is ongoing. And because of that Pinjalim, we weren't able to disclose expense information on the call, and we've announced that we expect to be unable to file our 10-Q in a timely manner, given that we want to make sure this is resolved first.  Now I want to also provide a little bit of color that we are -- given this, we still believe that our top-line results, our free cash flow as we reported it, are all unimpacted by this. And when we look forward to guidance, we are pleased to be able to raise our revenue and ACV billings guide, and we're comfortable with the $100 million to $125 million of free cash flow guidance for the year after factoring in the potential impact from this third-party software use that we mentioned on the call. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, the free cash flow guidance also includes the impact of the $33 million approximately from the settlement of the litigation and the impact of this $12 million of cash usage in Q3 for nonrecurring tax obligations related to employee RSUs vesting. And these cash outflows were not included in our prior guidance for the full year free cash flow.\nPinjalim Bora : Yes. Understood. And Rajiv, we had -- with some of our discussions with some of your partners seem to suggest that the VMware opportunity is taking shape. But I wanted to ask you, one of the discussions kind of highlighted that just the complexity of some very large VMware customers using tens of thousands of VMs, who might be looking at Nutanix as an alternative. It's just complex to kind of move from one to the other, of course. So I wanted to ask you, what can Nutanix do or what are you doing to kind of make those large companies feel a little bit at you to kind of move those large VMware environments over to Nutanix? And how has those -- some of those discussions have been progressing?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Absolutely. As you can imagine, Pinjalim, we are engaged with many of these customers right now. We have a significantly higher level of engagement. A lot of these are prospective customers that aren't existing ones, and they're all looking to explore their options and manage these potential risks related to the acquisition. What you should keep in mind is, for many, many years, we've been doing these things. We've been doing these migrations. In many cases, when we go out there, we insert our solution on top of a VMware platform, right? Customers are running vSphere, we go in there and we insert AOS, which is our software-defined storage. And over time, customers may choose to use our own hypervisor AHV, instead of the VMware hypervisor. So we have a lot of experience with doing migrations for our customers. Now the large is the environment, the more complex it is and we know that. And typically, we will do this one workload at a time, for example. They will pick us for one use case and then over time, we will expand and other use cases. Historically, it used to be in the computing, but these days, we do databases. We do all mission-critical workloads, all of this. So we have a lot of experience doing these migrations. That said, Pinjalim, I think what you heard -- yes, this is complex, it's going to take time, and this is why we are not factoring in any significant benefit in our fiscal '23 outlook. We expect these cycles to be long, typically nine, 12 months for some of the larger deals.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJim Fish : I wanted to build off the last couple of questions, actually. Maybe could you talk about the push-pull effect you're seeing with the demand environment given that ability to consolidate the competitive landscape, especially on the VMware side and maybe even the traditional storage perspective as well as just the HCI market against those traditional storage guys versus the general macro environment. It sounds like, Rajiv, you're talking about an increased lengthening of deal cycles. Is there a way to think about how much longer deals are also taking? So net of my question is, what are you seeing for the push-pull on all these kind of factors on demand? And is there a way to quantify how much longer these deals are taking?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. Jim, indeed, there is a push and pull on this, as you say. So first on the macro. We see strong performance from our renewals and that's been continuing. And of course, that helps reduce the risk in our business model and the guide that we put out there. Now we have taken into account the current macro environment. As you say, right, in terms of the impact that we are seeing, we have been seeing greater inspection. Now what I would say is, what that means is, very -- I would say, so far, it has been a modest increase in the average sales cycle, right? The time it takes to close the deal goes up a bit, and we're seeing this across both in new logos or new customers and existing customers looking to expand, right? They're just being a little bit more careful, taking some more time to review the economics of everything and looking at the TCO benefits.  Now that said, we do have strong TCO benefits that typically compared to legacy infrastructure. So when you look at the dynamics vis-a-vis the second piece of it, which is compared to third party or legacy 3-tier storage, I think those dynamics are largely the same. When there is, for example, time for a refresh or any kind of modernization effort, the customers compare HCI versus 3-tier, and then able to show a better TCO, a much more modern ability for them to go build a cloud platform. And that dynamic hasn't really changed. Clearly, the VMware dynamics certainly will help in the long term, but not in the short term. But in the short term, what I would say, is increase the level of engagement. So there's clearly a push and pull. We have the -- to summarize, we've got the renewals business that provides a foundation. On the new business, small elongation and deal cycles.  On the other side, we're seeing more engagement from a VMware basis. And so we've tried to do our best to factor in all of these dynamics into the guide that we gave you.\nJim Fish : That's helpful. Impressive on the free cash flow beat this quarter. Just trying to make sure here, how much of this was driven by essentially the operations versus working capital numbers and really underneath, we're trying to understand where OpEx would have kind of come in, barring any of these added expense issues and Rukmini, sorry to layer on here, but you just had mentioned the free cash flow outlook included the potential impact of this investigation. Does that also assume the catch-up potential?\nRukmini Sivaraman : Thank you, Jim. All good questions. So let me try to parse that. So as I said in my remarks, Jim, we are not commenting on expense -- expenses either for Q2 or on a forward-looking basis. So I'll stop there. But in terms of free cash flow, right, for Q2, as you said, we're happy with the free cash flow performance in Q2. And I will just say that I think we talked about DSOs on the call, right, which was 28 days. It was unusually low in Q1, and we saw it kind of come back to, I would say, within the range, right, in Q2 because typically, our payment terms for DSOs are 30 to 45 days. And so I would expect it to be sort of in that area. Now to your second question, so yes, we are comfortable with our full year $100 million to $125 million free cash flow guidance, Jim, including the potential impact from -- arising from this matter, right, related to the third-party software use that we mentioned on the call and the other sort of items around the $33 million for the settlement and the onetime $12 million tax obligations we discussed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Company.\nMike Cikos: I did have a couple of questions. Just to circle back to the Audit Committee, and I want to make sure that everyone had this right. So this investigation that we have right now is totally independent of the -- I'm not sure I'm getting the numbers right now, the anticipated expense in 3Q that you had cited regarding a $33 million for the litigation settlement, correct?\nRukmini Sivaraman : That's correct, Mike.\nMike Cikos : And so if I look at the audit investigation specifically, can you provide us like when was the issue discovered? When did the Audit Committee commenced its investigation? When did Nutanix engaged outside counsel? I'd just like to see if we can get a time line for how these events are playing out under the hood? Again, just because we have this limited guidance that we're being provided today.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Yes. Thank you, Mike, for the question. If I understand that there's limited guidance here, Mike, and we -- what I can say is that given this review is ongoing, what we can say is that we are working diligently, right, with the Audit Committee and our outside counsel to resolve this as quickly as possible so we can be in a position to share more with you. At this point, we're not able to kind of provide very specific timelines to your question, but we are working diligently to make sure we are resolving this appropriately and in a timely manner.\nMike Cikos : And I just wanted to see -- like one of the things I'm struggling with on my side, and again, it's probably just a misunderstanding on all of the legal comportment that are involved here. But I know that you guys are saying that this third-party provider was using software for evaluate. I don't want to butcher it, but I think it was supposed to be\u2026\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, let me try\u2026\nMike Cikos : Yes, and I'm trying to see, is there an impact on revenue as a result of this? Or is it entirely expense base? Because again, I'm trying to get it like, is there potential for this in any way to impact your top-line results? Like you're giving us the revenue and ACV billings guide, is that untouched by this investigation at this point? And then the follow-up is like, how is it we don't have the expenses here, but you guys are able to refer the free cash flow. I think that's what I'm wrestling on my side. And I apologize for the long-winded question, but I just want to make sure I'm being clear.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Yes. Thank you, Mike. So let me try and clarify some of those pieces. So you are correct that we do not believe that this matter has any impact on our topline metrics, specifically revenue, ACV billings, which as you point out, we've disclosed and we're guiding to. So that's one part of it. And in terms of just -- sorry, what was the second part of your question? Mike, I think there was one more question after that.\nMike Cikos : Yes. Yes. So...\nRukmini Sivaraman : On free cash flow, I think, right? Yes.\nMike Cikos : Exactly. Exactly.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Correct. Yes. Sorry about that. So I think on free cash flow, we reported Q2 free cash flow, right? Like that's the $63 million that we reported out. Now for the full year, I think this is important. So I'm glad you asked the question, Mike, that we are comfortable with the $100 million to $125 million free cash flow for the year after factoring in a potential impact from this third-party software use that we mentioned on the call and the two other items, right? So $33 million, which as you said, a separate matter from a previously outstanding litigation settlement. So that's $33 million that was not factored in before, and this $12 million of cash usage in Q3 for nonrecurring tax obligations related to a portion of our employee RSUs vesting this month.\nMike Cikos : Okay. Okay. And then maybe, again, this is just me being naive here. There was phrase it how you will, but again, I just want to make sure, with the third-party provider, like how were they supposed to be using the software versus what we're seeing today as far as its interoperability testing? Again, I just want to make sure I'm aware of like the different nuances here for what's causing this investigation in the first place.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Yes. Understood, Mike. So let me -- so what -- this is the software that we were using from a third-party software provider. It was evaluation software intended to be used for evaluation purposes, and instead, it was being used by us for interoperability testing, validation and proofs of concept. So that is the matter that's being reviewed right now.\nMike Cikos : I see. And so because you -- it was intended for evaluation, but instead you guys were using it for interoperability testing and validation because of the different usage of that software, there's potentially a different cost for what you had been paying that provider. Is that a very simple way of putting that? I know I'm probably mischaracterizing a lot of that.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Yes.\nMike Cikos : Okay. Okay.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Yes, that's right, Mike. So yes, it's intended to be used for evaluation software, and we discovered that was instead being used for these other inoperability, validation and proof of concept, and so that's what's under review right now.\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. And I'd just say one thing there, Rukmini, and what this means, therefore, there might be some additional expense, right, in terms of using usage of that.\nRukmini Sivaraman : That's correct.\nRajiv Ramaswami : So that's why we are -- until we have -- this is done, we can't really specifically give you expenses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall : Maybe one question for me or first question for me just on kind of the beat and better outlook. I'm just trying to get a sense of the blend of how much of that is from earlier renewals? And then how much of that is from the future less future start dates kind of moving in? So just trying to get a sense of kind of what the various contributors to the upside were? And then maybe just a second question, not to belabor the point, but just is there a way to contextualize like in fiscal year '22 just how much payments were to this vendor just to kind of get a sense of why you have confidence that even with an increase in those payments, you would still be able to kind of meet the free cash flow target that you laid out.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Thank you for the question, Meta. So let me take that one by one. So I think your first question was around just the raise for the full year, right, and what contributed to that. So I mean, clearly, in Q2, we beat both on ACV billings and on revenue, right? And so I think that certainly makes us feel more comfortable raising the guide for the full year.  On the revenue piece, we did try to provide some color for you in the prepared remarks around the percentage of future start dates. So that does have an impact. So you saw it had about $11 million impact in Q2. And for Q3, we expect that to be about $5 million more of license revenue that gets recognized in quarter versus deferred. And so there was some of that effect factored in, Meta, to your question on the full year. And I think on renewals, as Rajiv has said and I emphasize this too that our renewal business is doing well, and so that, again, continues to underpin the significant majority of our growth and lowers the risk somewhat given all of that is based on deals that we've already done that are coming up for renewal. Now I think the second part of your question was whether we'd be able to quantify some of these payments, and we are not able to provide any specific quantification on that at this point, Meta, given the review is ongoing. But as I said before, we are continuing to work diligently to try and get this dissolved.\nMeta Marshall : Okay. Got it. I mean just maybe following up on the renewal piece. Clearly, those are doing well, but just maybe in the past quarters, early renewals have been a greater contributor to upside. So just -- I'm just trying to get a sense if there's no early renewal component that we should be thinking of here as well.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Yes. I would say, it's not outside the norm, Meta. So anything we've discussed before, we typically do go to our customers as a lot of other vendors do as well, about even 6 months advance of the renewal date to begin those discussions. So there will be some timing movements here and there. We do some co-terming like most subscription vendors do. So -- but nothing outside of the normal or what we would expect that contributed to renewals.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.\nBen Bollin : I wanted to circle back a little bit on the renewals. Could you speak to how much of the footprint was up for renewal or is up for renewal in fiscal '23? And how that develops into fiscal '24? And then I had a follow-up.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Hi, Ben, thanks for the question. Yes. So we haven't quite provided kind of a percentage almost of ARR, right, that's up for renewal, I think, is your question. So we haven't quite quantified that, Ben, but I will say that overall, given where we are in our journey, right, really all we sell now is subscription software, term licensing software other than professional services, which is a small portion of the overall business. So -- and our renewals are starting to flow in, right? So we do expect to see kind of continued growth in that base of renewals as we layer on kind of the additional trims that we -- urgent software that we have sold over time, right? So I would say that is a growing base of renewals, but we haven't provided a specific number or a percentage of ARR that's up in this year.\nBen Bollin : Okay. And then the other item. When I look at the billings targets into 3Q and the fiscal year, it implies a pretty notable acceleration into 4Q. What are you seeing that drives that acceleration following what you're guiding to in 3Q and then what you're expecting in 4Q? That\u2019s it. Thank you.\nRukmini Sivaraman : So I think a few things. So when you say acceleration, did you mean growth? I think a couple of things, I would say, Ben, right? So typically, our Q4 seasonally is a better quarter for us than Q3 is, and that's because it's the end of the fiscal year for us and so that is expected. We also have -- last year, our Q4 ACV billings provides a bit of a -- somewhat of an easier comp given some of the dynamics that were happening in Q4 of last year. But I think from -- when you look at the guidance for the Q3 ACV billings and quarter-over-quarter, what's implied for Q4, it's, I would say, within the range of what we would expect from Q3 to Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC.\nMatthew Hedberg : You guys are coming up, I believe, about on the one-year anniversary from when you had some sales attrition issues last year. It feels like a long time ago now. I'm wondering, though, if you could talk about just how general attrition levels stand today? And maybe sort of kind of overall hiring plans for the remainder of the year?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. I can take that, Matt. So in general, by the way, the environment has gotten a lot better over the last year from a hiring perspective as well as the retention given what's happening out there in the markets, both with respect to other large tech companies as well as a lot of the start-ups that our people were potentially going to, right? So from that situation, I think things have gotten a lot better.  Now to your question on the sales front specifically, we are doing -- again, every quarter, we've been seeing repatriation -- retention improve actually quarter-over-quarter. And our rep headcount has been roughly flat. We do expect in FY '23 to grow our rep count modestly from where we're at. And at the same time, of course, we are very focused on continuing to drive higher rep productivity.\nMatthew Hedberg : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then congrats on the -- on that large Federal agency win. Maybe just kind of expand the aperture a bit and just talk about sort of like public sector spend in general, how much of a driver has that been for you? And how do you expect that can continue from here?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. So first of all, I'll just say, in the U.S. -- by the way, we only have two verticals. One is public sector and the other is healthcare. So public sector is clearly very important for us. We are well penetrated into public sector across both civilian, defense, government agencies across the board as well as state, local education. So it's a very important market. That's why we have a vertical presence in it targeted at that market. And I would say, it continues to be a very solid source of business for us. We continue to drive their modernization efforts. We are fairly broadly deployed, but we see continued opportunities there as well. So it's a good and very important sector for us with continued spending. Now of course, they have their budget cycles, as you know, every year, right? I mean depending on certain quarters where for the year-end, we tend to see a bump in the public sector sales during that quarter. But that's -- again, it's all as usual, I would say.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers : I have got two as well, if I can. I just wanted to maybe first ask about the ACV piece of the guidance. I know that you talked about the macro dynamics, but looking at the high end of the guidance range, it's still down about 15% or 16% sequential. I know you also talked about possibly a slight decline in duration. So I'm curious, that's definitely below what seasonalities look like over the last couple of years. Is that all just macro? Is there something else that you're factoring in or maybe quantify kind of that slight possible decline in duration? Just trying to unpack that guidance for ACV this quarter.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Sure. Thank you, Aaron. So yes, we were happy to be able to raise both revenue and ACV billings guidance. And you're right, Aaron, that sort of half over half, I guess, it does imply a decline in ACV billings like second half over first half. And I would say, one is what you've already pointed out and which we talked about, which is this modest elongation in sales cycles that we -- there was anecdotal in Q1. We saw it. We saw a modest elongation in Q2. And so we have factored in, as I mentioned in my remarks, to write some conservatism as it relates specifically to the new and expansion portion about the ACV, but ACV billings portion, right, of the overall guide. So there's definitely that. And if you look at a year-over-year growth rate, I think there's still a meaningful growth rate year-over-year for the second half. So that's kind of how we are thinking about the ACV guidance for the full year and implied second half.\nAaron Rakers : Yes, very, very helpful. And then on the free cash flow -- and I apologize for going back to this, but if you look at the first half of the year, you did about $109 million of free cash flow. If I take the adjustments that you've quantified factoring into, let's just call it, the midpoint of that $100 million to $125 million, factor back in the $33 million and the $12 million that you talked about is still a particularly large decline relative to the first half. So I understand that there's an unquantified element to this investigation dynamic. So I guess the question is, is there anything changing within the free cash flow dynamics, be it working capital that's changed in the back half of your guidance relative to what you saw in the first half? I'm just trying to understand why free cash flow second half versus first half down aside from just those factors that you outlined.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Good question, Aaron, and thank you for asking a clarification question, right? So first is, I think as we sort of you just pointed out, actually, we do expect to see lower billings and revenue in the second half which does have an impact, as you can imagine, billings does have a direct impact on free cash flow. And then I think you've done the math right around just the items that we pointed out, and as we said, it does factor in the potential impact from the use of this third-party software as well, which we are not quantifying at this point. So that's how to think about the full year free cash flow guide. We don't anticipate sort of any significant material changes to working capital or anything like that for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair.\nJason Ader : I wanted to ask just, I think, it may be confusing for folks on this third-party evaluation software. I think that -- I think people may be wondering, evaluation of what? What are you guys evaluating with that software?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. Maybe I'll give you some color, right? So eval software has meant for eval view, right? So you go try it. You go try it out for whatever you're using it for you try out, and then at some point, we purchase it. What we found was, in some cases, we were using the reval software for doing interoperability testing or customer proof of concepts, validating. So that goes beyond the scope of what the eval software was being used for.\nJason Ader : So the eval software, were you paying a very small amount because it was just eval software, and therefore, now you're going to have to pay a lot more because you were using it for things that it wasn't meant for. Is that the idea?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So we haven't quantified how much, right? But we can't get into that kind of detail here, but yes, you're right, right? I mean, therefore, there is some additional expense required likely to -- for the usage and use cases that we were looking at.\nJason Ader : Okay. Great. And then another question for you, Rajiv, just on this whole cloud versus on-prem debate. Specifically, are you seeing any slowdown in the migration of workloads to the cloud because of recent customer cost sensitivity just in this environment that we've been in over the last 6 months or so?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. In fact, we gave you an example of a repatriation in our prepared remarks here. Definitely, we are seeing -- especially in many areas of the world now, customers are much, much more cost sensitive in terms of looking at the cloud, the public cloud in particular and saying, when should I go to the public cloud and for what? And they're starting to look at -- this whole cloud economics is a very important part. So in the example that we showed, for example, this customer is actually running a production workload in the public cloud because of mission-critical workload, and they decided to migrate it on-prem because they could get a better TCO. They could also get better support experience and response sense from vendors by doing so. So we're seeing that definitely being much more nuanced now. It's not going -- not taking everything you have in going to the public cloud. It's being much more nuanced about what you put where and what is it going to cost you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold : I wanted to see if you could maybe address the elongation of decision process, whether or not there's variation in this behavior between existing customers and new customers? Or whether you're seeing any kind of patterns by customer types, verticals or something discernible like that? And then I've got a very quick follow-up.\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes, Simon, that's a good question. I don't think we have that level of visibility because a lot of this is somewhat anecdotal, and we've seen it for both new and for existing customers, right? Clearly, for us, typically in the past, expansion in existing customers is generally easier and quicker compared to new, right, net new prospects. But we are seeing an elongation in deal for both, and it's -- but I will also say, it's a very modest elongation at this point. So it's just that, for example, just anecdotally, well, something that a VP may have budget for at a VP level and say, yes, I'm going to go ahead and do it. Now with being scrutinized at the CFO level, say, okay, do you really have to go spend this money now? Can you wait? Is there a TCO benefit that you can quantify for me quickly? So that's the kind of, I think, dynamics that we are seeing. It's hard to parse out specifically as it varies a lot by customers, but we're seeing this as both new and for expansion.\nSimon Leopold : And then just a quick one is, on this third-party software issue, do you have insight into whether or not this affects your cost of goods sold or the R&D line? Or you just don't know that yet? I guess I'm sort of trying to figure out where these charges would show up.\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman : Thank you, Simon. Yes, at this point, given this is ongoing, Simon, we're not able to get more specific on the types of expenses or where the P&L, it might fall.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya : I'm filling in for Wamsi Mohan today. Rukmini, one question for you real quick. Just to clarify on the third-party software issue, do you think that this impacts the historical last couple of years' financials? And will you be restating your financials? And maybe does this impact margins lower and earnings lower? And will you be restating that when you file your statements?\nRukmini Sivaraman : Thank you for the question, Ruplu. Again, this is -- this review is ongoing, and so we really can't comment on any of that, Ruplu, but we are working quickly and diligently to make sure we're able to provide more clarity on all of this. But at this point, there's really nothing more I can add on the specifics.\nRuplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Okay. Maybe one for Rajiv. You talked about customers inspecting deals more and a slight modest increase in the sales cycle. When I look at the new customer adds, right, this quarter, it was like 490, which really is the lowest quarter for new adds going back to 2017. So can you talk about like any thoughts on that? I mean on that -- on the lower number of net adds this quarter, any competitive dynamics you're seeing? Or could this also -- any thoughts on FX because you price in dollars and with the dollar strengthening recently, how is the pricing environment? And are you having to price lower? So just your thoughts on the number of new ads and the competitive dynamics that you're seeing and then pricing.\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. I'll talk about two of those, and I'll let Rukmini comment on FX. But first of all, we are focusing on higher quality, higher ASP new logos, more so than new logo comp. So we want to make sure that when we get -- when we put our efforts to go winning a new logo, we make the count, right, much more so and provides us a bigger deal, drives up our sales productivity and also provides more expansion opportunities. So that's been our focus more so than the new logo count. The new logo count shows up in terms of what it is. It's more of a result rather than a number that we are trying to focus on in terms of trying to hit a new logo target. The second thing I would say is, our -- we are very much holding up our prices, right? Unit prices have remained very stable, and they're not going down in any way. And then the third part of it, in terms of FX, Rukmini, perhaps you can comment.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Yes. So Ruplu, your question, I think, was that given that we denominate all of our transaction in U.S. dollars, is it effectively a price increase? Which it is in some parts of the world, right, where the dollar has strengthened. And so what we're seeing is, this is anecdotal, right? In some cases, we've seen it sort of put some pressure on the timing of some transactions, especially in the emerging markets. But overall, I think to Rajiv's point, our unit economics and our overall pricing is in a good place. And so we haven't seen a sort of significant or systematic impact on that from any of these drivers.\nRuplu Bhattacharya : Okay. If I can sneak one quick one in backlog was very high coming into this fiscal year. Did you also reduce backlog in the quarter? And what's the expectation for backlog for the rest of the year?\nRukmini Sivaraman : Thank you for the question, Ruplu. So on backlog, yes, you're right. When we entered this fiscal year at the end of July, we did say that we had record levels of backlog, and we expect during the course of the year to use that backlog over time to get to a more normalized level by the end of the year. We did use some backlog in Q2 in line with our expectations, and again, we expect that we will continue to consume that over the course of the rest of this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Wang with Barclays.\nGeorge Wang : Congrats on the quarter. Just maybe you can, Rajiv, kind of unpack kind of service provider channel, any kind of update you have. Last quarter, you talked about the SP channel as a new sort of area to kind of land new customers. So just curious if you have any kind of updates on this?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes, I think, George, we are certainly very excited about that route to market because we are relatively new in terms of our using this route to market for us. So it's a growing business opportunity for us. Last quarter, we said, the largest deal in the quarter was done through that SP channel. And it's still -- we're still in the very early stages in that innings there, and we continue to build up our service provider partners. We're trying to enhance the product capabilities to provide a very as broad an offering as possible. So we have -- so it's a continued -- it's a journey, and it's going to take us multiple quarters for it to start becoming a significant chunk of our business. Right now, it's still a small portion of our overall business.\nGeorge Wang : Okay. I have to create a follow-up. Just in terms of the AHV kind of your own hypervisor this quarter is 63% mix, up 2 points sequentially. Can you give some color just on the traction of your own sort of hypervisor? And how are you seeing in terms of the migration kind of customer reception?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Absolutely. And I would say, it's becoming more and more important now in the context of the whole VMware-Broadcom acquisition as well. Now for us, it's always been a blend. We would like to see, of course, more customers using AHV, okay? On the one side, which, of course, will mean that our AHV as a percentage of our workload keeps going up. But at the same time, we see there's a huge opportunity in terms of us inserting into other hypervisor footprints. And in fact, that's the default. It used to be -- if you go back many years ago, that was our default. We would insert it into somebody else's hypervisor environment, like a hypervisor. So we want to continue that because there's still a huge opportunity there.  So the model with customers has been, in some cases, we will go and start on top of a third-party hypervisor with the rest of our solution stack. So our software-defined storage, for example. And then over time, they will choose to migrate some of that to AHV. We also have a dynamic where in many new customers, they go all in with AHV from day one as well. So we have both those dynamics, and we want to maintain a balance of both because we do want to, of course, have customers on our own hypervisor and sell them the full stack solution. But at the same time, we want to be able to go after those customers that have other hypervisors and be able to insert into their environment as well. So I'd say -- so that's the blend that we're trying to get comfortable with, but overall, it continues to mature. More and more customers using it. Ecosystem is being becoming broader and broader. We have third-party certifications like Red Hat and others on it now. So it's becoming, let's call it, ready for all mission-critical workloads at this point.\nOperator: Due to the interest of time, our final question comes from the line of Thomas Blakey with KeyBanc.\nThomas Blakey : Nice quarter. I just wanted to maybe just simplify a lot of the questions that were asked about renewal trends. I mean it's very important for hitting some longer-term free cash flow targets. Could you just speak to the trend? No numbers in fiscal '22, fiscal '23. What you're seeing from a renewal opportunity in fiscal '24 to fiscal '25 to hit those targets? Is the trend moving in the right direction? And just start there.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Tom, thanks for the question. So look, I think we've emphasized a few times and I'm happy to, I think, clarify I think for you, Tom. It's a good question on just the overall renewals work stream. We've talked about how it's a driver both of our growth and efficiency, and it continues to perform well. And yes, we do believe it's going in the right direction, not just for fiscal year '23, as we talked about in majority of growth coming in, in '23, but also more generally, right? And that's why we did mention that we reiterate our sort of $300 million-plus free cash flow number for '25, and so we continue to believe that, that thesis still holds.\nThomas Blakey : And given the commentary around the macro, maybe a downtick in my opinion from what I'm hearing from the last couple of quarter calls here and combined with the solid results. Can we get some feedback in terms of what maybe the higher kind of net dollar retention rate was on some of these renewals? What are -- where are those numbers up? And what was driving that?\nRukmini Sivaraman : Right. So I think if your question on NRR, our net dollar-based retention rate metric, Tom? Is that the question?\nThomas Blakey : Yes. From the renewals, yes.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Yes. So thank you for that. So I think I want to first clarify that when we talk about renewals billings, we're purely talking only about renewals, right? It does not factor in any of the expansion that is factored into our new and expansion portion, right? That's sort of incremental ACV. NRR, to your point on, we don't actually disclose on a quarterly basis. So what I will say, though, is if we look back to our last Investor Day, we had given some ranges in that 120 to 125-ish percent sort of range, and it is still in that in that range in terms of the NRR number. And so yes, and as we've also talked about how for new and expansion is where we are baking in some caution as it relates to the full year guide, given what we're seeing in the business.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. Against an uncertain macro backdrop, we delivered a solid second quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance and saw continued strong performance in our renewals business. With respect to the macro backdrop, in our second quarter, we continue to see businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and data center modernization initiative enabled by our platform. However, we have seen some increased inspection of deals by customers, which we believe is likely related to the more uncertain macro backdrop, and this is driving a modest elongation in sales cycles. We consider this dynamic in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Supply chain constraints with our several partners improved compared with the prior quarter. I'd like to comment on the investigation mentioned in our press release. We recently discovered that evaluation software from one of our third-party providers was instead being used for interoperability testing, validation and customer proof of concept over a multiyear period. Our Audit Committee commenced an investigation into this matter, which is still ongoing with the assistance of outside counsel. Rukmini will provide more details on the near-term reporting implications of this matter, but I'd like to emphasize that we do not believe it will have a significant impact on the fundamentals of our business and overall prospects. Taking a closer look at the second quarter, we delivered solid top-line growth, including 23% year-over-year ACV billings growth, driven by continued strong performance in our renewals business. We again demonstrated good expense management, which helped us generate $63 million of free cash flow, continuing our strong recent free cash flow performance. Overall, I'm pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter. Our second quarter results reflect the value our customers are seeing in both our core cloud platform and in adjacent solutions in our portfolio with particular strength in Nutanix cloud management. A good example is our largest new customer win in the quarter, which was with a Federal agency looking to modernize their infrastructure. They replaced their legacy 3-tier environment with Nutanix's cloud platform, including Nutanix cloud management, to run their business-critical applications, leveraging its simplicity and building automation for Infrastructure as a Service. They also added Nutanix unified storage to service their unstructured data needs. We see this as a good example of a customer adopting our full stack offering to modernize and automate their IT infrastructure. Another notable win in the quarter was with the bank in the APAC region, who had been running a key business-critical applications in the public cloud on Red Hat's OpenShift. However, they were having performance issues and were unhappy with the incident response times of their public cloud service providers. So following an evaluation of multiple on-prem and public cloud options, the customer chose to run OpenShift and their critical applications on-prem on the Nutanix cloud platform, including our AHV hypervisors, concluding that it was the alternative that could deliver the best performance and total cost of ownership. This deal reinforces our view that cloud is an operating model, not a destination and that our Nutanix cloud platform is ideally suited to enabling the hybrid multi-cloud operating model, increasingly favored by IT professionals. Following the general availability of NC2 on Microsoft Azure late in our first quarter, we saw solid momentum with NC2 in the second quarter. A good example is a win we had with an EMEA headquartered provider of global transportation services, looking to accelerate their migration to the public cloud, reduce their data center footprint and optimize their public cloud spend. Following a rigorous evaluation of alternatives, including native public cloud, this customer chose NC2 on Azure, which they found enabled a roughly 4x faster migration, lower migration costs and significantly lower operating costs. This win demonstrates how our customers appreciate the ability to rapidly and seamlessly shift their workloads from their private clouds to the largest public cloud provider with the consistent management, governance and data services provided by the Nutanix cloud platform without the time and expense of refactoring their workloads and with lower ongoing operating costs. On the product front, during the second quarter, we delivered meaningful upgrades to our core platform with the release of AOS 6.6, which offers enhanced data services and a number of networking and security-related features, further strengthening its capabilities to support business-critical applications. In closing, I'd like to provide some thoughts on our priorities and outlook. First, our overarching priority remains delivering sustainable, profitable growth through judicious investment in the business, execution on a growing base of renewals and diligent expense management. Our strong free cash flow, along with solid top-line growth in the second quarter, reflects the progress we made to date towards this objective. While the macro environment remains uncertain, we are encouraged that the strength of our business model underpinned by a growing base of renewals and our ongoing focus on profitability, allow us to raise our fiscal year top-line outlook and reaffirm our free cash flow outlook. I remain confident in our ability to continue to capitalize on the vast opportunity in front of us while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini? Yes. Let me start and Rukmini, you can explain the details here, right? But the one thing -- the first thing I want to say is that the fundamentals of our business are unchanged. So this matter doesn't impact our market opportunity or the demand for our solutions. And we are working diligently to resolve it as quickly as possible, and we are very focused on driving sustainable profitable growth. Now with respect to that specific matter, Rukmini, maybe you can just explain the details behind it and what we're doing. Absolutely. As you can imagine, Pinjalim, we are engaged with many of these customers right now. We have a significantly higher level of engagement. A lot of these are prospective customers that aren't existing ones, and they're all looking to explore their options and manage these potential risks related to the acquisition. What you should keep in mind is, for many, many years, we've been doing these things. We've been doing these migrations. In many cases, when we go out there, we insert our solution on top of a VMware platform, right? Customers are running vSphere, we go in there and we insert AOS, which is our software-defined storage. And over time, customers may choose to use our own hypervisor AHV, instead of the VMware hypervisor. So we have a lot of experience with doing migrations for our customers. Now the large is the environment, the more complex it is and we know that. And typically, we will do this one workload at a time, for example. They will pick us for one use case and then over time, we will expand and other use cases. Historically, it used to be in the computing, but these days, we do databases. We do all mission-critical workloads, all of this. So we have a lot of experience doing these migrations. That said, Pinjalim, I think what you heard -- yes, this is complex, it's going to take time, and this is why we are not factoring in any significant benefit in our fiscal '23 outlook. We expect these cycles to be long, typically nine, 12 months for some of the larger deals. Yes. Jim, indeed, there is a push and pull on this, as you say. So first on the macro. We see strong performance from our renewals and that's been continuing. And of course, that helps reduce the risk in our business model and the guide that we put out there. Now we have taken into account the current macro environment. As you say, right, in terms of the impact that we are seeing, we have been seeing greater inspection. Now what I would say is, what that means is, very -- I would say, so far, it has been a modest increase in the average sales cycle, right? The time it takes to close the deal goes up a bit, and we're seeing this across both in new logos or new customers and existing customers looking to expand, right? They're just being a little bit more careful, taking some more time to review the economics of everything and looking at the TCO benefits.  Now that said, we do have strong TCO benefits that typically compared to legacy infrastructure. So when you look at the dynamics vis-a-vis the second piece of it, which is compared to third party or legacy 3-tier storage, I think those dynamics are largely the same. When there is, for example, time for a refresh or any kind of modernization effort, the customers compare HCI versus 3-tier, and then able to show a better TCO, a much more modern ability for them to go build a cloud platform. And that dynamic hasn't really changed. Clearly, the VMware dynamics certainly will help in the long term, but not in the short term. But in the short term, what I would say, is increase the level of engagement. So there's clearly a push and pull. We have the -- to summarize, we've got the renewals business that provides a foundation. On the new business, small elongation and deal cycles.  On the other side, we're seeing more engagement from a VMware basis. And so we've tried to do our best to factor in all of these dynamics into the guide that we gave you. Yes. And I'd just say one thing there, Rukmini, and what this means, therefore, there might be some additional expense, right, in terms of using usage of that. So that's why we are -- until we have -- this is done, we can't really specifically give you expenses. Yes. I can take that, Matt. So in general, by the way, the environment has gotten a lot better over the last year from a hiring perspective as well as the retention given what's happening out there in the markets, both with respect to other large tech companies as well as a lot of the start-ups that our people were potentially going to, right? So from that situation, I think things have gotten a lot better.  Now to your question on the sales front specifically, we are doing -- again, every quarter, we've been seeing repatriation -- retention improve actually quarter-over-quarter. And our rep headcount has been roughly flat. We do expect in FY '23 to grow our rep count modestly from where we're at. And at the same time, of course, we are very focused on continuing to drive higher rep productivity. Yes. So first of all, I'll just say, in the U.S. -- by the way, we only have two verticals. One is public sector and the other is healthcare. So public sector is clearly very important for us. We are well penetrated into public sector across both civilian, defense, government agencies across the board as well as state, local education. So it's a very important market. That's why we have a vertical presence in it targeted at that market. And I would say, it continues to be a very solid source of business for us. We continue to drive their modernization efforts. We are fairly broadly deployed, but we see continued opportunities there as well. So it's a good and very important sector for us with continued spending. Now of course, they have their budget cycles, as you know, every year, right? I mean depending on certain quarters where for the year-end, we tend to see a bump in the public sector sales during that quarter. But that's -- again, it's all as usual, I would say. Yes. Maybe I'll give you some color, right? So eval software has meant for eval view, right? So you go try it. You go try it out for whatever you're using it for you try out, and then at some point, we purchase it. What we found was, in some cases, we were using the reval software for doing interoperability testing or customer proof of concepts, validating. So that goes beyond the scope of what the eval software was being used for. Yes. So we haven't quantified how much, right? But we can't get into that kind of detail here, but yes, you're right, right? I mean, therefore, there is some additional expense required likely to -- for the usage and use cases that we were looking at. Yes. In fact, we gave you an example of a repatriation in our prepared remarks here. Definitely, we are seeing -- especially in many areas of the world now, customers are much, much more cost sensitive in terms of looking at the cloud, the public cloud in particular and saying, when should I go to the public cloud and for what? And they're starting to look at -- this whole cloud economics is a very important part. So in the example that we showed, for example, this customer is actually running a production workload in the public cloud because of mission-critical workload, and they decided to migrate it on-prem because they could get a better TCO. They could also get better support experience and response sense from vendors by doing so. So we're seeing that definitely being much more nuanced now. It's not going -- not taking everything you have in going to the public cloud. It's being much more nuanced about what you put where and what is it going to cost you. Yes, Simon, that's a good question. I don't think we have that level of visibility because a lot of this is somewhat anecdotal, and we've seen it for both new and for existing customers, right? Clearly, for us, typically in the past, expansion in existing customers is generally easier and quicker compared to new, right, net new prospects. But we are seeing an elongation in deal for both, and it's -- but I will also say, it's a very modest elongation at this point. So it's just that, for example, just anecdotally, well, something that a VP may have budget for at a VP level and say, yes, I'm going to go ahead and do it. Now with being scrutinized at the CFO level, say, okay, do you really have to go spend this money now? Can you wait? Is there a TCO benefit that you can quantify for me quickly? So that's the kind of, I think, dynamics that we are seeing. It's hard to parse out specifically as it varies a lot by customers, but we're seeing this as both new and for expansion. Yes. Rukmini? Yes. I'll talk about two of those, and I'll let Rukmini comment on FX. But first of all, we are focusing on higher quality, higher ASP new logos, more so than new logo comp. So we want to make sure that when we get -- when we put our efforts to go winning a new logo, we make the count, right, much more so and provides us a bigger deal, drives up our sales productivity and also provides more expansion opportunities. So that's been our focus more so than the new logo count. The new logo count shows up in terms of what it is. It's more of a result rather than a number that we are trying to focus on in terms of trying to hit a new logo target. The second thing I would say is, our -- we are very much holding up our prices, right? Unit prices have remained very stable, and they're not going down in any way. And then the third part of it, in terms of FX, Rukmini, perhaps you can comment. Yes, I think, George, we are certainly very excited about that route to market because we are relatively new in terms of our using this route to market for us. So it's a growing business opportunity for us. Last quarter, we said, the largest deal in the quarter was done through that SP channel. And it's still -- we're still in the very early stages in that innings there, and we continue to build up our service provider partners. We're trying to enhance the product capabilities to provide a very as broad an offering as possible. So we have -- so it's a continued -- it's a journey, and it's going to take us multiple quarters for it to start becoming a significant chunk of our business. Right now, it's still a small portion of our overall business. Absolutely. And I would say, it's becoming more and more important now in the context of the whole VMware-Broadcom acquisition as well. Now for us, it's always been a blend. We would like to see, of course, more customers using AHV, okay? On the one side, which, of course, will mean that our AHV as a percentage of our workload keeps going up. But at the same time, we see there's a huge opportunity in terms of us inserting into other hypervisor footprints. And in fact, that's the default. It used to be -- if you go back many years ago, that was our default. We would insert it into somebody else's hypervisor environment, like a hypervisor. So we want to continue that because there's still a huge opportunity there.  So the model with customers has been, in some cases, we will go and start on top of a third-party hypervisor with the rest of our solution stack. So our software-defined storage, for example. And then over time, they will choose to migrate some of that to AHV. We also have a dynamic where in many new customers, they go all in with AHV from day one as well. So we have both those dynamics, and we want to maintain a balance of both because we do want to, of course, have customers on our own hypervisor and sell them the full stack solution. But at the same time, we want to be able to go after those customers that have other hypervisors and be able to insert into their environment as well. So I'd say -- so that's the blend that we're trying to get comfortable with, but overall, it continues to mature. More and more customers using it. Ecosystem is being becoming broader and broader. We have third-party certifications like Red Hat and others on it now. So it's becoming, let's call it, ready for all mission-critical workloads at this point."

            "name": "Rukmini Sivaraman",
            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. I would first like to note that with respect to the investigation Rajiv mentioned, we are in the process of assessing the financial reporting impact, and it is likely that additional costs would be incurred to address the use cases previously noted. As a result, we have not provided financial information regarding expenses in our second quarter preliminary results or our outlook for the third quarter or full fiscal year 2023. While we are working diligently to address this matter and finalize our financials as soon as possible, we do not expect to be able to file our 10-Q on time or following the 5-day prescribed extension period allowed under 12b-25. Relatedly, we are rescheduling our Investor Day we had intended to hold on April 4, 2023 to summer of 2023 and will provide a specific date once it is confirmed. With that said, I will now move on to talk through our Q2 results, followed by our outlook for Q3; and then finally, provide an update on our fiscal year '23 outlook. Q2 '23 was a solid quarter with results that came in better than our guidance. ACV billings in Q2 was $268 million, higher than our guidance of $245 million to $250 million and representing a year-over-year growth of 23%. The significant majority of that growth came from growth in renewals billings. Revenue in Q2 was $486 million, higher than our guidance of $460 million to $470 million and a year-over-year growth rate of 18%. ARR at the end of Q2 was $1.378 billion, a year-over-year growth of 32%. New logo additions were about 480 in Q2. Contract duration stayed flat quarter-over-quarter at three years as expected.  As described previously, the percentage of orders with future start dates likely due to partner supply chain constraints continue to be a key assumption in our Q2 guidance. This percentage came in lower than it was in Q1 '23 and below our expectations. Q2 revenue also benefited approximately $11 million from the improvement in percentage of future start dates as more license revenue was recognized in quarter than deferred, slightly more than the $10 million estimate we had provided on our last earnings call. Billings linearity was good, and DSOs were 28 days in Q2. Free cash flow in Q2 was $63 million, implying record free cash flow margin of 13%. A couple of additional notes on Q2: One, we retired the remaining principal amount on our January 2023 convertible notes of approximately $146 million with cash from the balance sheet. Two, last month, we reached an agreement to settle the outstanding securities class actions litigation, which is subject to documentation, notice to class members and court approval. We recorded a net charge of approximately $38 million for the settlement. This is the amount, inclusive of legal fees and expenses, net of our expected recovery under our D&O insurance. We expect approximately $33 million to be paid and settled in Q3, while the remainder was already paid for legal defense costs in previous quarters. We ended Q2 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.311 billion, down slightly from $1.388 billion in Q1 '23. Moving on to Q3 outlook. The guidance for Q3 '23 is as follows: ACV billings of $220 million to $225 million and revenue of $430 million to $440 million.  I'll now provide some more context around our guidance. First, the top-line guidance for Q3 assumes that supply chain dynamics for our server partners would remain more or less the same compared to Q2 '23. It also assumes that contract durations would stay approximately flat to slightly down in Q3 '23 compared to Q2 '23. Second, the revenue guidance includes approximately $5 million of revenue benefit from the decline in percentage of orders with future start dates over the last few months. Said differently, we expect to recognize more license revenue in Q3 than is deferred, similar to the dynamic we saw in Q2. Over time, as our partner supply chain constraints resolves and our future start date percentages normalize, we would expect this dynamic to normalize as well. I will now provide an update on our full year 2023 guidance. We have had a solid first half and our renewals business continues to provide a strong foundation for growth and efficiency. Those factors, combined with our continued focus on disciplined expense management, allow us to raise our ACV billings and revenue outlook for the year while reaffirming our prior free cash flow outlook. Our updated guidance for full year fiscal year '23 is as follows: ACV billings of $905 million to $915 million, year-over-year growth of 20% at the midpoint; revenue guidance of $1.8 billion to $1.81 billion, year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint; and free cash flow of $100 million to $125 million.  I'll now provide some additional color on our full year guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as Rajiv mentioned, we have seen a modest elongation of sales cycles likely due to increased deal inspection. We have considered this dynamic in our updated guidance. We continue to expect that the significant majority of our growth in ACV billings for fiscal year '23 will come from growth in renewals ACV billings with the uncertainty in the macro environment factored into our expectations for new and expansion ACV billings. A reminder that ACV billings for the full year is not simply the summation of four quarters ACV billings because of deals with less than one year in contract duration. We expect that full year ACV billings is discounted by approximately 5% relative to the sum of ACV billings from the four quarters.  Second, similar to our comments last quarter, the full year guidance assumes that contract durations would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year '22. The fiscal year '23 revenue guidance also assumes that the percentage of orders with future start dates would ease slightly in the second half of the fiscal year compared to the first half.  Third, the reaffirmed free cash flow guidance of $100 million to $125 million includes the impact of approximately $33 million in net cash outflow expected in Q3 from the previously mentioned litigation settlement. It also includes the impact of approximately $12 million of cash usage in Q3 for nonrecurring tax obligations related to a portion of our employee RSUs vesting this month and other anticipated cash outflows. These cash outflows were not included in our prior guidance for annual fiscal year '23 free cash flow.  Finally, I'd like to note that we continue to expect to generate at least $300 million of free cash flow in fiscal year 2025. In closing, we are pleased that our Q2 results reflect our continued execution towards our stated objective of sustainable, profitable growth, and we expect to continue that focus. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Sure. Yes. Pinjalim. So what we discovered was that certain eval software, evaluation software, from one of our third-party providers, so somebody who provides us software, which is intended for evaluation purposes was instead used for validation, interoperable, testing and proof of concept over a multiyear period. So that is a -- we discovered that, and as we said on the call, that matter is ongoing. And because of that Pinjalim, we weren't able to disclose expense information on the call, and we've announced that we expect to be unable to file our 10-Q in a timely manner, given that we want to make sure this is resolved first.  Now I want to also provide a little bit of color that we are -- given this, we still believe that our top-line results, our free cash flow as we reported it, are all unimpacted by this. And when we look forward to guidance, we are pleased to be able to raise our revenue and ACV billings guide, and we're comfortable with the $100 million to $125 million of free cash flow guidance for the year after factoring in the potential impact from this third-party software use that we mentioned on the call. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, the free cash flow guidance also includes the impact of the $33 million approximately from the settlement of the litigation and the impact of this $12 million of cash usage in Q3 for nonrecurring tax obligations related to employee RSUs vesting. And these cash outflows were not included in our prior guidance for the full year free cash flow. Thank you, Jim. All good questions. So let me try to parse that. So as I said in my remarks, Jim, we are not commenting on expense -- expenses either for Q2 or on a forward-looking basis. So I'll stop there. But in terms of free cash flow, right, for Q2, as you said, we're happy with the free cash flow performance in Q2. And I will just say that I think we talked about DSOs on the call, right, which was 28 days. It was unusually low in Q1, and we saw it kind of come back to, I would say, within the range, right, in Q2 because typically, our payment terms for DSOs are 30 to 45 days. And so I would expect it to be sort of in that area. Now to your second question, so yes, we are comfortable with our full year $100 million to $125 million free cash flow guidance, Jim, including the potential impact from -- arising from this matter, right, related to the third-party software use that we mentioned on the call and the other sort of items around the $33 million for the settlement and the onetime $12 million tax obligations we discussed. That's correct, Mike. Yes. Thank you, Mike, for the question. If I understand that there's limited guidance here, Mike, and we -- what I can say is that given this review is ongoing, what we can say is that we are working diligently, right, with the Audit Committee and our outside counsel to resolve this as quickly as possible so we can be in a position to share more with you. At this point, we're not able to kind of provide very specific timelines to your question, but we are working diligently to make sure we are resolving this appropriately and in a timely manner. Yes, let me try... Yes. Thank you, Mike. So let me try and clarify some of those pieces. So you are correct that we do not believe that this matter has any impact on our topline metrics, specifically revenue, ACV billings, which as you point out, we've disclosed and we're guiding to. So that's one part of it. And in terms of just -- sorry, what was the second part of your question? Mike, I think there was one more question after that. On free cash flow, I think, right? Yes. Correct. Yes. Sorry about that. So I think on free cash flow, we reported Q2 free cash flow, right? Like that's the $63 million that we reported out. Now for the full year, I think this is important. So I'm glad you asked the question, Mike, that we are comfortable with the $100 million to $125 million free cash flow for the year after factoring in a potential impact from this third-party software use that we mentioned on the call and the two other items, right? So $33 million, which as you said, a separate matter from a previously outstanding litigation settlement. So that's $33 million that was not factored in before, and this $12 million of cash usage in Q3 for nonrecurring tax obligations related to a portion of our employee RSUs vesting this month. Yes. Understood, Mike. So let me -- so what -- this is the software that we were using from a third-party software provider. It was evaluation software intended to be used for evaluation purposes, and instead, it was being used by us for interoperability testing, validation and proofs of concept. So that is the matter that's being reviewed right now. Yes. Yes, that's right, Mike. So yes, it's intended to be used for evaluation software, and we discovered that was instead being used for these other inoperability, validation and proof of concept, and so that's what's under review right now. That's correct. Thank you for the question, Meta. So let me take that one by one. So I think your first question was around just the raise for the full year, right, and what contributed to that. So I mean, clearly, in Q2, we beat both on ACV billings and on revenue, right? And so I think that certainly makes us feel more comfortable raising the guide for the full year.  On the revenue piece, we did try to provide some color for you in the prepared remarks around the percentage of future start dates. So that does have an impact. So you saw it had about $11 million impact in Q2. And for Q3, we expect that to be about $5 million more of license revenue that gets recognized in quarter versus deferred. And so there was some of that effect factored in, Meta, to your question on the full year. And I think on renewals, as Rajiv has said and I emphasize this too that our renewal business is doing well, and so that, again, continues to underpin the significant majority of our growth and lowers the risk somewhat given all of that is based on deals that we've already done that are coming up for renewal. Now I think the second part of your question was whether we'd be able to quantify some of these payments, and we are not able to provide any specific quantification on that at this point, Meta, given the review is ongoing. But as I said before, we are continuing to work diligently to try and get this dissolved. Yes. I would say, it's not outside the norm, Meta. So anything we've discussed before, we typically do go to our customers as a lot of other vendors do as well, about even 6 months advance of the renewal date to begin those discussions. So there will be some timing movements here and there. We do some co-terming like most subscription vendors do. So -- but nothing outside of the normal or what we would expect that contributed to renewals. Hi, Ben, thanks for the question. Yes. So we haven't quite provided kind of a percentage almost of ARR, right, that's up for renewal, I think, is your question. So we haven't quite quantified that, Ben, but I will say that overall, given where we are in our journey, right, really all we sell now is subscription software, term licensing software other than professional services, which is a small portion of the overall business. So -- and our renewals are starting to flow in, right? So we do expect to see kind of continued growth in that base of renewals as we layer on kind of the additional trims that we -- urgent software that we have sold over time, right? So I would say that is a growing base of renewals, but we haven't provided a specific number or a percentage of ARR that's up in this year. So I think a few things. So when you say acceleration, did you mean growth? I think a couple of things, I would say, Ben, right? So typically, our Q4 seasonally is a better quarter for us than Q3 is, and that's because it's the end of the fiscal year for us and so that is expected. We also have -- last year, our Q4 ACV billings provides a bit of a -- somewhat of an easier comp given some of the dynamics that were happening in Q4 of last year. But I think from -- when you look at the guidance for the Q3 ACV billings and quarter-over-quarter, what's implied for Q4, it's, I would say, within the range of what we would expect from Q3 to Q4. Sure. Thank you, Aaron. So yes, we were happy to be able to raise both revenue and ACV billings guidance. And you're right, Aaron, that sort of half over half, I guess, it does imply a decline in ACV billings like second half over first half. And I would say, one is what you've already pointed out and which we talked about, which is this modest elongation in sales cycles that we -- there was anecdotal in Q1. We saw it. We saw a modest elongation in Q2. And so we have factored in, as I mentioned in my remarks, to write some conservatism as it relates specifically to the new and expansion portion about the ACV, but ACV billings portion, right, of the overall guide. So there's definitely that. And if you look at a year-over-year growth rate, I think there's still a meaningful growth rate year-over-year for the second half. So that's kind of how we are thinking about the ACV guidance for the full year and implied second half. Good question, Aaron, and thank you for asking a clarification question, right? So first is, I think as we sort of you just pointed out, actually, we do expect to see lower billings and revenue in the second half which does have an impact, as you can imagine, billings does have a direct impact on free cash flow. And then I think you've done the math right around just the items that we pointed out, and as we said, it does factor in the potential impact from the use of this third-party software as well, which we are not quantifying at this point. So that's how to think about the full year free cash flow guide. We don't anticipate sort of any significant material changes to working capital or anything like that for the rest of the year. Thank you, Simon. Yes, at this point, given this is ongoing, Simon, we're not able to get more specific on the types of expenses or where the P&L, it might fall. Thank you for the question, Ruplu. Again, this is -- this review is ongoing, and so we really can't comment on any of that, Ruplu, but we are working quickly and diligently to make sure we're able to provide more clarity on all of this. But at this point, there's really nothing more I can add on the specifics. Yes. So Ruplu, your question, I think, was that given that we denominate all of our transaction in U.S. dollars, is it effectively a price increase? Which it is in some parts of the world, right, where the dollar has strengthened. And so what we're seeing is, this is anecdotal, right? In some cases, we've seen it sort of put some pressure on the timing of some transactions, especially in the emerging markets. But overall, I think to Rajiv's point, our unit economics and our overall pricing is in a good place. And so we haven't seen a sort of significant or systematic impact on that from any of these drivers. Thank you for the question, Ruplu. So on backlog, yes, you're right. When we entered this fiscal year at the end of July, we did say that we had record levels of backlog, and we expect during the course of the year to use that backlog over time to get to a more normalized level by the end of the year. We did use some backlog in Q2 in line with our expectations, and again, we expect that we will continue to consume that over the course of the rest of this year. Tom, thanks for the question. So look, I think we've emphasized a few times and I'm happy to, I think, clarify I think for you, Tom. It's a good question on just the overall renewals work stream. We've talked about how it's a driver both of our growth and efficiency, and it continues to perform well. And yes, we do believe it's going in the right direction, not just for fiscal year '23, as we talked about in majority of growth coming in, in '23, but also more generally, right? And that's why we did mention that we reiterate our sort of $300 million-plus free cash flow number for '25, and so we continue to believe that, that thesis still holds. Right. So I think if your question on NRR, our net dollar-based retention rate metric, Tom? Is that the question? Yes. So thank you for that. So I think I want to first clarify that when we talk about renewals billings, we're purely talking only about renewals, right? It does not factor in any of the expansion that is factored into our new and expansion portion, right? That's sort of incremental ACV. NRR, to your point on, we don't actually disclose on a quarterly basis. So what I will say, though, is if we look back to our last Investor Day, we had given some ranges in that 120 to 125-ish percent sort of range, and it is still in that in that range in terms of the NRR number. And so yes, and as we've also talked about how for new and expansion is where we are baking in some caution as it relates to the full year guide, given what we're seeing in the business."

And with that, I will turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich and good afternoon everyone. Against a volatile macro backdrop, we delivered a good first quarter. We exceeded all of our guided metrics and saw continued strong performance in our renewals business. Supply chain constraints with our server partners while remaining a headwind improved somewhat compared with the prior quarter. With respect to the macro backdrop, in our first quarter, we continue to see businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and data center modernization initiatives enabled by our platform. We have seen anecdotal evidence of increased inspection of deals by customers, which we believe is likely related to the more uncertain macro backdrop. We continue to factor this uncertainty into our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Taking a closer look at the first quarter, we delivered ACV billings and revenue above our guidance, driven by strong continued performance of our renewals business. We again demonstrated good expense management coming in slightly below our OpEx targets. Top line outperformance, combined with diligent expense management, enabled us to achieve positive non-GAAP operating income for the first time, another milestone in our drive towards sustainable, profitable growth. Finally, strong billings linearity and collections contributed to generation of $46 million of free cash flow, meaningfully exceeding our breakeven target and continuing our strong recent free cash flow performance. Overall, I am pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter. Our first quarter is typically a stronger one for our federal business and this one was no exception. Our largest customer in the quarter was a federal civilian agency that was already a significant user of Nutanix\u2019s cloud platform, including our unified storage and database automation solutions as well as Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2, on AWS for bursting additional resource capacity into the public cloud. This customer added additional cybersecurity workloads to the Nutanix Cloud Platform, reflecting their confidence in the ability of our platform to handle their most business-critical applications and resulting in a substantial expansion order for us. We see this customer as a great example of how we are able to land and expand with some of the largest organizations in the world. On the product and partnership front, we achieved an important milestone in realizing our hybrid multi-cloud vision with the general availability of NC2 on Microsoft Azure. Now with support of AWS, Azure and service provider cloud environment, we continue to deliver on our hybrid multi-cloud vision. Our customers have the ability to rapidly and seamlessly shift their workloads between their private clouds and the largest public cloud providers, with a consistent management, governance and data services provided by the Nutanix Cloud Platform, all without the time and expense of refactoring their workloads. One of our early customers for NC2 on Azure is Unum Group, a Fortune 500 financial services provider, who is part of our customer preview program. Unum chose NC2 on Azure, because they were looking to leverage our seamless hybrid multi-cloud platform for disaster recovery as well as to migrate and run their workloads in Azure without having to refactor their applications. They are also looking to take advantage of the ability to expand their Nutanix cloud platform to different Azure regions on demand. Another exciting development on the product front is the recent enhancements we made to our platform to accelerate adoption of Kubernetes-based applications in the enterprise. In keeping with our philosophy of offering customers choice throughout the stack, we added Amazon\u2019s Kubernetes service to an already long list of supported Kubernetes container platforms, including Red Hat, OpenShift, SUSE Rancher, Google Anthos, Azure Arc and our native Nutanix Kubernetes Engine. We also added built-in infrastructure as core capabilities and advanced cloud-native data services for modern applications, both of which will enhance the Nutanix cloud platform\u2019s ability to efficiently run Kubernetes applications at scale. Go-to-market leverage is one of my top priorities and we saw progress across a number of partner categories in the first quarter. In the public cloud category, our customers are now able to get on-demand consumption of Nutanix software through Azure marketplace, facilitating frictionless license procurement and movement of workloads between private cloud and Azure. For our channel partners, we updated our Elevate Partner Program ecosystem, which enhanced incentives to encourage and enable these partners to sell Nutanix into net new accounts and to drive opportunities through the entire sales cycle autonomously. In addition, we rolled out training designed to enable partners to speed up sales cycles through rapid capacity planning, quoting and order fulfillment, thereby generating more leverage for our sales rep. Finally, our two largest new customer wins in the quarter were in partnership with a global leader in data center colocation and interconnection services and part of our service provider program. We are encouraged by the early progress we are seeing with service providers and see good growth potential in our service provider-related businesses as we add additional partners and enhancements to our platform, supporting service provider business models. One of these service provider wins was from an EMEA-based publishing and education company that was looking to modernize and consolidate their data center footprint while having disaster recovery capability in AWS. They chose our Nutanix cloud platform, including Nutanix cloud management to run their business-critical applications, leveraging its simplicity and built-in automation for Infrastructure as a Service. They also added Nutanix unified storage to service their unstructured data needs. We see this as a great example of a customer adopting our full stack offering to consolidate and modernize their IT infrastructure. And now, I\u2019d like to talk about the industry recognition we continue to receive for our solutions. For the second year in a row, Nutanix was named a visionary in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for Distributed File Systems and Object Storage. We believe our improved position within the Visionary Quadrant this year reflects advances in customer traction, go-to-market efforts, enhanced product capabilities, and an expanded ecosystem for our Nutanix unified storage solution. With customers needing a simple and secure way to manage and protect their data, this recognition highlights the advantages of Nutanix unified storage. In closing, I\u2019d like to provide some thoughts on our priorities and outlook. First, our overarching priority remains driving towards sustainable profitable growth through judicious investment in the business, execution on a growing base of renewals, and diligent expense management. Our achievement of positive non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter represents tangible progress towards this goal. The strength of our business model is underpinned by a growing base of renewals and the strong value proposition of our platform in an uncertain macro landscape. I remain confident in our ability to continue to capitalize on the vast opportunity in front of us while driving towards sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv. I will first walk through our Q1 results, followed by our outlook for Q2 and then finally, provide an update on our fiscal year \u201823 outlook. Q1 \u201823 was a good quarter with results that came in better than our guidance and across all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q1 was $232 million, higher than our guidance of $210 million to $215 million and representing a year-over-year growth of 27%. A significant majority of that growth came from growth in renewals billings. Revenue in Q1 was $434 million, higher than our guidance of $410 million to $415 million and a year-over-year growth rate of 15%. ARR at the end of Q1 was $1.281 billion, a year-over-year growth of 34%. New logo additions were about 530 in Q1. Contract duration decreased quarter-over-quarter to 3 years as expected, partly due to a seasonally higher mix of U.S. federal business that typically has shorter contract durations. As described previously, the percentage of orders with future start dates continue to be a key assumption in our Q1 guidance. This percentage came in lower than it was in Q4 \u201822 and slightly below our expectations. Q1 revenue also benefited approximately $12 million from the improvement in percentage of future start dates from Q4 to Q1 as more license revenue was recognized in quarter than deferred. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 83% because of our higher-than-expected revenue performance. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was positive 2%, our first quarter of positive non-GAAP operating profit and a proof point of our ongoing focus on profitable growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q1 were $351 million, better than our guidance of $360 million to $365 million, and included about $2 million of benefit from favorable currency exchange rates in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $8 million or EPS of $0.03 per share based on weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 275 million shares. We are happy to report positive net income and EPS for the first time in the history of Nutanix. Billings linearity was very good in Q1 and better than our expectations. DSOs were 18 days in Q1, a demonstration of good linearity and strong collections. We expect DSOs to trend back up to historical levels going forward. The strong billings linearity and collections contributed to free cash flow generation of $46 million in Q1, significantly better than our expectations. We also collected in Q1 about $10 million of invoices due in early Q2. We are finding that while our cash collections remain strong, there is a normal level of variation in timing of payments from quarter-to-quarter. Going forward and given our transition into positive free cash flow generation, we expect to provide color on free cash flow on an annual basis. A brief note on severance payments related to our reduction in force that we announced in August. One, we expect the severance payments to total about $17 million rather than our previously estimated range of $20 million to $25 million; and two, about $6 million of the approximately $17 million in severance payments are being delayed to Q2, mainly in non-U.S. regions when we had previously assumed that the full amount would be paid in Q1. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.388 billion, up slightly from $1.324 billion in Q4 \u201822. Moving on to Q2 outlook. The guidance for Q2 \u201823 is as follows: ACV billings of $245 million to $260 million, implying a year-over-year growth rate of 13% at the midpoint. Revenue of $460 million to $470 million, a year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint, non-GAAP gross margin of 82% to 83%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 5% to 10%, weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 279 million shares. I\u2019ll now provide some more context around our Q2 guidance. First, the top line guidance for Q2 assumes that supply chain dynamics for our server partners would remain more or less the same compared to Q1 \u201823. Second, it assumes that contract durations would stay approximately flat in Q2 \u201823 compared to Q1 \u201823. Third, the revenue guidance includes approximately $10 million of revenue benefit from the decline in percentage of orders with future start dates over the last few months. Said differently, we expect to recognize more license revenue in Q2 than is deferred similar to the dynamic we saw in Q1. Over time, as our partner supply chain constraints resolve and our future start date percentages normalize, we would expect this dynamic to normalize as well. I will now provide an update on our full year 2023 guidance. While we had a good Q1 and our renewals business continues to provide a strong foundation for growth and efficiency, the macro environment remains uncertain, and we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in our full year top line guide, which remains unchanged. We also remain focused on disciplined expense management and are, therefore, raising our operating margin and free cash flow outlook for the year. Our guidance for full year fiscal year 2023 is as follows: ACV billings guidance remains unchanged at $895 million to $900 million, year-over-year growth of 19% at the midpoint. Revenue guidance remains unchanged at $1.77 billion to $1.78 billion, year-over-year growth of 12% at the midpoint, non-GAAP gross margin of 82% to 83% and non-GAAP operating margin of 2% to 4%. I\u2019ll now provide some color on our full year guidance. First, similar to our comments last quarter, the full year guidance assumes that contract durations would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year \u201822. The fiscal year \u201823 revenue guidance also assumes that the percentage of orders with future start dates would remain more or less the same in Q2 compared to Q1 and would start to ease slightly in the second half of the fiscal year. Second, the demand for our solutions continues and we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities. However, as Rajiv mentioned, we have started to see some anecdotal evidence of increased inspection on deals which we believe is likely related to the more uncertain macro backdrop and which could potentially lead to an increase in sales cycles. We have considered this dynamic and the uncertain macro environment in our guidance. We expect that the significant majority of our growth in ACV billings for fiscal year \u201823 will come from growth in renewals ACV billings. With the uncertainty in the macro environment factored into our expectations for new and expansion ACV billings. At the same time, our continued focus on expense management and operating discipline enables us to increase our operating margin and free cash flow outlook for the year. Which is a good segue to the third point, which is that we expect to deliver about $100 million to $125 million of free cash flow for fiscal year \u201823, an increase from our prior expectations of $75 million to $100 million. Finally, a note on seasonality. As we look ahead to the second half, we expect to see a low double-digit percentage decline quarter-over-quarter in ACV billings in the third quarter followed by a low double-digit percentage increase quarter-over-quarter in ACV billings in the fourth quarter. In closing, we are pleased that our Q1 results reflect our continued execution towards our stated objective of sustainable, profitable growth, and we expect to continue that focus. We look forward to sharing more about our medium-term outlook during our Investor Day in April 2023, as Rich referenced. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJim Fish: Hey, guys. Great quarter in the wake of this kind of macro environment, and that gets me to my question of why has demand for hyperconverged really remains strong in this kind of difficult macro spending environment? And really, the crux of my question here is how much of the current strength in numbers here is due to that backlog build and deferral from fiscal Q3 of last year versus what you\u2019re booking during this quarter?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Tim, thank you for the question. Rajiv here. First of all, I think, as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve got a good, strong and growing base of renewals. And that\u2019s performing well and that certainly helped reduce the risk in the model. And as we did say, we have taken into account a little bit of this uncertainty in the macro environment in our guidance. We have built some conservatism in terms of IT spending. And I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that HCI is completely immune from a potential slowdown in IT spending. But HCI per se produces better TCO compared to legacy architecture, and it\u2019s a foundation for the hybrid cloud. So from that perspective, customers can actually save money by moving to HCI from traditional legacy architectures. So so far, when you look at the macro again, we\u2019ve seen greater inspection of deals by some customers, which could potentially lead to an increase in sales cycles but we have factored this into our guidance.\nRukmini Sivaraman: And I\u2019ll take the backlog portion of that question. Hi, Jim, so as you point out, we had noted when we announced our fiscal \u201822 results that we ended fiscal \u201822 with a record level of backlog, which, combined with our growing base of renewals, as Rajiv said, provided a foundation for our growth in fiscal \u201823 and helped overall reduce the risk inherent in our forecast. So in the first quarter, consistent with our expectations and consistent with typical seasonality, we did use some backlog. And the only other comment I\u2019d add is that given the unusually high level of backlog we entered the year with, I think some of which was related to our partners, supply chain issues, we would expect that over the course of the year, we would likely consume some backlog.\nJim Fish: Makes sense. And if I could sneak in one more. Rajiv, a bunch of your customer commentary kind of focused on around cloud and trying to understand how much of the focus on customers is about optimizing cloud spending and how much that is helping Nutanix this past and current quarter as that\u2019s one of the biggest line items for IT spending? Thanks, guys.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. And again, that\u2019s a good question. Increasingly, more and more of our conversations with our customers are around how can we efficiently help them operate in this multi-cloud environment. Many of our customers have looked at public cloud. They have moved to the public cloud in portions and they are also realizing that it can be expensive. And so what we tell them is that we can actually help them take their existing workloads and move it and run it very efficiently in the public cloud, and we can save money and optimize how we do it for them. So yes, it\u2019s an increasing part of our conversation. I think the broader theme here is almost with every customer that I talk to, we are talking about how to help them operate well in a multi-cloud world and how we can save them money, how we can make it simpler for them, both from an ongoing CapEx cost, but also in terms of the people side of this equation in terms of having a consistent operating environment where you don\u2019t have to have different teams to operate each of these cloud environments. So it\u2019s very much becoming a centerpiece of many of our conversations there.\nJim Fish: Thanks. Great quarter, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe I just wanted to see if you could give more color on just kind of the macro impact that you\u2019re seeing. Clearly, you talked about not impacting the renewal business, but just are there regions or customer types \u2013 or just any other color as far as kind of the second set of eyes that are maybe needed to get a deal across the line. And then maybe just as a second question for me, just kind of given M&A within this space? How are you maybe taking advantage of the acquisition of \u2013 or pending acquisitions of competitors? Thanks.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think two good questions there, Meta. And on the first one, there is multiple portions to this. As you said, the renewals business is largely a steady state, not impacted by the uncertain macro. Now in terms of the uncertain macro, we\u2019ve taken some of that into our account \u2013 into account when we give you a conservative forecast. To your point, we have seen anecdotal evidence of greater inspection of deals by some customers. And what that also means is that potentially there could be an increase in sales cycles. We haven\u2019t quite seen that as much yet happening, but this is an indication of what might be coming. And we have factored those in, in terms of our guidance per se. Now, Rukmini you may want to comment on the foreign FX impact as well here in terms of the macro.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Well I will do that and then I can hand it back to you on the more broader question on M&A. So, obviously, the dollar has strengthened. I think as we all know, our sales contracts are all denominated in U.S. dollars. And so that relative strengthening has effectively made our products more expensive to customers in some international markets. And so anecdotally, and this is not something we have seen systemically, but we have seen it sort of put pressure on some price negotiations and some transactions. And we don\u2019t believe that, that\u2019s causing us to lose deals. But anecdotally, we have seen it show up in some transactions.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. And Meta, on the other question around how other M&A activity is potentially impacting us, yes, we have all \u2013 we are all reading the news around Broadcom acquiring VMware. And what we have seen as a result of that is a significantly higher level of engagement from prospective customers. These customers are looking to explore their options looking at managing potential risks related to the transaction. Now as you know, our sales cycles, especially for larger deals tend to be 9 months to 12 months. So, we are not assuming any significant benefit from that in our fiscal \u201823 outlook. But I can certainly tell you that the volume of conversations with these customers and prospective customers around this topic has increased, and we are a good alternative provider.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. This is [indiscernible] for Pinjalim. So, my first question is, what are you hearing from customers with respect to new IT transformation projects in the current macro environment? Like do you think that it might take a backseat and people might move back towards the third tier architecture temporarily?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So look, I think first of all, accelerating digital transformation continues to be a key driver for customers. And we are seeing this across all kinds of industries here, particularly in verticals such as financial services, healthcare, state, local education. There is a clear mandate to modernize IT operations and applications, improve costs and help the business redirect non-productive legacy kind of spend. Now, in the current macro, I would say this is intensified. There is even more of a focus on cost and better TCO. So, from that perspective, modernizing legacy treated infrastructure, especially when things are up for renewal, right, up for a cycle, you are running out of \u2013 your hardware is getting old. HCI is a very viable option for improving TCO, simplifying operations, making things much simpler. So, we haven\u2019t quite seen a slowdown in that mindset with customers. I mean the other thing for us we see is that, HCI has now also become a platform for where customers can run all their workloads, including all their highest performance, most mission-critical workloads. We saw an example of that here in the call where we talked about this large Federal agency, but there are many other customers who are doing that. And then finally, I would say we are also seeing more people looking at hybrid multi-cloud and how they can operate efficiently in this cloud environment for which, again, our solution is a good option. So, can help them run in the right private cloud or public cloud based on criteria on cost, performance and governance. So, all of that I think is continuing to play out there, even despite the macro situation.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then maybe a quick one, can you help us understand like what you are seeing with expected gross retention trends in your renewals portfolio?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Thank you for the question. So, our GRR or gross retention rates remain in line with sort of our stated objective of in the 90%-plus range.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of George Wang with Barclays. Your line is open.\nGeorge Wang: Hey guys. Congrats again on the strong quarter. I have two quick questions. Firstly, just it\u2019s nice to see kind of rate for the FCF and income for this year. Definitely, you guys are seeing strong leverage. Just curious kind of going forward, are there additional operating expenses, which can be taken out of the system? Just curious kind of what area you guys can be targeting in terms of the lever to pull for further cost cuts, whether that\u2019s in the back office, whether that\u2019s in the state to follow. Maybe you can give more color on that?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Maybe, Rukmini, I will just give a high-level view. I would just say that we are not as much focused on cost-cutting. I mean a lot of the efficiency in the model is coming from the fact that we are seeing a growing base of renewals that can be prosecuted at a significantly lower cost than our traditionally new business. Now, we have been focused on efficiencies already over the last few years in every area. On the sales side, we are focused on increasing sales productivity. On the marketing side, we have already redirected and optimized our demand generation dollars to be mostly digital with some hybrid events. We have simplified our product portfolio. So, we have been doing the right things in terms of efficiency and so forth. So, that\u2019s where I will leave it. And Rukmini, if you want to add anything?\nRukmini Sivaraman: No, I think that was a good summary, Rajiv.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Thanks for that. My follow-up is just kind of looking out in terms of as-a-service. Any kind of color you can give in terms of future as-a-service model, such as partnering with GreenLake, maybe more traction there or kind of through other MSPs. Just curious kind of what areas are you guys exploring to further this journey of as-a-service in the HCI adoption?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Absolutely. That\u2019s actually a very good question because we are seeing a trend in the market where more customers would like to consume more offerings deliver to them as a service. And there is many routes to getting there. One of our first route is through service providers. And as you saw, for example, this quarter, this last quarter, there were two largest lines came through partnering with service providers. And these are service providers, in some cases, who will take us and sell through, right, and provide a service to their customers. So, that\u2019s one approach. HPE GreenLake is another approach where HPE GreenLake includes Nutanix as part of their offering, and they can provide a combined hardware-software solution delivered as-a-service in a subscription model to their customers. And selectively, some of our own offerings are also available directly as-a-service, but those are small relatively speaking, in our portfolio, especially some of our management offerings are delivered even today as-a-service, but that\u2019s a small portion lately. But largely, we are focused on enabling as-a-service models to our partners, whether they would be service providers, whether they would be strategic partners like HPE.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: And the only other thing I would just add there, sorry, I should say this. We are also an Azure marketplace right now where an Azure customer can use Azure, their Azure spend dollars and buy Nutanix through the marketplace.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Bergstrom with RBC. Your line is open.\nDan Bergstrom: So, any sense on where we are from a rep headcount perspective? I think you were flat in the fourth quarter expectation to grow modestly for the year, focus on productivity. Is that still the right way to think about rep headcount and growth and productivity?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. Our rep headcount was roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. We do expect to grow our rep headcount modestly from current levels, while at the same time, continuing to focus on driving higher rep productivity.\nDan Bergstrom: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. It\u2019s Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. I have one question for Rukmini and one for Rajiv. Maybe I will ask Rukmini the first question. I think you guided a low double-digit percent decline in ACV billings sequentially for 3Q and then low-double digit increase for 4Q. That seems to be a more pronounced seasonality than the last couple of years. So, maybe can you give us some puts and takes? And how does that take into account? Is that normal seasonality, or is that worse than normal? And how should we think about that?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Hi Ruplu, thanks for the question. And yes, and we called it out because we want to just want to provide some color on how seasonality would \u2013 we expect seasonal to show up for the rest of the year. And so just to reiterate what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect to see a low-double digit percentage decline quarter-over-quarter in ACV billings in the third quarter. Which by the way, seasonally, we do see a decline in ACV billings from Q2 to Q3 but low-double digit percentages is a little higher than what we normally see, which is the way we wanted to call it out. And then followed by \u2013 in Q4, we expect low-double digit percentage increase quarter-over-quarter in ACV billings. And to answer your question, Ruplu, our available to renew pool that is due in Q3 is expected to be lower than it is in Q2 and then expect it to then pick back up in Q4. So that, combined with our typical quarterly seasonality, leads us to expect that this trend will occur for the second half of \u201823.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Got it. And then can I just also ask a clarification. In the past, you said that the sum of the four quarter ACV billings is typically 6% to 7% higher than the annual reported number. Does that rule still hold for fiscal \u201823? And how should we think about that going forward?\nRukmini Sivaraman: So, generally, the concept still holds, Ruplu, because effectively what we do, just to remind folks on why we had that out there is that when we report the quarterly ACV numbers, we have some contracts that come in for less than a year duration, and we do annualize those to report ACV billings on a quarterly basis. Of course, on an annualized basis, we sort of normalize for that. And so that\u2019s what Ruplu is referring to. And I would say that, that \u2013 it\u2019s in the general ballpark, maybe 94%, 95%, I think what about 67%, as you said, maybe it\u2019s 5% to 6%, but around that range is what I would expect to see this year as well.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for the details there. And maybe, Rajiv, if I can ask a question, if you can talk about the demand trends by region, are the shutdowns in China impacting you either directly or indirectly? And if you can just touch on the business with your partnership with Red Hat, any progress or anything happening there? Thank you so much.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. We didn\u2019t see any significant difference in terms of performance across regions. As you know, our business in China is relatively small, so not a direct impact there. And then of course, the indirect impact, that\u2019s really up to our customers. We haven\u2019t seen \u2013 we haven\u2019t really seen anything significant for us as a result of that directly. In terms of Red Hat, continuing to see good momentum with Red Hat this quarter as well. We continue to see a growing pipeline with some wins this first quarter. For example, we saw a Ministry in Asia-Pac combining the two, right. They had OpenShift and our cloud platform, so, from a three tier solution to our platform using our own hypervisor. So, this is an example of the kind of deal that we work on together with them. And we are seeing that continue to grow along nicely.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thank you for all the details.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I am showing no further questions in the queue. Ladies and gentlemen, this [Technical Difficulty] attending this conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich and good afternoon everyone. Against a volatile macro backdrop, we delivered a good first quarter. We exceeded all of our guided metrics and saw continued strong performance in our renewals business. Supply chain constraints with our server partners while remaining a headwind improved somewhat compared with the prior quarter. With respect to the macro backdrop, in our first quarter, we continue to see businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and data center modernization initiatives enabled by our platform. We have seen anecdotal evidence of increased inspection of deals by customers, which we believe is likely related to the more uncertain macro backdrop. We continue to factor this uncertainty into our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Taking a closer look at the first quarter, we delivered ACV billings and revenue above our guidance, driven by strong continued performance of our renewals business. We again demonstrated good expense management coming in slightly below our OpEx targets. Top line outperformance, combined with diligent expense management, enabled us to achieve positive non-GAAP operating income for the first time, another milestone in our drive towards sustainable, profitable growth. Finally, strong billings linearity and collections contributed to generation of $46 million of free cash flow, meaningfully exceeding our breakeven target and continuing our strong recent free cash flow performance. Overall, I am pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter. Our first quarter is typically a stronger one for our federal business and this one was no exception. Our largest customer in the quarter was a federal civilian agency that was already a significant user of Nutanix's cloud platform, including our unified storage and database automation solutions as well as Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2, on AWS for bursting additional resource capacity into the public cloud. This customer added additional cybersecurity workloads to the Nutanix Cloud Platform, reflecting their confidence in the ability of our platform to handle their most business-critical applications and resulting in a substantial expansion order for us. We see this customer as a great example of how we are able to land and expand with some of the largest organizations in the world. On the product and partnership front, we achieved an important milestone in realizing our hybrid multi-cloud vision with the general availability of NC2 on Microsoft Azure. Now with support of AWS, Azure and service provider cloud environment, we continue to deliver on our hybrid multi-cloud vision. Our customers have the ability to rapidly and seamlessly shift their workloads between their private clouds and the largest public cloud providers, with a consistent management, governance and data services provided by the Nutanix Cloud Platform, all without the time and expense of refactoring their workloads. One of our early customers for NC2 on Azure is Unum Group, a Fortune 500 financial services provider, who is part of our customer preview program. Unum chose NC2 on Azure, because they were looking to leverage our seamless hybrid multi-cloud platform for disaster recovery as well as to migrate and run their workloads in Azure without having to refactor their applications. They are also looking to take advantage of the ability to expand their Nutanix cloud platform to different Azure regions on demand. Another exciting development on the product front is the recent enhancements we made to our platform to accelerate adoption of Kubernetes-based applications in the enterprise. In keeping with our philosophy of offering customers choice throughout the stack, we added Amazon's Kubernetes service to an already long list of supported Kubernetes container platforms, including Red Hat, OpenShift, SUSE Rancher, Google Anthos, Azure Arc and our native Nutanix Kubernetes Engine. We also added built-in infrastructure as core capabilities and advanced cloud-native data services for modern applications, both of which will enhance the Nutanix cloud platform's ability to efficiently run Kubernetes applications at scale. Go-to-market leverage is one of my top priorities and we saw progress across a number of partner categories in the first quarter. In the public cloud category, our customers are now able to get on-demand consumption of Nutanix software through Azure marketplace, facilitating frictionless license procurement and movement of workloads between private cloud and Azure. For our channel partners, we updated our Elevate Partner Program ecosystem, which enhanced incentives to encourage and enable these partners to sell Nutanix into net new accounts and to drive opportunities through the entire sales cycle autonomously. In addition, we rolled out training designed to enable partners to speed up sales cycles through rapid capacity planning, quoting and order fulfillment, thereby generating more leverage for our sales rep. Finally, our two largest new customer wins in the quarter were in partnership with a global leader in data center colocation and interconnection services and part of our service provider program. We are encouraged by the early progress we are seeing with service providers and see good growth potential in our service provider-related businesses as we add additional partners and enhancements to our platform, supporting service provider business models. One of these service provider wins was from an EMEA-based publishing and education company that was looking to modernize and consolidate their data center footprint while having disaster recovery capability in AWS. They chose our Nutanix cloud platform, including Nutanix cloud management to run their business-critical applications, leveraging its simplicity and built-in automation for Infrastructure as a Service. They also added Nutanix unified storage to service their unstructured data needs. We see this as a great example of a customer adopting our full stack offering to consolidate and modernize their IT infrastructure. And now, I'd like to talk about the industry recognition we continue to receive for our solutions. For the second year in a row, Nutanix was named a visionary in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Distributed File Systems and Object Storage. We believe our improved position within the Visionary Quadrant this year reflects advances in customer traction, go-to-market efforts, enhanced product capabilities, and an expanded ecosystem for our Nutanix unified storage solution. With customers needing a simple and secure way to manage and protect their data, this recognition highlights the advantages of Nutanix unified storage. In closing, I'd like to provide some thoughts on our priorities and outlook. First, our overarching priority remains driving towards sustainable profitable growth through judicious investment in the business, execution on a growing base of renewals, and diligent expense management. Our achievement of positive non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter represents tangible progress towards this goal. The strength of our business model is underpinned by a growing base of renewals and the strong value proposition of our platform in an uncertain macro landscape. I remain confident in our ability to continue to capitalize on the vast opportunity in front of us while driving towards sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini? Yes, Tim, thank you for the question. Rajiv here. First of all, I think, as we've said, we've got a good, strong and growing base of renewals. And that's performing well and that certainly helped reduce the risk in the model. And as we did say, we have taken into account a little bit of this uncertainty in the macro environment in our guidance. We have built some conservatism in terms of IT spending. And I wouldn't necessarily say that HCI is completely immune from a potential slowdown in IT spending. But HCI per se produces better TCO compared to legacy architecture, and it's a foundation for the hybrid cloud. So from that perspective, customers can actually save money by moving to HCI from traditional legacy architectures. So so far, when you look at the macro again, we've seen greater inspection of deals by some customers, which could potentially lead to an increase in sales cycles but we have factored this into our guidance. Yes. And again, that's a good question. Increasingly, more and more of our conversations with our customers are around how can we efficiently help them operate in this multi-cloud environment. Many of our customers have looked at public cloud. They have moved to the public cloud in portions and they are also realizing that it can be expensive. And so what we tell them is that we can actually help them take their existing workloads and move it and run it very efficiently in the public cloud, and we can save money and optimize how we do it for them. So yes, it's an increasing part of our conversation. I think the broader theme here is almost with every customer that I talk to, we are talking about how to help them operate well in a multi-cloud world and how we can save them money, how we can make it simpler for them, both from an ongoing CapEx cost, but also in terms of the people side of this equation in terms of having a consistent operating environment where you don't have to have different teams to operate each of these cloud environments. So it's very much becoming a centerpiece of many of our conversations there. Yes. I think two good questions there, Meta. And on the first one, there is multiple portions to this. As you said, the renewals business is largely a steady state, not impacted by the uncertain macro. Now in terms of the uncertain macro, we've taken some of that into our account \u2013 into account when we give you a conservative forecast. To your point, we have seen anecdotal evidence of greater inspection of deals by some customers. And what that also means is that potentially there could be an increase in sales cycles. We haven't quite seen that as much yet happening, but this is an indication of what might be coming. And we have factored those in, in terms of our guidance per se. Now, Rukmini you may want to comment on the foreign FX impact as well here in terms of the macro. Yes. And Meta, on the other question around how other M&A activity is potentially impacting us, yes, we have all \u2013 we are all reading the news around Broadcom acquiring VMware. And what we have seen as a result of that is a significantly higher level of engagement from prospective customers. These customers are looking to explore their options looking at managing potential risks related to the transaction. Now as you know, our sales cycles, especially for larger deals tend to be 9 months to 12 months. So, we are not assuming any significant benefit from that in our fiscal \u201823 outlook. But I can certainly tell you that the volume of conversations with these customers and prospective customers around this topic has increased, and we are a good alternative provider. Yes. So look, I think first of all, accelerating digital transformation continues to be a key driver for customers. And we are seeing this across all kinds of industries here, particularly in verticals such as financial services, healthcare, state, local education. There is a clear mandate to modernize IT operations and applications, improve costs and help the business redirect non-productive legacy kind of spend. Now, in the current macro, I would say this is intensified. There is even more of a focus on cost and better TCO. So, from that perspective, modernizing legacy treated infrastructure, especially when things are up for renewal, right, up for a cycle, you are running out of \u2013 your hardware is getting old. HCI is a very viable option for improving TCO, simplifying operations, making things much simpler. So, we haven't quite seen a slowdown in that mindset with customers. I mean the other thing for us we see is that, HCI has now also become a platform for where customers can run all their workloads, including all their highest performance, most mission-critical workloads. We saw an example of that here in the call where we talked about this large Federal agency, but there are many other customers who are doing that. And then finally, I would say we are also seeing more people looking at hybrid multi-cloud and how they can operate efficiently in this cloud environment for which, again, our solution is a good option. So, can help them run in the right private cloud or public cloud based on criteria on cost, performance and governance. So, all of that I think is continuing to play out there, even despite the macro situation. Yes, Rukmini? Maybe, Rukmini, I will just give a high-level view. I would just say that we are not as much focused on cost-cutting. I mean a lot of the efficiency in the model is coming from the fact that we are seeing a growing base of renewals that can be prosecuted at a significantly lower cost than our traditionally new business. Now, we have been focused on efficiencies already over the last few years in every area. On the sales side, we are focused on increasing sales productivity. On the marketing side, we have already redirected and optimized our demand generation dollars to be mostly digital with some hybrid events. We have simplified our product portfolio. So, we have been doing the right things in terms of efficiency and so forth. So, that's where I will leave it. And Rukmini, if you want to add anything? Absolutely. That's actually a very good question because we are seeing a trend in the market where more customers would like to consume more offerings deliver to them as a service. And there is many routes to getting there. One of our first route is through service providers. And as you saw, for example, this quarter, this last quarter, there were two largest lines came through partnering with service providers. And these are service providers, in some cases, who will take us and sell through, right, and provide a service to their customers. So, that's one approach. HPE GreenLake is another approach where HPE GreenLake includes Nutanix as part of their offering, and they can provide a combined hardware-software solution delivered as-a-service in a subscription model to their customers. And selectively, some of our own offerings are also available directly as-a-service, but those are small relatively speaking, in our portfolio, especially some of our management offerings are delivered even today as-a-service, but that's a small portion lately. But largely, we are focused on enabling as-a-service models to our partners, whether they would be service providers, whether they would be strategic partners like HPE. And the only other thing I would just add there, sorry, I should say this. We are also an Azure marketplace right now where an Azure customer can use Azure, their Azure spend dollars and buy Nutanix through the marketplace. Yes. Our rep headcount was roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. We do expect to grow our rep headcount modestly from current levels, while at the same time, continuing to focus on driving higher rep productivity. Yes. We didn't see any significant difference in terms of performance across regions. As you know, our business in China is relatively small, so not a direct impact there. And then of course, the indirect impact, that's really up to our customers. We haven't seen \u2013 we haven't really seen anything significant for us as a result of that directly. In terms of Red Hat, continuing to see good momentum with Red Hat this quarter as well. We continue to see a growing pipeline with some wins this first quarter. For example, we saw a Ministry in Asia-Pac combining the two, right. They had OpenShift and our cloud platform, so, from a three tier solution to our platform using our own hypervisor. So, this is an example of the kind of deal that we work on together with them. And we are seeing that continue to grow along nicely."

            "name": "Rukmini Sivaraman",
            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. I will first walk through our Q1 results, followed by our outlook for Q2 and then finally, provide an update on our fiscal year \u201823 outlook. Q1 \u201823 was a good quarter with results that came in better than our guidance and across all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q1 was $232 million, higher than our guidance of $210 million to $215 million and representing a year-over-year growth of 27%. A significant majority of that growth came from growth in renewals billings. Revenue in Q1 was $434 million, higher than our guidance of $410 million to $415 million and a year-over-year growth rate of 15%. ARR at the end of Q1 was $1.281 billion, a year-over-year growth of 34%. New logo additions were about 530 in Q1. Contract duration decreased quarter-over-quarter to 3 years as expected, partly due to a seasonally higher mix of U.S. federal business that typically has shorter contract durations. As described previously, the percentage of orders with future start dates continue to be a key assumption in our Q1 guidance. This percentage came in lower than it was in Q4 \u201822 and slightly below our expectations. Q1 revenue also benefited approximately $12 million from the improvement in percentage of future start dates from Q4 to Q1 as more license revenue was recognized in quarter than deferred. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 83% because of our higher-than-expected revenue performance. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was positive 2%, our first quarter of positive non-GAAP operating profit and a proof point of our ongoing focus on profitable growth. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q1 were $351 million, better than our guidance of $360 million to $365 million, and included about $2 million of benefit from favorable currency exchange rates in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $8 million or EPS of $0.03 per share based on weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 275 million shares. We are happy to report positive net income and EPS for the first time in the history of Nutanix. Billings linearity was very good in Q1 and better than our expectations. DSOs were 18 days in Q1, a demonstration of good linearity and strong collections. We expect DSOs to trend back up to historical levels going forward. The strong billings linearity and collections contributed to free cash flow generation of $46 million in Q1, significantly better than our expectations. We also collected in Q1 about $10 million of invoices due in early Q2. We are finding that while our cash collections remain strong, there is a normal level of variation in timing of payments from quarter-to-quarter. Going forward and given our transition into positive free cash flow generation, we expect to provide color on free cash flow on an annual basis. A brief note on severance payments related to our reduction in force that we announced in August. One, we expect the severance payments to total about $17 million rather than our previously estimated range of $20 million to $25 million; and two, about $6 million of the approximately $17 million in severance payments are being delayed to Q2, mainly in non-U.S. regions when we had previously assumed that the full amount would be paid in Q1. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.388 billion, up slightly from $1.324 billion in Q4 \u201822. Moving on to Q2 outlook. The guidance for Q2 \u201823 is as follows: ACV billings of $245 million to $260 million, implying a year-over-year growth rate of 13% at the midpoint. Revenue of $460 million to $470 million, a year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint, non-GAAP gross margin of 82% to 83%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 5% to 10%, weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 279 million shares. I'll now provide some more context around our Q2 guidance. First, the top line guidance for Q2 assumes that supply chain dynamics for our server partners would remain more or less the same compared to Q1 \u201823. Second, it assumes that contract durations would stay approximately flat in Q2 \u201823 compared to Q1 \u201823. Third, the revenue guidance includes approximately $10 million of revenue benefit from the decline in percentage of orders with future start dates over the last few months. Said differently, we expect to recognize more license revenue in Q2 than is deferred similar to the dynamic we saw in Q1. Over time, as our partner supply chain constraints resolve and our future start date percentages normalize, we would expect this dynamic to normalize as well. I will now provide an update on our full year 2023 guidance. While we had a good Q1 and our renewals business continues to provide a strong foundation for growth and efficiency, the macro environment remains uncertain, and we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in our full year top line guide, which remains unchanged. We also remain focused on disciplined expense management and are, therefore, raising our operating margin and free cash flow outlook for the year. Our guidance for full year fiscal year 2023 is as follows: ACV billings guidance remains unchanged at $895 million to $900 million, year-over-year growth of 19% at the midpoint. Revenue guidance remains unchanged at $1.77 billion to $1.78 billion, year-over-year growth of 12% at the midpoint, non-GAAP gross margin of 82% to 83% and non-GAAP operating margin of 2% to 4%. I'll now provide some color on our full year guidance. First, similar to our comments last quarter, the full year guidance assumes that contract durations would decrease slightly compared to fiscal year \u201822. The fiscal year \u201823 revenue guidance also assumes that the percentage of orders with future start dates would remain more or less the same in Q2 compared to Q1 and would start to ease slightly in the second half of the fiscal year. Second, the demand for our solutions continues and we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities. However, as Rajiv mentioned, we have started to see some anecdotal evidence of increased inspection on deals which we believe is likely related to the more uncertain macro backdrop and which could potentially lead to an increase in sales cycles. We have considered this dynamic and the uncertain macro environment in our guidance. We expect that the significant majority of our growth in ACV billings for fiscal year \u201823 will come from growth in renewals ACV billings. With the uncertainty in the macro environment factored into our expectations for new and expansion ACV billings. At the same time, our continued focus on expense management and operating discipline enables us to increase our operating margin and free cash flow outlook for the year. Which is a good segue to the third point, which is that we expect to deliver about $100 million to $125 million of free cash flow for fiscal year \u201823, an increase from our prior expectations of $75 million to $100 million. Finally, a note on seasonality. As we look ahead to the second half, we expect to see a low double-digit percentage decline quarter-over-quarter in ACV billings in the third quarter followed by a low double-digit percentage increase quarter-over-quarter in ACV billings in the fourth quarter. In closing, we are pleased that our Q1 results reflect our continued execution towards our stated objective of sustainable, profitable growth, and we expect to continue that focus. We look forward to sharing more about our medium-term outlook during our Investor Day in April 2023, as Rich referenced. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. And I'll take the backlog portion of that question. Hi, Jim, so as you point out, we had noted when we announced our fiscal \u201822 results that we ended fiscal \u201822 with a record level of backlog, which, combined with our growing base of renewals, as Rajiv said, provided a foundation for our growth in fiscal \u201823 and helped overall reduce the risk inherent in our forecast. So in the first quarter, consistent with our expectations and consistent with typical seasonality, we did use some backlog. And the only other comment I'd add is that given the unusually high level of backlog we entered the year with, I think some of which was related to our partners, supply chain issues, we would expect that over the course of the year, we would likely consume some backlog. Yes. Well I will do that and then I can hand it back to you on the more broader question on M&A. So, obviously, the dollar has strengthened. I think as we all know, our sales contracts are all denominated in U.S. dollars. And so that relative strengthening has effectively made our products more expensive to customers in some international markets. And so anecdotally, and this is not something we have seen systemically, but we have seen it sort of put pressure on some price negotiations and some transactions. And we don't believe that, that's causing us to lose deals. But anecdotally, we have seen it show up in some transactions. Yes. Thank you for the question. So, our GRR or gross retention rates remain in line with sort of our stated objective of in the 90%-plus range. No, I think that was a good summary, Rajiv. Yes. Hi Ruplu, thanks for the question. And yes, and we called it out because we want to just want to provide some color on how seasonality would \u2013 we expect seasonal to show up for the rest of the year. And so just to reiterate what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect to see a low-double digit percentage decline quarter-over-quarter in ACV billings in the third quarter. Which by the way, seasonally, we do see a decline in ACV billings from Q2 to Q3 but low-double digit percentages is a little higher than what we normally see, which is the way we wanted to call it out. And then followed by \u2013 in Q4, we expect low-double digit percentage increase quarter-over-quarter in ACV billings. And to answer your question, Ruplu, our available to renew pool that is due in Q3 is expected to be lower than it is in Q2 and then expect it to then pick back up in Q4. So that, combined with our typical quarterly seasonality, leads us to expect that this trend will occur for the second half of \u201823. So, generally, the concept still holds, Ruplu, because effectively what we do, just to remind folks on why we had that out there is that when we report the quarterly ACV numbers, we have some contracts that come in for less than a year duration, and we do annualize those to report ACV billings on a quarterly basis. Of course, on an annualized basis, we sort of normalize for that. And so that's what Ruplu is referring to. And I would say that, that \u2013 it's in the general ballpark, maybe 94%, 95%, I think what about 67%, as you said, maybe it's 5% to 6%, but around that range is what I would expect to see this year as well."

Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich and good afternoon everyone. Our fourth quarter was a solid finish to our 2024 fiscal year. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions, driven by businesses prioritizing infrastructure modernization initiatives, while looking to adopt hybrid multi-cloud operating models, and optimize their total cost of ownership. In the fourth quarter, we are happy to have exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered quarterly revenue of $548 million, up 11% on year-over-year and saw another quarter of strong free cash flow generation. We also saw the highest number of new logos we've seen in three years, an encouraging sign of building traction with some of our go-to-market partnerships and initiatives. Our full year 2024 results demonstrated progress on a number of fronts. Financially, we delivered solid top line performance, driven by continued strong performance from our renewals business. We saw good growth in our pipeline of larger deals as we shifted our focus up-market and saw increased engagement from prospects, looking for alternatives to their existing infrastructure solutions. Even as our land and expand business underperformed related to our internal expectations due to the longer-than-expected sales cycles we see, we delivered revenue of $2.15 billion, up 15% year-over-year and ARR of $1.91 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Our bottom line performance was even stronger. We generated free cash flow of $598 million, almost three times higher than last year, resulting in a free cash flow margin of 28% and a Rule of 40 score of 43. In FY 2024, we also saw tangible progress on the partnership front with significant new or enhanced partnerships with Cisco, Dell and NVIDIA. And I'm pleased that Dell XC Plus, our new turnkey HCI-based appliance offering with Dell is now generally available. We see these partnerships is both expanding our addressable market and providing us with meaningful go-to-market leverage. Finally, we continue to innovate in FY 2024, with important new product releases and enhancements to our Nutanix cloud platform. These included the launch of GPT in-a-box, our solution for streamlining the adoption of generative AI by enterprises. We made meaningful progress towards our goal of becoming the best platform for modern applications, including launch of Nutanix Data Services for Kubernetes or NDK, which offers consistent data services across both virtual machines and container stats, as well as the recent release of Nutanix Kubernetes Platform or NKP, to simplify management of modern applications, on-premises and in any native public cloud service. Our most significant wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of Nutanix cloud platform to organizations that are looking to modernize their IT footprints and adopt hybrid cloud operating models, as well as those looking for alternatives in the wake of recent industry M&A. Our largest win in Q4 was a multimillion-dollar ACV deal with a North American-based Fortune 100 financial services company. Following a roughly 1.5 year engagement with us, they chose to replace their existing solution to Nutanix Cloud platform, including our AHV hypervisor as well as Nutanix cloud manager. This customer, who had been using a competing HCI solution in much of the footprint was able to utilize their existing hardware for Nutanix software deployment, obviating the need for a hardware refresh. We also had a number of significant wins that included our Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2 capability, which enables workloads to be seamlessly and efficiently run in both private and public clouds. One of these was with an existing customer, an EMEA-based provider of global research services. This customer was looking to accelerate the migration of their workloads to the public cloud, while ensuring the workloads once migrated, will run as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Having already made a commitment to Microsoft Azure, they purchased licenses for Nutanix cloud platform through the Azure marketplace with the intent of utilizing its NC2 capability to shift their on-prem workloads to Azure. Another good example was a significant new customer win, with a top North American university. Most of our customers start with our platform on prem. However, this customer was motivated by their decision to migrate away from a competing platform they were using to run their virtual machine workloads at scale in the public cloud on AWS, due to dissatisfaction with recent changes at their existing supplier. They chose Nutanix cloud platform to migrate their applications running in the public cloud to our NC2 on AWS, while also adopting our cloud platform to run their on-prem workloads. We also plan on Nutanix cloud manager for consistent health service and automation across their private and public cloud state. A final notable example is a win with an Asia-based Global 2000 semiconductor provider. This full stack win, which is also a displacement of our primary competitor, enables the customer to streamline their operations, increase their level of automation, and reduce their dependence on more expensive proprietary storage solutions. It included adoption of Nutanix database service, or NDD to enable them to move off of their expensive commercial databases to open source databases managed by NDD. This customer also plans to adopt our unified storage solutions, replacing multiple third-party storage options. Finally, we also plan on utilizing NC2 on Azure to enable them to shift applications to the public cloud, including performing lift and shifts of IT workloads of acquired companies. We see these wins as reflecting the value customers see in our platform as they look for seamless and efficient application portability, while adopting hybrid multi-cloud operating models, as well as the value of our partnerships with Azure and AWS. In closing, I am pleased with our solid Q4 and fiscal 2024 results, and the progress we continue to make on multiple fronts, including our financial model, our partnerships and our ongoing innovation in our cloud platform towards our goal of becoming the leading platform for running applications and managing data anywhere. We also remain focused on capitalizing on what we view as a long-term opportunity to gain share in face of recent industry disruption and are encouraged by our early successes, including some of the wins I just highlighted. Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our investors, customers and partners for their trust in us and to our employees for their hard work that led to these results. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I will first discuss our Q4 fiscal 2024 and full fiscal year 2024 results, followed by our guidance for Q1 fiscal 2025 and for the full fiscal year 2025. Results in Q4 2024 came in above the high end of our range across all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q4 were $338 million, above the guided range of $295 million to $305 million, representing year-over-year growth of 21%. Revenue in Q4 was $548 million, higher than the guided range of $530 million to $540 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 11%. ARR at the end of Q4 was $1.908 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 22%. In Q4, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. Average contract duration in Q4 was 3.1 years, 0.1 year higher than Q3. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 86.9%, higher than our guided range of 85% to 86%. Non-GAAP operating margin in to was 12.9% higher than our guided range of 9% to 10%, largely due to one, lower operating expenses as a result of higher-than-expected non-recurring payments related to one of our partnership agreements and a few other items; and two, slightly higher gross margin and revenue. Non-GAAP net income in Q4 was $76 million or fully diluted EPS of $0.27 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 285 million shares. DSOs based on revenue and ending accounts receivable were 39 days in Q4. Free cash flow in Q4 was $224 million, representing free cash flow margin of 41%. Free cash flow in Q4 benefited from the collection on the 8-figure ACV transaction that was booked in fiscal Q3. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with cash, cash equivalence and short-term investments of $994 million, down from $1.651 billion at the end of Q3. The primary reason for the reduction in our cash balance was Bain Capital's conversion of the 2026 notes, which we announced in June. We settled the conversion in Q4 by paying $817.6 million in cash and delivering approximately 16.9 million shares of common stock. Please note that the entire conversion value had previously already been included in our fully diluted weighted average share count on an if-converted basis. The actual settlement included a portion settled in cash rather than exclusively in shares, resulting in the issuance of approximately 17 million shares, which is 12 million lower than the 29 million that we had previously included on an if-converted basis. Moving to capital allocation. We repurchased about $25 million worth of shares in Q4 and $131 million worth of shares in all of fiscal year 2024 under the share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors. Looking at our full year financial results, we exceeded the high end of all guided metrics for fiscal year 2024. ACV billings in fiscal year 2024 were $1.162 billion, higher than our guidance of $1.12 billion to $1.13 billion, and representing a year-over-year growth of 21%. A reminder that the annual ACV billings is slightly lower than the sum of the ACV billings from the four quarters due to adjustments for deals with duration of less than a year. Revenue in fiscal year 2024 was $2.149 billion, higher than our guidance of $2.13 billion to $2.14 billion and representing a year-over-year growth of 15%. We are pleased to have exceeded the $2 billion revenue threshold in fiscal year 2024. We ended fiscal year 2024 with an ARR of $1.908 billion, as mentioned earlier, a year-over-year growth of 22%. Net dollar-based retention rate, or NRR, at the end of fiscal year 2024 was 114%. As the fiscal year progressed, we saw a higher mix larger deals in our pipeline. These larger opportunities often involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure. And as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels. Largely due to these dynamics, our fiscal year 2024 land and expand ACV and ARR performance were below our initial expectations at the beginning of the fiscal year, and we expect these dynamics to continue. Our renewals performance continues to be good through the fiscal year, and a reminder that renewals tend to be at a lower aggregate average contract duration compared to land and expand. Average contract duration in fiscal year 2024 was 2.95 years, flattish to fiscal year 2023 and slightly higher than expected, partly due to some larger deals with greater than average duration. Non-GAAP gross margin in fiscal year 2024 was 86.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 were $1.515 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year, as we began to make additional investments primarily in research and development and sales and marketing. Non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal year 2024 was 16%, representing an improvement of over 700 basis points year-over-year. We also delivered our first full year of positive GAAP operating income of $8 million in fiscal year 2024. Non-GAAP net income was $384 million, or diluted EPS of $1.31 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 294 million shares. Free cash flow in fiscal year 2024 was $598 million, higher than our guidance of $520 million to $540 million and almost 3 times higher than last year's free cash flow. Free cash flow margin in fiscal year 2024 was 28%, implying free cash flow margin expansion of 17 percentage points year-over-year. Free cash flow in fiscal year 2024 benefited from approximately $30 million in nonrecurring payments related to a partnership agreement, as previously referenced. Overall, fiscal year 2024 was a significant year, marking our first year with positive GAAP operating income, significant free cash flow generation of $598 million and free cash flow margin of 28%, while growing ARR at 22% and revenue at 15% year-over-year. We also delivered a Rule of 40 score defined as the sum of revenue growth and free cash flow margin of 43 for fiscal year 2024, an improvement of 14 percentage points year-over-year and 28 percentage points higher compared to two years ago. Moving to fiscal year 2025. The guidance for the full year is as follows; revenue of $2.435 billion to $2.465 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 15.5% to 17%; free cash flow of $540 million to $600 million, representing a free cash flow margin of approximately 23% at the midpoint. I will now provide some commentary regarding our fiscal year 2025 guidance. First, as previously mentioned at our 2023 Investor Day, we are signing our metrics by not reporting or guiding ACV billings starting in fiscal year 2025. ACV billings was intended as a transitional metric during our subscription evolution, and we believe that now is the time to evolve away from that metric. We are also no longer guiding to GAAP gross margin which was previously useful as we navigated our business model changes, leading to significant improvements in non-GAAP gross margin. We will continue to guide to revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow on an annual basis and to guide to revenue and non-GAAP operating margin for the subsequent quarter. Second, and moving on to assumptions in our guidance, we are seeing continued and significant land-an-d expand opportunities and a growing pipeline for our solution. However, we continue to see a higher mix of larger deals in our pipeline, which is driving greater variability in our land and expand bookings. These larger opportunities often involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals at the customer or prospect, causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome, and deal structure. And as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels, which we expect to continue. Third. The guidance assumes that renewals will continue to perform well in fiscal year 2025. Fourth. The full year guidance assume that average contract duration would be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year 2024, as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billing. Fifth. The non-GAAP operating margin guidance assumes incremental student investments in sales and marketing and R&D targeted towards addressing our large market opportunity. It also factors in the annualized run rate of the incremental investments we made in fiscal year 2024. It also assumes a $20 million to $25 million headwind in operating expenses relative to fiscal year 2024 from payments related one of our partnership agreement. Specifically, there was about $44 million of this benefit to the R&D operating expense line in fiscal year 2024, and we anticipate it be $20 million to $25 million in fiscal year 2025 And sixth. The free cash flow guidance reflects an approximately $30 million headwind relative to fiscal year 2024, from lower interest income as a result of our lower invested cash due to the cash payment on conversion of FY 2026 convertible notes. We expect free cash flow in fiscal year 2025 to also benefit from the approximately $30 million in nonrecurring payments related to a partnership agreement, similar to the benefit we saw in fiscal year 2024. It is expected to tail off towards the end of fiscal year 2025. Moving to Q1 2025. Our guidance for Q1 is as follows; revenue of $565 million to $575 million, non-GAAP operating margin of 14.5% to 15.5%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 287 million shares. In closing, we are pleased that Q4 and fiscal year 2024 performance exceeded guidance across all metrics. We are excited about the long-term market opportunity and Nutanix's ability to deliver compelling outcomes for customers and prospects. We remain committed to continued progress aligned with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth both through durable top line growth and expanding margins. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nQ - George Wang: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Firstly, just curious if you have any update on the Broadcom churn, especially in the last couple of quarters, you just talked about that after the initial wave of strong engagement, the activity slowed just because of Broadcom working back some of the initial initiatives to be now more in favor of retaining some of the priority customers. Just curious if the dynamic has changed.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Hi, George. Rajiv here. Yeah, we are -- it's largely an unchanged multiyear opportunity to gain share, like we said last quarter, while the sales side has been a bit longer than we had initially anticipated. Thus far, we haven't really seen any meaningful changes in our win or loss rates on these opportunities. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we are seeing some of these larger opportunities close. We gave you a few examples in the prepared remarks. And I do expect that we'll continue to see more of these over time. Now in the midsize and smaller customer segments, we're seeing significant increased engagement and opportunity as many of these smaller companies look for alternatives and generally less competitive engagements related to the larger customer opportunities. Along with our increased leverage from our go-to-market partnerships that we've talked about as well as our programs and incentives that we have in place, this dynamic has also been one of our drivers for our larger -- our stronger new logo performance.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Okay, great. Just if I can squeeze in quickly, it's nice to see one customer in financial services, you guys mentioned without changing the underlying hardware, previously, the gating factor \u2013 one of the gating factor has been so the upgrading the underlying hardware to wait for the hardware refresh. I guess, can you talk about sort of a better path going forward kind of now seems especially after Dell partnership, maybe you're kind of removing some of the constraints related to the underlying hardware refresh -- maybe you can give a little bit more color on that.\nRajiv Ramaswami: No, that's a very good question, George. I think if you look at the installed base out there in data centers, a vast majority of it, I don't have the exact number, but roughly around 80% of it is what we call 3-tier infrastructure. Separate storage, compute and networking. And as you know, we have a HCI solution today in the market. And if we want to replace the 3 tier with HCI, it's a better architecture, more cost-effective long-term, but it does require a hardware refresh. Now the remaining 20% is HCI, of which we are a market leader and our competition has some of the rest. Now in this particular case, an example that we talked about, the customer was already on HCI with a competing product. And when you're already on HCI, we've been quite successful having our software to be able to run on existing hardware because it's already a HCI hardware. And that's what happened in this particular account. And so for that subset or customers that are already on HCI, the migration path is easier in some subset of those cases, we don't need a hardware refreshes. That's what happened here. On the 3-tier, it does require a hardware refresh. Now we're also addressing the 3-tier market, to your point, one aspect of our partnership with Dell is that we said we would -- they would be the first that we would support at external storage, Dell PowerFlex. And now the whole idea of doing that is now we can find an easier insertion into feature deployments without having to change out the hardware. Now that solution is not available in the market today. It's only going to be available sometime next year. And over time, we anticipate being able to offer that support to a broader set of third-party storage ways.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll back to the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Fish from Piper Sandler. Your question, please.\nJim Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Rajiv, do you want to ask around essentially -- you alluded to a little bit of GPT in-a-box here. I don't think we've got a conference call anymore without talking about AI, but are you seeing any sort of trend of repatriation of workloads back to private cloud or just a core workload as well as for AI, I guess, any update on the GPT-in-a-Box?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So Jim, good question. I'll give you a two-point answer to that. First, in general purpose work clouds and then second on GPT. For general purpose workloads to your point, for steady-state workloads, I think people are getting to the conclusion that it's much more cost effective to run those on-prem in a private cloud environment. We've seen some repatriation. We've also seen much more deliberation in terms of whether that workload goes to the public cloud in the first place, because a lot of the deployment is still on-prem of enterprise workloads. So we're certainly seeing the trend and realization of customers to say, the steady-state workloads, we can run them more cost effectively in private clouds. Now on GPT specifically, I think a lot of visual interest in Gen AI has been in creation and training of LLMs, large language models, and a lot of that is being done in the public cloud and massive GPU farms. And we don't have -- we don't play there fully. But on the other hand, we think the bulk of the enterprise opportunity in terms of how companies are actually going to use it, is potentially going to be on-prem because at the end of the day, the Gen AI workloads, applications have we run wherever the customer data is. And in a lot of cases, sensitive customer data is either inside data centers or at the edges, and so a platform like our GPT-in-a-Box provides a very simple, easy-to-use, secure, way of running Gen AI applications. And so the use cases that we've seen so far have been around co-piloting, around document search and analysis, around customer support, around enhanced fraud detection. We are seeing certainly continued traction. It's still early days for us, but across multiple verticals, healthcare, financial services, government. So early days for DPT adoption in the private cloud enterprise, but I think that's going to be a growing market for fine tuning, rack retrieval, augmented generation and for inferencing in terms of running these AI workloads close to the data in a private and secure way.\nJim Fish: Makes sense. And Rukmini, I'm sure you're anticipating this question already, but I guess how much, as we think about that 2025 guide, how much incremental contribution are you expecting either from a growth dollar perspective, however you want to put it, between the VMware opportunity, the Cisco and Dell partnerships, versus the expansion within your existing install base that, if memory serves me right, should be accelerating a little bit in terms of the renewals that were grabbed this year? And is there a way to think about where ARR actually exits this year? Thanks, guys.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Jim, for that question. So in terms of contribution from the various buckets that you called out, Jim, so I'll give you some qualitative color on that. So we've talked about, in general, we are happy with our pipeline generation overall. We have talked about the growing pipeline and the fact that the pipeline from larger deals is growing faster. And that can lead to variability, with respect to timing or outcome or more complex deal structures and so on. And so some of those dynamics we expect to continue next year. Similarly, with just modestly elongated sales cycles across the board, not just large deals, but across the board. And we expect that to continue next year as well. In terms of the contribution from Cisco, we do expect the Cisco contribution to grow in fiscal year 2025 relative to last year. And we do expect a small initial contribution from a Dell XC Plus, which is the new offering that's generally available now. And we expect small initial contribution from that in 2025 and expect that to grow as well over time. And so all of that is taken into account when you think about the fiscal year 2025 top line guide that we provided, Jim. The other thing you alluded to is renewals. So yes, our renewals business continues to grow nicely year-over-year. So that's factored in there as well. And I think the last part of your question was around ARR. So -- we will, of course, continue to report ARR on a quarterly basis. And while we noted that the underperformed for fiscal year 2024 relative to our internal expectations, we're not providing guidance for ARR.\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. The only thing I'll add to that, Rukmini, would be -- I think, Jim, you also had a question on the Broadcom opportunity. And like I said, that's largely using, but it's also very difficult to explicitly pass that out, because every one of our deals, historically, we've been -- we have been competing against VMware in the past and that continue. So there's some level of influence. I only -- these are the only reason why people come to us. It's a little hard for us to piece it out separately.\nRukmini Sivaraman : Yes. Thank you, Rajiv. That attribution is certainly nuanced. So, we do expect it to continue to contribute some, but we wouldn't be overly precise on that. So, thank you, thank you, Rajiv, and Jim, for the question.\nJim Fish: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nMeta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Wanted to get a sense of maybe kind of circling back to the questions been asked a couple of times. Just in terms of -- do you feel like you've kind of figured out where Broadcom's line is where kind of the definition of your customer is or are you kind of refining where you think the most actionable opportunities are? Or are you still kind of in that discovery mode of figuring out what are the most actionable opportunities. And then Rukmini, I know Jim just asked about it, but just kind of any of the timing of renewals or co-terming just given that we've had some kind of early renewal dynamics and kind co-terming issues over the past couple of years, we should just be mindful of as we go into fiscal 2025? Thanks.\nRajiv Ramaswami : Hi, Meta. I'll start and then Rukmini can answer the second part. Yes, independent of the Broadcom situation, as we look at our addressable market, historically, Nutanix has been quite strong in what I would call the smaller side of enterprises and the higher end of commercial mid-market. But over the last few years, we have deliberately made it further upmarket towards larger enterprises, because that's where we are underpenetrated and the biggest TAM opportunity sits. So we have realigned our segmentation over the past few years to focus more on that market. Now the products are ready. We have done a lot of work on the product side. The GTM side, now we're ready. We've got some good partnerships. Now we also clearly understand that when you get to the large customers, the G2K accounts, for example, or the Fortune 100-type accounts, those are going to be more competitive. And that's where clearly Broadcom is more focused on. And those engagements tend to be long, they tend to be bigger, but to very fruitful if and when we do win it. And as you can see here, we are starting to win some of those. We talked about an eight-figure ACV win last quarter. This quarter, we had a multimillion dollar ACV win. So those tend to take time, but are well worth it when they do happen. So we've got a focus there, for sure. The mid-market or the smaller side of the enterprises has been historically our sweet spot. And it's also less of a focus for Broadcom, given their explicit focus on the bigger accounts. It also tends to be less competitive and easier migrations as well. So that used to be our historical sweet spot, it continues to be a sweet spot. But the bigger opportunity for us is growth is also now sitting at the top end of the pyramid.\nRukmini Sivaraman : And I'll take the question, Meta, on renewals and expectations for renewals in fiscal year 2025. So, first, I'd say, we did have in fiscal year 2024, just overall good performance in renewals. And I think to your point, it did include really good discipline from the team around economics for the renewals in terms of pricing. It did include some early and core term renewals. And as we said, for those are good in our mind as long as they come at good economics, because the customer is willing to renew with us and renew their commitment to us earlier and often give us the cash earlier as well. And then core terms, of course, the simplification of their real estate, right? So that's both the customer and us well in terms of managing their footprint. So we did have some of that. Now when we look at fiscal year 2025 are available to renew pool, you can think about it as effectively a pipeline for renewals continues to be -- continues to grow. It's a strong year-over-year growth. And it's roughly similar year-over-year growth to what we saw in fiscal year 2024. And then in terms of timing, I think perhaps your question was around seasonality of that, Meta. It does move around a little bit. But in general, our fiscal Q2 and Q4 tend to be sort of higher quarters for us; given Q2 has the calendar year-end and budget flush and things like that. And, of course, fiscal year Q4 is end of our fiscal year and there are incentives around that. So Q2 and Q4 started to have higher in general, available to the new pools relative to Q1 and Q3. But that's how we think about the renewal opportunity in fiscal year 2025.\nMeta Marshall: That\u2019s great. Thanks so much.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Meta.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your question please.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. It's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. I have one for Rajiv and one for Rukmini. Rajiv, is the demand environment materially different from 90 days ago? And can you talk about the pricing environment? Specifically, I think you've said in the past that some customers may wait for their hardware to be depreciated. Is pricing a lever you can use to maybe drive faster share gains for example, can a smaller customer be induced more to go with Nutanix. And as a management team, how do you trade off share gain versus margins? And I have a follow-up for Rukmini.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yeah, those are all very good questions. At a top level, the demand environment has not changed, and it's been fairly stable. As we said over the last several quarters, we are seeing some of elongated sales cycles, people getting more approvals and more awareness of TCO before they make the purchasing decision. So that part has not changed. Now in terms of how we look at the opportunity. Now hardware refresh, as you can see, right, I mean when we do need a hardware fresh, that tends to be a significant factor in terms of customers' timing on a deal. Now the key things to keep in mind is that the hardware refresh is not just at one point in time, hardware refreshes happen depending on the size of the state at various points. And we can use those points to secure an insertion. It may not be a full insertion because hardware orders gets replaced over time and multiple cycle, so we may be able to insert for one workload where a portion of the hardware is getting replaced, say, this year and maybe other portions the hardware we get refreshed in two, three years from now. So that's normal engagement. Now have offered some promotions to customers in terms of providing them some overlapping windows where we can give them discounted licenses for a period of time. Now I will say that hardware costs tend to be quite significant. So it's not that we are able to necessarily subsidize hardware costs ourselves, okay? But sometimes we may be able to work with partners, hardware partners who are more interested in doing that themselves. So that can be a possibility as well when it comes to the hardware costs. And then, look, I think when it comes to landing new customers, especially significant ones, we are willing to be quite aggressive in terms of -- we already have aggressive promotions out there and the incentives for customers. And we will do what is needed within reasonable bounds to go win these deals, while at the same time protecting our margins. So that's probably a broad answer. I would say net-net, we are being aggressive wherever needed. We are working with hardware partners to see if we can mitigate some better fresh opportunities. And at the same time, keep in mind, Ruplu, we are also working to broaden the set of places where we can insert without requiring a hardware refresh, existing HDI environments, or the ability to reuse servers that customers may already invested in. And then over time, as we get our third-party storage support, we'll be able to do more -- even more of that.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thank you, Rajiv for the detailed answer there. Rukmini, I wanted to ask you, your free cash flow guidance for fiscal 2025 is very strong, above the prior 2023 Investor Day guidance. How should we think about the cadence of that in the first half versus the second half of fiscal 2025? And then when we look at the remaining metrics, for example, revenue is now at the lower end of what you had thought, what you had guided in the Analyst Day, is it given that, is it reasonable for investors to expect that the outer year, say, fiscal 2027 expectations should also be lower? Or could there be a material acceleration over the next two years, given the dynamics of renewables and available to renew as well as new logos that you're winning?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi, Ruplu. Thank you for that question. So first, I think your first question was around free cash flow. And so we are pleased with our free cash flow performance in fiscal year 2024 and happy to guide to free cash flow where we did, which, as you noted, the midpoint is above the high end of the range of what we had put out last year at our Investor Day. Now in terms of the quarterly cadence there, Ruplu, we don't, of course, guide quarterly to free cash flow so there can be some variation there, including, as pointed out in the last couple of quarters where -- because we collect cash for multiple years upfront, generally, meaningful deals, right, if there are larger deals that we collect cash for upfront or if it's a longer duration transaction, then that those can cost swings, Ruplu. So yes, so we don't guide to quarterly, but that's sort of the quality of color. I will say that when you think about -- the operating expense increase over time. We've talked about you can sort of see the implied OpEx growth year-over-year on our margin guide. And that would be more gradual over time, right, because we're going to invest in sales and marketing and in R&D -- and some of that will be over time. The OpEx does include, for example, all of the annualized run rate from investments in 2024, all those are annualized into 2025, plus it includes salary raises for our employees that became effective. So some of those are more run rate and others will be more gradual as we ramp into the -- into the spend over time. So that's the first part of your question. And I think the second part was more around the sort of medium- to longer-term financial targets that we put out at our last Investor Day. So while we don't plan on commenting on those medium-term financial targets on an interim basis, we are happy to note as you just said, Ruplu, that the fiscal year 2025 free cash flow guidance at the midpoint is above the range of what we have put out at Investor Day. And our initial fiscal year 2025 revenue guide is within the range that we have provided at that time. We continue to focus on driving durable top line growth and expanding free cash flow and operating margin and driving to operating sustainably at a rule of 40 plus over time. So that's sort of been our philosophy, and we continue to drive that philosophy, and we're not commenting specifically on those numbers at this point.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thank you for all the details, and congrats on the results. Thank you.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Ruplu.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. You question, please.\nJason Ader: Yes. Thank you. One quick one is on the eight-figure deal that you announced last quarter. Did you recognize any revenue this quarter from that deal? And then what's the kind of schedule look like on rev rec for that particular transaction?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Thank you, Jason. So, as we said, I think last quarter, we did collect the cash for that transaction, the entire sort of PCV value of that transaction. But all of the revenue recognition is over multiple years starting in fiscal year 2025. So no, we didn't -- I think there was a small professional services portion that began in Q4, Jason, but all the license revenue is in fiscal year 2025 and beyond.\nJason Ader: Okay. Thank you. And then, Rajiv, for you, just I think a bunch of people have asked this question around the VMware displacement opportunity. But I wanted to kind of frame it like this, which is -- do you think you have a little bit of misalignment from a go-to-market standpoint right now just because you're moving up market over the last couple of years in terms of the types of customers that you're targeting, and yet it seems like most of the low-hanging fruit from VMware disruption is coming more in that low end of -- lower end of the market and kind of low end of the enterprise?\nRajiv Ramaswami : So to be clear, Jason, I don't think we're misaligned, because we are targeting our GTM resources on where we see the maximum dollar opportunity lies, right? And the more of the dollar opportunity is sitting higher up in the pyramid, better which is the same reason by Broadcom is equally focused on those customers, right? So for us to grow, I mean, we already have -- we are well penetrated in the lower end of the market, and we will continue to -- we still have very much focused there, right? We haven't moved away from that. That's our sweet spot. That's our installed base, and that's where we can go in and capture more customers. We are talking about everything ranging from school districts to retailers, to those types of public sector. These are all types, very much a sweet spot. But the bigger SAM opportunities for us, certainly, sitting in the top of the pyramid, and so we have to, as a company, to be successful. We have to go after those, right? And we have the products, we have the GTM. Yes, we know those are going to be harder fought. But when we do win them, like you saw with the eight-figure opportunity that we won last quarter, those can be pretty significant.\nJason Ader: Got you. But I thought the eight-figure one that you won last quarter was like a three-year so or 2.5 year sales cycle or something that wasn't really related to the Broadcom.\nRajiv Ramaswami : Well, I think it's partly related to the Broadcom thing, very much so. I mean, like, again, it's hard to attribute everything 100% to Broadcom. Yes, we were engaged with them for two years, but a lot of the big customers at the very top of the pyramid are -- were very sensitive and aware as soon as the Broadcom deal was announced, they started thinking about what they're going to do. It didn't wait for the deal to close, unlike many of the smaller customers to see what was going to happen. So this customer -- we had certainly a unique value proposition and our use cases that they were driving the thinking and then the Broadcom piece, of course, was an added boost. So it's one of these things where it's hard to attribute how much of it was Broadcom, how much of it was something else? But that's a good example. Similarly, the example from this quarter's call also is very much the same, right? This Fortune 100 financial services customer very much driven by the Broadcom situation.\nJason Ader: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your question, please.\nVictor Chiu: Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. I wanted to follow up on that last question kind of regarding customer migrations. Within VMware's footprint -- the 3-tier infrastructure customers that you described. Can you help us think about what percentage of those would be able to fairly easily adapt their existing application platforms to AHV and kind of what percentage for better or worse kind of married to VMware because of their dependency on some of the more advanced kind of virtualization functionalities on that?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So that's a good question, Victor. I would say the vast majority of applications running on a VMware high provider on 3-tier can run very well on AHV and HCI environment. There are perhaps things at the edges, where it's not technical gaps, it's really more ecosystem certification gaps that might hinder some of them. There might be an application that's certified on ESX, but not certified on AHV. And over the last few years, we've built that out as well. So there are going to be some convocations that are not certified. But for the most part, we can address pretty much anything that is running on a 3-tier infrastructure on VMware and run that effectively on Nutanix HCI on AHV. But there's the other barriers we talked about, right, in terms of hardware refresh cycles and then the timing of the renewals. Those are some of the other things that we still have to factor in, but it's not a technical barrier.\nVictor Chiu: Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe can you help us think about how the economics compare with Nutanix having an AHV, having a head of a hypervisor included in the platform, the economics, does that make the economic materially different? Or is it just kind of marginal difference in more of a capabilities kind of thing\u2026\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I think -- so Victor on that again, so clearly, historically, this has been the case when a customer migrates from a 3-tier deployment over to Health tier deployment. They save a lot, right? They save 30%, 40%, at least in terms of TCO costs. If we factor in everything, including the hardware cost, the operating cost, all of it is a pretty substantial savings. And so that continues to be the case today, right? I think the battery, of course, is you've got -- you've invested in the hardware, you want to depreciate it before you actually go buy new hardware. But those savings and the value of HCI related to 3-tier is very established and that continues.\nVictor Chiu: And is the transition for an existing VMware HCI customer to Nutanix much easier?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Much easier. Yes, this Fortune 100 win that we talked about was exactly that situation. The customer had a lot of competitive HCI offerings deployed. It was an easier migration because for them, they didn't have to change out their hardware. We could just replace the other software without software.\nVictor Chiu: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Victor.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Simran [ph] on for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on the quarter. May just have one. Can you touch more on the linearity of large deals within the quarter? And did you see any deals being pushed out or pulled in this quarter? And then looking ahead, what early trends have you been seeing so far in August? And then maybe just general linearity for 2025, given some of the uncertainty of these large deal timing. Thanks.\nRukmini Sivaraman: I'll take that, Rajiv, you should proceed to add in. So for linearity in Q4 I would say it was more or less as we expected. I think, your question specifically was on linearity with respect to large deals. And those we've talked about can be more unpredictable than other portions of the business is given they tend to be often more strategic, involved C-suite approvals, things like that. It can be more unpredictable. But overall, I would say linearity in Q4 was largely as expected. In terms of push out or pull in, I think at the next part of the question as we think about last Q4 coming into this year. Nothing unusual there, I would note. I think it was what we think would expect for that time of year. So nothing unusual there. And then again, on August linearity, the only thing to call out in Q1 is its US federal end of fiscal year in September, of course. But again, that's all factored into how we think about our guidance and ability to collect free cash flow and things like that. But as I said earlier, I think the overall linearity can become a little more unpredictable because of the mix of the large deals as that that grows over time, and it is something we're continuing to watch closely.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos from Needham. Your question please.\nMike Cikos: Thank you for taking the question guys. I just wanted to ask, I know last quarter, the company gave some great color on the number of million dollar plus ACV opportunities in the pipeline, growing 30% year-on-year, growing more than 50% if we look at it on a dollar basis. Did these statistics still hold in Q4? And do we have a sizable enough cohort to start really understanding how much longer these sales cycles are for these deals?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi, Mike. Yeah, good question. So we're not going to provide that metric necessarily quarterly, Mike. But as we said, I think we are happy overall with pipe creation and are seeing meaningful opportunities with those larger deal segments. So that continues to be good in terms of pipe creation. And I think your second question around do we have enough data points, it\u2019s still relatively early. The pipeline has grown nicely. But as we've talked about here, some of these larger deals can take a really long time, I would give one example where it was two years, another one this quarter where it was 1.5 years. And so it is variable and it can take long. And so I'd say, I don't think we have a lot of that data or enough data point\u2019s under our belt to draw too many conclusions from that. And that's what -- even the previous question here that was asked in terms of it is something we watch closely in terms of tracking those deals, but also thinking about do we have multiple ways to get to the number? If deals X and Y close or don't close, do we have other deals A&B that could get us there. So that's definitely a discussion that we have internally and factor that into our guidance.\nMike Cikos: Got it. Thank you for that. And I guess just for a quick follow-up. I appreciate all the color on the assumptions here. Can you help us understand that call it, $30 million benefit to free cash flow we're expecting from the partner payments this year. Again, just because we're -- this is essentially the second back-to-back year we're now receiving this kind of payment. Is it the same quarter, any other color would be beneficial?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Thank you, Mike, for that question because I think it's -- I would be happy to clarify that. So there are these nonrecurring payments from this partner, and there is a timing difference between OpEx and free cash flow. And so the commentary that we had provided was we had about a $44 million benefit in fiscal year 2024 over the course of the year to the R&D OpEx line in fiscal year 2024. And we expect that same $44 million benefit, right, it becomes more like $20 million to $25 million in fiscal year 2025. So that's the $20 million, $25 million headwind that I was referring to in OpEx, in 2025 relative to fiscal year 2024. So all of that is operating expense commentary. Now, when you look at free cash flow, there's a bit of a delay in when the cash comes in relative to that payment. So we got about $30 million of cash benefit from that in fiscal year 2024. We expect another $30 million in 2025, and then it would taper off, there may be a small portion in 2026, but it will then taper off as we end this fiscal year in 2025. And it's nonrecurring because we don't expect this to be an ongoing thing. It is continuing into this year, which we didn't fully anticipate about three months ago. But we do think that over time, it will taper off.\nMike Cikos: Got it. Thank you so much.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich and good afternoon everyone. Our fourth quarter was a solid finish to our 2024 fiscal year. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions, driven by businesses prioritizing infrastructure modernization initiatives, while looking to adopt hybrid multi-cloud operating models, and optimize their total cost of ownership. In the fourth quarter, we are happy to have exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered quarterly revenue of $548 million, up 11% on year-over-year and saw another quarter of strong free cash flow generation. We also saw the highest number of new logos we've seen in three years, an encouraging sign of building traction with some of our go-to-market partnerships and initiatives. Our full year 2024 results demonstrated progress on a number of fronts. Financially, we delivered solid top line performance, driven by continued strong performance from our renewals business. We saw good growth in our pipeline of larger deals as we shifted our focus up-market and saw increased engagement from prospects, looking for alternatives to their existing infrastructure solutions. Even as our land and expand business underperformed related to our internal expectations due to the longer-than-expected sales cycles we see, we delivered revenue of $2.15 billion, up 15% year-over-year and ARR of $1.91 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Our bottom line performance was even stronger. We generated free cash flow of $598 million, almost three times higher than last year, resulting in a free cash flow margin of 28% and a Rule of 40 score of 43. In FY 2024, we also saw tangible progress on the partnership front with significant new or enhanced partnerships with Cisco, Dell and NVIDIA. And I'm pleased that Dell XC Plus, our new turnkey HCI-based appliance offering with Dell is now generally available. We see these partnerships is both expanding our addressable market and providing us with meaningful go-to-market leverage. Finally, we continue to innovate in FY 2024, with important new product releases and enhancements to our Nutanix cloud platform. These included the launch of GPT in-a-box, our solution for streamlining the adoption of generative AI by enterprises. We made meaningful progress towards our goal of becoming the best platform for modern applications, including launch of Nutanix Data Services for Kubernetes or NDK, which offers consistent data services across both virtual machines and container stats, as well as the recent release of Nutanix Kubernetes Platform or NKP, to simplify management of modern applications, on-premises and in any native public cloud service. Our most significant wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of Nutanix cloud platform to organizations that are looking to modernize their IT footprints and adopt hybrid cloud operating models, as well as those looking for alternatives in the wake of recent industry M&A. Our largest win in Q4 was a multimillion-dollar ACV deal with a North American-based Fortune 100 financial services company. Following a roughly 1.5 year engagement with us, they chose to replace their existing solution to Nutanix Cloud platform, including our AHV hypervisor as well as Nutanix cloud manager. This customer, who had been using a competing HCI solution in much of the footprint was able to utilize their existing hardware for Nutanix software deployment, obviating the need for a hardware refresh. We also had a number of significant wins that included our Nutanix Cloud Clusters or NC2 capability, which enables workloads to be seamlessly and efficiently run in both private and public clouds. One of these was with an existing customer, an EMEA-based provider of global research services. This customer was looking to accelerate the migration of their workloads to the public cloud, while ensuring the workloads once migrated, will run as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Having already made a commitment to Microsoft Azure, they purchased licenses for Nutanix cloud platform through the Azure marketplace with the intent of utilizing its NC2 capability to shift their on-prem workloads to Azure. Another good example was a significant new customer win, with a top North American university. Most of our customers start with our platform on prem. However, this customer was motivated by their decision to migrate away from a competing platform they were using to run their virtual machine workloads at scale in the public cloud on AWS, due to dissatisfaction with recent changes at their existing supplier. They chose Nutanix cloud platform to migrate their applications running in the public cloud to our NC2 on AWS, while also adopting our cloud platform to run their on-prem workloads. We also plan on Nutanix cloud manager for consistent health service and automation across their private and public cloud state. A final notable example is a win with an Asia-based Global 2000 semiconductor provider. This full stack win, which is also a displacement of our primary competitor, enables the customer to streamline their operations, increase their level of automation, and reduce their dependence on more expensive proprietary storage solutions. It included adoption of Nutanix database service, or NDD to enable them to move off of their expensive commercial databases to open source databases managed by NDD. This customer also plans to adopt our unified storage solutions, replacing multiple third-party storage options. Finally, we also plan on utilizing NC2 on Azure to enable them to shift applications to the public cloud, including performing lift and shifts of IT workloads of acquired companies. We see these wins as reflecting the value customers see in our platform as they look for seamless and efficient application portability, while adopting hybrid multi-cloud operating models, as well as the value of our partnerships with Azure and AWS. In closing, I am pleased with our solid Q4 and fiscal 2024 results, and the progress we continue to make on multiple fronts, including our financial model, our partnerships and our ongoing innovation in our cloud platform towards our goal of becoming the leading platform for running applications and managing data anywhere. We also remain focused on capitalizing on what we view as a long-term opportunity to gain share in face of recent industry disruption and are encouraged by our early successes, including some of the wins I just highlighted. Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our investors, customers and partners for their trust in us and to our employees for their hard work that led to these results. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini? Hi, George. Rajiv here. Yeah, we are -- it's largely an unchanged multiyear opportunity to gain share, like we said last quarter, while the sales side has been a bit longer than we had initially anticipated. Thus far, we haven't really seen any meaningful changes in our win or loss rates on these opportunities. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we are seeing some of these larger opportunities close. We gave you a few examples in the prepared remarks. And I do expect that we'll continue to see more of these over time. Now in the midsize and smaller customer segments, we're seeing significant increased engagement and opportunity as many of these smaller companies look for alternatives and generally less competitive engagements related to the larger customer opportunities. Along with our increased leverage from our go-to-market partnerships that we've talked about as well as our programs and incentives that we have in place, this dynamic has also been one of our drivers for our larger -- our stronger new logo performance. No, that's a very good question, George. I think if you look at the installed base out there in data centers, a vast majority of it, I don't have the exact number, but roughly around 80% of it is what we call 3-tier infrastructure. Separate storage, compute and networking. And as you know, we have a HCI solution today in the market. And if we want to replace the 3 tier with HCI, it's a better architecture, more cost-effective long-term, but it does require a hardware refresh. Now the remaining 20% is HCI, of which we are a market leader and our competition has some of the rest. Now in this particular case, an example that we talked about, the customer was already on HCI with a competing product. And when you're already on HCI, we've been quite successful having our software to be able to run on existing hardware because it's already a HCI hardware. And that's what happened in this particular account. And so for that subset or customers that are already on HCI, the migration path is easier in some subset of those cases, we don't need a hardware refreshes. That's what happened here. On the 3-tier, it does require a hardware refresh. Now we're also addressing the 3-tier market, to your point, one aspect of our partnership with Dell is that we said we would -- they would be the first that we would support at external storage, Dell PowerFlex. And now the whole idea of doing that is now we can find an easier insertion into feature deployments without having to change out the hardware. Now that solution is not available in the market today. It's only going to be available sometime next year. And over time, we anticipate being able to offer that support to a broader set of third-party storage ways. Yes. So Jim, good question. I'll give you a two-point answer to that. First, in general purpose work clouds and then second on GPT. For general purpose workloads to your point, for steady-state workloads, I think people are getting to the conclusion that it's much more cost effective to run those on-prem in a private cloud environment. We've seen some repatriation. We've also seen much more deliberation in terms of whether that workload goes to the public cloud in the first place, because a lot of the deployment is still on-prem of enterprise workloads. So we're certainly seeing the trend and realization of customers to say, the steady-state workloads, we can run them more cost effectively in private clouds. Now on GPT specifically, I think a lot of visual interest in Gen AI has been in creation and training of LLMs, large language models, and a lot of that is being done in the public cloud and massive GPU farms. And we don't have -- we don't play there fully. But on the other hand, we think the bulk of the enterprise opportunity in terms of how companies are actually going to use it, is potentially going to be on-prem because at the end of the day, the Gen AI workloads, applications have we run wherever the customer data is. And in a lot of cases, sensitive customer data is either inside data centers or at the edges, and so a platform like our GPT-in-a-Box provides a very simple, easy-to-use, secure, way of running Gen AI applications. And so the use cases that we've seen so far have been around co-piloting, around document search and analysis, around customer support, around enhanced fraud detection. We are seeing certainly continued traction. It's still early days for us, but across multiple verticals, healthcare, financial services, government. So early days for DPT adoption in the private cloud enterprise, but I think that's going to be a growing market for fine tuning, rack retrieval, augmented generation and for inferencing in terms of running these AI workloads close to the data in a private and secure way. Yes. The only thing I'll add to that, Rukmini, would be -- I think, Jim, you also had a question on the Broadcom opportunity. And like I said, that's largely using, but it's also very difficult to explicitly pass that out, because every one of our deals, historically, we've been -- we have been competing against VMware in the past and that continue. So there's some level of influence. I only -- these are the only reason why people come to us. It's a little hard for us to piece it out separately. Hi, Meta. I'll start and then Rukmini can answer the second part. Yes, independent of the Broadcom situation, as we look at our addressable market, historically, Nutanix has been quite strong in what I would call the smaller side of enterprises and the higher end of commercial mid-market. But over the last few years, we have deliberately made it further upmarket towards larger enterprises, because that's where we are underpenetrated and the biggest TAM opportunity sits. So we have realigned our segmentation over the past few years to focus more on that market. Now the products are ready. We have done a lot of work on the product side. The GTM side, now we're ready. We've got some good partnerships. Now we also clearly understand that when you get to the large customers, the G2K accounts, for example, or the Fortune 100-type accounts, those are going to be more competitive. And that's where clearly Broadcom is more focused on. And those engagements tend to be long, they tend to be bigger, but to very fruitful if and when we do win it. And as you can see here, we are starting to win some of those. We talked about an eight-figure ACV win last quarter. This quarter, we had a multimillion dollar ACV win. So those tend to take time, but are well worth it when they do happen. So we've got a focus there, for sure. The mid-market or the smaller side of the enterprises has been historically our sweet spot. And it's also less of a focus for Broadcom, given their explicit focus on the bigger accounts. It also tends to be less competitive and easier migrations as well. So that used to be our historical sweet spot, it continues to be a sweet spot. But the bigger opportunity for us is growth is also now sitting at the top end of the pyramid. Yeah, those are all very good questions. At a top level, the demand environment has not changed, and it's been fairly stable. As we said over the last several quarters, we are seeing some of elongated sales cycles, people getting more approvals and more awareness of TCO before they make the purchasing decision. So that part has not changed. Now in terms of how we look at the opportunity. Now hardware refresh, as you can see, right, I mean when we do need a hardware fresh, that tends to be a significant factor in terms of customers' timing on a deal. Now the key things to keep in mind is that the hardware refresh is not just at one point in time, hardware refreshes happen depending on the size of the state at various points. And we can use those points to secure an insertion. It may not be a full insertion because hardware orders gets replaced over time and multiple cycle, so we may be able to insert for one workload where a portion of the hardware is getting replaced, say, this year and maybe other portions the hardware we get refreshed in two, three years from now. So that's normal engagement. Now have offered some promotions to customers in terms of providing them some overlapping windows where we can give them discounted licenses for a period of time. Now I will say that hardware costs tend to be quite significant. So it's not that we are able to necessarily subsidize hardware costs ourselves, okay? But sometimes we may be able to work with partners, hardware partners who are more interested in doing that themselves. So that can be a possibility as well when it comes to the hardware costs. And then, look, I think when it comes to landing new customers, especially significant ones, we are willing to be quite aggressive in terms of -- we already have aggressive promotions out there and the incentives for customers. And we will do what is needed within reasonable bounds to go win these deals, while at the same time protecting our margins. So that's probably a broad answer. I would say net-net, we are being aggressive wherever needed. We are working with hardware partners to see if we can mitigate some better fresh opportunities. And at the same time, keep in mind, Ruplu, we are also working to broaden the set of places where we can insert without requiring a hardware refresh, existing HDI environments, or the ability to reuse servers that customers may already invested in. And then over time, as we get our third-party storage support, we'll be able to do more -- even more of that. So to be clear, Jason, I don't think we're misaligned, because we are targeting our GTM resources on where we see the maximum dollar opportunity lies, right? And the more of the dollar opportunity is sitting higher up in the pyramid, better which is the same reason by Broadcom is equally focused on those customers, right? So for us to grow, I mean, we already have -- we are well penetrated in the lower end of the market, and we will continue to -- we still have very much focused there, right? We haven't moved away from that. That's our sweet spot. That's our installed base, and that's where we can go in and capture more customers. We are talking about everything ranging from school districts to retailers, to those types of public sector. These are all types, very much a sweet spot. But the bigger SAM opportunities for us, certainly, sitting in the top of the pyramid, and so we have to, as a company, to be successful. We have to go after those, right? And we have the products, we have the GTM. Yes, we know those are going to be harder fought. But when we do win them, like you saw with the eight-figure opportunity that we won last quarter, those can be pretty significant. Well, I think it's partly related to the Broadcom thing, very much so. I mean, like, again, it's hard to attribute everything 100% to Broadcom. Yes, we were engaged with them for two years, but a lot of the big customers at the very top of the pyramid are -- were very sensitive and aware as soon as the Broadcom deal was announced, they started thinking about what they're going to do. It didn't wait for the deal to close, unlike many of the smaller customers to see what was going to happen. So this customer -- we had certainly a unique value proposition and our use cases that they were driving the thinking and then the Broadcom piece, of course, was an added boost. So it's one of these things where it's hard to attribute how much of it was Broadcom, how much of it was something else? But that's a good example. Similarly, the example from this quarter's call also is very much the same, right? This Fortune 100 financial services customer very much driven by the Broadcom situation. Yes. So that's a good question, Victor. I would say the vast majority of applications running on a VMware high provider on 3-tier can run very well on AHV and HCI environment. There are perhaps things at the edges, where it's not technical gaps, it's really more ecosystem certification gaps that might hinder some of them. There might be an application that's certified on ESX, but not certified on AHV. And over the last few years, we've built that out as well. So there are going to be some convocations that are not certified. But for the most part, we can address pretty much anything that is running on a 3-tier infrastructure on VMware and run that effectively on Nutanix HCI on AHV. But there's the other barriers we talked about, right, in terms of hardware refresh cycles and then the timing of the renewals. Those are some of the other things that we still have to factor in, but it's not a technical barrier. Yes, I think -- so Victor on that again, so clearly, historically, this has been the case when a customer migrates from a 3-tier deployment over to Health tier deployment. They save a lot, right? They save 30%, 40%, at least in terms of TCO costs. If we factor in everything, including the hardware cost, the operating cost, all of it is a pretty substantial savings. And so that continues to be the case today, right? I think the battery, of course, is you've got -- you've invested in the hardware, you want to depreciate it before you actually go buy new hardware. But those savings and the value of HCI related to 3-tier is very established and that continues. Much easier. Yes, this Fortune 100 win that we talked about was exactly that situation. The customer had a lot of competitive HCI offerings deployed. It was an easier migration because for them, they didn't have to change out their hardware. We could just replace the other software without software."

            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I will first discuss our Q4 fiscal 2024 and full fiscal year 2024 results, followed by our guidance for Q1 fiscal 2025 and for the full fiscal year 2025. Results in Q4 2024 came in above the high end of our range across all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q4 were $338 million, above the guided range of $295 million to $305 million, representing year-over-year growth of 21%. Revenue in Q4 was $548 million, higher than the guided range of $530 million to $540 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 11%. ARR at the end of Q4 was $1.908 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 22%. In Q4, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. Average contract duration in Q4 was 3.1 years, 0.1 year higher than Q3. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 86.9%, higher than our guided range of 85% to 86%. Non-GAAP operating margin in to was 12.9% higher than our guided range of 9% to 10%, largely due to one, lower operating expenses as a result of higher-than-expected non-recurring payments related to one of our partnership agreements and a few other items; and two, slightly higher gross margin and revenue. Non-GAAP net income in Q4 was $76 million or fully diluted EPS of $0.27 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 285 million shares. DSOs based on revenue and ending accounts receivable were 39 days in Q4. Free cash flow in Q4 was $224 million, representing free cash flow margin of 41%. Free cash flow in Q4 benefited from the collection on the 8-figure ACV transaction that was booked in fiscal Q3. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with cash, cash equivalence and short-term investments of $994 million, down from $1.651 billion at the end of Q3. The primary reason for the reduction in our cash balance was Bain Capital's conversion of the 2026 notes, which we announced in June. We settled the conversion in Q4 by paying $817.6 million in cash and delivering approximately 16.9 million shares of common stock. Please note that the entire conversion value had previously already been included in our fully diluted weighted average share count on an if-converted basis. The actual settlement included a portion settled in cash rather than exclusively in shares, resulting in the issuance of approximately 17 million shares, which is 12 million lower than the 29 million that we had previously included on an if-converted basis. Moving to capital allocation. We repurchased about $25 million worth of shares in Q4 and $131 million worth of shares in all of fiscal year 2024 under the share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors. Looking at our full year financial results, we exceeded the high end of all guided metrics for fiscal year 2024. ACV billings in fiscal year 2024 were $1.162 billion, higher than our guidance of $1.12 billion to $1.13 billion, and representing a year-over-year growth of 21%. A reminder that the annual ACV billings is slightly lower than the sum of the ACV billings from the four quarters due to adjustments for deals with duration of less than a year. Revenue in fiscal year 2024 was $2.149 billion, higher than our guidance of $2.13 billion to $2.14 billion and representing a year-over-year growth of 15%. We are pleased to have exceeded the $2 billion revenue threshold in fiscal year 2024. We ended fiscal year 2024 with an ARR of $1.908 billion, as mentioned earlier, a year-over-year growth of 22%. Net dollar-based retention rate, or NRR, at the end of fiscal year 2024 was 114%. As the fiscal year progressed, we saw a higher mix larger deals in our pipeline. These larger opportunities often involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure. And as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels. Largely due to these dynamics, our fiscal year 2024 land and expand ACV and ARR performance were below our initial expectations at the beginning of the fiscal year, and we expect these dynamics to continue. Our renewals performance continues to be good through the fiscal year, and a reminder that renewals tend to be at a lower aggregate average contract duration compared to land and expand. Average contract duration in fiscal year 2024 was 2.95 years, flattish to fiscal year 2023 and slightly higher than expected, partly due to some larger deals with greater than average duration. Non-GAAP gross margin in fiscal year 2024 was 86.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 were $1.515 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year, as we began to make additional investments primarily in research and development and sales and marketing. Non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal year 2024 was 16%, representing an improvement of over 700 basis points year-over-year. We also delivered our first full year of positive GAAP operating income of $8 million in fiscal year 2024. Non-GAAP net income was $384 million, or diluted EPS of $1.31 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 294 million shares. Free cash flow in fiscal year 2024 was $598 million, higher than our guidance of $520 million to $540 million and almost 3 times higher than last year's free cash flow. Free cash flow margin in fiscal year 2024 was 28%, implying free cash flow margin expansion of 17 percentage points year-over-year. Free cash flow in fiscal year 2024 benefited from approximately $30 million in nonrecurring payments related to a partnership agreement, as previously referenced. Overall, fiscal year 2024 was a significant year, marking our first year with positive GAAP operating income, significant free cash flow generation of $598 million and free cash flow margin of 28%, while growing ARR at 22% and revenue at 15% year-over-year. We also delivered a Rule of 40 score defined as the sum of revenue growth and free cash flow margin of 43 for fiscal year 2024, an improvement of 14 percentage points year-over-year and 28 percentage points higher compared to two years ago. Moving to fiscal year 2025. The guidance for the full year is as follows; revenue of $2.435 billion to $2.465 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 15.5% to 17%; free cash flow of $540 million to $600 million, representing a free cash flow margin of approximately 23% at the midpoint. I will now provide some commentary regarding our fiscal year 2025 guidance. First, as previously mentioned at our 2023 Investor Day, we are signing our metrics by not reporting or guiding ACV billings starting in fiscal year 2025. ACV billings was intended as a transitional metric during our subscription evolution, and we believe that now is the time to evolve away from that metric. We are also no longer guiding to GAAP gross margin which was previously useful as we navigated our business model changes, leading to significant improvements in non-GAAP gross margin. We will continue to guide to revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow on an annual basis and to guide to revenue and non-GAAP operating margin for the subsequent quarter. Second, and moving on to assumptions in our guidance, we are seeing continued and significant land-an-d expand opportunities and a growing pipeline for our solution. However, we continue to see a higher mix of larger deals in our pipeline, which is driving greater variability in our land and expand bookings. These larger opportunities often involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals at the customer or prospect, causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome, and deal structure. And as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels, which we expect to continue. Third. The guidance assumes that renewals will continue to perform well in fiscal year 2025. Fourth. The full year guidance assume that average contract duration would be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year 2024, as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billing. Fifth. The non-GAAP operating margin guidance assumes incremental student investments in sales and marketing and R&D targeted towards addressing our large market opportunity. It also factors in the annualized run rate of the incremental investments we made in fiscal year 2024. It also assumes a $20 million to $25 million headwind in operating expenses relative to fiscal year 2024 from payments related one of our partnership agreement. Specifically, there was about $44 million of this benefit to the R&D operating expense line in fiscal year 2024, and we anticipate it be $20 million to $25 million in fiscal year 2025 And sixth. The free cash flow guidance reflects an approximately $30 million headwind relative to fiscal year 2024, from lower interest income as a result of our lower invested cash due to the cash payment on conversion of FY 2026 convertible notes. We expect free cash flow in fiscal year 2025 to also benefit from the approximately $30 million in nonrecurring payments related to a partnership agreement, similar to the benefit we saw in fiscal year 2024. It is expected to tail off towards the end of fiscal year 2025. Moving to Q1 2025. Our guidance for Q1 is as follows; revenue of $565 million to $575 million, non-GAAP operating margin of 14.5% to 15.5%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 287 million shares. In closing, we are pleased that Q4 and fiscal year 2024 performance exceeded guidance across all metrics. We are excited about the long-term market opportunity and Nutanix's ability to deliver compelling outcomes for customers and prospects. We remain committed to continued progress aligned with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth both through durable top line growth and expanding margins. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Thank you, Jim, for that question. So in terms of contribution from the various buckets that you called out, Jim, so I'll give you some qualitative color on that. So we've talked about, in general, we are happy with our pipeline generation overall. We have talked about the growing pipeline and the fact that the pipeline from larger deals is growing faster. And that can lead to variability, with respect to timing or outcome or more complex deal structures and so on. And so some of those dynamics we expect to continue next year. Similarly, with just modestly elongated sales cycles across the board, not just large deals, but across the board. And we expect that to continue next year as well. In terms of the contribution from Cisco, we do expect the Cisco contribution to grow in fiscal year 2025 relative to last year. And we do expect a small initial contribution from a Dell XC Plus, which is the new offering that's generally available now. And we expect small initial contribution from that in 2025 and expect that to grow as well over time. And so all of that is taken into account when you think about the fiscal year 2025 top line guide that we provided, Jim. The other thing you alluded to is renewals. So yes, our renewals business continues to grow nicely year-over-year. So that's factored in there as well. And I think the last part of your question was around ARR. So -- we will, of course, continue to report ARR on a quarterly basis. And while we noted that the underperformed for fiscal year 2024 relative to our internal expectations, we're not providing guidance for ARR. Yes. Thank you, Rajiv. That attribution is certainly nuanced. So, we do expect it to continue to contribute some, but we wouldn't be overly precise on that. So, thank you, thank you, Rajiv, and Jim, for the question. And I'll take the question, Meta, on renewals and expectations for renewals in fiscal year 2025. So, first, I'd say, we did have in fiscal year 2024, just overall good performance in renewals. And I think to your point, it did include really good discipline from the team around economics for the renewals in terms of pricing. It did include some early and core term renewals. And as we said, for those are good in our mind as long as they come at good economics, because the customer is willing to renew with us and renew their commitment to us earlier and often give us the cash earlier as well. And then core terms, of course, the simplification of their real estate, right? So that's both the customer and us well in terms of managing their footprint. So we did have some of that. Now when we look at fiscal year 2025 are available to renew pool, you can think about it as effectively a pipeline for renewals continues to be -- continues to grow. It's a strong year-over-year growth. And it's roughly similar year-over-year growth to what we saw in fiscal year 2024. And then in terms of timing, I think perhaps your question was around seasonality of that, Meta. It does move around a little bit. But in general, our fiscal Q2 and Q4 tend to be sort of higher quarters for us; given Q2 has the calendar year-end and budget flush and things like that. And, of course, fiscal year Q4 is end of our fiscal year and there are incentives around that. So Q2 and Q4 started to have higher in general, available to the new pools relative to Q1 and Q3. But that's how we think about the renewal opportunity in fiscal year 2025. Thank you, Meta. Hi, Ruplu. Thank you for that question. So first, I think your first question was around free cash flow. And so we are pleased with our free cash flow performance in fiscal year 2024 and happy to guide to free cash flow where we did, which, as you noted, the midpoint is above the high end of the range of what we had put out last year at our Investor Day. Now in terms of the quarterly cadence there, Ruplu, we don't, of course, guide quarterly to free cash flow so there can be some variation there, including, as pointed out in the last couple of quarters where -- because we collect cash for multiple years upfront, generally, meaningful deals, right, if there are larger deals that we collect cash for upfront or if it's a longer duration transaction, then that those can cost swings, Ruplu. So yes, so we don't guide to quarterly, but that's sort of the quality of color. I will say that when you think about -- the operating expense increase over time. We've talked about you can sort of see the implied OpEx growth year-over-year on our margin guide. And that would be more gradual over time, right, because we're going to invest in sales and marketing and in R&D -- and some of that will be over time. The OpEx does include, for example, all of the annualized run rate from investments in 2024, all those are annualized into 2025, plus it includes salary raises for our employees that became effective. So some of those are more run rate and others will be more gradual as we ramp into the -- into the spend over time. So that's the first part of your question. And I think the second part was more around the sort of medium- to longer-term financial targets that we put out at our last Investor Day. So while we don't plan on commenting on those medium-term financial targets on an interim basis, we are happy to note as you just said, Ruplu, that the fiscal year 2025 free cash flow guidance at the midpoint is above the range of what we have put out at Investor Day. And our initial fiscal year 2025 revenue guide is within the range that we have provided at that time. We continue to focus on driving durable top line growth and expanding free cash flow and operating margin and driving to operating sustainably at a rule of 40 plus over time. So that's sort of been our philosophy, and we continue to drive that philosophy, and we're not commenting specifically on those numbers at this point. Thank you, Ruplu. Yes. Thank you, Jason. So, as we said, I think last quarter, we did collect the cash for that transaction, the entire sort of PCV value of that transaction. But all of the revenue recognition is over multiple years starting in fiscal year 2025. So no, we didn't -- I think there was a small professional services portion that began in Q4, Jason, but all the license revenue is in fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Thank you, Victor. I'll take that, Rajiv, you should proceed to add in. So for linearity in Q4 I would say it was more or less as we expected. I think, your question specifically was on linearity with respect to large deals. And those we've talked about can be more unpredictable than other portions of the business is given they tend to be often more strategic, involved C-suite approvals, things like that. It can be more unpredictable. But overall, I would say linearity in Q4 was largely as expected. In terms of push out or pull in, I think at the next part of the question as we think about last Q4 coming into this year. Nothing unusual there, I would note. I think it was what we think would expect for that time of year. So nothing unusual there. And then again, on August linearity, the only thing to call out in Q1 is its US federal end of fiscal year in September, of course. But again, that's all factored into how we think about our guidance and ability to collect free cash flow and things like that. But as I said earlier, I think the overall linearity can become a little more unpredictable because of the mix of the large deals as that that grows over time, and it is something we're continuing to watch closely. Thank you. Hi, Mike. Yeah, good question. So we're not going to provide that metric necessarily quarterly, Mike. But as we said, I think we are happy overall with pipe creation and are seeing meaningful opportunities with those larger deal segments. So that continues to be good in terms of pipe creation. And I think your second question around do we have enough data points, it's still relatively early. The pipeline has grown nicely. But as we've talked about here, some of these larger deals can take a really long time, I would give one example where it was two years, another one this quarter where it was 1.5 years. And so it is variable and it can take long. And so I'd say, I don't think we have a lot of that data or enough data point's under our belt to draw too many conclusions from that. And that's what -- even the previous question here that was asked in terms of it is something we watch closely in terms of tracking those deals, but also thinking about do we have multiple ways to get to the number? If deals X and Y close or don't close, do we have other deals A&B that could get us there. So that's definitely a discussion that we have internally and factor that into our guidance. Yes. Thank you, Mike, for that question because I think it's -- I would be happy to clarify that. So there are these nonrecurring payments from this partner, and there is a timing difference between OpEx and free cash flow. And so the commentary that we had provided was we had about a $44 million benefit in fiscal year 2024 over the course of the year to the R&D OpEx line in fiscal year 2024. And we expect that same $44 million benefit, right, it becomes more like $20 million to $25 million in fiscal year 2025. So that's the $20 million, $25 million headwind that I was referring to in OpEx, in 2025 relative to fiscal year 2024. So all of that is operating expense commentary. Now, when you look at free cash flow, there's a bit of a delay in when the cash comes in relative to that payment. So we got about $30 million of cash benefit from that in fiscal year 2024. We expect another $30 million in 2025, and then it would taper off, there may be a small portion in 2026, but it will then taper off as we end this fiscal year in 2025. And it's nonrecurring because we don't expect this to be an ongoing thing. It is continuing into this year, which we didn't fully anticipate about three months ago. But we do think that over time, it will taper off. Thank you, Mike."

Finally, our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period will begin on Wednesday, July 17. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a solid third quarter. With results that came in ahead of our guidance. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives. And looking to optimize their total cost of ownership or TCO. Taking a closer look at the third quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered quarterly revenue of $525 million and grew our ARR 24% year-over-year to $1.82 billion. We also had another quarter of solid free cash flow generation. Overall, our third quarter financial performance reflected continued disciplined execution. Our largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix cloud platform to organizations that are looking to modernize and improve the efficiency of the data center footprint, while managing through some of the disruption from recent industry M&A. Our largest new customer win of the quarter was an eight-figure ACV deal with a North American-based Fortune 50 financial services company that was looking to streamline and automate the deployment and management of their substantial fleet of databases. This customer purchased the Nutanix Stock platform with Nutanix database service to automate all of their internal database deployment and management needs. While also modernizing the three tier footprint previously used for running their database. This win was substantially larger than our typical land win. And mark the culmination of an approximately two year engagement. Another notable win in Q3 was a significant renewal and expansion with a North American-based Fortune 500 provider of consumer packaged goods. This customer, whose data center footprint has historically been split between Nutanix and a competitor was looking to standardize their automation and self-service capabilities on a single class. They decided to standardize our Nutanix start platform, including our A3 hypervisor and Nutanix cloud management to handle their self-service and automation needs. They also added Nutanix unified storage and Nutanix database service for their unstructured data management and database automation needs, respectively. Going forward, this customer plans on swapping out the competitive software in their existing footprint and also utilizing Nutanix cloud platform for all of their expansion needs. We see these wins as a testament to our ability to both land significantly and expand within the largest companies. And we are encouraged by the substantial increase in the number of customers and partners engaging with us, including some of the world's largest companies. However, these larger opportunities tend to have longer sales cycles can involve aggressive competitive responses and exhibit great availability with respect to timing and outcome. Rukmini will provide more color on the impact of these dynamics. Last week, we held our annual .NEXT conference in Barcelona, Spain, where the excitement from the 4,000 plus attendees was tangible. At .NEXT, we made a number of announcements demonstrating continued progress and plans on enhancing the functionality of the Nutanix store platform and broadening our partnerships especially with respect to support for modern applications and enterprise AI. On the enterprise AI front, we announced GPT in-a-box 2.0, which will deliver expanded GPU and large language model support. Automated configuration and management of model inference endpoints for gen AI applications, simplified model management and an expanded partner program. This includes a new partnership with Hugging Face to provide access to the Hugging Face library of large language models for Nutanix customers as well as an expanded partnership with NVIDIA that includes the planned integration of NVIDIA\u2019s inference micro services or NIM, into our automated enterprise AI solution. More broadly, we continue to see a high level of interest and additional wins with DPT in a box in Q3, including a win with a large EMEA-based government agency that is looking to deploy gen AI with fraud detection at the initial use case. On the modern application front, we announced the Nutanix Kubernetes platform or NKP to simplify management of container-based modern applications using Kubernetes, on-premises and in any major public cloud service. We also took initial steps in extending our data services for Kubernetes or NKP to cloud-native, containerized environments. This will simplify the development of resilient data-intensive modern applications in public clouds and allow customers to ultimately run them anywhere in keeping with our project Beacon vision. Finally, we announced a broadening of our partnership with Dell, while Nutanix software already works well with Dell hardware, we announced two new elements of our long-standing partnership. First, then I'm going to sell a tightly integrated hyper-converged solution combining the Nutanix star platform software with Dell PowerEdge service. This will provide our customers with the choice of procuring Nutanix's platform directly from there. We expect that this solution will be available later this calendar year. Second, we will together deliver the Nutanix start platform powered by AHV hypervisor for compute and dell PowerFlex for storage. This will allow customers to reuse some of their existing IP-based Dell 3-tier storage hardware, protecting their investment and giving them choice. We are in the development stage for this offering at this time and expect it to be available in calendar 2025. Now I'd like to comment on the recently published results of our sixth annual Nutanix Enterprise Cloud Index, a survey of 1,500 IT decision makers around the world. The top three priorities identified by respondents were data security and ransomware protection, implementing the right hybrid IT operations and implementing AI strategies. I see these results as playing to the strength of the Nutanix fraud platform, which is built in ransomware protection with our data lens capability, enables hybrid multi-cloud operating models and has strong support for AI with our GPT and above solution. In closing, I'm pleased with our solid Q3 results. Our ongoing innovation on our cloud platform. Particularly with respect to its support for modern applications and generative AI and on the progress we continue to make on partnerships. We remain focused on delighting our customers while driving sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv. I will first review our Q3 fiscal '24 results followed by guidance for Q4 fiscal '24 and the implied full year fiscal year '24 guidance. Results in Q3 '24 came in above the high end of our range across all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q3 were $289 million, above the guided range of $265 million to $275 million, representing year-over-year growth of 20%. Revenue in Q3 was $525 million, higher than the guided range of $510 million to $520 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 17%. ARR at the end of Q3 was $1.82 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 24%. In Q3, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. Average contract duration in Q3 was three years higher than Q2. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 86.5%, higher than our guided range of approximately 85%. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 14% higher than our guided range of 7.5% to 8.5%, largely due to: one, lower operating expenses as a result of higher-than-expected nonrecurring payments related to one of our partnership agreements and timing of hiring; and two, higher revenue and higher gross margin. Non-GAAP net income in Q3 was $85 million or fully diluted EPS of $0.28 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 302 million shares. DSOs based on revenue and ending accounts receivable were 39 days in Q3. Free cash flow in Q3 was $78 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 15%. We ended Q3 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.651 billion, up slightly from $1.644 billion at the end of Q2. We continued repurchasing shares in Q3 under the share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors. We have repurchased about $106 million worth of shares year-to-date through Q3 '24. As a reminder, our sustainable generation of free cash flow enabled us to transition to net share settlement to pay for employees' tax liability on RSU vesting starting in Q2 and going forward from our previous method of cell to cover. We used $58 million of our cash in Q3 and $53 million in Q2 for a total of over $111 million of cash year-to-date for this purpose. More information on the mechanics of net share settlement and its impact can be found in the Appendix section of our earnings presentation found on our Investor Relations website. This along with our share repurchase program will help us continue to manage dilution. Moving to Q4 '24. Our guidance for Q4 is as follows: ACV billings of $295 million to $305 million, revenue of $530 million to $540 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 85% to 86% and non-GAAP operating margin of 9% to 10% and fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 302 million shares. The updated guidance for full year fiscal year '24 is as follows: ACV billings of $1.12 billion to $1.13 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 18% at the midpoint of the range, revenue of $2.13 billion to $2.14 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 86%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 15% and free cash flow of $520 million to $540 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 25% at the midpoint. I will now provide some commentary regarding our updated fiscal year '24 guidance, specifically the following four points: first, we are seeing continued and significant new and expansion opportunities for our solutions. However, we continue to see a higher mix of larger deals in our pipeline which is driving greater variability in our new and expansion business. The number of opportunities greater than $1 million in ACV in our pipeline has grown at higher than 30% for each of the last 3 quarters compared to the corresponding quarters last year. Relatedly, the dollar amount of pipeline from opportunities greater than $1 million in ACV has grown at well over 50% and for each of the last three quarters compared to the corresponding quarters last year. These larger opportunities often involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals, causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure. And as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels. Our fiscal year '24 new and expansion ACV and ARR performance year-to-date have been affected by these dynamics and have been below our initial expectations at the beginning of the fiscal year. We expect these dynamics to continue in Q4. As an example, for the eight figure ACV transaction in Q3 that Rajiv mentioned, we expect the billings and cash collection to be in Q4, while the associated subscription revenue is expected to be recognized over multiple years starting in fiscal year '25. Additionally, it is worth noting that this transaction was approximately two years in the making, taking longer to close than our prior expectations, but came in with a longer contract duration and a higher total contract value than expected. We anticipate similar variability in deal structures and longer sales cycles for some of the larger opportunities in our pipeline. Second, the guidance assumes that our renewals business will continue to perform well in Q4. Third, the full year guidance continues to assume that average contract duration would be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '23, as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billing. Fourth, the updated full year free cash flow guidance includes the benefit of the eight figure ACV transaction, which was booked in Q3. In addition, the full year free cash flow guidance also assumes the impact of certain nonrecurring benefits over the course of the year, including approximately $40 million of operating expenses, of which we expect to receive approximately $30 million of non-recurring cash payments related to one of our partnership agreements. In closing, we are pleased that our Q3 performance exceeded guidance across all metrics and to continue to make significant progress aligned with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora : Rajiv, one question for you. I want to ask you about the decision to kind of extend AHP to support compute-only nodes. On what it seems like it could actually help you create a non-ramp to migrate workloads into the Nutanix HCI platform. But on the other hand, it could elongate the time for a customer to make that decision since AHP might increase the time they stay on their existing 3D architectures. So maybe talk about that puts and takes there. And is there any incremental investment in that decision that we should be thinking about as we think about next year?\nRajiv Ramaswami : We thought about this one long and hard. Here's kind of the rationale for why we're doing this. One of the things we've talked about, as customers migrate from legacy three tier to HCI architecture that it requires them typically to do a hardware refresh, get out of their legacy storage arrays and some -- and their existing drivers in move to HCI configuration. And that actually can slow things down a bit in terms of our ability to get into an account because they have to wait for their hardware depreciation cycles typically before they buy new hardware. Now the rationale with this announcement with Dell is we're starting out by supporting AHP with PowerFlex, which is one of their Dell storage platforms. Now doing so allows us to get in the door right, with existing customers who have made an investment in the storage array already because having to replace the storage array. And so it allows a faster entry into an account, not slower. It's going to be faster, right, with a portion of our portfolio. And we are still very much on the mission of converting over time our customers to this modern cloud HCI architecture, which creates a platform for the future. So on balance, this gives us easier insertion into accounts where they're not quite ready to go depreciate their hardware yet, allowing us to then over time convert them over to HCI. So that's the rationale behind us supporting external storage. We are starting out with just IP storage only, and that was specifically with Dell PowerFlex at this time, right? And again, I think that's rationale.\nPinjalim Bora : Any thoughts on the incremental investment that we should think about maybe going into next fiscal year?\nRajiv Ramaswami : I think it factored into our current run rate, by the way on this. We already have our engineering teams sended this solution is in development currently, and it's included in our ongoing R&D expenses.\nPinjalim Bora : One quick follow-up for Rukmini, is it possible Rukmini to understand kind of the size of this eight figure deal that might be -- from a point of view of just free cash flow guidance that you have seems like a huge $100 million upside if my numbers are correct that I looked at?\nRukmini Sivaraman: So we are not commenting on the specific size of the deal beyond what we said in terms of eight figure ACV. And I'll also remind folks that we do collect cash upfront for all -- it's a multiyear contract. And we alluded to the fact that this transaction came in with a longer contract duration than we had initially expected. So the total TCV, actually, the total contract value was larger than we had expected, Pinjalim. And so yes, we're happy to be able to raise our free cash flow guide to the range that we did $520 million to $540 million for the full year.\nOperator:\n[:\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Quinton] on for Jim Fish. Rajiv maybe for you first. I'd love to hear incremental color you have around the partnerships with Cisco. Obviously, we've announced some deployment optionalities there. But how are your win rates there? How have reps kind of adopted the selling of Nutanix platform and kind of any traction you can kind of further talk on would be great?\nRajiv Ramaswami : So in Q3, we saw some good additional wins for this new solution with Cisco. And we've seen good encouraging progress with respect to Cisco's ability to bring in new logos for us. Also at .NEXT last week, we announced that we are certifying our HP hypervisor to run on Cisco UCS servers. This will enable customers to repurpose their existing Cisco servers to run our software. Connected to our storage-only nodes, right, again, running our own software. So with respect to the contribution, we expect to see a growing contribution from Cisco in and of course, into FY\u201925. And certainly, we are encouraged by the partnership in terms of their reps, especially their specialist tracks. Because Cisco, again has a very big sales force, but a lot of those sellers are also networking sellers, but they do have a specialist team, sales team coming and focusing on data center sales, and those are the people who are more familiar with the Nutanix offering. So we're overall encouraged by the contribution. The overall contribution for this year, a small modest as we said in the past, and we expect a bigger contribution into FY\u201925.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then maybe touching a bit on Pinjalim's question earlier. After the AHV combination with Dell storage, is there really anything from a feature or functionality standpoint that would limit a VMware customer from being able to move to AHV now that kind of the hypervisor only has been enabled? Or is it kind of an optionality where this opens up all VMware customers to move over to Nutanix?\nRajiv Ramaswami : So first of all, I want to say that, first of all, we are only initially supporting one storage platform, and that is PowerFlex, okay? But the concept it's about offering AHV standalone to work with third-party storage, right, which is a big chunk of the installed base out there, legacy installed base, which is separate ritualized servers connected to three tier storage. Now we are starting out with a very small footprint to be clear, right? We are not -- we're only supporting one storage array and it's an IP-based storage array. So we -- it will be -- I don't think we'll ever get to a point where we'll support every storage array that's out there in the planet. That's not going to happen. We will start with Dell PowerFlex and then over time, incrementally add other IP-based storage arrays, right, not fibre channel storage. So I expect that this is something that we can get a broader and broader opportunity scope over time but it does open the door to supporting third-party storage.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jason Ader from William Blair.\nJason Ader : Just to follow up on the first two questions for Rajiv. On the standalone AHV deployment option with third-party storage, how are you planning on pricing AHV in those kinds of environments? I know it's just starting with Dell PowerFlex. But is it sort of -- is it right to think about the pricing would be similar to kind of an HCI solution?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. I mean, Jason, again, as you can imagine, the whole reason for doing this is to provide an alternative solution for customers who are looking to reuse their existing storage but replace their hypervisor. So -- but we also want to think about this as an on-ramp to HCI, not just the standalone hypervisor being the end game in itself. And therefore, we will figure out what the appropriate pricing needs to be to achieve that outcome. So we haven't prices offering. It's still in development won't be available until next year. So, still early days for us. And we will monitor customer feedback and make more revisions on this over time.\nJason Ader : And then a follow-up for Rukmini. I know you mentioned on the new and expansion business that it was below your expectations coming into the year because of the longer sales cycles. Could you comment on how the pipeline has fared relative to your expectations entering the year? Because it sounds like you gave some data points there. It sounds like the pipeline is extremely strong?\nRukmini Sivaraman : Correct. I mean, I think we have strong pipeline generation. And we gave you some qualification around the larger deal pipeline, which we did comment on last quarter as well. And the qualification I had in my script was that if you look at opportunities greater than $1 million in ACV as a threshold in our pipeline, that number of deals have grown at higher than 30%, right, for each of the last three quarters and the dollar amount of that pipeline from opportunities greater than $1 million has gone even faster at well over 50%. And so the pipeline is strong. I think what we're seeing and what in the market is a bit of a dichotomy on that versus I think what's closing and I'll let Rajiv, do you want to add more I mean.\nRajiv Ramaswami : To Rukmini your point, we are seeing this dichotomy. We've got this vast opportunity opening up to us on the one hand and that's for sure. But at the same time, in terms of the deals that we are closing in the near term, right, I mean, these deals are taking longer, these larger deals. So on the opportunity side, I was at .NEXT last week, and it is amazing to see the substantial increase in the customers who are engaging with us, including some of the world's largest companies, and one that we have one business left and we are willing to talk about it very publicly in terms of their modernization experiences, their migration experiences. . And at the same time, we've seen an increased level of activity with our channel partners, our OEM partners are looking to engage deeper with us. Now the engagements themselves on the other side have been taking longer than expected to close, and they've shown greater variability with respect to the timing and the outcome than we expected. Now I think this is because of a higher mix of larger, more strategic opportunities and of course, some of which are influenced by the Broadcom acquisition. Now with respect to the Broadcom opportunity, we had said and we do expect that this will take out time to play for all the reasons we've previously discussed. That includes three reasons. First, many VMware customers have signed multiyear ELAs with VMware prior to the acquisition, buying them time. Second, as we've talked about before, a lot of this installed base also requires a hardware refresh to run HCI. Although once we do get out the HV, we start addressing a portion of this market as well. But also, I think the situation has been very dynamic recently, number three. We've seen Broadcom display a lot of flexibility with respect to their pricing, they are packaging changes, especially when they are faced with the probability of losing some of their larger customers are responding to push back from the market and from the customer base. So that's -- those are some of the reasons why we've had some pressure on our recent new and expansion ACV performance.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan : Given your commentary on the longer time to close some of these deals that you're saying will last into Q4, would you say that changes any of your outlook also around '25? I mean, why should it not sort of extend beyond Q4? Is my first question. I will follow-up.\nRukmini Sivaraman : So to date, this fiscal year, we've been outperforming our initial free cash flow expectations but have been below our initial expectations on new and expansion ACV and ARR as you alluded to. While we're not commenting on fiscal year '25 or longer-term targets today, we remain committed to driving top line growth. And strong free cash flow generation and we expect to provide our initiative fiscal '25 guidance on our next earnings call as we typically do.\nWamsi Mohan : And I guess as a follow-up, I mean, this higher mix of larger deals, right? You said like this been tracking pretty strongly now for three quarters. What is driving the higher mix of the larger deals? Is that more competitive traction? I think Rajiv alluded to some of that? Or is there incremental attach across your stack? And would you say that the demand environment has changed materially across the last three quarters?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Maybe I can take that. There's multiple reasons for that Wamsi. So first, of course, look, there is a larger set of market opportunities available to us at these other accounts and these other accounts in to be associated with larger deals, number one. Number two, our platform has evolved to a point where we can go after pretty much all the workloads that companies are running, so -- which means we can go off for a broader opportunity set. Number three, of course, the competitive dynamics in terms of what's happening with Broadcom is stimulating a portion of this. And so these are the reasons why we are seeing more large deals in our pipeline.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold : One of the things I wanted to follow-up on was how your views have evolved regarding the opportunities to take business from VMware versus your assessment, say, six months ago? And then I've got a quick follow-up that I'll come back with?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Maybe I'll take that to start. Rukmini, you can provide more color. I would say largely the opportunity is a multi-year opportunity, as we've been saying all along. It's not here and now in terms of closing deals, right? These things are going to take many years. We look at it as a multiyear tailwind for us. For all the reasons that we talked about, Simon. And I don't think it's -- that part of it has changed, right? It's been the same, as we said, right? The customers who sign ELAs therefore, it takes time. There's -- the hardware refresh cycle is involved in the process. The only big change that we've seen over the last couple of months, in fact, is that the situation with respect what Broadcom is doing is also evolving rapidly. They've tried a bunch of things. They're stepping back on some of the things that they've tried. Of course, for the competitive situation, this is quite dynamic on that front. And these larger deals, of course, are taking longer also for us to close. So the ones that are in the pipeline are taking for all these reasons that we talked about. So I'd say compared to the overall thesis about this being a multi-year opportunity hasn't really changed for us. In the short-term, I think what we're seeing is these larger deals are going to take more time. And that's just a fact of life as we have to deal with the dynamics of all the things that are going on right now.\nSimon Leopold : I appreciate that. And then maybe my follow-up is tied into this is at least the anecdotes from my perspective seem like Broadcom's price hikes and bundling, we're bigger than I would have anticipated I don't know what you were expecting, but they surprised me. So I'm wondering if there's some inflationary aspects that maybe is a tailwind for Nutanix that gives you the ability to be more aggressive and potentially even raise price up against the inflation coming from Broadcom?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. I think, first of all, I think clearly, Broadcom is doing what they're doing in terms of the bundling and the subscription price increases and so forth. Now when we look at our pricing response there, we've always been competitively priced from HCI architecture, right? A lot of the competitive or the installed base out there is legacy, right, which is three tier architecture with separate storage. And our philosophy has always been to make sure that our solution pricing is attractive from a HCI perspective as companies move from the legacy architecture to the modern HCI architecture. And that's still the underlying philosophy that drives our pricing and we price to value. We've always been a premium offering in the market, and we pride ourselves on being really supply to use, delighting our customers but also pricing based on value. So we continue to do that, Simon. So that part hasn't changed. I think -- and we will continue to be agile in terms of responding to what we see as competitive situations in the market.\nRukmini Sivaraman: The one thing, to reiterate that Simon is that while the -- while Broadcom's effective list prices for many of their customers may have increased significantly, the actual prices, meaning the discount levels in the market, especially when there's sort of a risk of losing business or otherwise challenge. Can -- as you can imagine will be lower than those list prices. And as Rajiv said, remain quite dynamic is what we're seeing in the market.\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. And we've seen them respond aggressively when they are faced with the sort of losing large customers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall : A couple of questions. Maybe first, you mentioned kind of starting with PowerFlex and make insider others. Just wondering, with the time it's going to take to kind of build the solution for PowerFlex would that shrink as you added other storage or just how to think about kind of adding incremental or the time to add other incrementals? And then as a second question, Rukmini, you didn't kind of mention or at least I missed if you did anything about early renewal dynamics this quarter. I did miss that apologies, but if you could just kind of restate whether there were any dynamics there to be note full of?\nRajiv Ramaswami : I'll cover Powerflex, and Rukmini will cover renewals. So on the PowerFlex equation, of course, there is an initial development effort to take our hypervisor and make it standalone ready, right? We've never had that in the past because we've always sold our hypervisor as part of our HCI solution. And now for the first time, we are disaggregating it. So there is some development work required to do that and we are doing that, and the first target is PowerFlex. Now once we do this with PowerFlex, I expect that the additional effort to bring on other IP storage, right, clearly IP, not Fibre Channel, IP storage, will be incremental. We won't have to do all of this over again. Once we have the first storage are qualified with incremental work, we should be able to bring in more IP storage array into the mix.\nRukmini Sivaraman : And Meta to your second question on renewals. So we have seen outperformance of our renewals business so far this fiscal year due to a combination of a few things. One is good discipline around renewals economics and pricing. Second is improved on-time renewal performance. And then third is some early and core term renewals setting, with respect to your specific question. And so the benefit of this stronger performance has primarily been seen in ACV billings and free cash flow. And just as a reminder, this will have a modest benefit to revenue because revenue from early renewals, specifically on the early renewal piece would only be recognized in the quarter in which they are due. So yes, overall happy with the outperformance in renewals year-to-date.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham & Company.\nMike Cikos : I just wanted to come back to the large deals and thank you for the statistics or meaning around that $1 million ACV plus cohort. Can you help us think about, given the greater variability for the timing of those deals, has there been any change in philosophy regarding how management construct its guidance?\nRukmini Sivaraman : So I would say, in general, our guidance philosophy hasn't changed, Mike. What we are trying to do is to, of course, put more -- create more visibility internally and put more scrutiny around how we review the opportunities in our pipeline. And this is in partnership with our sales organization as they think about these opportunities coming in, how we qualify them and how can we think about just the quality of the pipeline in addition to the quantity of the pipeline. We also, as you can imagine, my closely watch duration here, right, at how long the pipeline has been open and we'll continue to do so. I think I would say we have, as we've talked about on these calls, have closed some larger deals over the last few quarters, including the one we talked about the Rajiv the eight figure ACV that we talked about. But we'll continue to sort of build more data points, right, as we do more of those. So yes, I think trying to put more rigor into various processes, both on the go-to-market side and on the finance side. With the philosophy in terms of how we approach guidance hasn't changed, but certainly a lot more rigor being put into how we think about forecasting.\nMike Cikos : And just to follow-up as well. I think at the end of your prepared remarks, I know you were citing some of the nonrecurring benefits and cash payments related to partnership agreements. So first, can you just run through those numbers again real quickly? And then secondly, just as a reminder, what are those payments in relation to with respect to those partnership agreements?\nRukmini Sivaraman :\n : So I'm not going to get more specific on what the payment is. But it is a $40 million benefit to OpEx this year, it was throughout the year. And it's expected to be off that $40 million, $30 million will also be free cash flow benefited this year. The only other maybe modeling point for you all is that $40 million of OpEx that I will return in terms of benefit is sitting in the R&D line within OpEx for your reference.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Hedberg : I had a question. There's been a lot of conversation here on the large deals and timing. And it sounds great that they're growing in size, but obviously, you've noted that creates a fair amount of uncertainty there. I'm sort of curious -- are you doing anything to accelerate, I would call it more of the run rate business that might be more predictable? I assume partners like Dell and Cisco could be driving that. But are there other things you can do to maybe help offset the timing of larger deals?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. I think certainly, first of all, we haven't seen any changes to our conversion ratio on the -- what you would call maybe run rate deals. And I think we -- in terms of what we are doing on that front by on the run rate stuff also, we are incentivizing our channels to get us more new logos. We have -- we have migration programs in place for competitive take outs. We are, of course, companies like Cisco can help bring us more new logos there as well. And then in terms of larger deals fits us, when you look at what we're trying to do there to expedite the larger deals that we talked about, we are -- we put together a cross-functional team for these types of large deals that include sales, finance and product folks with executive sponsorship for pursuing these deals specifically. And we are quite familiar with the cycle of this product qualification, customer-specific requests that may come in for some of these larger wins vendor qualification process, and then, of course, commercial negotiations, right, all of these. So we do what we can do under our control. But at the same time, we also have to factor in the customers' time lines and processes. As well, right, because that's going to be a gating item as well in some of these.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research Company.\nBenjamin Bollin : Rajiv, I'm curious if you could elaborate a little bit more on how you feel enterprise investigations around their own internal AI efforts might be influencing their refresh activities, your win opportunities. You mentioned data security and ransomware priorities within that. But curious if you could expand on that and speak to any sequence of investments that you see across those customers?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think there is a natural sequence of hardware refresh that is driven by typically aging of hardware on the one side. And then, on the other side, new initiatives. And I think what you're talking about comes from the AI. AI is very much part of the new initiatives, Ben. So -- so when it comes to the AI part for enterprise AI, I mean, there's been a lot of talk about AI in the public cloud, and a lot of it has to do with training of these large language models. Now an enterprise AI it has to be run where the data is. And a lot of that is going to be on-prem. And in fact, I think that's the reason why we announced our GPT in-a-box 2.0, simplifying things as well as the partnerships that we announced last week at .NEXT. But most of our customers, I would say, are in the early phases of that journey. A lot of them are doing proof of concept and initial use cases to validate the gen AI use cases that we've talked about. Whether it be fraud detection or customer support or documents such as summarization or co-piloting. So they're still pretty early on that front. They're making certainly hardware investments, but I would say more for proof-of-concept and trying out rather than volume production and deployment. And I think this will play out over time. They're going to go through these concepts proof-of-concept, validate the business proposition and then get into a production deployment scenario.\nBenjamin Bollin : And as a follow-up, looking at the commentary around the opportunity for larger deals, if you look at maybe more traditional deal sizes versus these larger deals. Could you speak to a little bit about who is involved and how it's different? And then any thoughts on the average evaluation duration between the two? That's it for me.\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. I think on the smaller deals, it's more business as usual. I mean our field reps are at the front of that opportunity with customers. And in very small -- in a sector of the market, we have actually had the channel, our channel partners take the lead on some of those opportunities. But in a lot of these cases, our reps are very much involved and they're compensated in exactly the same way as they will be compensated for any other deal because for us, new business is a new business, whether it comes as large or small. And like I said, with respect to the conversion rate on the smaller deals, we haven't seen any real changes over the last several quarters. It's been roughly about the same. So we haven't seen any major changes on that front. Rukmini, is there anything that you would like to add on this?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Only on I think Ben's question about duration, I think it is how long they're taking that was part of the question, Ben. I think we talked about how these larger deals do tend to take longer often because they're strategic or they just have more approvals, things like that. And we haven't kind of given you a specific quantification of one versus the other. We did give the example though of this particular eight figure deal. That we talked about, which took approximately two years for it to come to a close. So yes, it is -- it does take longer than what I think was referred to earlier as sort of our run rate business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Wang from Barclays.\nGeorge Wang : Do you have any updated thoughts on the repatriation trends. Increasingly, you mentioned that there has been some examples of the repatriation kind of private cloud with additional build out kind of in the hybrid cloud space. Just curious if you have any notable trends kind of you have seen from the quarter?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes, George. I mean, I think we -- every quarter, we see a handful of these where people are running something in the public cloud and they might want to repatriate it back on-prem. We've certainly seen that with some of our customers. I wouldn't call it a major trend in terms of like everybody trying to do that but there's a few customers every quarter that we see doing that. What I would say is rather than looking at it from a repaitration angle, for us, the bigger angle is the fact that for -- since vast majority of enterprise workloads are still running on-prem in data centers their CIOs these days are the new reality for them is that the world is hybrid, and a lot of those workloads, they're going to look at how to run them on modern platforms, how to run them in a hybrid cloud kind of model. And not necessarily take all those workloads and take them to the public cloud, which may have been the case five years ago. So part this is more triggering a need for running modern applications, modernizing their on-prem infrastructure, running modern applications. And that goes for even the newest modern applications gen AI is a similar example of that. There will be in my view, a fair amount of gen AI workloads also being deployed on-prem where the data is and perhaps even at the edge where a lot of data being generated. So that's more the trend, I would say, call out rather than a mass repatriation.\nGeorge Wang : Just a quick follow-up. Just in terms of the incentives to a channel -- to attract new logos kind of -- do you have anything notable to cloud quarter-to-quarter or still kind of a similar sort of trend that you are certainly providing to the channel to kind of upsell and cross-sell. Just curious if there's additional initiatives on the promo and coming incentive front?\nRajiv Ramaswami : Yes. I mean we try to be somewhat neutral in terms of cloud versus on-prem. In fact, we have the same products and the same licensing, whether a customer chooses to deploy on-prem or in the public cloud. With respect to new logos, we are fine, in fact however, we get the new logos. In fact, it was interesting, we actually had a new logo this time. We didn't cover that in the earnings call, but it was actually an example of a customer who started with us in the public cloud. Before they -- and over time, they will deploy more on-prem, but they're starting out with us in the public cloud. Now that is not the norm. I would say most of our customers have started out with us on-prem and then move to the public cloud. But with respect to incentives to our field and to our channel, it's all around new logos, which are ways again.\nOperator: And I'm showing no further questions. This concludes today's Nutanix Q3 conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a solid third quarter. With results that came in ahead of our guidance. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives. And looking to optimize their total cost of ownership or TCO. Taking a closer look at the third quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered quarterly revenue of $525 million and grew our ARR 24% year-over-year to $1.82 billion. We also had another quarter of solid free cash flow generation. Overall, our third quarter financial performance reflected continued disciplined execution. Our largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix cloud platform to organizations that are looking to modernize and improve the efficiency of the data center footprint, while managing through some of the disruption from recent industry M&A. Our largest new customer win of the quarter was an eight-figure ACV deal with a North American-based Fortune 50 financial services company that was looking to streamline and automate the deployment and management of their substantial fleet of databases. This customer purchased the Nutanix Stock platform with Nutanix database service to automate all of their internal database deployment and management needs. While also modernizing the three tier footprint previously used for running their database. This win was substantially larger than our typical land win. And mark the culmination of an approximately two year engagement. Another notable win in Q3 was a significant renewal and expansion with a North American-based Fortune 500 provider of consumer packaged goods. This customer, whose data center footprint has historically been split between Nutanix and a competitor was looking to standardize their automation and self-service capabilities on a single class. They decided to standardize our Nutanix start platform, including our A3 hypervisor and Nutanix cloud management to handle their self-service and automation needs. They also added Nutanix unified storage and Nutanix database service for their unstructured data management and database automation needs, respectively. Going forward, this customer plans on swapping out the competitive software in their existing footprint and also utilizing Nutanix cloud platform for all of their expansion needs. We see these wins as a testament to our ability to both land significantly and expand within the largest companies. And we are encouraged by the substantial increase in the number of customers and partners engaging with us, including some of the world's largest companies. However, these larger opportunities tend to have longer sales cycles can involve aggressive competitive responses and exhibit great availability with respect to timing and outcome. Rukmini will provide more color on the impact of these dynamics. Last week, we held our annual .NEXT conference in Barcelona, Spain, where the excitement from the 4,000 plus attendees was tangible. At .NEXT, we made a number of announcements demonstrating continued progress and plans on enhancing the functionality of the Nutanix store platform and broadening our partnerships especially with respect to support for modern applications and enterprise AI. On the enterprise AI front, we announced GPT in-a-box 2.0, which will deliver expanded GPU and large language model support. Automated configuration and management of model inference endpoints for gen AI applications, simplified model management and an expanded partner program. This includes a new partnership with Hugging Face to provide access to the Hugging Face library of large language models for Nutanix customers as well as an expanded partnership with NVIDIA that includes the planned integration of NVIDIA's inference micro services or NIM, into our automated enterprise AI solution. More broadly, we continue to see a high level of interest and additional wins with DPT in a box in Q3, including a win with a large EMEA-based government agency that is looking to deploy gen AI with fraud detection at the initial use case. On the modern application front, we announced the Nutanix Kubernetes platform or NKP to simplify management of container-based modern applications using Kubernetes, on-premises and in any major public cloud service. We also took initial steps in extending our data services for Kubernetes or NKP to cloud-native, containerized environments. This will simplify the development of resilient data-intensive modern applications in public clouds and allow customers to ultimately run them anywhere in keeping with our project Beacon vision. Finally, we announced a broadening of our partnership with Dell, while Nutanix software already works well with Dell hardware, we announced two new elements of our long-standing partnership. First, then I'm going to sell a tightly integrated hyper-converged solution combining the Nutanix star platform software with Dell PowerEdge service. This will provide our customers with the choice of procuring Nutanix's platform directly from there. We expect that this solution will be available later this calendar year. Second, we will together deliver the Nutanix start platform powered by AHV hypervisor for compute and dell PowerFlex for storage. This will allow customers to reuse some of their existing IP-based Dell 3-tier storage hardware, protecting their investment and giving them choice. We are in the development stage for this offering at this time and expect it to be available in calendar 2025. Now I'd like to comment on the recently published results of our sixth annual Nutanix Enterprise Cloud Index, a survey of 1,500 IT decision makers around the world. The top three priorities identified by respondents were data security and ransomware protection, implementing the right hybrid IT operations and implementing AI strategies. I see these results as playing to the strength of the Nutanix fraud platform, which is built in ransomware protection with our data lens capability, enables hybrid multi-cloud operating models and has strong support for AI with our GPT and above solution. In closing, I'm pleased with our solid Q3 results. Our ongoing innovation on our cloud platform. Particularly with respect to its support for modern applications and generative AI and on the progress we continue to make on partnerships. We remain focused on delighting our customers while driving sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini? We thought about this one long and hard. Here's kind of the rationale for why we're doing this. One of the things we've talked about, as customers migrate from legacy three tier to HCI architecture that it requires them typically to do a hardware refresh, get out of their legacy storage arrays and some -- and their existing drivers in move to HCI configuration. And that actually can slow things down a bit in terms of our ability to get into an account because they have to wait for their hardware depreciation cycles typically before they buy new hardware. Now the rationale with this announcement with Dell is we're starting out by supporting AHP with PowerFlex, which is one of their Dell storage platforms. Now doing so allows us to get in the door right, with existing customers who have made an investment in the storage array already because having to replace the storage array. And so it allows a faster entry into an account, not slower. It's going to be faster, right, with a portion of our portfolio. And we are still very much on the mission of converting over time our customers to this modern cloud HCI architecture, which creates a platform for the future. So on balance, this gives us easier insertion into accounts where they're not quite ready to go depreciate their hardware yet, allowing us to then over time convert them over to HCI. So that's the rationale behind us supporting external storage. We are starting out with just IP storage only, and that was specifically with Dell PowerFlex at this time, right? And again, I think that's rationale. I think it factored into our current run rate, by the way on this. We already have our engineering teams sended this solution is in development currently, and it's included in our ongoing R&D expenses. So in Q3, we saw some good additional wins for this new solution with Cisco. And we've seen good encouraging progress with respect to Cisco's ability to bring in new logos for us. Also at .NEXT last week, we announced that we are certifying our HP hypervisor to run on Cisco UCS servers. This will enable customers to repurpose their existing Cisco servers to run our software. Connected to our storage-only nodes, right, again, running our own software. So with respect to the contribution, we expect to see a growing contribution from Cisco in and of course, into FY'25. And certainly, we are encouraged by the partnership in terms of their reps, especially their specialist tracks. Because Cisco, again has a very big sales force, but a lot of those sellers are also networking sellers, but they do have a specialist team, sales team coming and focusing on data center sales, and those are the people who are more familiar with the Nutanix offering. So we're overall encouraged by the contribution. The overall contribution for this year, a small modest as we said in the past, and we expect a bigger contribution into FY'25. So first of all, I want to say that, first of all, we are only initially supporting one storage platform, and that is PowerFlex, okay? But the concept it's about offering AHV standalone to work with third-party storage, right, which is a big chunk of the installed base out there, legacy installed base, which is separate ritualized servers connected to three tier storage. Now we are starting out with a very small footprint to be clear, right? We are not -- we're only supporting one storage array and it's an IP-based storage array. So we -- it will be -- I don't think we'll ever get to a point where we'll support every storage array that's out there in the planet. That's not going to happen. We will start with Dell PowerFlex and then over time, incrementally add other IP-based storage arrays, right, not fibre channel storage. So I expect that this is something that we can get a broader and broader opportunity scope over time but it does open the door to supporting third-party storage. Yes. I mean, Jason, again, as you can imagine, the whole reason for doing this is to provide an alternative solution for customers who are looking to reuse their existing storage but replace their hypervisor. So -- but we also want to think about this as an on-ramp to HCI, not just the standalone hypervisor being the end game in itself. And therefore, we will figure out what the appropriate pricing needs to be to achieve that outcome. So we haven't prices offering. It's still in development won't be available until next year. So, still early days for us. And we will monitor customer feedback and make more revisions on this over time. To Rukmini your point, we are seeing this dichotomy. We've got this vast opportunity opening up to us on the one hand and that's for sure. But at the same time, in terms of the deals that we are closing in the near term, right, I mean, these deals are taking longer, these larger deals. So on the opportunity side, I was at .NEXT last week, and it is amazing to see the substantial increase in the customers who are engaging with us, including some of the world's largest companies, and one that we have one business left and we are willing to talk about it very publicly in terms of their modernization experiences, their migration experiences. . And at the same time, we've seen an increased level of activity with our channel partners, our OEM partners are looking to engage deeper with us. Now the engagements themselves on the other side have been taking longer than expected to close, and they've shown greater variability with respect to the timing and the outcome than we expected. Now I think this is because of a higher mix of larger, more strategic opportunities and of course, some of which are influenced by the Broadcom acquisition. Now with respect to the Broadcom opportunity, we had said and we do expect that this will take out time to play for all the reasons we've previously discussed. That includes three reasons. First, many VMware customers have signed multiyear ELAs with VMware prior to the acquisition, buying them time. Second, as we've talked about before, a lot of this installed base also requires a hardware refresh to run HCI. Although once we do get out the HV, we start addressing a portion of this market as well. But also, I think the situation has been very dynamic recently, number three. We've seen Broadcom display a lot of flexibility with respect to their pricing, they are packaging changes, especially when they are faced with the probability of losing some of their larger customers are responding to push back from the market and from the customer base. So that's -- those are some of the reasons why we've had some pressure on our recent new and expansion ACV performance. Maybe I can take that. There's multiple reasons for that Wamsi. So first, of course, look, there is a larger set of market opportunities available to us at these other accounts and these other accounts in to be associated with larger deals, number one. Number two, our platform has evolved to a point where we can go after pretty much all the workloads that companies are running, so -- which means we can go off for a broader opportunity set. Number three, of course, the competitive dynamics in terms of what's happening with Broadcom is stimulating a portion of this. And so these are the reasons why we are seeing more large deals in our pipeline. Maybe I'll take that to start. Rukmini, you can provide more color. I would say largely the opportunity is a multi-year opportunity, as we've been saying all along. It's not here and now in terms of closing deals, right? These things are going to take many years. We look at it as a multiyear tailwind for us. For all the reasons that we talked about, Simon. And I don't think it's -- that part of it has changed, right? It's been the same, as we said, right? The customers who sign ELAs therefore, it takes time. There's -- the hardware refresh cycle is involved in the process. The only big change that we've seen over the last couple of months, in fact, is that the situation with respect what Broadcom is doing is also evolving rapidly. They've tried a bunch of things. They're stepping back on some of the things that they've tried. Of course, for the competitive situation, this is quite dynamic on that front. And these larger deals, of course, are taking longer also for us to close. So the ones that are in the pipeline are taking for all these reasons that we talked about. So I'd say compared to the overall thesis about this being a multi-year opportunity hasn't really changed for us. In the short-term, I think what we're seeing is these larger deals are going to take more time. And that's just a fact of life as we have to deal with the dynamics of all the things that are going on right now. Yes. I think, first of all, I think clearly, Broadcom is doing what they're doing in terms of the bundling and the subscription price increases and so forth. Now when we look at our pricing response there, we've always been competitively priced from HCI architecture, right? A lot of the competitive or the installed base out there is legacy, right, which is three tier architecture with separate storage. And our philosophy has always been to make sure that our solution pricing is attractive from a HCI perspective as companies move from the legacy architecture to the modern HCI architecture. And that's still the underlying philosophy that drives our pricing and we price to value. We've always been a premium offering in the market, and we pride ourselves on being really supply to use, delighting our customers but also pricing based on value. So we continue to do that, Simon. So that part hasn't changed. I think -- and we will continue to be agile in terms of responding to what we see as competitive situations in the market. Yes. And we've seen them respond aggressively when they are faced with the sort of losing large customers. I'll cover Powerflex, and Rukmini will cover renewals. So on the PowerFlex equation, of course, there is an initial development effort to take our hypervisor and make it standalone ready, right? We've never had that in the past because we've always sold our hypervisor as part of our HCI solution. And now for the first time, we are disaggregating it. So there is some development work required to do that and we are doing that, and the first target is PowerFlex. Now once we do this with PowerFlex, I expect that the additional effort to bring on other IP storage, right, clearly IP, not Fibre Channel, IP storage, will be incremental. We won't have to do all of this over again. Once we have the first storage are qualified with incremental work, we should be able to bring in more IP storage array into the mix. Yes. I think certainly, first of all, we haven't seen any changes to our conversion ratio on the -- what you would call maybe run rate deals. And I think we -- in terms of what we are doing on that front by on the run rate stuff also, we are incentivizing our channels to get us more new logos. We have -- we have migration programs in place for competitive take outs. We are, of course, companies like Cisco can help bring us more new logos there as well. And then in terms of larger deals fits us, when you look at what we're trying to do there to expedite the larger deals that we talked about, we are -- we put together a cross-functional team for these types of large deals that include sales, finance and product folks with executive sponsorship for pursuing these deals specifically. And we are quite familiar with the cycle of this product qualification, customer-specific requests that may come in for some of these larger wins vendor qualification process, and then, of course, commercial negotiations, right, all of these. So we do what we can do under our control. But at the same time, we also have to factor in the customers' time lines and processes. As well, right, because that's going to be a gating item as well in some of these. Yes. I think there is a natural sequence of hardware refresh that is driven by typically aging of hardware on the one side. And then, on the other side, new initiatives. And I think what you're talking about comes from the AI. AI is very much part of the new initiatives, Ben. So -- so when it comes to the AI part for enterprise AI, I mean, there's been a lot of talk about AI in the public cloud, and a lot of it has to do with training of these large language models. Now an enterprise AI it has to be run where the data is. And a lot of that is going to be on-prem. And in fact, I think that's the reason why we announced our GPT in-a-box 2.0, simplifying things as well as the partnerships that we announced last week at .NEXT. But most of our customers, I would say, are in the early phases of that journey. A lot of them are doing proof of concept and initial use cases to validate the gen AI use cases that we've talked about. Whether it be fraud detection or customer support or documents such as summarization or co-piloting. So they're still pretty early on that front. They're making certainly hardware investments, but I would say more for proof-of-concept and trying out rather than volume production and deployment. And I think this will play out over time. They're going to go through these concepts proof-of-concept, validate the business proposition and then get into a production deployment scenario. Yes. I think on the smaller deals, it's more business as usual. I mean our field reps are at the front of that opportunity with customers. And in very small -- in a sector of the market, we have actually had the channel, our channel partners take the lead on some of those opportunities. But in a lot of these cases, our reps are very much involved and they're compensated in exactly the same way as they will be compensated for any other deal because for us, new business is a new business, whether it comes as large or small. And like I said, with respect to the conversion rate on the smaller deals, we haven't seen any real changes over the last several quarters. It's been roughly about the same. So we haven't seen any major changes on that front. Rukmini, is there anything that you would like to add on this? Yes, George. I mean, I think we -- every quarter, we see a handful of these where people are running something in the public cloud and they might want to repatriate it back on-prem. We've certainly seen that with some of our customers. I wouldn't call it a major trend in terms of like everybody trying to do that but there's a few customers every quarter that we see doing that. What I would say is rather than looking at it from a repaitration angle, for us, the bigger angle is the fact that for -- since vast majority of enterprise workloads are still running on-prem in data centers their CIOs these days are the new reality for them is that the world is hybrid, and a lot of those workloads, they're going to look at how to run them on modern platforms, how to run them in a hybrid cloud kind of model. And not necessarily take all those workloads and take them to the public cloud, which may have been the case five years ago. So part this is more triggering a need for running modern applications, modernizing their on-prem infrastructure, running modern applications. And that goes for even the newest modern applications gen AI is a similar example of that. There will be in my view, a fair amount of gen AI workloads also being deployed on-prem where the data is and perhaps even at the edge where a lot of data being generated. So that's more the trend, I would say, call out rather than a mass repatriation. Yes. I mean we try to be somewhat neutral in terms of cloud versus on-prem. In fact, we have the same products and the same licensing, whether a customer chooses to deploy on-prem or in the public cloud. With respect to new logos, we are fine, in fact however, we get the new logos. In fact, it was interesting, we actually had a new logo this time. We didn't cover that in the earnings call, but it was actually an example of a customer who started with us in the public cloud. Before they -- and over time, they will deploy more on-prem, but they're starting out with us in the public cloud. Now that is not the norm. I would say most of our customers have started out with us on-prem and then move to the public cloud. But with respect to incentives to our field and to our channel, it's all around new logos, which are ways again. Thank you."

            "name": "Rukmini Sivaraman",
            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. I will first review our Q3 fiscal '24 results followed by guidance for Q4 fiscal '24 and the implied full year fiscal year '24 guidance. Results in Q3 '24 came in above the high end of our range across all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q3 were $289 million, above the guided range of $265 million to $275 million, representing year-over-year growth of 20%. Revenue in Q3 was $525 million, higher than the guided range of $510 million to $520 million, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 17%. ARR at the end of Q3 was $1.82 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 24%. In Q3, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. Average contract duration in Q3 was three years higher than Q2. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 86.5%, higher than our guided range of approximately 85%. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 14% higher than our guided range of 7.5% to 8.5%, largely due to: one, lower operating expenses as a result of higher-than-expected nonrecurring payments related to one of our partnership agreements and timing of hiring; and two, higher revenue and higher gross margin. Non-GAAP net income in Q3 was $85 million or fully diluted EPS of $0.28 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 302 million shares. DSOs based on revenue and ending accounts receivable were 39 days in Q3. Free cash flow in Q3 was $78 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 15%. We ended Q3 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.651 billion, up slightly from $1.644 billion at the end of Q2. We continued repurchasing shares in Q3 under the share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors. We have repurchased about $106 million worth of shares year-to-date through Q3 '24. As a reminder, our sustainable generation of free cash flow enabled us to transition to net share settlement to pay for employees' tax liability on RSU vesting starting in Q2 and going forward from our previous method of cell to cover. We used $58 million of our cash in Q3 and $53 million in Q2 for a total of over $111 million of cash year-to-date for this purpose. More information on the mechanics of net share settlement and its impact can be found in the Appendix section of our earnings presentation found on our Investor Relations website. This along with our share repurchase program will help us continue to manage dilution. Moving to Q4 '24. Our guidance for Q4 is as follows: ACV billings of $295 million to $305 million, revenue of $530 million to $540 million, non-GAAP gross margin of 85% to 86% and non-GAAP operating margin of 9% to 10% and fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 302 million shares. The updated guidance for full year fiscal year '24 is as follows: ACV billings of $1.12 billion to $1.13 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 18% at the midpoint of the range, revenue of $2.13 billion to $2.14 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 86%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 15% and free cash flow of $520 million to $540 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 25% at the midpoint. I will now provide some commentary regarding our updated fiscal year '24 guidance, specifically the following four points: first, we are seeing continued and significant new and expansion opportunities for our solutions. However, we continue to see a higher mix of larger deals in our pipeline which is driving greater variability in our new and expansion business. The number of opportunities greater than $1 million in ACV in our pipeline has grown at higher than 30% for each of the last 3 quarters compared to the corresponding quarters last year. Relatedly, the dollar amount of pipeline from opportunities greater than $1 million in ACV has grown at well over 50% and for each of the last three quarters compared to the corresponding quarters last year. These larger opportunities often involve strategic decisions and C-suite approvals, causing them to take longer to close and to have greater variability in timing, outcome and deal structure. And as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels. Our fiscal year '24 new and expansion ACV and ARR performance year-to-date have been affected by these dynamics and have been below our initial expectations at the beginning of the fiscal year. We expect these dynamics to continue in Q4. As an example, for the eight figure ACV transaction in Q3 that Rajiv mentioned, we expect the billings and cash collection to be in Q4, while the associated subscription revenue is expected to be recognized over multiple years starting in fiscal year '25. Additionally, it is worth noting that this transaction was approximately two years in the making, taking longer to close than our prior expectations, but came in with a longer contract duration and a higher total contract value than expected. We anticipate similar variability in deal structures and longer sales cycles for some of the larger opportunities in our pipeline. Second, the guidance assumes that our renewals business will continue to perform well in Q4. Third, the full year guidance continues to assume that average contract duration would be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '23, as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billing. Fourth, the updated full year free cash flow guidance includes the benefit of the eight figure ACV transaction, which was booked in Q3. In addition, the full year free cash flow guidance also assumes the impact of certain nonrecurring benefits over the course of the year, including approximately $40 million of operating expenses, of which we expect to receive approximately $30 million of non-recurring cash payments related to one of our partnership agreements. In closing, we are pleased that our Q3 performance exceeded guidance across all metrics and to continue to make significant progress aligned with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. So we are not commenting on the specific size of the deal beyond what we said in terms of eight figure ACV. And I'll also remind folks that we do collect cash upfront for all -- it's a multiyear contract. And we alluded to the fact that this transaction came in with a longer contract duration than we had initially expected. So the total TCV, actually, the total contract value was larger than we had expected, Pinjalim. And so yes, we're happy to be able to raise our free cash flow guide to the range that we did $520 million to $540 million for the full year. Correct. I mean, I think we have strong pipeline generation. And we gave you some qualification around the larger deal pipeline, which we did comment on last quarter as well. And the qualification I had in my script was that if you look at opportunities greater than $1 million in ACV as a threshold in our pipeline, that number of deals have grown at higher than 30%, right, for each of the last three quarters and the dollar amount of that pipeline from opportunities greater than $1 million has gone even faster at well over 50%. And so the pipeline is strong. I think what we're seeing and what in the market is a bit of a dichotomy on that versus I think what's closing and I'll let Rajiv, do you want to add more I mean. So to date, this fiscal year, we've been outperforming our initial free cash flow expectations but have been below our initial expectations on new and expansion ACV and ARR as you alluded to. While we're not commenting on fiscal year '25 or longer-term targets today, we remain committed to driving top line growth. And strong free cash flow generation and we expect to provide our initiative fiscal '25 guidance on our next earnings call as we typically do. The one thing, to reiterate that Simon is that while the -- while Broadcom's effective list prices for many of their customers may have increased significantly, the actual prices, meaning the discount levels in the market, especially when there's sort of a risk of losing business or otherwise challenge. Can -- as you can imagine will be lower than those list prices. And as Rajiv said, remain quite dynamic is what we're seeing in the market. And Meta to your second question on renewals. So we have seen outperformance of our renewals business so far this fiscal year due to a combination of a few things. One is good discipline around renewals economics and pricing. Second is improved on-time renewal performance. And then third is some early and core term renewals setting, with respect to your specific question. And so the benefit of this stronger performance has primarily been seen in ACV billings and free cash flow. And just as a reminder, this will have a modest benefit to revenue because revenue from early renewals, specifically on the early renewal piece would only be recognized in the quarter in which they are due. So yes, overall happy with the outperformance in renewals year-to-date. So I would say, in general, our guidance philosophy hasn't changed, Mike. What we are trying to do is to, of course, put more -- create more visibility internally and put more scrutiny around how we review the opportunities in our pipeline. And this is in partnership with our sales organization as they think about these opportunities coming in, how we qualify them and how can we think about just the quality of the pipeline in addition to the quantity of the pipeline. We also, as you can imagine, my closely watch duration here, right, at how long the pipeline has been open and we'll continue to do so. I think I would say we have, as we've talked about on these calls, have closed some larger deals over the last few quarters, including the one we talked about the Rajiv the eight figure ACV that we talked about. But we'll continue to sort of build more data points, right, as we do more of those. So yes, I think trying to put more rigor into various processes, both on the go-to-market side and on the finance side. With the philosophy in terms of how we approach guidance hasn't changed, but certainly a lot more rigor being put into how we think about forecasting. : So I'm not going to get more specific on what the payment is. But it is a $40 million benefit to OpEx this year, it was throughout the year. And it's expected to be off that $40 million, $30 million will also be free cash flow benefited this year. The only other maybe modeling point for you all is that $40 million of OpEx that I will return in terms of benefit is sitting in the R&D line within OpEx for your reference. Only on I think Ben's question about duration, I think it is how long they're taking that was part of the question, Ben. I think we talked about how these larger deals do tend to take longer often because they're strategic or they just have more approvals, things like that. And we haven't kind of given you a specific quantification of one versus the other. We did give the example though of this particular eight figure deal. That we talked about, which took approximately two years for it to come to a close. So yes, it is -- it does take longer than what I think was referred to earlier as sort of our run rate business."

Finally, our third quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period will begin on Tuesday, April16th. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich. And good afternoon, everyone. We've delivered a solid second quarter, with results that came in ahead of our guidance. The macro backdrop in our second quarter remain uncertain, but stable relative to the prior quarter. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership or TCO.  Taking a closer look at the second quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all of our guided metrics. We delivered record quarterly revenue of $565 million and grew our ARR 26% year-over-year to $1.74 billion. We also had another quarter of strong free cash flow generation.  Finally, we achieved quarterly GAAP operating profitability for the first time in Q2, demonstrating the progress we continue to make on driving operating leverage in our subscription model. Overall, our second quarter financial performance reflected continued discipline execution. Our largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix cloud platform to organizations that are looking to adopt hybrid multi cloud operating models optimize the performance of their workloads and improve their TCO all while managing through some of the disruption from recent industry M&A.  A good example is a seven figure win with a global EMEA based provider of automotive technology solutions. This new customer had an existing three tier footprint in need of a refresh, but was frustrated by the recent price increases of their incumbent vendor and was also looking to have the flexibility to potentially move some of their footprint to the public cloud in future. They chose our Nutanix Cloud Platform, including our AHP hypervisor, as well as Nutanix Cloud Management, based on its superior TCO, built-in automation for infrastructure as a service. And its ability to seamlessly transition workloads to public cloud via our NC2 solution. We see this win as a good example of the value customers see in our cloud platform for both, modernization and providing a seamless pathway to the public cloud.  A second good example is a win with a large North American based hedge fund, that was looking to mitigate the growing cost of its public cloud hosted virtual desktop infrastructure or VDI. And for a more responsive solution to meet the performance demands of its traders. They chose to repatriate their VDI onto the Nutanix Cloud Platform on GPU based servers. Resulting in a meaningful improvement in performance and an estimated 60% plus TCO savings. We believe this win demonstrates the ability of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to seamlessly run and manage workloads wherever the optimal performance and TCO can be achieved, whether on premise, at the edge or in the public cloud.  A final example if one of our largest new customer wins in the quarter, with a global airline based in the EMEA region that was looking to modernize their feature infrastructure, while enabling a hybrid multi cloud environment. This customer chosen Nutanix Cloud Platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management to run their business critical application, leveraging its simplicity and built-in automation for infrastructure as a service. They also adopted Nutanix database service for managing and deploying their databases throughout their organization, and Nutanix unified storage to service their unstructured data needs. We see this win as evidence of the value companies see in adopting our full stack solution.  Moving on, adopting and benefiting from generating AI, is top of mind for many of our customers. As such, interest remains high in our GPT in-a-Box offering, which enables our customers to accelerate the use of generative AI across their enterprises, while keeping their data secure. Last quarter, we saw our first win for GPT in-a-Box with a large federal agency. In this quarter, we saw multiple additional wins for a Gen AI ready infrastructure offering. While it's still early days, and the numbers remain small, I'm excited about the longer term potential for GPT in-a-Box.  Finally, on the partner front, I'm happy with the early progress we're seeing with our Cisco partnership. We continue to see good customer interest in our joint offering and saw additional wins for it in the second quarter. While it's still early in this partnership, I'm encouraged by what we've seen so far.  In closing, we are encouraged that the compelling value proposition of our cloud platform and the strength of our business model enable us to increase our top and bottom line outlook for fiscal 2024. We remain focused on delighting our customers while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv. I will first review our Q2 fiscal '24 results, followed by guidance for Q3 fiscal '24. And finally provide an updated view of our full year fiscal year '24 guidance.  Results in Q2 '24 came in higher than the high end of our range across all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q2 were $329 million above the guided range of $295 million to $305 million representing year-over-year growth of 23%. The outperformance was driven by better than expected renewal performance due to a combination of good discipline around renewals economics, improved on time renewal performance, as well as early and core term renewals.  Revenue in Q2 was $565 million, higher than the guidance range of $545 million to $555 million and the year-over-year growth rate of 16%. ARR at the end of Q2 was $1.737 billion representing year-over-year growth of 26%. In Q2, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. Average contract duration in Q2 was 2.8 years, slightly lower than Q1, and more or less in line with our expectations.  Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 87.3%. Higher than our guided range of 85% to 86%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 21.9%, higher than our guidance range of 14% to 16%, largely due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses as a result of timing of hiring. Non-GAAP net income was $136 million, or fully diluted EPS of $0.46 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 299 million shares.  Q2 marked our first ever quarter of positive GAAP operating income of $37 million and a positive GAAP net income of $33 million, with fully diluted GAAP EPS of $0.12 per share. Given expected variability in quarterly revenue and timing of expenses, we would not expect to be consistently profitable at the GAAP operating profit level over the near term.  DSOs based on revenue and ending accounts receivable were 31 days in Q2. Free cash flow in Q2 was $163 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 29%, higher than our expectations due to higher billings and lower expenses in the quarter.  We ended Q2 with cash, cash equivalents and short term investment of $1.644 billion up from $1.571 billion at the end of Q1. We continued repurchasing shares in Q2 under the share repurchase program, previously authorized by our Board of Directors. Our sustainable generation of free cash flow enabled us to transition the net share settlement to pay for employees' tax liability on RSU Vesting in Q2, and going forward from our previous method of sell to cover. This, along with our share repurchase program will help us continue to manage dilution.  Moving to Q3 '24, our guidance for Q3 is as follows: ACV billings of $265 million to $275 million, revenue of $510 million to $520 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 85%, on-GAAP operating margin of 7.5% to 8.5%. And fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 301 million shares. The updated guidance for full year fiscal year '24, which is higher than our previously provided fiscal year '24 guidance across all metrics is as follows; ACV billings of $1.09 billion to $1.11 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint of the range. Revenue of $2.12 billion to $2.15 billion representing a year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin of 85% to 86%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 12.5% to 13.5%. Free cash flow of $420 million to $440 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 20% at the midpoint.  I will now provide some commentary regarding our updated fiscal year '24 guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels. Our fiscal year '24 new and expansion ACV performance outlook assume some impact from these macro dynamics. We are also seeing a higher mix of larger deals in our pipeline, which is driving greater variability in the timing of our new and expansion business.  Second, the guidance assumes that our renewals business will continue to perform well. Third, the full year guidance continues to assume that average contract duration would be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '23, as renewals continue to grow as a percent of our total billing. Fourth, a reminder that the full year ACV billing is not the straight sum of the ACV billings of the four quarters due to contracts with duration less than one year. We expect full year ACV billings to be about 5% to 6% lower than the sum of the four quarters ACV billings.  In closing, we are pleased that our Q2 results exceeded guidance and to raise our top line and bottom line guidance for the full fiscal year. We remain focused on driving growth to capture the significant opportunity ahead of us and are investing prudently for that growth, consistent with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJim Fish: Hey, guys, thanks, thanks for questions. Awesome quarter here. Look, I'm going to ask the obvious, that's on top of everybody's mind, and I'm sure you're totally prepared for. On the VMware opportunity and Rukmini, you even just mentioned, you know, you're seeing a higher mix of larger deals in the pipeline. So my question to you is, is what sort of pipeline or bookings build Have you seen relative to this stage last year, between either direct customers kind of coming to you or partners coming over to you as well in terms of signups? \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, why don't I start Jim, and Rukmini can give you color on the pipeline. So, first of all, I think, as you said, I mean, there are significant concerns from VMware customers regarding the Broadcom acquisition. And we think that this is a significant multi-year opportunity for us to win new customers and to gain share. Now, getting to your question a bit here, the timing and magnitude of these deals is a bit unpredictable. Our pipeline is quite substantial, and growing.  Now for a number of reasons, we expect contribution for the opportunity to build gradually, and here are the reasons. First one, Jim is that many customers signed multi-year ELAs enterprise agreements with VMware prior to the deal closing three to five years. So it buys them some time to make decisions. The second, converting from VMware 3-tier accounts or legacy storage accounts, which is a good chunk of VMware footprint, in many cases requires a refresh of their storage and our servers, right, one of the two, which could also impact the timing of the potential software purchases that they would make with us. Okay.  And the last piece is like with all these accounts, we typically ever land and expand motion. So the first deal could be followed, and then there's a lot of potential for expansion further than that.  And then Rukmini, you want to take this? \nRukmini Sivaraman: Sure. Yes, I'll add one thing, Jim, to your question is that, I mentioned in my prepared remarks about this. Higher mix of larger deals that we're seeing in our pipeline and that is driving the greater variability, we believe in the timing of our new and expansion business, as well as potentially contributing to the longer average sales cycles, because larger deals do tend to take longer to close.  And we believe that this higher mix of larger deals in the pipeline is driven by, you know, one, our segmentation of market, as we've talked about before, and the improved product readiness for those larger customers. And secondly, some of the dynamics that Rajiv talked about already regarding concerns from larger customers, regarding the impacts from Broadcom\u2019s acquisition of VMware. And so we have continued and continue to factor all of the impact of some of these dynamics into our updated fiscal year '24 outlook.\nJim Fish: Make sense. And just a follow up here. You know, there's a bit of confusion out there, from what I can tell on the conversations with investors between, what VMware can do that Nutanix can't do. And, so Rajiv, what differences actually exist, if any, or features or functions -- exist, what the differences kind of exist, if any, between vSphere, for example, and Acropolis or the VMware platform versus Nutanix platform, or features functions you plan to add in order to make it an apple to apples compare, or is it simply just a legacy market perception thing that you guys can't address, really what most of VMware could do? And really, why wouldn't we start to see that Acropolis attach rate get closer to, you know, 100% on every deal that you signed from kind of here on forward. Thanks, guys. \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So Jim, I think first of all, if you compare the full stack that Broadcom was offering with VMware Cloud Foundation, that, -- and our Nutanix cloud platform pretty much goes head to head against that, and we've got all the capabilities. That's a full stack that includes, the hypervisor, a software defined storage, networking and management. So we compare very well with that full stack and we're able to go to a very comparable offering. And indeed, as you can see, right our AHP penetration our hypervisor penetration, our install base is about 70%. And we are seeing new customers who adopt a full stack start with our own hypervisor, okay.  That part is fair. Now when it comes to the lower tier offering, VMware does have a vSphere and now it's called I believe VMware Virtual Foundation, VVF. That includes vSphere, some operations management capabilities, et cetera. Now, what you -- what I mentioned earlier, in response to the question was that, there is some amount of VMware, in fact a big chunk of VMware it's only the hypervisor that's connected to legacy storage, right 3-tier storage arrays.  Now, the way we go after the market is not to just simply replace the hypervisor with our hypervisor, because our hypervisor also is part of our complete solution, right, which includes our storage. So customers are actually making a shift from a legacy architecture that say hypervisor plus external storage to a modern HCI architecture that includes our hypervisor, but also the rest of our stack.  So there, it's not just a simple life for life, but it's a conversion, and modernization of infrastructure as well. So I feel pretty good about what we can do, we can handle all the workloads. We have a hybrid cloud solution, we have a modern app platform that customers can run Kubernetes applications on. We have partnerships with Red Hat for OpenShift. We have partnerships with our cloud partners like Azure and AWS. So from a capability of the portfolio perspective, we're very much there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Your line is open. \nJason Ader: Thank you. Hi, Rajiv, hi Rukmini. I just wanted to ask on that kind of follow up threads on the last question just on the 3-tier architectures out there. And most of those are running VMware today. Does it feel like this change with the Broadcom acquisition actually could accelerate the transition away from 3-tier architectures as customers maybe get a little bit disenfranchised, and are looking for alternatives? And then it's like, well, we never really looked at HCI that closely. But now, maybe we should. Are those kinds of conversations happening?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Very much so, I would say, Jason. So in fact, you're right. There's a lot of VMware with what we call 3-tier. And one of the things that Broadcom itself is doing has done by the way is that the VMware Cloud Foundation that includes HCI and that their default offering to a lot of the bigger customers. So effectively now, it's not just us doing HCI, but they're also putting, which puts a little bit of pressure on the 3-tier storage piece of it. And so we are clearly focused on that opportunity, in terms of -- and we've been doing that all day long, right, since we've started, migrating, legacy 3-tier over HCI, and potentially that this might help.  Now, the other thing we should also keep in mind just so that we don't lose track of it. There are even easier assertion opportunities now. Because there is a substantial base of vSphere plus VSAN HCI out there. And so that's almost the like for like. Those customers have already made the HCI decision, and they might be looking at, if they're looking to migrate away from VMware, we pretty much have a like for like solution that that we can migrate over to. And we are doing, we're not sitting idle here, right, we are doing a bunch of things to capitalize on the opportunity, I'd say three things that we're doing. First is that we have been targeting some more advertising dollars to maximize the awareness of Nutanix as the simplest, easiest, viable alternative for these customers.  Number two, we've also put in place incentives for our partners, who are helping customers get to our platform for new customers, as partners bring new customers to us, we give them more incentives. Number three, we're also helping end customers with migration. When they have a VMware environment, they're looking to bring our environment on, there's a period of time where they might have dual operating costs, and we try to help them out on that front. So we're also taking some very specific steps to go out for the opportunity.\nJason Ader: Great, and then a real quick follow up just on your comments on Cisco, that you're happy with early progress. When do you think, Rajiv that could start to really be a material contributor to the business? \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, we factored in a modest contribution this year, Jason, from Cisco. I do expect that the contribution is going to be more significant in FY '25. And we\u2019ll cover that when we get to, you know, when we are ready to talk about that FY '25 guide. But, clearly, it takes time to build this up, we focused on enabling the full solution, training that sellers. And we're happy with the progress we're making. We are getting new customers through the cloud now. And they are motivated. So I think over time, it will build.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for next question. And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is open. \nWamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you so much. You drove very strong operating leverage in the quarter. Can you talk about if there were any one time things in there? I think, Rukmini, you mentioned something around hiring I didn't really catch. But, was there any one time things in there when why is that rewarding lower next fiscal quarter? Then I have a follow-up.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Hi, Wamsi. Thanks for the question. So the reference I made in terms of our operating margin performance in Q2, which was came in strong at 22% and higher than our expectation was, one revenue was higher than we expected. And expenses were a bit lower because of timing of hiring, and just overall good expense management. And we do expect that expenses will go up in the second half. So if you look at half over half operating expenses implied in the guide, that does go up in the second half, one way, and of course, Q3 compared to Q2, seasonally, the revenue is lower in Q3, that it doesn't in Q2. So those are some of the things that are factoring into the outlook.  But overall, you know, I'd say, we have continued to be focused on investing and investing thoughtfully on this growth opportunity that's ahead of us. And so that's the approach we've taken. And overall, we've been pleased to take up our full year outlook on both top and bottom line.\nWamsi Mohan : Okay, thanks. Makes a lot of sense. And then, Rajiv, I mean, you made some comments already. But can you perhaps maybe quantitatively talk about the wins that are coming your way because of this M&A? And, and sort of, you know, how many points of growth potentially we should be thinking about? Or how many points of share that you think you could see shift over to Nutanix, given this disruption, or even maybe if you can talk about it in qualitative terms around rate and pace of pipeline build? Just quarter-over-quarter over the last few quarters? That will be helpful. Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Wamsi first of all, I think it's going be hard for me to give you some very specific quantitative numbers at this point. But what I'd say is, is for sure, right, if you look at our last Investor Day, we talked about our TAM and the SAM as part of that right the $60 billion $70 billion TAM and SAM. And what we really expect is, I mean, we've always been going and continuing to grow market share and eat into that SAM, and what this event creates is an opportunity to speed that up. So it's the same, the TAM and SAM haven't really changed. It's still the same, but now we're able to get after more of it quicker.  Now, the challenge with quantifying it is that it's very hard to predict right I mean, as we bought that, how much of this is going to come out quickly? And this is what, it's a little early to, for us to say something there. So we've got, like I said, we've got customers who want to do something different, but they've got these three five year relays. They're not in a rush. There's some time it takes to convert customers, and they have to depreciate the hardware that they bought, for example. And then you know, the -- you bring us in for a small portion and expand. So all of these things create some unpredictability in terms of timing, and how quickly can we capture it. But, I certainly think that this provides us an opportunity for us to capture more of the market quicker, and we're trying to move as quickly as we can.  I don\u2019t know, Rukmini, if you want to provide any color on the pipeline?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, I may add one thing to that, Rajiv, which is that. I think Wamsi your question is specifically around what we can tell about this opportunity as a result of VMware\u2019s acquisition by Broadcom. And I say, I think the other nuance here is we've always competed against VMware, right. And so in some cases, it's quite clear to tell, well, this door wasn't open to us before. And now it is because of what they may be seeing from our competitor. But in other cases, and we talked about an example on the last earnings call, where existing customers of ours are maybe choosing to invest more than us or go single source with us, a partly influenced by this, right.  So this idea of in some cases, it's clear, in other cases, it's more of A factor, an important factor, but one factor, and so that those situations, it's harder for us to attribute specifically, dollars and pipeline and things like that, to this particular disruption in the competitive market. So, all those factors combined, are what makes us, feel good that this is a multi-year and opportunity, as Rajiv has mentioned, but difficult to get precise in terms of magnitude and timing.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan, your line is open.\nPinjalim Bora : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. Rajiv, one of your partners, compare the Nutanix Cisco relationship and the buzz around it to the formative years of VCE and noted how VCE was kind of a game changer for VMware at the time. Do you think the Cisco partnership could be that pivotal for Nutanix? And secondly, do you think there any learnings from the rise and fall of the VCE that you can apply I guess, to this relationship? \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I've actually there at Cisco at that time, when the VCE partnership and clearly very cyclical initially. Now, I -- it's hard for me to compare VCE back then converged infrastructure with this. But I'll tell you the, this -- I'll give you the sort of the puts and takes. So clearly, Cisco has huge market leverage and market position, in terms of their sellers, and their access to big accounts, their presence in all these accounts.  Now, if you look at this particular space in the market, there are several positions, it's not that there are small, relatively small market share player when it comes to servers compared to some of their other competitors. So it's -- so they're not as strong in this segment of the market. However, I mean, they certainly have a big overall market cloud. So now, what could the two of us do together really to go into the market, and that's really I think, where I do see significant potential here. Over time, again, it has to take time to build up. And it -- Cisco also has a complex sell emotion, they have generalists, they have specialists. And right now, we are more focused on the data center specialists as they have and working together with them.  So to answer your question, I mean, it's still early days for us to predict how big this could be for us. And I would say, you know, we, I am optimistic, and I think this opportunity is also going to build up over time. And certainly continuing to -- and in fact there's a lot of cooperation happening between our sellers, and Cisco sellers in the field. So all good, good omens at this point in time, but still very early.\nPinjalim Bora : Understood. I guess we'll stay tuned. One question for you Rukmini, the ACV billings guidance for fiscal Q3. Seems like it calls for maybe a little bit higher sequential drawdown. I want to ask you the sales cycle elongation comment that you have made, was that versus Q1, the elongation in Q2 that you saw, was that sequential and are you assuming kind of a similar sequential? Higher elongation in the Q3 guide as well?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi, Pinjalim. Thank you for that question. So on this -- I think the first part of the question was on seasonality between Q2 and Q3. And so on that front, if you look back to sort of our initial guidance that we gave for Q3 last year, this time, Pinjalim, it was actually quite similar in terms of what we guided for Q3 versus Q2. But we were able to beat Q3 and so the actual I think, is what you're referring to, was smaller than what we guided to. But the decrease, I would say, is more or less in line with what we'd expect for seasonality and what we expected at this time last year, as well.  And then to your point on the average sale cycle, and modest elongation we're seeing there, it moves around a bit quarter to quarter, Pinjalim, but what I was referring to is that when we look back at to historical levels, it remains somewhat elevated. And so that's what I was referring to.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, our next question. Our next question comes from George Wang from Barclays. Your line is open.\nGeorge Wang : Hey, guys, congrats on the quarter and the guidance, I have two quick ones. Firstly, you briefly touch on the potential, the discounts and promotions to promote VMware customers. And I just want to kind of see if you can elaborate on the approach for the fiscal partnership, the HyperFlex customers, maybe you can give some color just on the incentives, you guys are providing to kind of further drive the adoption from the older HyperFlex customers?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, we have, I think I would say that Cisco, with Cisco, clearly we have a, they are -- they've end of life HyperFlex, first of all, and there's a limited time where you know that so \u2013 they no longer selling the product, and there's a limited support window for it. So that by itself, by the way it creates an incentive for HyperFlex customers to migrate. And we through Cisco, of course, as a whole, Cisco has a set of programs for migration. And they're good at driving those types of migration initiatives. And we are supporting them as they do that. So this is being done largely through Cisco and through the Cisco router market.\nGeorge Wang: Also Rajiv, quickly, you talked about repatriation in the prepared remarks. I'm just curious, are you seeing a more visible inflection point in terms of the repatriation to the private cloud or is still a continuation of prior trends just besides lower TCO, kind of versus expensive public cloud. Can you can talk about other factors may contribute to continue repatriation to the private cloud?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I\u2019ll give you two-part answer to that, George. So I don't know if I can call it a point of inflection. But certainly we are seeing more examples of people repatriating but that those are examples. It's hard for me to say you know that there's a whole trend here. Yes. But some are certainly repatriating like the example I talked about. But also, I think the other thing that we should keep in mind is that the bulk of enterprise workloads are still not in the public cloud. They're still sitting in data centers.  I'm talking about enterprise workloads, because what has gone to the public cloud largely have been net new applications. So for these workloads are still sitting in the enterprise environment, I think CIOs are being a lot more careful about how much of that do they take to the public cloud? So there's yes, there's some repatriation happening from the public cloud back on-prem. But there's also a lot more scrutiny and forethought being applied to what should I take going forward into the public cloud from where I'm at?\nOperator: Thank you one moment for next question. Our next question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham. Your line is open.\nMichael Cikos : Hey, thank you guys. And I, I wanted to eco my comments as well, in addition to the others as far as the great quarter and the results here. I picked a bit of a two parter here. But the first I know coming back to the financials, specifically Rukmini. Can you help us think about the benefit to the quarter from the co-terming that occurred? And if I guess to what degree anything was pulled forward that was expected to land later this year, when we think about the magnitude of the beat and raise for guidance?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Sure. Hi, Mike. So yes, I talked about renewals outperformance in Q2, and there were three factors that I highlighted to -- the reason for that I performance. One was better renewals economics. And by that, I mean just our team is able to get better pricing at the time of renewal, which is good. Secondly, we talked about better on time renewal performance, which was strong in the quarter as well.  And then the third piece, I think, is what you're referring to Mike, which is around I said that we did do a little better on early and quote on renewal. And those, as we've said before, we go out to our customers well in advance of a renewal being due and start that conversation early. And that's what they prefer, as well. And often, we will be able to transact those renewals earlier than when they are -- in an earlier quarter than when they are due. And co-terms similarly, at co-terms are beneficial both for us and for the customer, because it then brings a lot of their licenses that may have been purchased at different times, to all be aligned to the same end date.  And so those were generally welcome. As long as they are, you know, coming at a good economics for us, it's good for the customer, they give us cash up front. And so those are all generally things that we welcome.  Now, in terms of the dynamic of the pool forwards, I think was another sort of aspect of your question, Mike, I say, you know, there is normal variation, right, between quarters, and we would expect that to continue going forward. And I would say I think we had also talked about this dynamic between fiscal year '24 and fiscal year '25. And I'm not sure if that's way you're going, Mike. But at this point, we still do see that renewal available to renew for next year, the growth in that is accelerating compared to what we saw for fiscal year '24. Because that was partly earlier than co-term was but was also just a beginner cohort that is coming up in '25, which is reading to that accelerated renewals ATR in '25, compared to '24.  So overall, again, I would say, you know, pretty strong quarter from renewals perspective, and generally these are all the outperformance driven by things that we like to see, so nothing that I would sort of characterize as better than expected, certainly, but allows us to sort of suddenly manage the business on a more predictable basis going forward.\nMichael Cikos: Got it. And my -- it's funny, you're ending that response on predictability. I think one of the things that I've been going through on my side, this earnings season is certain companies have cited seeing larger deals in their pipeline, and greater variability based on when those deals close. So I wanted to get a sense of possible, but can you help us think about the magnitude when you're citing these larger deals? Like, are they coming with, like an X percent increase in size from a $1 perspective versus what you're historically seeing, just to help us get a better sense of that?  And then the second piece tied to that is, how do you get financing, driving those deals again, just because they are obviously more strategic, there's less certainty around the timing of when those close, just anything there as far as how you do gain confidence on that front? It's a high quality problem I have, I'll start with that. But I just want to make sure that you guys are thinking about this and wanted to see how you respond to that?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, it's a good question, Mike. And you're right. These larger deals are inherently more unpredictable, which is why I think my point on your previous question, right was renewals is generally more predictable, although, of course, in as with everything, there is some variability there, but definitely more predictable, right than the new and expansion portion. And so I won't give you a specific number, Mike, I know you were looking for like some percentage or size or something like that.  What I will say is when we look at our pipeline of opportunities, and we look at the mix of that, meaning how much is coming from deals of a certain size versus larger size. And if you think, you know, you may have buckets of, you know, deal sizes, what we're seeing in the data is that a larger proportion is coming from those higher, larger deal size buckets, than we've seen previously. So -- and that's in addition to the pipeline growing or just into the mix of it is also changing, to be weighted more towards larger deals.  So that's sort of the first part of part of the answer to your question. Now, in terms of just how do we get comfortable, we look at what's in the pipeline, we're looking at a lot of other things that we in terms of conversion rates and things like that. And it is related to the pipeline. And we put a probability on how many of those we think we can convert during a period of time. And so that's sort of a little more color into the methodology of how we're approaching this. And all that is factored into the guide that we provided.  But Rajiv, did you want to add anything? \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, just a couple of things. First of all, I think one of the reasons we're seeing these large deals is because we of course for a while we've been working on a portfolio, that product portfolio, which we think is ready for large scale enterprise deployments. And so we have segmented our focus a bit further up the market in terms of our own sales for segmentation, and then on top of that, we've got the industry disruption with VMware where many large customers, of course, who are not necessarily engaged with us before are now engaging with us. So that's the reason for why we're seeing more of these large deals in our pipeline.  Now, I think with respect to prosecuting these deals, I would say we keep getting better at going after these deals. I mean, we have a whole 360 approach towards going after this. We have executed sponsors on the big accounts where we have large deals, we have a full team assembled to go pursue these deals. And now having said that, so it's still going to be timing is going to be a bit unpredictable.  And the size of the things also tends to vary over time. So it doesn't completely replace the unpredictability. But it does. It's a sea of engagement, when you have these types of deals between both companies, we are investing resources, customers investing a lot of resources as well, because there's a lot of testing certifications, go into contract negotiations, security audits, a whole bunch of things that get through this process. And so I would say we as a company are getting better and better at going after these types of opportunities.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall : Great, thanks. A couple questions for me. Maybe just on, you noted, clearly, some macro headwinds still. Just wanted to get a sense of any of the shape of that is it still things that are just a long game lead times? Are you seeing it on larger deals, smaller deals, certain verticals, certain types of projects, kind of just any change in color from the past couple of quarters, if there are any?  And then maybe on the second question, you know, I would imagine you guys are getting a number of resumes in your inbox right now just kind of given the disruption, just any notable hires, or how you're finding kind of the pool of talent to add in terms of some of your OpEx ads? Thanks.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Rukmini why don\u2019t you take number one, and I\u2019ll take the number two question.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, sure, Rajiv, so on macro, Meta, which I think was your first question. It's more or less remained stable, relative to what we've seen in the last few quarters are fairly consistent with what we've seen in the last few quarters. And we characterize that as somewhat uncertain, but stable. And, that's sort of what we continue to see. So no significant change from that, which again, as we talked about, did show up in the continued modest elongation of sales cycles compared to what historical levels.  Now, some of that could also be driven by this high, you know, larger mix of higher, larger deal sizes in our pipeline. So that's sort of showing up now. But again, that is also a factor of just the fact that we've gone up market, it's not necessarily a macro point. So on macro, nothing else I would call out in terms of specific verticals, seeing strength or weakness that we're noticing at this point. Somewhat uncertain, but stable is how I would characterize it. \nRajiv Ramaswami: And then Meta on the talent questions, there's no doubt this is --two years ago, it was a difficult market for talent, right, everybody was hiring. And it was a tough market as we tend to hire at the top of the pyramid in terms of software developers, now, that has changed quite significantly for us, right, in this market today, we're able to attract the best talent from every place, not just you know, VMware or other places, you might think, but also from hyperscalers, for example.  And, so we see a good tenant environment, we have been using that, of course, we have been hiring carefully, but selectively in both R&D and sales. And we are seeing really good talent come in the door. And overall, it's helping uplevel the talent that we have in the company and I'm very happy about that. And that's happening at the individual contributor levels, but also at the management levels, as well. So across the Board.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP. Your line is open. Eric, your line is open. \nErik Suppiger: Sorry, there, sorry. \nOperator: One moment. Let me go ahead and bring him back up. Okay, Eric, your line is open again.\nErik Suppiger: All right. Sorry about that. I want to just touch on the subject of larger deals in elongated sales cycles. As previously noted, there have been other vendors that have seen similar trends and there was some discussions around consolidation, customers that are getting more focused on consolidating onto a single or a few vendors as opposed to a lot of tools out there. Is that one of the things that could be contributing to the elongated sales cycle? Or is it more of an economic uncertainty issue?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I'm not sure as much, Erik, whether it's because people are consolidating, whether they're -- in our case, for example, certainly, there's a lot of like, okay, I've got an incumbent vendor that I need to rethink my strategy and bring on an automated vendor. And that's how we\u2019re playing very much for us, right, very much in play. So, they were happy with the vendor prior, and now they don't feel happy. So they got to look at an alternative. And we are a very solid infrastructure alternative. That's one factor that's clearly play.  The second factor, as I mentioned a little earlier, that that we ourselves as a company, have gotten to a point where we have a portfolio that can address, pretty much across the enterprise, all the applications that customers are running. So all applications that you know, from small scale to very large scale. And that makes us a bigger player in our customers' minds, right? It's not that they're thinking about it as a vendor for just one use case anymore. They're thinking about as a platform vendor for them that can run other applications. And so that typically leads to a more larger strategic engagement with the customer, which also takes longer. So that I think is what's playing in our -- for us -- playing out for us now.\nErik Suppiger: Okay, very good. And then just on the ChatGPT in-a-box. Just curious if you have seen particular groups or segments of your customer base that are adopting that, who is doing AI in a private cloud these days? \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. First of all, I'd say it's early days for us, Erik on that for sure. But we are seeing traction across all kinds of verticals. Financial services, defense, federal, in fact, one of our first events was with the federal agency, manufacturing, pharma or medical devices, so there's just many different verticals. But the use cases tend to be somewhat similar. Document summarization, search, analytics, co-piloting, customer service, enhanced fraud detection, these are some of the same sort of same use cases, but across a range of verticals.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is open.\nBen Bollin : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Rukmini, you made a comment about investing carefully for the growth in front of you. And there's been a few questions on hiring. I'm curious about how your hiring plans have evolved since the start of the year, when you look at -- what you see out there, in particular, how you're managing the amount of inbound activity that you are seeing from partners and customers? And then I had a follow up.\nRajiv Ramaswami: So maybe I think Ben, so I think there's a couple of points. One is related to hiring the other this inbound activity from partners, customers, et cetera. So slightly different questions there. So, I think, on the hiring we, you know, we, if you look at our history here, we've been very, very tight on OpEx, apart few years for the right reasons. As we consolidated our portfolio, got some more focus into the company, and got our execution going.  And now this is the year where we are investing, our OpEx is going up as based on what we talked about, and what we're investing, judiciously continuing to drive both growth and leverage to our bottom line. But we're certainly investing, we're investing in terms of building out our portfolio from an R&D perspective, we\u2019re investing in terms of our go-to-market, so that we can be more effective in terms of getting -- handling the demands that we started to see.  And to your point over the last, I would say, a year or two years, we've seen more than coming from customers, partners, and managed service providers. And we are -- we now have focused efforts in terms of addressing all of those, whether it be a larger set of customer engagement, whether it be more focus in terms of the partners, which was one of the priorities that I said very early on when we started here three years ago. So more focus on the channel, enabling them recruiting partners, giving them incentive, making them more autonomous. And extending that to our managed service provider partners where we continue to add more of them to our partner network over time.\nBen Bollin: Okay, that's great. Rajiv, one other question for you is, you commented earlier about some CIO scrutiny as it relates to the data center investments and public cloud investments. I'm curious if you're seeing any change in how customers are thinking about their longer term infrastructure planning, from an investment perspective, notably, because of what's happened with Broadcom and VMware? That's it for me. Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Well, I mean, certainly, Ben, so the bottom wave, I think, absolutely, it is, right. I mean, again, VMware was a great technology vendor with a lot of innovation, and customers and with a large footprint of customers, and now they have to rethink whether that's the right long term strategy for them. And so that says, okay, well, we got to either look at alternative providers, of which we are an easy alternative. Or they could say, well, I could go more to the public cloud, okay, which is not an easy thing for existing workloads, to just take everything and move to the public cloud, that's not easy to do.  And then they factor into the fact, cost regulatory aspects of it, and so forth. So, so clearly, I think, for us as a vendor, there's certainly, we see customers continue to invest in infrastructure modernization, in terms of digitization, in terms of running modern applications, not just in the public cloud, but also on prem. And like some of these new cycles that are happening now, like AI, for example. We\u2019ll also find this path down the same route, right, which is, you know, it's starting out with a lot of training happening in the public cloud, but it's moving towards, okay, I'm going to run my AI, I'm going to preach -- I'm going to fine tune the training on my own data sets, which are proprietary that I want to keep carefully. And I'm going to have to potentially look at slightly different solutions for inferencing, which are going to be running closer to my edge locations. So these things are driving what we call hybrid multi cloud. And I think that's very much I think, the world that many of our customers are here for the next several years.\nOperator: Thank you one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from line of Dan [indiscernible], from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hey, it's Dan [indiscernible] for Matt Hedberg. Appreciate you taking a question here. To build off a recent answer that mentioned that 360 approach around VMware deals. Could you go into some of the mechanics and processes involved in migration over from VMware? I guess, you know, specifically, what tools are in place to facilitate migrations? And then how long does a typical migration take?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I mean, and the answer to that varies, but I'll go through the process Dan. So, there's clearly an assessment of what the workloads are, that our applications are, that are running on that infrastructure. That's one part of it and making sure that we can run all those workloads with good performance, which by and large is the case these days. The second is what elements of the stack have been deployed. And the more of the elements that they have deployed, the stickier or the more complex the migration becomes.  So for example, for a customer that definitely deployed a hypervisor, it's a largely automated move away from the hypervisor to our hypervisor, we have automated tools. In fact, our tools called move, we've done a lot of the VM migrations all day long. And so that's a relatively simple migration that can be done automated.  Now, at the other end of the spectrum, if they've invested a lot of custom automation work, custom security work on top of the stack, then some of those will have to be converted over that requires a professional services engagement, which also as part of our offering, to help convert over some of those onto our platform or on to more open type of platform. For example, automation, people are looking at Terraform as an example. So in those cases, it's a more complex migration.  I'll give you some examples, though, in a lot of cases, actually, what happens is that the migration planning takes some time, the actual execution of the migration is very quick. There was a case study that we published recently of a healthcare system that we've been engaged with for the past three years or so. The name of pediatrics is public this point, and they plan this migration for a few years. But when they actually came around to doing the migration, they were done within 90 days. So that's a typical example as a cycle of selling and engagement and everything and then getting everything ready. And then once it's very, they were able to migrate in 90 days, and I would call them as a medium complexity environment, they're not at the high end of the complexity, but they're not necessarily the lower, the simplest type.\nUnidentified Analyst : That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nVictor Chiu: Hi, guys, this is Victor Chiu for Simon Leopold. Just really quickly, can you help us understand what's baked into your full year outlook specifically, just, you know, the current guidance reflects gains from VMware at a similar rate, or you expecting this accelerates from here?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Victor, for the question. So the full year guide, assume some benefit from the VMware being acquired by Broadcom as we said at the beginning of the year, and no, it does not expect any acceleration at this point, right? It just assumes it has some benefit in there. It also assumes a small benefit, as we've talked about before, towards the end of the year, from the Cisco partnership, as well, but that, again, as Rajiv said, we expect that to grow over time, and certainly in fiscal year '25. But there's a small benefit from that baked in, as well, in addition to sort of all the other dynamics we've talked about on this call, including modest elongation, average sales cycles, unpredictability with regard to large deals in the pipeline, et cetera.\nVictor Chiu: Okay, great. That's helpful. And just lastly, I wanted to follow up on the macro question. We've been hearing through the channel that the sentiment on, you know, the HCI market overall has turned slightly more cautious. Can you help us understand what you're thinking for HCI growth overall this year, and how Nutanix performs relative to that?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, maybe I\u2019ll take that. I don\u2019t think, we haven't seen a slowdown or caution around its adoption, I think it's been the same kind of dynamic that we've seen in the past. There's a legacy infrastructure out there. The HCI capabilities are continuously gotten better over time where HCI they can run pretty much all enterprise workloads on the platform, and in many cases can do so with better performance even than legacy architectures. So better performance, better TCO, much simpler to operate.  So, but I think what we've always had to overcome as inertia. We've got a set way of doing things that customers have been doing for a long time. And here is a shift to a more modern software defined architecture and that shift we have to do, and we have to overcome that with all the -- but that's been what we've been doing the entire existence of the company. So I wouldn't see that there's been a bunch of change in how our customers are thinking about it. Certainly, or not in the last year or so that I've seen.\nVictor Chiu: Great, and, you know, how the growth, you know, what you're thinking for growth and kind of how Nutanix is growing relative?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yeah, I think we, I don't have much to add beyond what we comment at Investor Day, just last September, where we provided both your TAM and SAM opportunities and our growth outlook in terms of, you know, 20% ARR growth in terms of what we could drive through FY '27 is what we said there.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, this will conclude our question and answer session today. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich. And good afternoon, everyone. We've delivered a solid second quarter, with results that came in ahead of our guidance. The macro backdrop in our second quarter remain uncertain, but stable relative to the prior quarter. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership or TCO.  Taking a closer look at the second quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all of our guided metrics. We delivered record quarterly revenue of $565 million and grew our ARR 26% year-over-year to $1.74 billion. We also had another quarter of strong free cash flow generation.  Finally, we achieved quarterly GAAP operating profitability for the first time in Q2, demonstrating the progress we continue to make on driving operating leverage in our subscription model. Overall, our second quarter financial performance reflected continued discipline execution. Our largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix cloud platform to organizations that are looking to adopt hybrid multi cloud operating models optimize the performance of their workloads and improve their TCO all while managing through some of the disruption from recent industry M&A.  A good example is a seven figure win with a global EMEA based provider of automotive technology solutions. This new customer had an existing three tier footprint in need of a refresh, but was frustrated by the recent price increases of their incumbent vendor and was also looking to have the flexibility to potentially move some of their footprint to the public cloud in future. They chose our Nutanix Cloud Platform, including our AHP hypervisor, as well as Nutanix Cloud Management, based on its superior TCO, built-in automation for infrastructure as a service. And its ability to seamlessly transition workloads to public cloud via our NC2 solution. We see this win as a good example of the value customers see in our cloud platform for both, modernization and providing a seamless pathway to the public cloud.  A second good example is a win with a large North American based hedge fund, that was looking to mitigate the growing cost of its public cloud hosted virtual desktop infrastructure or VDI. And for a more responsive solution to meet the performance demands of its traders. They chose to repatriate their VDI onto the Nutanix Cloud Platform on GPU based servers. Resulting in a meaningful improvement in performance and an estimated 60% plus TCO savings. We believe this win demonstrates the ability of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to seamlessly run and manage workloads wherever the optimal performance and TCO can be achieved, whether on premise, at the edge or in the public cloud.  A final example if one of our largest new customer wins in the quarter, with a global airline based in the EMEA region that was looking to modernize their feature infrastructure, while enabling a hybrid multi cloud environment. This customer chosen Nutanix Cloud Platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management to run their business critical application, leveraging its simplicity and built-in automation for infrastructure as a service. They also adopted Nutanix database service for managing and deploying their databases throughout their organization, and Nutanix unified storage to service their unstructured data needs. We see this win as evidence of the value companies see in adopting our full stack solution.  Moving on, adopting and benefiting from generating AI, is top of mind for many of our customers. As such, interest remains high in our GPT in-a-Box offering, which enables our customers to accelerate the use of generative AI across their enterprises, while keeping their data secure. Last quarter, we saw our first win for GPT in-a-Box with a large federal agency. In this quarter, we saw multiple additional wins for a Gen AI ready infrastructure offering. While it's still early days, and the numbers remain small, I'm excited about the longer term potential for GPT in-a-Box.  Finally, on the partner front, I'm happy with the early progress we're seeing with our Cisco partnership. We continue to see good customer interest in our joint offering and saw additional wins for it in the second quarter. While it's still early in this partnership, I'm encouraged by what we've seen so far.  In closing, we are encouraged that the compelling value proposition of our cloud platform and the strength of our business model enable us to increase our top and bottom line outlook for fiscal 2024. We remain focused on delighting our customers while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini? Yes, why don't I start Jim, and Rukmini can give you color on the pipeline. So, first of all, I think, as you said, I mean, there are significant concerns from VMware customers regarding the Broadcom acquisition. And we think that this is a significant multi-year opportunity for us to win new customers and to gain share. Now, getting to your question a bit here, the timing and magnitude of these deals is a bit unpredictable. Our pipeline is quite substantial, and growing.  Now for a number of reasons, we expect contribution for the opportunity to build gradually, and here are the reasons. First one, Jim is that many customers signed multi-year ELAs enterprise agreements with VMware prior to the deal closing three to five years. So it buys them some time to make decisions. The second, converting from VMware 3-tier accounts or legacy storage accounts, which is a good chunk of VMware footprint, in many cases requires a refresh of their storage and our servers, right, one of the two, which could also impact the timing of the potential software purchases that they would make with us. Okay.  And the last piece is like with all these accounts, we typically ever land and expand motion. So the first deal could be followed, and then there's a lot of potential for expansion further than that.  And then Rukmini, you want to take this? Yes. So Jim, I think first of all, if you compare the full stack that Broadcom was offering with VMware Cloud Foundation, that, -- and our Nutanix cloud platform pretty much goes head to head against that, and we've got all the capabilities. That's a full stack that includes, the hypervisor, a software defined storage, networking and management. So we compare very well with that full stack and we're able to go to a very comparable offering. And indeed, as you can see, right our AHP penetration our hypervisor penetration, our install base is about 70%. And we are seeing new customers who adopt a full stack start with our own hypervisor, okay.  That part is fair. Now when it comes to the lower tier offering, VMware does have a vSphere and now it's called I believe VMware Virtual Foundation, VVF. That includes vSphere, some operations management capabilities, et cetera. Now, what you -- what I mentioned earlier, in response to the question was that, there is some amount of VMware, in fact a big chunk of VMware it's only the hypervisor that's connected to legacy storage, right 3-tier storage arrays.  Now, the way we go after the market is not to just simply replace the hypervisor with our hypervisor, because our hypervisor also is part of our complete solution, right, which includes our storage. So customers are actually making a shift from a legacy architecture that say hypervisor plus external storage to a modern HCI architecture that includes our hypervisor, but also the rest of our stack.  So there, it's not just a simple life for life, but it's a conversion, and modernization of infrastructure as well. So I feel pretty good about what we can do, we can handle all the workloads. We have a hybrid cloud solution, we have a modern app platform that customers can run Kubernetes applications on. We have partnerships with Red Hat for OpenShift. We have partnerships with our cloud partners like Azure and AWS. So from a capability of the portfolio perspective, we're very much there. Very much so, I would say, Jason. So in fact, you're right. There's a lot of VMware with what we call 3-tier. And one of the things that Broadcom itself is doing has done by the way is that the VMware Cloud Foundation that includes HCI and that their default offering to a lot of the bigger customers. So effectively now, it's not just us doing HCI, but they're also putting, which puts a little bit of pressure on the 3-tier storage piece of it. And so we are clearly focused on that opportunity, in terms of -- and we've been doing that all day long, right, since we've started, migrating, legacy 3-tier over HCI, and potentially that this might help.  Now, the other thing we should also keep in mind just so that we don't lose track of it. There are even easier assertion opportunities now. Because there is a substantial base of vSphere plus VSAN HCI out there. And so that's almost the like for like. Those customers have already made the HCI decision, and they might be looking at, if they're looking to migrate away from VMware, we pretty much have a like for like solution that that we can migrate over to. And we are doing, we're not sitting idle here, right, we are doing a bunch of things to capitalize on the opportunity, I'd say three things that we're doing. First is that we have been targeting some more advertising dollars to maximize the awareness of Nutanix as the simplest, easiest, viable alternative for these customers.  Number two, we've also put in place incentives for our partners, who are helping customers get to our platform for new customers, as partners bring new customers to us, we give them more incentives. Number three, we're also helping end customers with migration. When they have a VMware environment, they're looking to bring our environment on, there's a period of time where they might have dual operating costs, and we try to help them out on that front. So we're also taking some very specific steps to go out for the opportunity. Yes, we factored in a modest contribution this year, Jason, from Cisco. I do expect that the contribution is going to be more significant in FY '25. And we'll cover that when we get to, you know, when we are ready to talk about that FY '25 guide. But, clearly, it takes time to build this up, we focused on enabling the full solution, training that sellers. And we're happy with the progress we're making. We are getting new customers through the cloud now. And they are motivated. So I think over time, it will build. Yes, Wamsi first of all, I think it's going be hard for me to give you some very specific quantitative numbers at this point. But what I'd say is, is for sure, right, if you look at our last Investor Day, we talked about our TAM and the SAM as part of that right the $60 billion $70 billion TAM and SAM. And what we really expect is, I mean, we've always been going and continuing to grow market share and eat into that SAM, and what this event creates is an opportunity to speed that up. So it's the same, the TAM and SAM haven't really changed. It's still the same, but now we're able to get after more of it quicker.  Now, the challenge with quantifying it is that it's very hard to predict right I mean, as we bought that, how much of this is going to come out quickly? And this is what, it's a little early to, for us to say something there. So we've got, like I said, we've got customers who want to do something different, but they've got these three five year relays. They're not in a rush. There's some time it takes to convert customers, and they have to depreciate the hardware that they bought, for example. And then you know, the -- you bring us in for a small portion and expand. So all of these things create some unpredictability in terms of timing, and how quickly can we capture it. But, I certainly think that this provides us an opportunity for us to capture more of the market quicker, and we're trying to move as quickly as we can.  I don't know, Rukmini, if you want to provide any color on the pipeline? Yes, I've actually there at Cisco at that time, when the VCE partnership and clearly very cyclical initially. Now, I -- it's hard for me to compare VCE back then converged infrastructure with this. But I'll tell you the, this -- I'll give you the sort of the puts and takes. So clearly, Cisco has huge market leverage and market position, in terms of their sellers, and their access to big accounts, their presence in all these accounts.  Now, if you look at this particular space in the market, there are several positions, it's not that there are small, relatively small market share player when it comes to servers compared to some of their other competitors. So it's -- so they're not as strong in this segment of the market. However, I mean, they certainly have a big overall market cloud. So now, what could the two of us do together really to go into the market, and that's really I think, where I do see significant potential here. Over time, again, it has to take time to build up. And it -- Cisco also has a complex sell emotion, they have generalists, they have specialists. And right now, we are more focused on the data center specialists as they have and working together with them.  So to answer your question, I mean, it's still early days for us to predict how big this could be for us. And I would say, you know, we, I am optimistic, and I think this opportunity is also going to build up over time. And certainly continuing to -- and in fact there's a lot of cooperation happening between our sellers, and Cisco sellers in the field. So all good, good omens at this point in time, but still very early. Yes, we have, I think I would say that Cisco, with Cisco, clearly we have a, they are -- they've end of life HyperFlex, first of all, and there's a limited time where you know that so \u2013 they no longer selling the product, and there's a limited support window for it. So that by itself, by the way it creates an incentive for HyperFlex customers to migrate. And we through Cisco, of course, as a whole, Cisco has a set of programs for migration. And they're good at driving those types of migration initiatives. And we are supporting them as they do that. So this is being done largely through Cisco and through the Cisco router market. Yes, I'll give you two-part answer to that, George. So I don't know if I can call it a point of inflection. But certainly we are seeing more examples of people repatriating but that those are examples. It's hard for me to say you know that there's a whole trend here. Yes. But some are certainly repatriating like the example I talked about. But also, I think the other thing that we should keep in mind is that the bulk of enterprise workloads are still not in the public cloud. They're still sitting in data centers.  I'm talking about enterprise workloads, because what has gone to the public cloud largely have been net new applications. So for these workloads are still sitting in the enterprise environment, I think CIOs are being a lot more careful about how much of that do they take to the public cloud? So there's yes, there's some repatriation happening from the public cloud back on-prem. But there's also a lot more scrutiny and forethought being applied to what should I take going forward into the public cloud from where I'm at? Yes, just a couple of things. First of all, I think one of the reasons we're seeing these large deals is because we of course for a while we've been working on a portfolio, that product portfolio, which we think is ready for large scale enterprise deployments. And so we have segmented our focus a bit further up the market in terms of our own sales for segmentation, and then on top of that, we've got the industry disruption with VMware where many large customers, of course, who are not necessarily engaged with us before are now engaging with us. So that's the reason for why we're seeing more of these large deals in our pipeline.  Now, I think with respect to prosecuting these deals, I would say we keep getting better at going after these deals. I mean, we have a whole 360 approach towards going after this. We have executed sponsors on the big accounts where we have large deals, we have a full team assembled to go pursue these deals. And now having said that, so it's still going to be timing is going to be a bit unpredictable.  And the size of the things also tends to vary over time. So it doesn't completely replace the unpredictability. But it does. It's a sea of engagement, when you have these types of deals between both companies, we are investing resources, customers investing a lot of resources as well, because there's a lot of testing certifications, go into contract negotiations, security audits, a whole bunch of things that get through this process. And so I would say we as a company are getting better and better at going after these types of opportunities. Yes, Rukmini why don't you take number one, and I'll take the number two question. And then Meta on the talent questions, there's no doubt this is --two years ago, it was a difficult market for talent, right, everybody was hiring. And it was a tough market as we tend to hire at the top of the pyramid in terms of software developers, now, that has changed quite significantly for us, right, in this market today, we're able to attract the best talent from every place, not just you know, VMware or other places, you might think, but also from hyperscalers, for example.  And, so we see a good tenant environment, we have been using that, of course, we have been hiring carefully, but selectively in both R&D and sales. And we are seeing really good talent come in the door. And overall, it's helping uplevel the talent that we have in the company and I'm very happy about that. And that's happening at the individual contributor levels, but also at the management levels, as well. So across the Board. I'm not sure as much, Erik, whether it's because people are consolidating, whether they're -- in our case, for example, certainly, there's a lot of like, okay, I've got an incumbent vendor that I need to rethink my strategy and bring on an automated vendor. And that's how we're playing very much for us, right, very much in play. So, they were happy with the vendor prior, and now they don't feel happy. So they got to look at an alternative. And we are a very solid infrastructure alternative. That's one factor that's clearly play.  The second factor, as I mentioned a little earlier, that that we ourselves as a company, have gotten to a point where we have a portfolio that can address, pretty much across the enterprise, all the applications that customers are running. So all applications that you know, from small scale to very large scale. And that makes us a bigger player in our customers' minds, right? It's not that they're thinking about it as a vendor for just one use case anymore. They're thinking about as a platform vendor for them that can run other applications. And so that typically leads to a more larger strategic engagement with the customer, which also takes longer. So that I think is what's playing in our -- for us -- playing out for us now. Yes. First of all, I'd say it's early days for us, Erik on that for sure. But we are seeing traction across all kinds of verticals. Financial services, defense, federal, in fact, one of our first events was with the federal agency, manufacturing, pharma or medical devices, so there's just many different verticals. But the use cases tend to be somewhat similar. Document summarization, search, analytics, co-piloting, customer service, enhanced fraud detection, these are some of the same sort of same use cases, but across a range of verticals. So maybe I think Ben, so I think there's a couple of points. One is related to hiring the other this inbound activity from partners, customers, et cetera. So slightly different questions there. So, I think, on the hiring we, you know, we, if you look at our history here, we've been very, very tight on OpEx, apart few years for the right reasons. As we consolidated our portfolio, got some more focus into the company, and got our execution going.  And now this is the year where we are investing, our OpEx is going up as based on what we talked about, and what we're investing, judiciously continuing to drive both growth and leverage to our bottom line. But we're certainly investing, we're investing in terms of building out our portfolio from an R&D perspective, we're investing in terms of our go-to-market, so that we can be more effective in terms of getting -- handling the demands that we started to see.  And to your point over the last, I would say, a year or two years, we've seen more than coming from customers, partners, and managed service providers. And we are -- we now have focused efforts in terms of addressing all of those, whether it be a larger set of customer engagement, whether it be more focus in terms of the partners, which was one of the priorities that I said very early on when we started here three years ago. So more focus on the channel, enabling them recruiting partners, giving them incentive, making them more autonomous. And extending that to our managed service provider partners where we continue to add more of them to our partner network over time. Well, I mean, certainly, Ben, so the bottom wave, I think, absolutely, it is, right. I mean, again, VMware was a great technology vendor with a lot of innovation, and customers and with a large footprint of customers, and now they have to rethink whether that's the right long term strategy for them. And so that says, okay, well, we got to either look at alternative providers, of which we are an easy alternative. Or they could say, well, I could go more to the public cloud, okay, which is not an easy thing for existing workloads, to just take everything and move to the public cloud, that's not easy to do.  And then they factor into the fact, cost regulatory aspects of it, and so forth. So, so clearly, I think, for us as a vendor, there's certainly, we see customers continue to invest in infrastructure modernization, in terms of digitization, in terms of running modern applications, not just in the public cloud, but also on prem. And like some of these new cycles that are happening now, like AI, for example. We'll also find this path down the same route, right, which is, you know, it's starting out with a lot of training happening in the public cloud, but it's moving towards, okay, I'm going to run my AI, I'm going to preach -- I'm going to fine tune the training on my own data sets, which are proprietary that I want to keep carefully. And I'm going to have to potentially look at slightly different solutions for inferencing, which are going to be running closer to my edge locations. So these things are driving what we call hybrid multi cloud. And I think that's very much I think, the world that many of our customers are here for the next several years. Yes, I mean, and the answer to that varies, but I'll go through the process Dan. So, there's clearly an assessment of what the workloads are, that our applications are, that are running on that infrastructure. That's one part of it and making sure that we can run all those workloads with good performance, which by and large is the case these days. The second is what elements of the stack have been deployed. And the more of the elements that they have deployed, the stickier or the more complex the migration becomes.  So for example, for a customer that definitely deployed a hypervisor, it's a largely automated move away from the hypervisor to our hypervisor, we have automated tools. In fact, our tools called move, we've done a lot of the VM migrations all day long. And so that's a relatively simple migration that can be done automated.  Now, at the other end of the spectrum, if they've invested a lot of custom automation work, custom security work on top of the stack, then some of those will have to be converted over that requires a professional services engagement, which also as part of our offering, to help convert over some of those onto our platform or on to more open type of platform. For example, automation, people are looking at Terraform as an example. So in those cases, it's a more complex migration.  I'll give you some examples, though, in a lot of cases, actually, what happens is that the migration planning takes some time, the actual execution of the migration is very quick. There was a case study that we published recently of a healthcare system that we've been engaged with for the past three years or so. The name of pediatrics is public this point, and they plan this migration for a few years. But when they actually came around to doing the migration, they were done within 90 days. So that's a typical example as a cycle of selling and engagement and everything and then getting everything ready. And then once it's very, they were able to migrate in 90 days, and I would call them as a medium complexity environment, they're not at the high end of the complexity, but they're not necessarily the lower, the simplest type. Yes, maybe I'll take that. I don't think, we haven't seen a slowdown or caution around its adoption, I think it's been the same kind of dynamic that we've seen in the past. There's a legacy infrastructure out there. The HCI capabilities are continuously gotten better over time where HCI they can run pretty much all enterprise workloads on the platform, and in many cases can do so with better performance even than legacy architectures. So better performance, better TCO, much simpler to operate.  So, but I think what we've always had to overcome as inertia. We've got a set way of doing things that customers have been doing for a long time. And here is a shift to a more modern software defined architecture and that shift we have to do, and we have to overcome that with all the -- but that's been what we've been doing the entire existence of the company. So I wouldn't see that there's been a bunch of change in how our customers are thinking about it. Certainly, or not in the last year or so that I've seen. Yeah, I think we, I don't have much to add beyond what we comment at Investor Day, just last September, where we provided both your TAM and SAM opportunities and our growth outlook in terms of, you know, 20% ARR growth in terms of what we could drive through FY '27 is what we said there."

            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. I will first review our Q2 fiscal '24 results, followed by guidance for Q3 fiscal '24. And finally provide an updated view of our full year fiscal year '24 guidance.  Results in Q2 '24 came in higher than the high end of our range across all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q2 were $329 million above the guided range of $295 million to $305 million representing year-over-year growth of 23%. The outperformance was driven by better than expected renewal performance due to a combination of good discipline around renewals economics, improved on time renewal performance, as well as early and core term renewals.  Revenue in Q2 was $565 million, higher than the guidance range of $545 million to $555 million and the year-over-year growth rate of 16%. ARR at the end of Q2 was $1.737 billion representing year-over-year growth of 26%. In Q2, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. Average contract duration in Q2 was 2.8 years, slightly lower than Q1, and more or less in line with our expectations.  Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 87.3%. Higher than our guided range of 85% to 86%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 21.9%, higher than our guidance range of 14% to 16%, largely due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses as a result of timing of hiring. Non-GAAP net income was $136 million, or fully diluted EPS of $0.46 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 299 million shares.  Q2 marked our first ever quarter of positive GAAP operating income of $37 million and a positive GAAP net income of $33 million, with fully diluted GAAP EPS of $0.12 per share. Given expected variability in quarterly revenue and timing of expenses, we would not expect to be consistently profitable at the GAAP operating profit level over the near term.  DSOs based on revenue and ending accounts receivable were 31 days in Q2. Free cash flow in Q2 was $163 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 29%, higher than our expectations due to higher billings and lower expenses in the quarter.  We ended Q2 with cash, cash equivalents and short term investment of $1.644 billion up from $1.571 billion at the end of Q1. We continued repurchasing shares in Q2 under the share repurchase program, previously authorized by our Board of Directors. Our sustainable generation of free cash flow enabled us to transition the net share settlement to pay for employees' tax liability on RSU Vesting in Q2, and going forward from our previous method of sell to cover. This, along with our share repurchase program will help us continue to manage dilution.  Moving to Q3 '24, our guidance for Q3 is as follows: ACV billings of $265 million to $275 million, revenue of $510 million to $520 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 85%, on-GAAP operating margin of 7.5% to 8.5%. And fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 301 million shares. The updated guidance for full year fiscal year '24, which is higher than our previously provided fiscal year '24 guidance across all metrics is as follows; ACV billings of $1.09 billion to $1.11 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint of the range. Revenue of $2.12 billion to $2.15 billion representing a year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin of 85% to 86%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 12.5% to 13.5%. Free cash flow of $420 million to $440 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 20% at the midpoint.  I will now provide some commentary regarding our updated fiscal year '24 guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels. Our fiscal year '24 new and expansion ACV performance outlook assume some impact from these macro dynamics. We are also seeing a higher mix of larger deals in our pipeline, which is driving greater variability in the timing of our new and expansion business.  Second, the guidance assumes that our renewals business will continue to perform well. Third, the full year guidance continues to assume that average contract duration would be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '23, as renewals continue to grow as a percent of our total billing. Fourth, a reminder that the full year ACV billing is not the straight sum of the ACV billings of the four quarters due to contracts with duration less than one year. We expect full year ACV billings to be about 5% to 6% lower than the sum of the four quarters ACV billings.  In closing, we are pleased that our Q2 results exceeded guidance and to raise our top line and bottom line guidance for the full fiscal year. We remain focused on driving growth to capture the significant opportunity ahead of us and are investing prudently for that growth, consistent with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Sure. Yes, I'll add one thing, Jim, to your question is that, I mentioned in my prepared remarks about this. Higher mix of larger deals that we're seeing in our pipeline and that is driving the greater variability, we believe in the timing of our new and expansion business, as well as potentially contributing to the longer average sales cycles, because larger deals do tend to take longer to close.  And we believe that this higher mix of larger deals in the pipeline is driven by, you know, one, our segmentation of market, as we've talked about before, and the improved product readiness for those larger customers. And secondly, some of the dynamics that Rajiv talked about already regarding concerns from larger customers, regarding the impacts from Broadcom's acquisition of VMware. And so we have continued and continue to factor all of the impact of some of these dynamics into our updated fiscal year '24 outlook. Yes. Hi, Wamsi. Thanks for the question. So the reference I made in terms of our operating margin performance in Q2, which was came in strong at 22% and higher than our expectation was, one revenue was higher than we expected. And expenses were a bit lower because of timing of hiring, and just overall good expense management. And we do expect that expenses will go up in the second half. So if you look at half over half operating expenses implied in the guide, that does go up in the second half, one way, and of course, Q3 compared to Q2, seasonally, the revenue is lower in Q3, that it doesn't in Q2. So those are some of the things that are factoring into the outlook.  But overall, you know, I'd say, we have continued to be focused on investing and investing thoughtfully on this growth opportunity that's ahead of us. And so that's the approach we've taken. And overall, we've been pleased to take up our full year outlook on both top and bottom line. Yes, I may add one thing to that, Rajiv, which is that. I think Wamsi your question is specifically around what we can tell about this opportunity as a result of VMware's acquisition by Broadcom. And I say, I think the other nuance here is we've always competed against VMware, right. And so in some cases, it's quite clear to tell, well, this door wasn't open to us before. And now it is because of what they may be seeing from our competitor. But in other cases, and we talked about an example on the last earnings call, where existing customers of ours are maybe choosing to invest more than us or go single source with us, a partly influenced by this, right.  So this idea of in some cases, it's clear, in other cases, it's more of A factor, an important factor, but one factor, and so that those situations, it's harder for us to attribute specifically, dollars and pipeline and things like that, to this particular disruption in the competitive market. So, all those factors combined, are what makes us, feel good that this is a multi-year and opportunity, as Rajiv has mentioned, but difficult to get precise in terms of magnitude and timing. Hi, Pinjalim. Thank you for that question. So on this -- I think the first part of the question was on seasonality between Q2 and Q3. And so on that front, if you look back to sort of our initial guidance that we gave for Q3 last year, this time, Pinjalim, it was actually quite similar in terms of what we guided for Q3 versus Q2. But we were able to beat Q3 and so the actual I think, is what you're referring to, was smaller than what we guided to. But the decrease, I would say, is more or less in line with what we'd expect for seasonality and what we expected at this time last year, as well.  And then to your point on the average sale cycle, and modest elongation we're seeing there, it moves around a bit quarter to quarter, Pinjalim, but what I was referring to is that when we look back at to historical levels, it remains somewhat elevated. And so that's what I was referring to. Sure. Hi, Mike. So yes, I talked about renewals outperformance in Q2, and there were three factors that I highlighted to -- the reason for that I performance. One was better renewals economics. And by that, I mean just our team is able to get better pricing at the time of renewal, which is good. Secondly, we talked about better on time renewal performance, which was strong in the quarter as well.  And then the third piece, I think, is what you're referring to Mike, which is around I said that we did do a little better on early and quote on renewal. And those, as we've said before, we go out to our customers well in advance of a renewal being due and start that conversation early. And that's what they prefer, as well. And often, we will be able to transact those renewals earlier than when they are -- in an earlier quarter than when they are due. And co-terms similarly, at co-terms are beneficial both for us and for the customer, because it then brings a lot of their licenses that may have been purchased at different times, to all be aligned to the same end date.  And so those were generally welcome. As long as they are, you know, coming at a good economics for us, it's good for the customer, they give us cash up front. And so those are all generally things that we welcome.  Now, in terms of the dynamic of the pool forwards, I think was another sort of aspect of your question, Mike, I say, you know, there is normal variation, right, between quarters, and we would expect that to continue going forward. And I would say I think we had also talked about this dynamic between fiscal year '24 and fiscal year '25. And I'm not sure if that's way you're going, Mike. But at this point, we still do see that renewal available to renew for next year, the growth in that is accelerating compared to what we saw for fiscal year '24. Because that was partly earlier than co-term was but was also just a beginner cohort that is coming up in '25, which is reading to that accelerated renewals ATR in '25, compared to '24.  So overall, again, I would say, you know, pretty strong quarter from renewals perspective, and generally these are all the outperformance driven by things that we like to see, so nothing that I would sort of characterize as better than expected, certainly, but allows us to sort of suddenly manage the business on a more predictable basis going forward. Yes, it's a good question, Mike. And you're right. These larger deals are inherently more unpredictable, which is why I think my point on your previous question, right was renewals is generally more predictable, although, of course, in as with everything, there is some variability there, but definitely more predictable, right than the new and expansion portion. And so I won't give you a specific number, Mike, I know you were looking for like some percentage or size or something like that.  What I will say is when we look at our pipeline of opportunities, and we look at the mix of that, meaning how much is coming from deals of a certain size versus larger size. And if you think, you know, you may have buckets of, you know, deal sizes, what we're seeing in the data is that a larger proportion is coming from those higher, larger deal size buckets, than we've seen previously. So -- and that's in addition to the pipeline growing or just into the mix of it is also changing, to be weighted more towards larger deals.  So that's sort of the first part of part of the answer to your question. Now, in terms of just how do we get comfortable, we look at what's in the pipeline, we're looking at a lot of other things that we in terms of conversion rates and things like that. And it is related to the pipeline. And we put a probability on how many of those we think we can convert during a period of time. And so that's sort of a little more color into the methodology of how we're approaching this. And all that is factored into the guide that we provided.  But Rajiv, did you want to add anything? Yes, sure, Rajiv, so on macro, Meta, which I think was your first question. It's more or less remained stable, relative to what we've seen in the last few quarters are fairly consistent with what we've seen in the last few quarters. And we characterize that as somewhat uncertain, but stable. And, that's sort of what we continue to see. So no significant change from that, which again, as we talked about, did show up in the continued modest elongation of sales cycles compared to what historical levels.  Now, some of that could also be driven by this high, you know, larger mix of higher, larger deal sizes in our pipeline. So that's sort of showing up now. But again, that is also a factor of just the fact that we've gone up market, it's not necessarily a macro point. So on macro, nothing else I would call out in terms of specific verticals, seeing strength or weakness that we're noticing at this point. Somewhat uncertain, but stable is how I would characterize it. Thank you, Victor, for the question. So the full year guide, assume some benefit from the VMware being acquired by Broadcom as we said at the beginning of the year, and no, it does not expect any acceleration at this point, right? It just assumes it has some benefit in there. It also assumes a small benefit, as we've talked about before, towards the end of the year, from the Cisco partnership, as well, but that, again, as Rajiv said, we expect that to grow over time, and certainly in fiscal year '25. But there's a small benefit from that baked in, as well, in addition to sort of all the other dynamics we've talked about on this call, including modest elongation, average sales cycles, unpredictability with regard to large deals in the pipeline, et cetera."

Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a solid first quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance. The uncertain macro backdrop that we saw in our first quarter was largely unchanged compared with the prior quarter. However, we saw a steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership. Taking a closer look at the first quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered record quarterly revenue of $511 million, exceeding a $2 billion annualized run rate for the first time, and grew our ARR 30% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. We also had another quarter of strong free cash flow generation aided by good linearity. Overall, our first quarter financial performance was a strong start to our fiscal year. Our federal business is typically strong in our first quarter, and this one was no exception. We saw wins with several different agencies across all three of our expansion vectors, including additional capacity for existing workloads, capacity for net new workloads, and adoption of additional portfolio products. The wins also included expansion into the public cloud with NC2 on AWS, and our first win with a large existing customer for GPT-in-a-Box, our recently introduced turnkey solution for deploying generative AI. We view the breadth and diversity of our wins with this important customer as a testament to our ability to expand within our largest customers. Another notable win in the quarter was with a Global 2000 bank in the Asia Pacific region. This customer, who signed a significant expansion agreement, selected Nutanix as their sole platform for their future modernization initiatives and planned build out of multiple new data centers. This was a departure from their historical dual vendor strategy. They chose our Nutanix Cloud Platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management to run their containerized, business-critical applications, leveraging its simplicity and built-in automation for infrastructure-as-a-service. They also adopted Nutanix database service for managing and deploying their databases throughout their organizations. We see this win as a great example of our ability to partner with the largest and most demanding companies in the world, as they look to modernize and grow their businesses. Generating leverage from our partners remains a key focus. And towards this end, I am excited with the early progress we've seen with our recently launched Cisco partnership. This past quarter, our joint solution was made generally available to be sold by both sales forces. We also saw good customer interest and secured a few wins for this new offering, which were conversions of customers, who had previously been planning to purchase Cisco's HyperFlex. While it is still early days in this partnership, I am encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen so far. Another positive development on the partner front in the first quarter was a significant expansion deal we signed with a North American managed service provider, or MSP. This partner was increasing its capacity to handle the expected growth of its Nutanix related business. We see this win as reflecting the growing traction we are seeing with our MSP partners. On the product front, this quarter we announced important enhancements to the Nutanix Cloud Platform to strengthen its capabilities against ransomware attacks on unstructured data. These new features enable organizations to detect the threat, defend from further damage and begin a one click recovery process, all within 20 minutes of exposure. They build on the strength of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to protect and secure customers' most sensitive data across clouds. These enhancements reflect our ongoing commitment to investing in our platform. In the past quarter, we continued to receive industry recognition for our Nutanix Cloud Platform, being recognized as a leader in the latest report from Forrester Research in this area. We view our position as one of only two companies named as a leader in this report, as a reflection of our strong competitive position in the market. Finally, it was a pleasure seeing many of you in-person at our recent Investor Day. We were happy to be able to provide an update on a large and growing market opportunity to discuss our long-term vision of enabling portable applications and to provide targets calling for an ARR compound annual growth rate of approximately 20% through fiscal year '27 and generation of $700 million to $900 million of free cash flow in fiscal year '27. We have received great feedback so far from our Investor Day, and look forward to continuing to drive towards the vision and targets we share. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv. I will first provide commentary on our Q1 '24 results, followed by the guidance for Q2 '24 and fiscal year '24. Q1 '24 was a good quarter in which we exceeded the high end of the range on all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q1 was $287 million, above the guided range of $260 million to $270 million and a year-over-year growth rate of 24%. Revenue in Q1 was $511 million, higher than the guided range of $495 million to $505 million and a year-over-year growth rate of 18%. The outperformance was driven partly by stronger-than-expected performance from our U.S. federal government business, which grew significantly year-over-year in new ACV bookings. Our renewals performance also continued to be good. ARR at the end of Q1 was $1.664 billion, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 30%. Similar to last quarter, we saw a modest elongation of average sales cycles, relative to the year ago quarter. Average contract duration in Q1 was 2.9 years, slightly lower quarter-over-quarter and largely in line with our expectations, due to the higher mix of U.S. federal government business, which typically has lower contract duration. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 85.9%, higher than our expectations, due to higher revenue and a mix of factors leading to lower-than-expected cost of goods sold. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $360 million in Q1. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 15.6%, higher than our guided range of 9% to 11%, partly due to higher-than-expected revenue. Non-GAAP net income in Q1 was $85 million or EPS of $0.29 per share, based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 293 million shares. Linearity was good, and DSOs, based on revenue and ending AR were 24 days in Q1. Free cash flow in Q1 was $132 million, implying free cash flow margin of 26%, higher than our expectations, largely due to better-than-expected bookings familiarity. We saw a larger-than-expected proportion of Q1 bookings in the first two months of the quarter. And since our payment terms are typically 30 to 45 days, more of the bookings were billed and collected in Q1, than expected. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.571 billion, up from $1.437 billion in '23. Under the share repurchase program, authorized by our Board of Directors at the end of August, we began repurchasing shares in Q1, through a 10b5-1 plan. Given the timing of the authorization, we were in the market repurchasing shares for only a portion of Q1. Moving on to Q2. Our guidance for Q2 '24 is as follows: ACV billings of $295 million to $305 million; revenue of $545 million to $555 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 85% to 86%; non-GAAP operating margin of 14% to 16%; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 297 million shares. The updated guidance for full year fiscal year 2024 is as follows: ACV billings of $1.08 billion to $1.1 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint of the range; revenue of $2.095 billion to $2.125 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 85%; non-GAAP operating margin of 11.5% to 12.5%; free cash flow of $340 million to $360 million, representing free cash flow margin of 16.6% at the midpoint of the range. This updated fiscal year '24 guidance is higher than our previously provided fiscal year '24 guidance, across all metrics. I will now provide some additional commentary regarding our fiscal year '24 guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions, despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles. Our fiscal year '24 new and expansion ACV performance outlook assumes some impact from these macro dynamics. Second, the guidance assumes that our renewals business will continue to perform well. And a reminder that while our available to renew, or ATR pool, continues to grow year-over-year, it is growing at a slower pace in fiscal year '24, but is expected to reaccelerate in fiscal year '25, based on our current view. Third, the full year guidance assumes that average contract duration would be flat to slightly lower, compared to fiscal year '23, as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings. A reminder that the full year ACV billing is not the sum of the ACV billings of the four quarters, due to contracts with durations less than one year. We expect full year ACV billings to be about 5% to 6% lower than the sum of the four quarters ACV billings. Finally, a few thoughts on seasonality for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on our current view, we expect the trend in top line metrics in Q3 relative to Q2, to be more or less similar to what we saw in fiscal year '23. A reminder that operating expenses tend to be slightly higher in Q3 versus Q2, all else being equal, as Q3 includes the full impact of calendar year resets to payroll taxes. In closing, we are pleased with our Q1 results exceeding guidance and to raise our top line and bottom line guidance for the full fiscal year. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question for today will be coming from in Pinjalim Bora of JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Hey. Thank you. This is Pinjalim. Thank you for taking the questions, and congrats on the quarter, guys. Rajiv, I was surprised to hear your first customer for GPT-in-a-Box. So, that's what I'm going to ask. What -- maybe add a little bit more color around what this company is doing with GPT-in-a-Box? Is this more of a test dev kind of an environment, or are they looking to actually do something in production using GPT-in-a-Box? Are you seeing similar deals in the pipeline? How should we think about uplift in ACV? A number of questions, just surprised to see a new customer signing up so quickly.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Pinjalim, so thanks for the question. It's still early days for GPT-in-a-Box. Actually, we've seen good inbound interest from customers, as well as prospective ecosystem partners. Now, we did land that first win for GPT-in-a-Box. It is a federal agency. And the use cases are along the lines of what we've talked about. A lot of use cases have to do with document, search, document retrieval that we were looking for patterns, looking for potential criminal activity, et cetera, right? And that's along the line for what this particular agency was looking to do. Now, from an offering perspective, it's still very early days for us. It's still early to really comment on when it's going to be a meaningful contribution to our numbers, at this point. And so that's what I can say about GPT now. Perhaps it might be worth recapping a little bit on a broader basis of how we see this market for us, if that makes sense. So for us, I look at AI, I've sort of said this at our Investor Day, but there's three parts to it, first is landing new applications. Lots of companies looking at new applications like this particular customer and many others. Lining that on our platform. And there, again, I think AI applications are going run around where the data is. And some of the data will be in the public cloud, but others are going to be sensitive. They're going to be in the private cloud in secure locations, for example. And for those types of situations, we can help with our GPT-in-a-Box platform to provide a turnkey solution for them to both fine tune and train model from their specific data, as well as do inferencing. That's the first piece in terms of landing new applications. The second is, of course, about making our own products better. And we do, for example, a lot of telemetry that we gather from customers and we can use back-end AI to analyze that, get insight. We have a product around operations management. In fact, that product we call AI Operations. And so again, there's a lot of AI behind it to make the operating environment and optimize the operating environment such as capacity planning, et cetera. So that's the second vector. And the third vector is really using it internally itself to make things more efficient and run us more -- automate more processes inside the Company. We are starting that out, for example, with customer service on our end. So that's a broader picture. Still early days for us with gen AI. But again, lots of interest, and we'll continue to engage.\nPinjalim Bora: Understood. One follow-up. We -- in the channel, we have been hearing that Red Hat has kind of thrown its hat on for the VMware opportunity with OpenShift\u2019s virtualization technology. You obviously have a strong partnership with Red Hat. How do you kind of see that competition play out as both of you kind of go after the VMware opportunity.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. In fact, I mean, I think the -- this was actually the original thesis for the Red Hat partnership, that we complement each other very well, they, from an OpenShift perspective, being -- providing a complete platform for modern app development and b, being the underlying infrastructure platform. And so from their perspective, as they compete against VMware on the application side, we compete with VMware on the infrastructure side. So, the partnership was very good from that perspective, good synergies on our side. Now, we have seen several customers adopt OpenShift on top of Nutanix, that continues. And we've seen G2K wins here as well with including G2K banks, for example, running OpenShift on the Nutanix platform. So, it's a good synergistic relationship. We look forward to doing more with them. So in fact, this particular G2K bank in Asia Pacific, that I mentioned, was a good example where they're running OpenShift on top of our cloud platform.\nOperator: And today, our next question will be coming from Jim Fish of Piper Sandler.\nJim Fish: Just wanted to build off the last one and ask it a little bit more directly. You guys have talked about like a little bit of VMware contribution here this quarter. But, maybe you could walk us just through the pipeline. What does the pipeline look now that the competitor's acquisition has officially closed over to Broadcom and you've actually already seen them from what we've heard in our channel shacks at least, about them kind of raising maintenance prices pretty significantly. So can you just walk us through a little bit more detail on what you're seeing on the VMware pipeline itself going forward outside of just the Red Hat opportunity?\nRajiv Ramaswami: For sure, Jim, good question. And of course, very relevant, given what just happened with the transaction closing. So, even this last quarter, we did close some additional deals that I would consider to be influenced by the Broadcom VMware transaction. In fact, again, going back to that bank win that we talked about, the G2K bank, that was certainly influenced by this transaction. As we mentioned, it was a dual vendor strategy, but going forward, it's going to be a single vendor strategy with us. Now, the timing and magnitude of these deals is unpredictable. And also attributing the primary motivation for these deals also can be a bit nuanced. Because we compete every day, right, even before all of the acquisition news, so. But certainly it\u2019s contributing. Now the transaction, of course, closed recently, but we don't expect that to have an immediate impact for us in terms of timing of potential risk. Clearly, some -- many customers have signed multiyear ELAs with VMware, prior to the deal closing. And for those that have signed that gives them some time to evaluate options going forward. There continues to be certainly a lot of concerns around all the stuff we've talked about in the past, pricing, increased pricing, potentially dropping support levels, et cetera. So we have a significant pipeline of opportunities, and it's growing and a good degree of engagement with prospects, driven by these concerns. It's just difficult to predict timing and magnitude of wins. And we continue to expect some benefit from these influenced by this transaction, and we certainly factored that in -- into our guidance for this fiscal year.\nJim Fish: Very helpful. And I\u2019m surprised to hear a little bit about the Cisco partnership already picking up. I mean, we're two months in. Understanding it's easier with the installed base of HyperFlex to kind of sell or sell into that base. But, any way to think about if there are larger periods of renewals at certain times within that base, or if those renewals are accelerating, understanding you mentioned that the larger the wins there were more on the kind of customers evaluating HyperFlex and you guys get substituted in.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I mean, first of all, I think we're happy that we are -- our joint solution with Cisco became available this last quarter. So it's now in the field, both sellers are selling it. And those deals -- the initial deals, of course, naturally are ones where Cisco was either had already won them or was very close to winning them with HyperFlex, and now they're simply converting those over to Nutanix going forward. So that's one of the first parts. But with respect to new pipeline, really, I mean, we know that our pipeline takes 6 to 9 months to go close deals for us, right? So we don't expect a huge amount of Cisco this year. We expect some and we factored that into our guidance this year. And then we expect that to continue growing next fiscal year and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. And I'll offer my congrats as well. Really solid quarter and guide, especially given the uncertainty of the macro environment. Rukmini, I had a question for you. You noted strong renewals in the quarter and obviously, it's becoming a bigger part of the mix. On the call, you talked about some new wins as well. But I'm curious, can you just step back and maybe double click a little bit more on the new business side of it. I know that, obviously, it's been more of a renewals business of late. But just where are we in the new business sort of aspect of the story?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi Matt, thank you for the question. So, if we think about Q1, I'll talk about Q1 performance versus maybe what you were alluding to, but then also maybe talk a little bit about the full year, Matt, to your point on just trends and so on. So in Q1, specifically, our overall sort of top line performance or outperformance really was driven by a combination of good execution across our new and expansion business. And within that, we talked specifically about our U.S. federal business, which had a really significant and nice year-over-year growth in new and expansion ACV bookings. So that was certainly something that we benefited from in Q1. Now for the full year, Matt, we've talked about, I think, some puts and takes that we are factoring into our outlook. One is that we are expecting some improvement in our new and expansion ACV performance, compared to fiscal year '23. We've talked about -- Rajiv just touched upon like some things that we're factoring in, in terms of benefits, whether it be a little benefit from our -- from what's happening in the competitive environment, some benefits from the fairly new Cisco partnership and so on. So we have some things that we're optimistic and excited about. At the same time, as you started your question, Matt, there is also uncertainty in the macro, which just means that it's harder for us to sit here and say exactly how the rest of the year is going to play out. So those are some of the things we've factored into our new and expansion performance for the year. I will say, I think as you pointed out, right, renewals tends to be much more predictable portion of the business, just given our GRR, as you said before, is in the 90-plus percent range, and we know when those renewals are coming up for the next transaction. And so that part continues to be predictable and continues to perform well. And so hopefully, that gives you a sense of revenue and expansion.\nMatt Hedberg: Super helpful. If I could ask one more. The gross margin performance has been great. And obviously, you guided to a really strong Q2 gross margin. Maybe could you double click there also, like what are some of the biggest factors driving that significant gross margin improvement?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. So, I think a couple of points that I would make. Again, I'll start with sort of the Q1 and maybe the Q2 guide, Matt, and then talk more broadly on gross margin. So for Q1, we attributed our gross margin outperformance, revenue coming in slightly higher, of course, because we beat on revenue. But we also had a mix of factors that led to COGS coming in lower. Now, there were a few things in there, Matt. I think that I would call out as one singular factor but a mix of things, some of which we believe will sustain and which is why we were happy to take up our full year gross margin number, last quarter when we gave you the first guide, we said approximately 84%, and we're happy to take it up to approximately 85%. So I would say it's just a mix of good execution on a few different funds, and a reminder that our COGS has a good portion of it is our support teams like for our customer support folks are in there, we have services costs in there. And so across a few different dimensions, we were happy to see gross margin do better and take some of that across to the full year guide as well.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from George Wang of Barclays.\nGeorge Wang: Congrats on the quarter. Yes, so, two quick ones. Firstly, just given better-than-expected free cash flow generation, just given kind of you guys started purchasing stocks. Just curious kind of any high-level plan going forward, how to model in terms of the share buyback, just given better free cash profile?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi George, thank you for the question. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did begin repurchasing shares in Q1, under the authorization of -- that we had from our -- that was approved by our Board in August. And we did that through a 10b5-1 program that we've set up. Due to the timing of the authorization, we were only in the market for a portion of Q1. And you'll see in the financial tables that we put out with the release that we spent about $17.5 million, repurchasing shares, during that time. So for a portion of Q1, we spent $17.5 million. And the timing and amount of the future repurchases will continue to depend on a variety of factors, George, including stock prices, just conditions of the market and so on. And so I won't get too specific in terms of outlook, but I wanted to give you at least a bit of color on what we did in Q1, acknowledging it was only for a portion of the quarter.\nGeorge Wang: Okay, great. Just a quick follow-up, if I can. Just can you kind of comment on backlog? Last quarter, you talked about backlog slightly improved in absolute dollars year-over-year, as you kind of factored into the FY24 guide. Just curious if you have any latest update in terms of the backlog level and any sort of plus and minus, how would that factor into the latest guide?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, happy to give you some color on that. So we used some backlog in Q1, as is seasonally typical for Q1 and expect some backlog to be consumed over the course of this fiscal year, as we talked about before. But as is to be expected in an environment like this, where things remain fairly uncertain from a macro perspective, the range of possible outcomes is wider than usual. And as we continue to grow, the absolute dollar number of backlog would also increase over time. So, a few different factors there. But yes, I think in Q1, we used some backlog as is typical for Q1, and we expect to use some backlog over the course of the year as well.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Michael Cikos of Needham.\nMichael Cikos: Congrats on the strong quarter. I wanted to cycle back to some of the comments when we're describing the revenue and the ACV billings outperformance, I know that we cited specifically U.S. federal. Can you give us a better sense, as far as what U.S. federal is as far as size or contribution to revenue or ACV billings? Understanding that there's probably seasonality with their year-end. But would just be good to get a flavor for how big of a component that is to the overall business? And then also, if you could shed some light, I know that you cited the improved linearity during the quarter. Is it -- is that improvement linearity tied back to the stronger U.S. federal business, or is it -- are those two independent items in your view?\nRajiv Ramaswami: So I can take a first crack at the federal piece, Rukmini you can go for the rest. So what I\u2019d say is, look, largely, we don't have verticals, but we have two exceptions. And that's in the U.S., we have federal at vertical, and we have health care as another vertical. So from that perspective, federal is a significant portion of our business. We haven't broken it out exactly in terms of the percentages. But given the fact that it is 1 of 2 verticals and we have a focused team on it, it is important for us. And of course, there's also seasonality there, as Rukmini was alluding to here. I mean this quarter typically is strong for federal. So that's kind of what we have to say about Federal. Rukmini, you can comment on the linearity.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. So on the linearity, Mike, what we mean there is we have some expectations of how much bookings comes in, in month 1, month 2, month 3. And the reason that's important for free cash flow, right, is because we invoice soon after we get the booking, and we have 30- to 45-day invoice payment terms. And so, what we saw in Q1 is that compared to our expectations going in -- so we saw a larger proportion of those bookings come in month 1 and month 2. And you're right, there's an outperformance in fed as well, and of course, fed had their year-end, the U.S. federal government has their fiscal year end in September. So that was likely a factor in that. And so what that meant was that given, again, we invoiced right after we get the bookings, we were -- we collected more cash from bookings in Q1 than we had previously expected, which was a significant driver of the free cash flow performance in Q1.\nMichael Cikos: Understood. Thank you for clearing that up. I guess, the other question that I had, this is more specific to the 2Q guidance that we have here today, Rukmini. But if I could just take a look, I'm happy to see that the revenue is coming in above where the sell side models were, happy to see the strong gross margins and then the operating margin is also coming in ahead of where we had been. But one of the things that I'm looking at is the OpEx. The implied OpEx from Q1 to Q2 has a pretty material pickup after being relatively flat the last couple of quarters. And I just wanted to see what is it that you guys are embedding in that? Is it more maybe targeted go-to-market initiatives? Are you focused on hiring or potentially backfilling open positions? Like, how should we think about that OpEx ramp that you guys are putting now in the 2Q guide?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. So, a few points on Q2 OpEx related to Q1, Mike. The first one is, as we talked about when we laid out sort of our initial full year guide on the last call, we talked about the fact that we plan to continue to invest to drive growth, while continuing to improve the margin profile. And that's the approach that we've taken for this year, and you saw some of that in the last call, but also we touched on this sort of idea at Investor Day as well. And so in general, we've started those investments. And as you can imagine, it takes -- we're continuing to hire. And so as you can imagine, that sort of leads to sort of an increase in Q2 as more of the folks come on board. The other piece is this is only for one month of Q2. But in the calendar year resets, and I alluded to this in my script as well, like payroll taxes and all that reset for calendar year '24, which means that we have one month of that in January. That also has an effect on the Q2 OpEx. That all said, of course, we were pleased, as you pointed out, to be able to raise both of our top line and bottom line guidance for the full year.\nOperator: And the next question will be coming from Erik Suppiger JMP.\nErik Suppiger: Two questions. One, you said the sales cycles continue to elongate. Are they still getting longer, or is it just they've kind of reached a level of extended cycles? Is it consistent with last quarter? Is it actually getting longer? And then secondly, you've had some time now to talk with customers about their Chat GPT-in-a-Box. What are the specific use cases that customers are using either what department are they using that for, or how are they using that in particular?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Erik. I'll take the first one. Yes. And then Rajiv you can take maybe the GPT-in-a-Box question. So on sales cycles, what I said in my script, Erik, was that we're seeing some increased elongation, right, in -- a modest increase in average sales cycles on a year-over-year basis. I\u2019m comparing Q1 to Q1, it has gotten longer in Q1. But if you look at average sales cycle in Q1, it was more or less the same as the last few quarters. So it's not like it's continued to lengthen early quarter-over-quarter, but year-over-year, it remains elevated. And this -- again, it's hard to sort of focus what's going to -- exactly is going to happen here, given all the uncertainties we've talked about, but that's what we saw in Q1.\nErik Suppiger: Okay.\nRajiv Ramaswami: So Erik, on the GPT-in-a-Box. By the way, it\u2019s GPT not ChatGPT. So on the GPT-in-a-Box section, there are four use cases that we typically see. And again, I want to caution all this by saying it's pretty early. A lot of people are just trying to figure out how to use gen AI. But the four use cases right now. First, of course, is a classic customer service use case. That includes chat, that's one. The second is a whole bunch of operations having to do with documents, document, search documents, analysis documents, retrieval of key information from unstructured data, for example. So that's the second big, I would say, a use case. The third use case is co-piloting, generally providing assistive services, for example, to software developers or researchers in pharma for example. That's the third use case. And the fourth use case I would broadly classify as fraud detection or fraud prevention. And these are things across multiple verticals. I think these tend to cut across verticals, whether it be financial services or retail or our federal or other.\nErik Suppiger: Last question is you talked about the class of customer service. Is that the majority of the use cases at this point, or is it spread across those different four options?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I would say it's spread across. It's -- now the customer service one, for example, happens to be one that we are ourselves internally trialing right now within Nutanix. But I would say it's fairly broad-based across all of those four. And it's still very early, I have to say, to say, hey, we can actually say, hey, this percent of one use case versus the other. It's just, we are in the forming stages here.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Karan on for Meta. So just first question, I understand it's sort of a challenging environment today. But I guess just in terms of customer conversations or what you're hearing from customers in terms of 2024 budgets, I guess what are you hearing from customers on those budgets? And are you seeing a pickup in any RFP activity?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I wouldn't say there's anything specific we are seeing in our conversations with customers. I think, certainly, look, I would say they're still investing in their digital efforts, in their modernization efforts. Every customer call I have, there\u2019s conversation on how they can be using AI inside their companies. So from a budget perspective, I would say, in general, I think, IT spending will probably grow faster than GDP growth. And within that, I would say software modernization spending will probably grow faster than that. But we haven't seen any specific trend other than the fact that there are -- customers are still on us, at least, they're willing to spend the money. They want to make sure there's a solid business case and there's good TCO and ROI for everything that they do. And there's certainly more inspection, which is what is causing the elongation in the cycle, right? They want to make sure there may be an additional level of approvals, for example, before they sign up on projects. But, they're still moving forward with projects.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. And then a quick follow-up. Sort of at the Analyst Day, you mentioned some of the VMware share gains would likely take place, with just a little bit of share with each customer over time. I guess as you started to see these opportunities take place, are these shares maybe -- the share taking greater than expected, or is it just more opportunities or more at bats, or I guess just any color around sort of the opportunities you're seeing in share gains there?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think we commented on the overall situation from a VMware Broadcom perspective. Again, I think we are still at a point where we have a significant and growing pipeline of opportunities that we are engaged in with prospects. But it's hard to predict what portion of those will win? How much will they, for example, bring us in as a second vendor or the sole vendor or just use us as a negotiating lever to get a better deal from VMware. So there's a lot of uncertainty and lack of predictability there for the long term. So we've focused -- or the timing, for example, for when this might happen. So, we -- that's why we have -- we've modeled in some level of share gains here into our forecast for the year and incorporated into the guidance. But it's going to be -- I would again emphasize that it's going to be a multiyear thing for us here. And it's going to be a bit timing, and the exact share gains are going to be a little unpredictable.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research.\nBen Bollin: Rajiv, I wanted to ask about the Global 2000 Financials Awards. Could you share a little bit about what that process looks like? How long was the evaluation, the pilot? And how does the ACV ramp for that deal? Does it build over time, as they get more data centers? Does it commence at a full run rate? Just any color on that? And then, I have a follow-up.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So this particular bank in Asia Pacific, the G2K bank, has been a customer for a while for us. And what they've been doing, of course, is the classic, they've been migrating from traditional legacy 3-tier infrastructure over to HCI. And for many years -- I mean, they've been a customer for a while now. And for many years, it was a dual vendor situation with us and VMware. And -- so they've been going down both parts. They had us, they had this sense. And this was a classic time, where we were coming due for renewal, and they were also looking to expand, significantly increase their presence, they\u2019re growing and they had multiple data centers that they were going to go modernize. So for them, this was a time for them to -- for us to do an expansion along with the renewal, a substantial expansion. And like we've said with other G2K customers, generally, once we get in the door, they're pretty happy with us, and they do expand with us over time. In fact, we've given you some data at Investor Day in terms of how much the expansion is, like I think it was 25x or 26x over life. So this particular bank was similar, right? They liked us. They were comfortable with us. And then now they have this additional trigger that they were concerned about what would happen on the other side. So when they did do the expansion with us, they went with us as a sole vendor. So that's sort of how it played out for us.\nRukmini Sivaraman: If I can add to that, Ben. I think you had a question on ACV ramp. And just to clarify, our contracts, typically, they're sort of evenly spread up. There isn't a ramp within the year. So like this transaction and typically most of our transactions, it would be a total TCV amount divided by the contract duration. That's how we calculate the ACV of any given transaction.\nBen Bollin: Okay. That's great. The other item, Rajiv, I'm curious, you talked about the MSP awards. Can you share any thoughts about your strategy around go-to-market efforts? Do you have some programs specifically geared to pursue more of these partners that are potentially alienate by this deal? That's it for me.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I think that's -- again, that's both an MSP specific thing here and a broader thing here, as well in your questions, Ben. So on the MSP specific, I mean, for us, independent of this transaction. This was a an area that we want to do more in because traditionally, we have not had a big route to market through MSPs. So for the last couple of years, we've been building up our MSP presence and recruiting more of these MSPs to come on board as partners. And that continues. And this particular deal this last quarter was a good example of an expansion opportunity where they had done something small with us and now the standard is a significant expansion with us. So I do think that with the transaction happening, it's not only the customers of VMware that are going to be concerned, but there's also their partners and that includes the MSP partners. So, we are talking to the MSP partners, just like people with other customers and trying to recruit more of them on to the Nutanix platform. And so, this is still -- I would say, we are young when it comes to the MSP route to market. And so, there's potentially a lot more MSPs that we do need to recruit over time and get on board as our partners. And we have a team at Nutanix that\u2019s focused on recruiting these partners and enabling that.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: It's actually Wamsi here at Bank of America. I guess, Rukmini, if you could address seasonality. Your Q2 revenue guidance at the midpoint is calling for 8% growth. That is the lowest that we've seen over the last four or five years, but you're calling for Q3 seasonality to be down similar to fiscal '23, which is down the highest in the last several years. And I'm just wondering, are you seeing something around the macro that's causing you to view the seasonality this way, which is actually a little bit bias lower towards Q3 than historically, a little bit lower also in Q2 to the upside. Just wondering if you could share any color there.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi Wamsi, thanks for the question. So a few things I would say. One, on the Q1 to Q2 dynamic. We talked about Q1, of course, came in at a bit higher than our expectations, given the beat across revenue and ACV billings, Wamsi. So I think relative to that Q2, I think, to your point, still going to look based on our guidance, right, higher than Q1 as we seasonally see. So, I wouldn't read too much into that dynamic. And then, the reason we sort of gave the color on Q3 is to just note what we're seeing right now, based on pipeline and all the various factors we've talked about already, as it relates to things that are driving the top line. And I'll just remind folks, again, as we said in the prepared remarks as well that the full year ACV billings is at about a 5% or 6% discount with some of the four quarters given the annualization that we do each quarter for contracts less than one year. So overall, I'd say, Wamsi, I think I wouldn't read too much into the seasonality point, other than we're seeing -- this is what we're seeing in our pipeline. I wanted to give folks an update on that. And overall, we're happy to be able to raise our '24 ACV billings guidance, right, following a solid first quarter, but we've also factored in some caution overall regarding how the rest of the year plays out given some of this macro uncertainity.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. And just on free cash flow out of clarification. When you think about what you would have normally called a normal booking linearity in the quarter, what was -- what would you say is the delta of overachievement in fiscal 1Q? And is that overachievement primarily what's driving the full year free cash flow increase, or are you expecting sort of -- is that free cash flow weighs beyond sort of the 1Q overachievement? Thank you so much.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, great question, Wamsi. So two thoughts. So one on Q1, we, of course, don't guide to quarterly free cash flow. So I'm not able to sort of give you specifically how much we overachieved our own expectations for Q1 free cash flow, but we did overachieve it. And I will say that, in addition to the billings number coming higher, right, given we had a beat on ACV billings as well for Q1. So that helped, but the linearity was a significant factor in Q1, okay? So that did have a significant impact on the outperformance for free cash flow in Q1. And I think the second part of your question is around the full year free cash flow guidance. And what I'd say there is that in addition to benefiting from the raised top line guide, and of course, as you know, billings has a very high correlation with free cash flow, right? So the fact that we were able to raise our full year billings number. So that's one factor. But we're also expecting to see some benefit from somewhat better working capital management within the year than previously expected, including from improved linearity. So that is helping us to raise the full year free cash flow guide as well.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Victor Chiu [ph] in for Simon Leopold. Regarding the share shifts and competitive dynamics with VMware, are there instances where customers use both VMware and Nutanix?\nRajiv Ramaswami: A lot of customers use both VMware and Nutanix. And again, I think just to clarify, how they use. Sometimes their users is just -- they\u2019ll have a dual vendor strategy. They'll do some with VMware, some with Nutanix. There's also -- we work together with Nutanix -- I mean, Nutanix works together with VMware\u2019s hypervisor, ESX. So, we have a lot of customers who are deploying Nutanix on top of VMS hypervisor, ESX. And over the years, many of these have also migrated from ESX to our own built-in hypervisor that's included in the platform. In fact, again, I would say, over the years, we came up with our own hypervisor back in 2015. And today, if you look at our workloads across the entire spectrum of customers, about 65% of those workloads have migrated and they are now on just a Nutanix hypervisor. Most of those won VMware ESX hypervisors. But we are committed to continuing to interoperate very nicely with VMware. And so customers have the choice. They have -- it's all about providing a premium of choice for customers. So we interoperate with them, we can replace them fully. It's up to the customer.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And are you having discussions with customers? Is your visibility kind of what -- into what their plans are going forward, kind of built into your assumptions and kind of the share shifts that come along with that, is that kind of built into assumptions or is there some dry powder that that potentially happens with the shift?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. Like we said, it's hard to predict the timing and how big these things are going to be, right? And so, we have factored in some of this into our guide for the full year, and we'll have to see how things materialize. There's a lot of engagement, but what happens to these engagements from do we win them fully, do we win partially or do we win nothing and just become a leverage point for them to get a better deal on the other side? It's hard to predict ahead of time. So we have to see how it plays out. And it's hard to predict both timing and the degree to which they'll play out for each customer.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nRajiv Ramaswami: I don't think we have any closing remarks. Do we?\nRich Valera: No, I think we conclude the call now. Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you all.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining the conference call tonight. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Rajiv Ramaswami",
            "content": "Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a solid first quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance. The uncertain macro backdrop that we saw in our first quarter was largely unchanged compared with the prior quarter. However, we saw a steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership. Taking a closer look at the first quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered record quarterly revenue of $511 million, exceeding a $2 billion annualized run rate for the first time, and grew our ARR 30% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. We also had another quarter of strong free cash flow generation aided by good linearity. Overall, our first quarter financial performance was a strong start to our fiscal year. Our federal business is typically strong in our first quarter, and this one was no exception. We saw wins with several different agencies across all three of our expansion vectors, including additional capacity for existing workloads, capacity for net new workloads, and adoption of additional portfolio products. The wins also included expansion into the public cloud with NC2 on AWS, and our first win with a large existing customer for GPT-in-a-Box, our recently introduced turnkey solution for deploying generative AI. We view the breadth and diversity of our wins with this important customer as a testament to our ability to expand within our largest customers. Another notable win in the quarter was with a Global 2000 bank in the Asia Pacific region. This customer, who signed a significant expansion agreement, selected Nutanix as their sole platform for their future modernization initiatives and planned build out of multiple new data centers. This was a departure from their historical dual vendor strategy. They chose our Nutanix Cloud Platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management to run their containerized, business-critical applications, leveraging its simplicity and built-in automation for infrastructure-as-a-service. They also adopted Nutanix database service for managing and deploying their databases throughout their organizations. We see this win as a great example of our ability to partner with the largest and most demanding companies in the world, as they look to modernize and grow their businesses. Generating leverage from our partners remains a key focus. And towards this end, I am excited with the early progress we've seen with our recently launched Cisco partnership. This past quarter, our joint solution was made generally available to be sold by both sales forces. We also saw good customer interest and secured a few wins for this new offering, which were conversions of customers, who had previously been planning to purchase Cisco's HyperFlex. While it is still early days in this partnership, I am encouraged by what we've seen so far. Another positive development on the partner front in the first quarter was a significant expansion deal we signed with a North American managed service provider, or MSP. This partner was increasing its capacity to handle the expected growth of its Nutanix related business. We see this win as reflecting the growing traction we are seeing with our MSP partners. On the product front, this quarter we announced important enhancements to the Nutanix Cloud Platform to strengthen its capabilities against ransomware attacks on unstructured data. These new features enable organizations to detect the threat, defend from further damage and begin a one click recovery process, all within 20 minutes of exposure. They build on the strength of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to protect and secure customers' most sensitive data across clouds. These enhancements reflect our ongoing commitment to investing in our platform. In the past quarter, we continued to receive industry recognition for our Nutanix Cloud Platform, being recognized as a leader in the latest report from Forrester Research in this area. We view our position as one of only two companies named as a leader in this report, as a reflection of our strong competitive position in the market. Finally, it was a pleasure seeing many of you in-person at our recent Investor Day. We were happy to be able to provide an update on a large and growing market opportunity to discuss our long-term vision of enabling portable applications and to provide targets calling for an ARR compound annual growth rate of approximately 20% through fiscal year '27 and generation of $700 million to $900 million of free cash flow in fiscal year '27. We have received great feedback so far from our Investor Day, and look forward to continuing to drive towards the vision and targets we share. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini? Yes, Pinjalim, so thanks for the question. It's still early days for GPT-in-a-Box. Actually, we've seen good inbound interest from customers, as well as prospective ecosystem partners. Now, we did land that first win for GPT-in-a-Box. It is a federal agency. And the use cases are along the lines of what we've talked about. A lot of use cases have to do with document, search, document retrieval that we were looking for patterns, looking for potential criminal activity, et cetera, right? And that's along the line for what this particular agency was looking to do. Now, from an offering perspective, it's still very early days for us. It's still early to really comment on when it's going to be a meaningful contribution to our numbers, at this point. And so that's what I can say about GPT now. Perhaps it might be worth recapping a little bit on a broader basis of how we see this market for us, if that makes sense. So for us, I look at AI, I've sort of said this at our Investor Day, but there's three parts to it, first is landing new applications. Lots of companies looking at new applications like this particular customer and many others. Lining that on our platform. And there, again, I think AI applications are going run around where the data is. And some of the data will be in the public cloud, but others are going to be sensitive. They're going to be in the private cloud in secure locations, for example. And for those types of situations, we can help with our GPT-in-a-Box platform to provide a turnkey solution for them to both fine tune and train model from their specific data, as well as do inferencing. That's the first piece in terms of landing new applications. The second is, of course, about making our own products better. And we do, for example, a lot of telemetry that we gather from customers and we can use back-end AI to analyze that, get insight. We have a product around operations management. In fact, that product we call AI Operations. And so again, there's a lot of AI behind it to make the operating environment and optimize the operating environment such as capacity planning, et cetera. So that's the second vector. And the third vector is really using it internally itself to make things more efficient and run us more -- automate more processes inside the Company. We are starting that out, for example, with customer service on our end. So that's a broader picture. Still early days for us with gen AI. But again, lots of interest, and we'll continue to engage. Yes. In fact, I mean, I think the -- this was actually the original thesis for the Red Hat partnership, that we complement each other very well, they, from an OpenShift perspective, being -- providing a complete platform for modern app development and b, being the underlying infrastructure platform. And so from their perspective, as they compete against VMware on the application side, we compete with VMware on the infrastructure side. So, the partnership was very good from that perspective, good synergies on our side. Now, we have seen several customers adopt OpenShift on top of Nutanix, that continues. And we've seen G2K wins here as well with including G2K banks, for example, running OpenShift on the Nutanix platform. So, it's a good synergistic relationship. We look forward to doing more with them. So in fact, this particular G2K bank in Asia Pacific, that I mentioned, was a good example where they're running OpenShift on top of our cloud platform. For sure, Jim, good question. And of course, very relevant, given what just happened with the transaction closing. So, even this last quarter, we did close some additional deals that I would consider to be influenced by the Broadcom VMware transaction. In fact, again, going back to that bank win that we talked about, the G2K bank, that was certainly influenced by this transaction. As we mentioned, it was a dual vendor strategy, but going forward, it's going to be a single vendor strategy with us. Now, the timing and magnitude of these deals is unpredictable. And also attributing the primary motivation for these deals also can be a bit nuanced. Because we compete every day, right, even before all of the acquisition news, so. But certainly it's contributing. Now the transaction, of course, closed recently, but we don't expect that to have an immediate impact for us in terms of timing of potential risk. Clearly, some -- many customers have signed multiyear ELAs with VMware, prior to the deal closing. And for those that have signed that gives them some time to evaluate options going forward. There continues to be certainly a lot of concerns around all the stuff we've talked about in the past, pricing, increased pricing, potentially dropping support levels, et cetera. So we have a significant pipeline of opportunities, and it's growing and a good degree of engagement with prospects, driven by these concerns. It's just difficult to predict timing and magnitude of wins. And we continue to expect some benefit from these influenced by this transaction, and we certainly factored that in -- into our guidance for this fiscal year. Yes. I mean, first of all, I think we're happy that we are -- our joint solution with Cisco became available this last quarter. So it's now in the field, both sellers are selling it. And those deals -- the initial deals, of course, naturally are ones where Cisco was either had already won them or was very close to winning them with HyperFlex, and now they're simply converting those over to Nutanix going forward. So that's one of the first parts. But with respect to new pipeline, really, I mean, we know that our pipeline takes 6 to 9 months to go close deals for us, right? So we don't expect a huge amount of Cisco this year. We expect some and we factored that into our guidance this year. And then we expect that to continue growing next fiscal year and beyond. So I can take a first crack at the federal piece, Rukmini you can go for the rest. So what I'd say is, look, largely, we don't have verticals, but we have two exceptions. And that's in the U.S., we have federal at vertical, and we have health care as another vertical. So from that perspective, federal is a significant portion of our business. We haven't broken it out exactly in terms of the percentages. But given the fact that it is 1 of 2 verticals and we have a focused team on it, it is important for us. And of course, there's also seasonality there, as Rukmini was alluding to here. I mean this quarter typically is strong for federal. So that's kind of what we have to say about Federal. Rukmini, you can comment on the linearity. So Erik, on the GPT-in-a-Box. By the way, it's GPT not ChatGPT. So on the GPT-in-a-Box section, there are four use cases that we typically see. And again, I want to caution all this by saying it's pretty early. A lot of people are just trying to figure out how to use gen AI. But the four use cases right now. First, of course, is a classic customer service use case. That includes chat, that's one. The second is a whole bunch of operations having to do with documents, document, search documents, analysis documents, retrieval of key information from unstructured data, for example. So that's the second big, I would say, a use case. The third use case is co-piloting, generally providing assistive services, for example, to software developers or researchers in pharma for example. That's the third use case. And the fourth use case I would broadly classify as fraud detection or fraud prevention. And these are things across multiple verticals. I think these tend to cut across verticals, whether it be financial services or retail or our federal or other. I would say it's spread across. It's -- now the customer service one, for example, happens to be one that we are ourselves internally trialing right now within Nutanix. But I would say it's fairly broad-based across all of those four. And it's still very early, I have to say, to say, hey, we can actually say, hey, this percent of one use case versus the other. It's just, we are in the forming stages here. I wouldn't say there's anything specific we are seeing in our conversations with customers. I think, certainly, look, I would say they're still investing in their digital efforts, in their modernization efforts. Every customer call I have, there's conversation on how they can be using AI inside their companies. So from a budget perspective, I would say, in general, I think, IT spending will probably grow faster than GDP growth. And within that, I would say software modernization spending will probably grow faster than that. But we haven't seen any specific trend other than the fact that there are -- customers are still on us, at least, they're willing to spend the money. They want to make sure there's a solid business case and there's good TCO and ROI for everything that they do. And there's certainly more inspection, which is what is causing the elongation in the cycle, right? They want to make sure there may be an additional level of approvals, for example, before they sign up on projects. But, they're still moving forward with projects. Yes. I think we commented on the overall situation from a VMware Broadcom perspective. Again, I think we are still at a point where we have a significant and growing pipeline of opportunities that we are engaged in with prospects. But it's hard to predict what portion of those will win? How much will they, for example, bring us in as a second vendor or the sole vendor or just use us as a negotiating lever to get a better deal from VMware. So there's a lot of uncertainty and lack of predictability there for the long term. So we've focused -- or the timing, for example, for when this might happen. So, we -- that's why we have -- we've modeled in some level of share gains here into our forecast for the year and incorporated into the guidance. But it's going to be -- I would again emphasize that it's going to be a multiyear thing for us here. And it's going to be a bit timing, and the exact share gains are going to be a little unpredictable. Yes. So this particular bank in Asia Pacific, the G2K bank, has been a customer for a while for us. And what they've been doing, of course, is the classic, they've been migrating from traditional legacy 3-tier infrastructure over to HCI. And for many years -- I mean, they've been a customer for a while now. And for many years, it was a dual vendor situation with us and VMware. And -- so they've been going down both parts. They had us, they had this sense. And this was a classic time, where we were coming due for renewal, and they were also looking to expand, significantly increase their presence, they're growing and they had multiple data centers that they were going to go modernize. So for them, this was a time for them to -- for us to do an expansion along with the renewal, a substantial expansion. And like we've said with other G2K customers, generally, once we get in the door, they're pretty happy with us, and they do expand with us over time. In fact, we've given you some data at Investor Day in terms of how much the expansion is, like I think it was 25x or 26x over life. So this particular bank was similar, right? They liked us. They were comfortable with us. And then now they have this additional trigger that they were concerned about what would happen on the other side. So when they did do the expansion with us, they went with us as a sole vendor. So that's sort of how it played out for us. Yes, I think that's -- again, that's both an MSP specific thing here and a broader thing here, as well in your questions, Ben. So on the MSP specific, I mean, for us, independent of this transaction. This was a an area that we want to do more in because traditionally, we have not had a big route to market through MSPs. So for the last couple of years, we've been building up our MSP presence and recruiting more of these MSPs to come on board as partners. And that continues. And this particular deal this last quarter was a good example of an expansion opportunity where they had done something small with us and now the standard is a significant expansion with us. So I do think that with the transaction happening, it's not only the customers of VMware that are going to be concerned, but there's also their partners and that includes the MSP partners. So, we are talking to the MSP partners, just like people with other customers and trying to recruit more of them on to the Nutanix platform. And so, this is still -- I would say, we are young when it comes to the MSP route to market. And so, there's potentially a lot more MSPs that we do need to recruit over time and get on board as our partners. And we have a team at Nutanix that's focused on recruiting these partners and enabling that. A lot of customers use both VMware and Nutanix. And again, I think just to clarify, how they use. Sometimes their users is just -- they'll have a dual vendor strategy. They'll do some with VMware, some with Nutanix. There's also -- we work together with Nutanix -- I mean, Nutanix works together with VMware's hypervisor, ESX. So, we have a lot of customers who are deploying Nutanix on top of VMS hypervisor, ESX. And over the years, many of these have also migrated from ESX to our own built-in hypervisor that's included in the platform. In fact, again, I would say, over the years, we came up with our own hypervisor back in 2015. And today, if you look at our workloads across the entire spectrum of customers, about 65% of those workloads have migrated and they are now on just a Nutanix hypervisor. Most of those won VMware ESX hypervisors. But we are committed to continuing to interoperate very nicely with VMware. And so customers have the choice. They have -- it's all about providing a premium of choice for customers. So we interoperate with them, we can replace them fully. It's up to the customer. Yes. Like we said, it's hard to predict the timing and how big these things are going to be, right? And so, we have factored in some of this into our guide for the full year, and we'll have to see how things materialize. There's a lot of engagement, but what happens to these engagements from do we win them fully, do we win partially or do we win nothing and just become a leverage point for them to get a better deal on the other side? It's hard to predict ahead of time. So we have to see how it plays out. And it's hard to predict both timing and the degree to which they'll play out for each customer. I don't think we have any closing remarks. Do we? Thank you all."

            "name": "Rukmini Sivaraman",
            "content": "Thank you, Rajiv. I will first provide commentary on our Q1 '24 results, followed by the guidance for Q2 '24 and fiscal year '24. Q1 '24 was a good quarter in which we exceeded the high end of the range on all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q1 was $287 million, above the guided range of $260 million to $270 million and a year-over-year growth rate of 24%. Revenue in Q1 was $511 million, higher than the guided range of $495 million to $505 million and a year-over-year growth rate of 18%. The outperformance was driven partly by stronger-than-expected performance from our U.S. federal government business, which grew significantly year-over-year in new ACV bookings. Our renewals performance also continued to be good. ARR at the end of Q1 was $1.664 billion, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 30%. Similar to last quarter, we saw a modest elongation of average sales cycles, relative to the year ago quarter. Average contract duration in Q1 was 2.9 years, slightly lower quarter-over-quarter and largely in line with our expectations, due to the higher mix of U.S. federal government business, which typically has lower contract duration. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 85.9%, higher than our expectations, due to higher revenue and a mix of factors leading to lower-than-expected cost of goods sold. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $360 million in Q1. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 15.6%, higher than our guided range of 9% to 11%, partly due to higher-than-expected revenue. Non-GAAP net income in Q1 was $85 million or EPS of $0.29 per share, based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 293 million shares. Linearity was good, and DSOs, based on revenue and ending AR were 24 days in Q1. Free cash flow in Q1 was $132 million, implying free cash flow margin of 26%, higher than our expectations, largely due to better-than-expected bookings familiarity. We saw a larger-than-expected proportion of Q1 bookings in the first two months of the quarter. And since our payment terms are typically 30 to 45 days, more of the bookings were billed and collected in Q1, than expected. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.571 billion, up from $1.437 billion in '23. Under the share repurchase program, authorized by our Board of Directors at the end of August, we began repurchasing shares in Q1, through a 10b5-1 plan. Given the timing of the authorization, we were in the market repurchasing shares for only a portion of Q1. Moving on to Q2. Our guidance for Q2 '24 is as follows: ACV billings of $295 million to $305 million; revenue of $545 million to $555 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 85% to 86%; non-GAAP operating margin of 14% to 16%; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 297 million shares. The updated guidance for full year fiscal year 2024 is as follows: ACV billings of $1.08 billion to $1.1 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint of the range; revenue of $2.095 billion to $2.125 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 85%; non-GAAP operating margin of 11.5% to 12.5%; free cash flow of $340 million to $360 million, representing free cash flow margin of 16.6% at the midpoint of the range. This updated fiscal year '24 guidance is higher than our previously provided fiscal year '24 guidance, across all metrics. I will now provide some additional commentary regarding our fiscal year '24 guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions, despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles. Our fiscal year '24 new and expansion ACV performance outlook assumes some impact from these macro dynamics. Second, the guidance assumes that our renewals business will continue to perform well. And a reminder that while our available to renew, or ATR pool, continues to grow year-over-year, it is growing at a slower pace in fiscal year '24, but is expected to reaccelerate in fiscal year '25, based on our current view. Third, the full year guidance assumes that average contract duration would be flat to slightly lower, compared to fiscal year '23, as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings. A reminder that the full year ACV billing is not the sum of the ACV billings of the four quarters, due to contracts with durations less than one year. We expect full year ACV billings to be about 5% to 6% lower than the sum of the four quarters ACV billings. Finally, a few thoughts on seasonality for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on our current view, we expect the trend in top line metrics in Q3 relative to Q2, to be more or less similar to what we saw in fiscal year '23. A reminder that operating expenses tend to be slightly higher in Q3 versus Q2, all else being equal, as Q3 includes the full impact of calendar year resets to payroll taxes. In closing, we are pleased with our Q1 results exceeding guidance and to raise our top line and bottom line guidance for the full fiscal year. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Hi Matt, thank you for the question. So, if we think about Q1, I'll talk about Q1 performance versus maybe what you were alluding to, but then also maybe talk a little bit about the full year, Matt, to your point on just trends and so on. So in Q1, specifically, our overall sort of top line performance or outperformance really was driven by a combination of good execution across our new and expansion business. And within that, we talked specifically about our U.S. federal business, which had a really significant and nice year-over-year growth in new and expansion ACV bookings. So that was certainly something that we benefited from in Q1. Now for the full year, Matt, we've talked about, I think, some puts and takes that we are factoring into our outlook. One is that we are expecting some improvement in our new and expansion ACV performance, compared to fiscal year '23. We've talked about -- Rajiv just touched upon like some things that we're factoring in, in terms of benefits, whether it be a little benefit from our -- from what's happening in the competitive environment, some benefits from the fairly new Cisco partnership and so on. So we have some things that we're optimistic and excited about. At the same time, as you started your question, Matt, there is also uncertainty in the macro, which just means that it's harder for us to sit here and say exactly how the rest of the year is going to play out. So those are some of the things we've factored into our new and expansion performance for the year. I will say, I think as you pointed out, right, renewals tends to be much more predictable portion of the business, just given our GRR, as you said before, is in the 90-plus percent range, and we know when those renewals are coming up for the next transaction. And so that part continues to be predictable and continues to perform well. And so hopefully, that gives you a sense of revenue and expansion. Yes. So, I think a couple of points that I would make. Again, I'll start with sort of the Q1 and maybe the Q2 guide, Matt, and then talk more broadly on gross margin. So for Q1, we attributed our gross margin outperformance, revenue coming in slightly higher, of course, because we beat on revenue. But we also had a mix of factors that led to COGS coming in lower. Now, there were a few things in there, Matt. I think that I would call out as one singular factor but a mix of things, some of which we believe will sustain and which is why we were happy to take up our full year gross margin number, last quarter when we gave you the first guide, we said approximately 84%, and we're happy to take it up to approximately 85%. So I would say it's just a mix of good execution on a few different funds, and a reminder that our COGS has a good portion of it is our support teams like for our customer support folks are in there, we have services costs in there. And so across a few different dimensions, we were happy to see gross margin do better and take some of that across to the full year guide as well. Hi George, thank you for the question. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did begin repurchasing shares in Q1, under the authorization of -- that we had from our -- that was approved by our Board in August. And we did that through a 10b5-1 program that we've set up. Due to the timing of the authorization, we were only in the market for a portion of Q1. And you'll see in the financial tables that we put out with the release that we spent about $17.5 million, repurchasing shares, during that time. So for a portion of Q1, we spent $17.5 million. And the timing and amount of the future repurchases will continue to depend on a variety of factors, George, including stock prices, just conditions of the market and so on. And so I won't get too specific in terms of outlook, but I wanted to give you at least a bit of color on what we did in Q1, acknowledging it was only for a portion of the quarter. Yes, happy to give you some color on that. So we used some backlog in Q1, as is seasonally typical for Q1 and expect some backlog to be consumed over the course of this fiscal year, as we talked about before. But as is to be expected in an environment like this, where things remain fairly uncertain from a macro perspective, the range of possible outcomes is wider than usual. And as we continue to grow, the absolute dollar number of backlog would also increase over time. So, a few different factors there. But yes, I think in Q1, we used some backlog as is typical for Q1, and we expect to use some backlog over the course of the year as well. Yes. So on the linearity, Mike, what we mean there is we have some expectations of how much bookings comes in, in month 1, month 2, month 3. And the reason that's important for free cash flow, right, is because we invoice soon after we get the booking, and we have 30- to 45-day invoice payment terms. And so, what we saw in Q1 is that compared to our expectations going in -- so we saw a larger proportion of those bookings come in month 1 and month 2. And you're right, there's an outperformance in fed as well, and of course, fed had their year-end, the U.S. federal government has their fiscal year end in September. So that was likely a factor in that. And so what that meant was that given, again, we invoiced right after we get the bookings, we were -- we collected more cash from bookings in Q1 than we had previously expected, which was a significant driver of the free cash flow performance in Q1. Yes. So, a few points on Q2 OpEx related to Q1, Mike. The first one is, as we talked about when we laid out sort of our initial full year guide on the last call, we talked about the fact that we plan to continue to invest to drive growth, while continuing to improve the margin profile. And that's the approach that we've taken for this year, and you saw some of that in the last call, but also we touched on this sort of idea at Investor Day as well. And so in general, we've started those investments. And as you can imagine, it takes -- we're continuing to hire. And so as you can imagine, that sort of leads to sort of an increase in Q2 as more of the folks come on board. The other piece is this is only for one month of Q2. But in the calendar year resets, and I alluded to this in my script as well, like payroll taxes and all that reset for calendar year '24, which means that we have one month of that in January. That also has an effect on the Q2 OpEx. That all said, of course, we were pleased, as you pointed out, to be able to raise both of our top line and bottom line guidance for the full year. Thank you, Erik. I'll take the first one. Yes. And then Rajiv you can take maybe the GPT-in-a-Box question. So on sales cycles, what I said in my script, Erik, was that we're seeing some increased elongation, right, in -- a modest increase in average sales cycles on a year-over-year basis. I'm comparing Q1 to Q1, it has gotten longer in Q1. But if you look at average sales cycle in Q1, it was more or less the same as the last few quarters. So it's not like it's continued to lengthen early quarter-over-quarter, but year-over-year, it remains elevated. And this -- again, it's hard to sort of focus what's going to -- exactly is going to happen here, given all the uncertainties we've talked about, but that's what we saw in Q1. If I can add to that, Ben. I think you had a question on ACV ramp. And just to clarify, our contracts, typically, they're sort of evenly spread up. There isn't a ramp within the year. So like this transaction and typically most of our transactions, it would be a total TCV amount divided by the contract duration. That's how we calculate the ACV of any given transaction. Hi Wamsi, thanks for the question. So a few things I would say. One, on the Q1 to Q2 dynamic. We talked about Q1, of course, came in at a bit higher than our expectations, given the beat across revenue and ACV billings, Wamsi. So I think relative to that Q2, I think, to your point, still going to look based on our guidance, right, higher than Q1 as we seasonally see. So, I wouldn't read too much into that dynamic. And then, the reason we sort of gave the color on Q3 is to just note what we're seeing right now, based on pipeline and all the various factors we've talked about already, as it relates to things that are driving the top line. And I'll just remind folks, again, as we said in the prepared remarks as well that the full year ACV billings is at about a 5% or 6% discount with some of the four quarters given the annualization that we do each quarter for contracts less than one year. So overall, I'd say, Wamsi, I think I wouldn't read too much into the seasonality point, other than we're seeing -- this is what we're seeing in our pipeline. I wanted to give folks an update on that. And overall, we're happy to be able to raise our '24 ACV billings guidance, right, following a solid first quarter, but we've also factored in some caution overall regarding how the rest of the year plays out given some of this macro uncertainity. Yes, great question, Wamsi. So two thoughts. So one on Q1, we, of course, don't guide to quarterly free cash flow. So I'm not able to sort of give you specifically how much we overachieved our own expectations for Q1 free cash flow, but we did overachieve it. And I will say that, in addition to the billings number coming higher, right, given we had a beat on ACV billings as well for Q1. So that helped, but the linearity was a significant factor in Q1, okay? So that did have a significant impact on the outperformance for free cash flow in Q1. And I think the second part of your question is around the full year free cash flow guidance. And what I'd say there is that in addition to benefiting from the raised top line guide, and of course, as you know, billings has a very high correlation with free cash flow, right? So the fact that we were able to raise our full year billings number. So that's one factor. But we're also expecting to see some benefit from somewhat better working capital management within the year than previously expected, including from improved linearity. So that is helping us to raise the full year free cash flow guide as well. Thanks everyone."
