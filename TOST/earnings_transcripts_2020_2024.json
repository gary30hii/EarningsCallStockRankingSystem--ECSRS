I'm Edward Parker, (ph) Investor Relations. Today, our CEO, Chris Comparato; and CFO, Elena Gomez will join us and discuss our fourth quarter and full year results.

Toast delivered a strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021, as restaurants need for an all-in-one platform to help them thrive has only become more important. Before I jump into our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, I want to provide you with an overview of our business. 02:06 First, let me remind you about our big ambitions. We have an amazing opportunity to empower the restaurant community around the world to delight their guests, do what they love and thrive. That is our mission. Toast provides restaurants with an all-in-one digital technology platform that combines point of sale, front of house, back of house and guest facing technology integrated with financial technology and payments all built with the restaurant success in mind. 02:38 Toast works for all restaurants regardless of size, concept or cuisine from independent cafes to enterprise brands. We serve every stakeholder from the guest to the GM or owner to the waitstaff, to the chef, suppliers and the entire ecosystem. This past year was transformational for Toast, as we executed on our plan and became a publicly traded company. 03:06 Our initial public offering in September was a big milestone for our company and our customer community and the momentum continued through the end of the year, resulting in a very strong Q4. Our community grew rapidly as we added more restaurants to our platform and as the percentage of live customers on our platform using four or more modules continued to increase. This is a result of our strong focus on execution. 03:32 Let me share a few financial highlights. During the quarter, revenue increased 111% year-over-year to $512 million and annualized recurring run rate or ARR increased 74% year-over-year to $568 million. This was driven by continued strength in gross payment volume or GPV, the addition of new locations to our platform as we capture market share and continued customer adoption of our growing portfolio of products. 04:08 The industry continues to rebound from the impact of COVID-19 and GPV on our platform increased to $17 billion in Q4, a 125% increase year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately 57,000 live locations on our platform, up from approximately 40,000 locations in Q4 of 2020, representing a 41% increase year-over-year. 04:38 As our customer community grew, we also saw accelerated adoption of our platform as a percentage of customers using four or more core modules beyond point of sale and payments increased from 48% in Q4 of 2020 to 59% in Q4 of 2021. As a result, our software-as-a-service ARPU increased year-over-year by 30% from Q4 of 2020. Finally, as customers rely on Toast to run their businesses, our net retention continues to be strong and was 135% for 2021 as Elena will discuss in a few minutes. 05:21 Now I'd like to take a moment and provide some context on the industry as a whole. Throughout 2021, the operating environment remains challenging for restaurant operators as they face the dual challenges of shifting workforce dynamics in a sustained labor shortage alongside rising input prices due to supply chain disruption and accompanying inflation. 05:48 As you can imagine, it is challenging to run a restaurant in this environment and we are committed now more than ever to being the true partner to the restaurant industry just as we've been since the onset of the pandemic and for the last 10 years. With this backdrop, what we have learned in our history serving the industry is that restaurant operators are incredibly resilient. 06:15 Even before COVID-19, the industry was transforming, dining itself was changing from mobile order and pay at the table to delivery and online ordering. The pandemic accelerated these changes. When looking at the performance of restaurants on the Toast platform, we have been impressed by their ability to take full advantage of the platform's capabilities to reinvent their business and navigate the impact of COVID-19. Later this month, we will publish the first addition of our quarterly restaurant trends report, which gives visibility into the overall state of the restaurant industry through sales data from restaurants on the Toast platform. 06:57 Let me share a few highlights today. As the industry rebounded from the impact of COVID-19 in 2021, restaurant sales as measured by same store GMV or gross merchandise volume on the Toast platform increased by 41% year-over-year from 2020 to 2021. Overall, same-store sales of Toast customers continue to exceed pre-COVID levels as evidenced by GMV per location, increasing nearly 6% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2021. 07:35 These are just a few strong signs that the restaurant industry, while continually battle tested is resilient. We will continue to lobby congress to replenish the Restaurant Revitalization Funds, but we are also glad to see Toast adoption contributing to restaurant success and helping restaurants navigate through this difficult time. 08:02 To better support our customers in the restaurant industry at large, as they re-imagine their businesses, we hosted thousands of restaurant operators for a virtual addition of Spark, our restaurant innovation event where we previewed the newest Toast technology. During the course of the day, we unveiled an entire suite of new products designed to help restaurants take control of their finances, navigate the labor shortage, regain control of third-party delivery and better manage their P&Ls. This -- the response from our customer community was overwhelmingly positive. 08:37 So let me share two examples. As many of you know, there are substantial demand for faster access to capital in the restaurant industry, as both their point of sale and payments processor for restaurants we have unprecedented visibility into the health of their business. Nearly two years ago, we introduced Toast Capital, which allows restaurants to borrow money and pay that money back as a percentage of daily sales. Restaurants absolutely love this product as they pay back more on busy days and less on slow days. 09:12 At Spark, we introduced a new longer duration loan product, and the demand for this new product has been robust. During calendar year 2021, we originated over $100 million in Toast -- in total Toast Capital loans. A second highlight from Spark was the introduction of an enhanced suite of products designed to help restaurants maintain control of takeout and delivery. With Orders Hub, Toast has helped more than 20,000 restaurants manage both takeout and delivery orders from first-party Toast ordering channels and third-party providers. 09:54 Toast is the first restaurant technology platform to deliver direct integrations with the five largest third-party delivery brands, DoorDash, Caviar, Grubhub, Postmates, and Uber Eats. And our performance center provides unique visibility into the profitability of each channel when used together this new suite of products enables our customer community to truly take control of their takeout and delivery business. We're excited about how our customers are using these new products announced at Spark and how they further our position as the leading all in one platform for restaurants. 10:33 Throughout the quarter, we experienced robust demand in the market for the Toast platform. In 2021, we added around 17,000 new restaurant locations on the platform. Throughout Q4, we saw incredible demand across all segments, from single location SMB restaurants to regional mid-market and large enterprise brands. This quarter, we signed a new deal with Sinelli Concepts, the holding company for multiple national restaurant and retail brands, including Which Wich Superior Sandwiches, Pachinko, Gelato Cafe, Birdguesa Tenders & Tots, SuperNova and Earth Burger. 11:15 Sinelli Concepts is looking to improve efficiency by moving its business to a digital platform. It will be rolling out Toast to 250 locations nationwide for point of sale, kitchen display systems and kiosks. We also signed a new deal with Cohn Restaurant Group, which is rolling out Toast for front of house with Toast Go and order and pay at the table and back of house with our kitchen display system. Cohn Restaurant Group will use Toast at 35 locations both in California and Hawaii and will continue its efforts in converting its entire technology stack to a best-in-class cloud-based platform. 11:55 Pavement Coffeehouse, an independent and locally-owned coffee house with eight shops in Boston and Cambridge, purchased Toast POS and payroll in Q4. Toast is replacing multiple vendors for loyalty, payroll, gift cards and online order. By consolidating on Toast, customers like Pavement Coffeehouse can see lower total cost and experience the benefits of an integrated platform, common UI, shared data and a single partner -- a single partner relationship to manage. In addition to the exciting growth across our customer community, we also welcomed a new Board member to our Board of Directors in Q4. 12:42 Hilarie Koplow-McAdams joined the Toast Board of Directors on November 30. If you're not familiar with Hilarie, she has spent more than three decades in operating leadership roles devoted to accelerating high growth software companies through sales, business development, customer success and more. Currently, she is a venture partner with New Enterprise Associates, NEA, a venture capital firm. Prior to NEA, Hilarie served as the President of New Relic, President of Global Sales at Salesforce and also held executive roles at Intuit Inc. and Oracle Corporation. We are really excited about having Hilarie on our Board. Welcome to the team, Hilarie. 13:28 Before I wrap up and pass the call to Elena, I thought it would also be helpful to tee up our primary focus areas that we look forward to updating you on in 2022. The first is our focus on being the trusted platform of choice for the restaurant industry. There are approximately 860,000 restaurant locations across the U.S. and we see an enormous opportunity ahead within this large addressable market. 13:59 As evidenced by our growth in Q4, there is tremendous demand for the Toast platform as restaurant operators navigate the new normal. Toast is the all-in-one technology platform built exclusively for restaurants by people who understand their specific needs. Second, our industry has been through a massive transition during the past two years. To help our customer community navigate this transition, we will continue to invest in their success for commitment to customer success and support. 14:35 Third, given our momentum in mid-market and enterprise, we are confident in our ability to serve restaurants of all types and sizes. I shared earlier just a few examples of mid-market and enterprise wins this past quarter, and we will continue to invest in our capability here. Finally, we have a substantial opportunity to provide our platform to international locations. As discussed earlier, we estimate our total addressable market at least doubles the U.S. opportunity if we look globally. In late 2021, we started our initial investment to cede our international expansion. 15:19 With that. I will close by saying, I am honored and humbled to be part of supporting the restaurant industry through this past year. I'm also equally excited about 2022. Restaurants are resilient, they make up the social fabric of our community and we believe our commitment to aligning our success with restaurant success will lead to a stronger and exciting future ahead. I'd like to thank our customers, our partners and our Toast employees for their hard work and support in 2021. The financial results we're sharing today wouldn't be possible without your confidence in our platform, commitment to the industry, and unwavering support for our vision. 16:08 Now I'd like to hand it over to our CFO, Elena Gomez.\nElena Gomez: 16:11 Thanks, Chris. And I just want to echo the -- thank you to our employees and to our customers. 2021 has been an unforgettable year. And I appreciate your commitment and dedication to our company. So I'm going to remind you, as I get into results, that we will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Refer to today's press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial performance and additional disclosures regarding these measures. 16:43 As Chris mentioned, we had a strong Q4 to exit 2021 and to cap off the year we became a public company. With continued momentum in Q4, we outperformed all key metrics, which is testament to the strong execution of our collective team. We are proud of the new locations we added to our platform through 2021, which reflect the value of our all-in-one digital platform. 17:07 In Q4, we generated revenue of $512 million, up 111% year-over-year and $1,705 million for the full year 2021, a 107% increase year-over-year. We closed the year at $568 million in ARR, up 74% year-over-year. We continue to believe ARR is our North Star metric. As Chris said, we ended the year with approximately 57,000 live locations on our platform compared to 40,000 in Q4 2020, representing a 41% year-over-year growth. 17:44 In addition, we're also proud to report that our net retention rate also referred to as NRR, which we reported in our S1 to be greater than 110% for the last five years was 135% in 2021. NRR comprises both SaaS and fintech solutions revenue, both of which had a retention rate above 110%. SaaS NRR was strong to the expansion of locations from our existing customers as well as customers adding more products. 18:12 From a fintech perspective, we have shared with you that in 2021, we've benefited from higher debit and credit mix as well as higher card not present volume. In 2022, we anticipate these trends will have largely stabilized and as such we expect NRR going forward to trend closer to 110% as we shared in the S1. 18:32 Our subscription services revenue grew 86% year-over-year to $54 million in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase in customers adopting more of our SaaS products. As of the end of 2021, 59% of our Toast locations use four or more core products on top of our integrated POS and payment solution as compared to 48% a year ago. 18:56 Our financial technology solutions revenue grew 117% year-over-year to $421 million in the fourth quarter driven by GPV of $17 billion, which had an increase of 124% year-over-year. GPV is driven by transactions processed on our platform. Since early 2021, annualized GPV per process location continues to remain strong at an average of $1.3 million per location. 19:23 As a reminder, our GPV per location dropped by 45% at the onset of COVID but has steadily returned to above pre-COVID levels. As we have stated before, there's quarterly seasonality with our financial technology solutions revenue as restaurants on average generally performed better in the second and third quarters. Given that we continue to anticipate seasonal fluctuations in the annualized GPV per location from quarter-to-quarter. However, on an annualized basis, our GPV per location is consistent and remains durable. 19:54 For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP gross profit, which excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense that was a mouthful, (ph) came in at $82 million, up 54% year-over-year. In addition to the growth in our customer base, this growth was driven by higher revenue per location, which in turn has been driven by continued growth in average revenue per unit known as ARPU for both SaaS and financial technology solutions. We are pleased with our ARPU performance as a driver to non-GAAP gross profit and we believe that such performance can be sustainable. 20:27 Drilling down into our ARPU performance, we've seen our SaaS ARPU increase as a result of continued adoption of our platform by both new and existing customers. We continue to invest in our technology and remain highly focused on driving innovation across our product portfolio. Our fintech solutions ARPU is up more than 50% from Q4 2019 or pre-COVID levels, primarily as a result of GPV per location and card not present volume. 20:55 As a reminder, two factors that influence fintech solutions ARPU are the mix of card not present volume and the debit credit mix. Consumers continue to utilize digital channels and as such, we believe the card not present volumes will remain elevated. The debit credit mix has returned to pre-COVID levels. 21:14 Turning to hardware cost of revenue as shared in the last earnings call, our freight costs remain elevated due to supply chain dynamics. We continue to believe they will remain elevated through the near term. Despite increased hardware cost, however, we remain confident in our ability to deliver hardware for our customers. 21:32 Before I turn to operating expenses, I want to remind you that we use customer acquisition cost and payback metrics to measure the performance of our business and guide our investment decisions. We are proud to share that our payback period for the full year 2021 was approximately 12 months. Our healthy unit economics and strong payback periods continue to make us feel confident in our ability to invest for durable growth. 21:55 Now let's turn to our operating expenses, which I will review on a non-GAAP basis. In Q4, we continue to invest in sales and marketing and research and development to capture our TAM and build out our platform. Additionally, general and administrative cost increased as a result of operating as a public company. This includes cost from the adoption of the new credit loss -- of the new credit losses accounting standard in Q4 and increased investment to support the growth of our business. As a result of these investments, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was negative $45 million for Q4 and negative $42 million for the full year 2021. 22:33 Now let me turn to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $469 million to $499 million, which represents 72% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative $65 million to negative $55 million. For the full year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2,349 million to $2,409 million, which represents 48% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative $240 million to negative $200 million. 23:08 As you can see, we are deliberately investing to drive long-term growth. The stakes have never been higher for restaurants. The restaurant industry is going through massive change driven by undeniable trends in the world across labor, supply chain and guest adoption of technology. Our investments in 2022 are reflective of this opportunity we have ahead of us. With only approximately 7% market share here in the United States, we continue to believe we are in the early innings of this opportunity. As such, we will continue to invest in research and development as well as in sales and marketing to cost effectively capture our market share. 23:48 Our primary focus is on being the trusted platform of choice for the restaurant industry. Our business is performing well and there is enormous demand for the Toast platform as restaurants need to streamline their operations, increase revenue and retain great employees. Our ambition continues to be to serve restaurants all around the world. And with that we will be making foundational investments in 2022 to drive growth internationally. We look forward to updating you on this multi-year journey in future quarters. 24:18 In closing, our strong 2021 performance demonstrates our success in capturing market share. We are built to serve large -- built to serve a large and growing addressable market and we've shown we can execute at scale with healthy unit economics. We continue to believe we are uniquely positioned to drive durable growth for ourselves and for the restaurants using our platform. 24:40 Now I'd like to turn the call back to the moderator for our Q&A session.\nOperator:\nA -Unidentified Company Representative: 24:46 All right. Thank you very much, Chris and Elena. Let's go ahead and start our Q&A session. Please use the raise the hand function in Zoom to ask your question. And our first question comes from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Josh, please go ahead.\nJosh Baer: 25:04 Great. Thank you for the question. So I wanted to get some context on the pace of location additions in '22. If you could provide any insight into how you're thinking about that and maybe tying into the ramp of sales reps and capacity and where are you today or in '22 versus 2019 from that perspective?\nElena Gomez: 25:29 Yeah, I can start. At the highest level without me guiding for locations, we've intentionally invested, Josh, in adding to our sales force. And we've often said that TAM is our number one priority and then ARPU will follow. We're actually balancing both. But we're pretty excited about the locations we added on our platform in 2021. And we see no reason why we wouldn't continue to have success, adding locations, frankly, very efficiently to with the 12 month payback period that we experienced in 2021. We feel confident to make this investment and we'll continue to see growth on our platform.\nJosh Baer: 26:11 Great. And related as far as location additions that you've been seeing, any way to break down where you are having the most success or where you are strategically focused as far as competitive wins, new geographies in the U.S. that are under penetrated. And if it is competitive, is it from legacy vendors or are you going after cloud replacements? And then I guess lastly, new restaurant formations and if that's a strategic priority just winning an outsized share of the new restaurant formations? Thank you.\nChris Comparato: 26:50 I can jump in.\nElena Gomez: 26:52 Yeah. I can -- yeah. Go ahead.\nChris Comparato: 26:51 Either way. Josh, we've seen broad momentum across multiple sectors of our business in multiple geos, I wouldn't say there's any one geo or sector that has grown faster. We're seeing really good traction in SMB, really good momentum in mid-market and enterprise, as I referenced with those examples. And we have teams across the U.S. embedded in local communities going after their market. So we feel good about our position. I'd say, we believe that we have the capability to serve restaurants of different types, formats and sizes than any of our competition. So we feel good about our position, and we're seeing steady demand on that front.\nUnidentified Company Representative: 27:45 Thanks, Josh. Let's go to Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan, please.\nTien-Tsin Huang: 27:49 Hey. Thanks so much. Good to see all of you all here today. Thanks for the time. Just to hear you loud and clear on the investing, I think it makes lot of sense, time is now to do it. So with the investments across developing new products, I know you're working really hard to build new products, and of course, customer acquisition. Just trying to better understand how you're prioritizing those two isn't changed versus maybe 90 days ago and is your LTV to CAC thinking still the same versus 90 days ago? Just trying to better understand the OpEx, given the wider EBITDA loss for the year.\nElena Gomez: 28:24 Yeah. No. It's a -- took (ph) a question. Let me just start by saying we have a ton of confidence and conviction about our opportunity and that has not changed at all, actually. In fact, I would say after our performance in 2021, we have even more conviction. And so our prioritization has always been, let's focus on capturing the opportunity ahead with the TAM. And we know we're in the early innings, as you know. And we also have seen some data points, proof points. Demand continues to be strong and customers engaging on our platform, whether that's NRR, as you saw that we talked about or just consistent addition of locations to our platform. 29:04 And so we're going to remain very disciplined and have a lot of rigor about our investments and point investments to things that will drive growth. And then, of course, back to your timing point, the pandemic really amplified the need that customers have for technology and to make their operations more efficient. And we believe when you put all that data together, we're well positioned to capture that opportunity. So it's really important that we're intentional about this investment. I would tell you, it doesn't mean we're not thinking about profitability, so I don't want you to take that from this at all. In fact, in our executive alignment -- in our comp plans, we've aligned on the fact that we do, at the right time need to drive operating leverage, right? We're going to drive and orient to durable growth today. But of course, over time, we will drive operating leverage.\nTien-Tsin Huang: 29:59 Yeah. That makes great sense. If you don't mind, just a quick follow-up. Just thinking about the first quarter, Elena. Just any puts and takes there with revenue. And I know seasonality is always something to think about. I know we're coming out of it hopefully. And I don't know if there's anything to call out with GMV or locations, return or growth in the first quarter versus the fourth? Thank you.\nElena Gomez: 30:19 Yeah. That's a great question. So I would just point to a couple of things. As a reminder, last year at this time, vaccines were coming back and people were coming back, right. So just don't forget that as you guys. I know a lot of you look at sequential moves. So pay attention to that because we had a big surge last year. We didn't expect that to repeat this year, right, because we've now been unfortunately used to this kind of quasi environment, we're operating in. But even without that dynamic from last year, there's always seasonality in our payments, as you know. So Q1 tends to be a quarter where the seasonality is such that we have lower GPV than, say, Q2 and Q3. So that was not much -- that's not what -- that did not surprise us. 31:05 I would tell you we had a little bit of Omicron in the early part -- late days of December and early part of January, but we believe that's transitory and frankly behind us at this point. The other thing I'll point to that you may not see in the guidance is we anticipate SaaS will continue to increase. So you will see that sequential increase Q4 to Q1. So that's -- I hope that gives you enough color to kind of give you the backdrop for Q1.\nTien-Tsin Huang: 31:31 It does. Thank you.\nElena Gomez: 31:32 Great.\nUnidentified Company Representative: 31:35 Thanks very much. Let's go to Josh Beck at KeyBanc. Josh?\nJosh Beck: 31:43 Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to maybe start with a higher-level question. I think one that is surfacing a lot is really what's the impact of a full reopening, hopefully, as we progress through the year. There's obviously puts and takes against your model. So just kind of curious how you're trying to embed that into the outlook. And what are some of the more important factors we should be keying in on there?\nChris Comparato: 32:16 Yeah, I mean, I could jump in at a high level and Elena, feel free to support it. But I mean, listen, we're excited about 2022. We're seeing really strong demand. We're executing well. So our mindset is sort of a growth oriented mindset to go after locations in the TAM and support the restaurant community as it starts to recover. If you zoom out, this is an industry that's largely been underserved by great technology. And in the past two years, they've gone from crisis to survival to recovery and now to a time frame that I think it's time to thrive. 32:57 So personally, as a team and as a management team and a company and a Board, we're excited about 2022 because we think it's going to be a little bit of a renaissance coming back to the restaurant industry. Though it's been difficult for the past two years, we're certainly excited about what lies ahead and some of the momentum that we may see across the entire business.\nElena Gomez: 33:23 Yeah. I mean, I think in our guidance, as we entered into the year, there's a few trends that really, really, we pay attention to that you guys are familiar with. Card not present is one of those, debit and credit mix, all those impact our fintech ARPU. So for card not present, I said in my script, we do believe consumer behavior has largely changed. I think all of us are probably using online ordering more than we did in the past. And so we believe some of that behavior is going to persist. And we -- therefore, we believe CNP will remain somewhat elevated. Debit and credit mix has largely come back to pre-COVID levels, so we factored that into our thinking. 34:06 And then I would just call out on the COGS side, as I mentioned in the script, we have elevated freight costs, and we believe that's going to persist for the near term. We're keeping an eye on it, of course. But that's -- those are the things that come to mind when you ask a little bit about what do we think about recovery. I think we've seen Omicron come and go, which is great. I think it shows restaurants are resilient. And so we're considering that in our calculus as well.\nJosh Beck: 34:36 Very helpful. Just a follow-up. The payback period I believe you said was 12 month, which is well below the pre-COVID level, so I imagine there's perhaps some positive surprise there. As you think about the future, what range are you comfortable that trending towards maybe over what time? Just curious if you could give us any thoughts on how we should be thinking about the payback period from here?\nElena Gomez: 35:08 Yeah. No, I mean, we're proud of our payback. I wouldn't say it was a surprise. I think my finance team would get really mad at me, if we said it was a surprise because actually it wasn't a surprise, like I think we are so focused on unit economics and payback periods. But we did benefit from -- in the first part of the year, we had -- if I say the puts and takes in the first part of the year, we had higher card not present and just higher take rates, obviously, but then you counter that with freight costs being elevated, so all those puts and takes really come into play there. But as I think about the future, as we said in our S1, as long as our payback period is in the mid-teens, I'm happy with that. Obviously, we're always going to do better. We're always going to try to make our operation more efficient, but I'm happy with that. So I would think about that as more of a longer-term trend than what we had in 2021.\nJosh Beck: 36:10 Excellent. Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: 36:13 Great. Thanks, Josh. Why don't we go to Brent Bracelin at Piper Sandler? Brent, you there?\nBrent Bracelin: 36:21 Guys, good afternoon. Thanks for letting me on here. Two questions, if I could. Maybe Chris, we'll start with you. I'd love to hear early feedback on the Toast restaurant card, pay card, pay now features. What have you learned so far? I know we're really early but can be a pretty exciting and incremental lever for you over time. So I'd love to hear any sort of early feedback there on those cards. And then one quick follow-up for Elena. I can't hear you.\nChris Comparato: 36:51 Sorry about that. Yeah, Brent. Good question. I think it's still early. I mean, we launched them in November. It's been a couple of months, not even a full quarter. But we remain really excited. We're putting a lot of investment behind those teams to make sure that those cards have a good product market fit. Listen, we believe in faster payments to restaurants. We believe in faster early wage access for employees. We believe those two fundamental dynamics help the restaurant industry succeed and for each restaurant operator to have better control of their financials. So they make a ton of sense but it's early days. We're excited about the products, and we're continuing to test and iterate and gain customer feedback and listen to our customer base about what we need to tweak to make them better and better. So stay tuned.\nBrent Bracelin: 37:42 Perfect. And then, Elena, I saved a tough one for you. If I go back and look at quarterly seasonality, we only have post-COVID quarterly seasonality. And so in some regards, we have a big sequential drop in Q2 in one year. Another year, we have a big sequential rise in Q2. I'm just -- as we kind of think about going forward towards a normal environment, do you have any general sense for us how we should think about like quarter-to-quarter seasonality of the business, given it's been so dynamic in the last couple of years?\nElena Gomez: 38:17 Yeah. No, Brent, that's a really good question. I had to go back and myself for the reason you described than it was before my time. But I think the thing we'll call out is Q2 and Q3 summer months tend to be our high GPV per location quarters. Q1 tends to be the lower quarter, and same with Q4 with the holidays and whatnot. So warm weather gets people out, and that's why you see a lot of increase in our GPV going in Q2 and Q3. So you should expect that more, hopefully, more normal this year going into 2022. And that's how we think about it, too. That's how we planned.\nBrent Bracelin: 38:57 Perfect. Helpful color there and look forward to seeing it.\nUnidentified Company Representative: 39:03 Thanks, Brent. Next question, let's go to Mayank Tandon from Needham.\nMayank Tandon: 39:10 Thank you. Chris, you mentioned the investments in international and enterprise. Could you talk about what are the unique challenges you expect to face as you penetrate these opportunities? In other words, what are the keys to success based on your experience so far with Toast?\nChris Comparato: 39:28 Sure. Now, let's start with enterprise. So we've been in the enterprise space for years and collaborating with our largest customers, it's really making sure that, number one, the platform is as scalable and reliable as possible to support their needs on expansion. So that includes a lot of above-store reporting, multi-level analysis of their business. So it just needs -- we need to make sure that the platform is a core centerpiece of their architecture as they scale their businesses. So that's number one. Number two, it's important to make sure that we've got strong APIs. As I mentioned back in the IPO, we've got 150-plus technology partners that stitch into our platform on a daily basis. And large enterprises require more complexity around architecture, so they love the fact that we've got a strong partner ecosystem and strong APIs that go along with it. 40:26 I'd say the third dimension is making sure that the enterprise has strong reporting. So just the data elements and the data sharing capabilities of the platform are critically important. So we continue to invest in those pieces of the road map, so that the enterprises have the right analytics and insights that they need to properly run their business. But we're confident about our position in the mid-market and enterprise space. And as I referenced, the win with Sinelli, it allows us to really accomplish enterprises that are different. They could be an FSR, it could be a QSR, but the strength of the platform to support multiple segments of the restaurant industry is pretty strong. 41:11 On international, it's going to be early days. I mean, this is more about building the proper foundation to go-to-market in key markets with the product market fit that helps every restaurant be successful in the early days of those international markets. So I'm going to temper expectations that it's going to be a foundational year and a building year for international as we put the team in place, the products in place and our execution in place to make sure that customers have a fantastic experience. And Elena, you may want to add to that. But it's just a reminder that international is going to be the early days. So in terms of location count and driving ARR, it's going to be lower than perhaps, obviously, what we've seen in the U.S. for years.\nElena Gomez: 42:03 Yeah, I think the only thing I would add is just making sure that we get the product localized for -- if there's any languages that we need to consider, of course, that's important and making sure that we invest in that over the long term but also being measured about our investment and just making sure we learn in 2022 is really important to us.\nMayank Tandon: 42:23 And then as a quick follow-up, just given the war for talent, are you able to hire the sales people and the engineers and other key people to be able to hit those demand targets that you've set for yourself?\nChris Comparato: 42:35 Yeah. No, I mean, big shout-out to our people team and our talent acquisition team. They've stayed on goal. So when we look at 2021 and the momentum going into 2022, that team's done a fantastic job to find the best talent in key markets and help us scale and execute. So yeah, we've been able to keep pace.\nMayank Tandon: 42:56 Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: 43:00 Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Sheldon at William Blair. Stephen, please go ahead.\nStephen Sheldon: 43:05 Hey. Thanks. Really nice job on top line results and great to hear that you're starting to focus more on the international opportunity. Wondering, if you could just talk some about the trends you're seeing when you first win new customers. Are -- what trends are you seeing in terms of the size of initial packages? And what are some of the main products that newer customers are frequently, I guess, including when they're first signing up for Toast?\nElena Gomez: 43:30 Yeah, I mean, I can tell you, Stephen, so when we looked a couple of years ago, our initial -- our customers was at -- would typically add about two products. That's well over four now and we talked about 50% of our customers more than four products. The typical products are online ordering, Toast Co. devices, gift cards, those are all really, loyalty, all really popular products. And also with our new customers, a lot of them are adopting the payroll product. We see the majority of our new customers adopting the payroll product. So we're excited about that. And of course, there's an opportunity to sell that to our existing installed base as well.\nStephen Sheldon: 44:17 Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, just when I think about the -- as we think about the sales capacity investments, I guess, where are you focusing incremental sales resources at this time? Has there been any shift towards maybe focusing more on gaining market share in existing markets versus expanding into new markets? I mean, would just love an update on what you're seeing in terms of sales efficiency, especially some of the markets where you've been operating maybe the longest.\nChris Comparato: 44:44 Yeah. That's a good question. I mean, it's a little bit of both, making sure that we're broadening our presence in newer markets and adding reps into those markets. Again, we're constantly testing and iterating how many reps it takes to accomplish our TAM goals within a market. So I'd say on one front, it's, again, broadening that base of reps in new markets. But then similar to markets like New England, we continue to put reps into New England to go after deeper sections of TAM and really just make sure that we've got broad brand awareness within those older legacy markets where Toast has been executing, but we can actually put more reps into it and even be more successful. So I think it comes back to the fact that we're still in the early days or early innings, as Elena mentioned, of our TAM penetration. Today, we're 7% of the U.S. TAM, so that gives us strong belief that there's enough demand to continue to ramp that go-to-market engine.\nStephen Sheldon: 45:54 Great. Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: 45:58 Thanks, Stephen. Our next question is from Dan Dolev at Mizuho. Dan, please go ahead.\nDan Dolev: 46:04 Hey. Thank you. Appreciate taking the questions. Two quick ones. Just, I saw the take rate. I think, Elena, you mentioned that the debit/credit mix stabilized to pre-COVID. I may have misunderstood you but it looks like the take rate has been stable sequentially. Can you maybe give us some more detail on what's driving the stabilization in the take rate sequentially despite kind of the movement, the shift from debit to credit? Thank you.\nElena Gomez: 46:38 Yeah. So actually, our take rate, I think, is slightly down in Q4, and that's primarily because we're getting back to normal on debit and credit. CNP is remaining elevated and so I feel comfortable with where we are. And stable is probably a pretty solid term in terms of how we think about 2022. But I would just remind you, the beauty of the model, right, is both take rate but then we also have an opportunity to monetize through SaaS. So I would just encourage you as you think about our growth, consider both the take rate but also the SaaS ARPU as well.\nDan Dolev: 47:20 Got it. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, more from a strategic perspective. I believe NCR made an announcement last week that they're considering alternatives. Obviously, they're a huge player with Aloha. Obviously, you're not going to discuss any specific M&A, but is the strategy now still pretty much organic or will you be willing to look at maybe opportunities to opportunistically bolster your portfolio? Thank you.\nChris Comparato: 47:49 Yeah, it's a good question. mean, Dan, listen, I mean, our organic growth engine continues to be really strong and the team's executing at an extremely high level. So I think that motion and that growth lever is going to continue. Will we assess strategic opportunities when we see them on the landscape, whether it's within a line of business or more broadly? Perhaps, like I think those opportunities will exist as a growth lever in our future. We've proven that with our acquisition of xtraCHEF and then also our acquisition of StratEx two years ago. So we feel confident in our M&A stance, but I'll remind everybody that the organic growth engine continues to execute extremely well, and we're going to continue to prioritize that.\nDan Dolev: 48:40 Got it. Really appreciate the color. Thanks again.\nUnidentified Company Representative: 48:46 Thanks, Dan. And our next question is from Andrew Bauch of SMBC Nikko. Andrew, please go ahead.\nAndrew Bauch: 48:52 Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Nice set of results, considering the COVID challenges that you're facing in the quarter. I wanted to speak to the Capital business. You mentioned the $100 million originated in 2021, which is pretty promising. And you also said that the long duration loans that you introduced at Spark were a key variable in that accelerating growth. I mean, how much of that contributed to the $100 million if you could contextualize it? And maybe higher level, what percentage would you -- or kind of how should we think about what's addressable within your base for that product?\nChris Comparato: 49:35 Yeah. It's good question. I think if you step back into the shoes of a restaurant, restaurants desire capital to run their business. They want to have working capital. They want to grow, whether it's new locations or renovate or add a patio. They want to purchase equipment or they may need emergency funding. So we actually think capital is deeply strategic to help the restaurant industry thrive moving forward. Having multiple products within lending is key because it's not one-size-fits-all. So you're going to see us continue to innovate and test different types of products within Toast Capital. It's still the early days of what Toast Capital could be as a percentage of our entire business. 50:23 So we're not going to give you sort of the splits between products, but we know that we are on the right path with what we're seeing. And we feel like we've got a significant advantage because we have all the data that flows through the restaurant. So that allows us to effectively underwrite restaurants and really have visibility into the effectiveness and then the payback on those loans. So it's -- we feel like we're in a strong position. We're going to continue to invest in this aspect of the business. But I'll remind you, it's still a small portion of the business today.\nAndrew Bauch: 50:57 Definitely understood. Then my follow-up would be the four-plus module adoption rising 10 points from last year is obviously super impressive. I mean, how should we think about where that metric goes, be it in 2022 and maybe in the long term?\nElena Gomez: 51:16 Yeah. I think that's a really good question. I would say our ARPU growth will be steady but having a steep growth is probably not the way I would model it. I would just plan for steady improvement in our ARPU over time. And that's what the innovation we have today, not to mention the innovation that's coming. So that's how I would think about it, Andrew. And then on Toast Capital, the only thing I would add is the growth we've seen is, obviously, we're very encouraged by it. Chris is right, it's early days. The impact to our financials is not material today. But what we love about that program is we're testing and learning, right? We're testing and learning each time. So we started out with 90-day loans. Now we're testing longer duration loans. And that's a motion that we're going to continue to try to do as we expand what's possible with Toast Capital.\nAndrew Bauch: 52:10 Got it. Thank you for the color, guys.\nUnidentified Company Representative: 52:13 Thanks, Andrew. Our final question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik, please go ahead.\nKartik Mehta: 52:22 Thank you. I'm wondering for you, as you've had so much success, what the competition has done. And if they've done anything different in the last six months.\nChris Comparato: 52:33 Yeah. I can take that. I mean, listen, as I mentioned earlier, the restaurant industry has been underserved by great technology, so it's no surprise that there's been competition for the past 10 years. I mean, it's a competitive space. But what I like about our position is, number one, we're seeing really strong demand for the platform, and that's a very good signal for us to continue to execute. Number two, we're seeing healthy win rates. And you're seeing strong payback periods, healthy win rates, so that gives us even more confidence in our execution. So while there's competition, we feel like we are the leading platform to help the restaurant industry grow. And it comes back to the platform. 53:20 Being an end-to-end restaurant-specific platform that's not multiproduct but it's a true platform across the board from front-of-house to back-of-house, that's a key success factor, and we're going to continue to execute on that path. So we feel good about our position within the competitive landscape. And while there's been announcements over time, I mean, there's been announcements for the past few years on the competitive landscape of restaurants. But we just continue to execute and raise the bar and support our customers. At the end of the day, we want to make sure that every customer has a fantastic experience when they run Toast.\nKartik Mehta: 54:02 Perfect. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nUnidentified Company Representative: 54:08 Well, all right, everyone, thank you very much. That concludes our call. We look forward to speaking with you all next quarter, and have a great afternoon.\nChris Comparato: 54:16 Thank you, all.",

            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "16:11 Thanks, Chris. And I just want to echo the -- thank you to our employees and to our customers. 2021 has been an unforgettable year. And I appreciate your commitment and dedication to our company. So I'm going to remind you, as I get into results, that we will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Refer to today's press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial performance and additional disclosures regarding these measures. 16:43 As Chris mentioned, we had a strong Q4 to exit 2021 and to cap off the year we became a public company. With continued momentum in Q4, we outperformed all key metrics, which is testament to the strong execution of our collective team. We are proud of the new locations we added to our platform through 2021, which reflect the value of our all-in-one digital platform. 17:07 In Q4, we generated revenue of $512 million, up 111% year-over-year and $1,705 million for the full year 2021, a 107% increase year-over-year. We closed the year at $568 million in ARR, up 74% year-over-year. We continue to believe ARR is our North Star metric. As Chris said, we ended the year with approximately 57,000 live locations on our platform compared to 40,000 in Q4 2020, representing a 41% year-over-year growth. 17:44 In addition, we're also proud to report that our net retention rate also referred to as NRR, which we reported in our S1 to be greater than 110% for the last five years was 135% in 2021. NRR comprises both SaaS and fintech solutions revenue, both of which had a retention rate above 110%. SaaS NRR was strong to the expansion of locations from our existing customers as well as customers adding more products. 18:12 From a fintech perspective, we have shared with you that in 2021, we've benefited from higher debit and credit mix as well as higher card not present volume. In 2022, we anticipate these trends will have largely stabilized and as such we expect NRR going forward to trend closer to 110% as we shared in the S1. 18:32 Our subscription services revenue grew 86% year-over-year to $54 million in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase in customers adopting more of our SaaS products. As of the end of 2021, 59% of our Toast locations use four or more core products on top of our integrated POS and payment solution as compared to 48% a year ago. 18:56 Our financial technology solutions revenue grew 117% year-over-year to $421 million in the fourth quarter driven by GPV of $17 billion, which had an increase of 124% year-over-year. GPV is driven by transactions processed on our platform. Since early 2021, annualized GPV per process location continues to remain strong at an average of $1.3 million per location. 19:23 As a reminder, our GPV per location dropped by 45% at the onset of COVID but has steadily returned to above pre-COVID levels. As we have stated before, there's quarterly seasonality with our financial technology solutions revenue as restaurants on average generally performed better in the second and third quarters. Given that we continue to anticipate seasonal fluctuations in the annualized GPV per location from quarter-to-quarter. However, on an annualized basis, our GPV per location is consistent and remains durable. 19:54 For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP gross profit, which excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense that was a mouthful, (ph) came in at $82 million, up 54% year-over-year. In addition to the growth in our customer base, this growth was driven by higher revenue per location, which in turn has been driven by continued growth in average revenue per unit known as ARPU for both SaaS and financial technology solutions. We are pleased with our ARPU performance as a driver to non-GAAP gross profit and we believe that such performance can be sustainable. 20:27 Drilling down into our ARPU performance, we've seen our SaaS ARPU increase as a result of continued adoption of our platform by both new and existing customers. We continue to invest in our technology and remain highly focused on driving innovation across our product portfolio. Our fintech solutions ARPU is up more than 50% from Q4 2019 or pre-COVID levels, primarily as a result of GPV per location and card not present volume. 20:55 As a reminder, two factors that influence fintech solutions ARPU are the mix of card not present volume and the debit credit mix. Consumers continue to utilize digital channels and as such, we believe the card not present volumes will remain elevated. The debit credit mix has returned to pre-COVID levels. 21:14 Turning to hardware cost of revenue as shared in the last earnings call, our freight costs remain elevated due to supply chain dynamics. We continue to believe they will remain elevated through the near term. Despite increased hardware cost, however, we remain confident in our ability to deliver hardware for our customers. 21:32 Before I turn to operating expenses, I want to remind you that we use customer acquisition cost and payback metrics to measure the performance of our business and guide our investment decisions. We are proud to share that our payback period for the full year 2021 was approximately 12 months. Our healthy unit economics and strong payback periods continue to make us feel confident in our ability to invest for durable growth. 21:55 Now let's turn to our operating expenses, which I will review on a non-GAAP basis. In Q4, we continue to invest in sales and marketing and research and development to capture our TAM and build out our platform. Additionally, general and administrative cost increased as a result of operating as a public company. This includes cost from the adoption of the new credit loss -- of the new credit losses accounting standard in Q4 and increased investment to support the growth of our business. As a result of these investments, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was negative $45 million for Q4 and negative $42 million for the full year 2021. 22:33 Now let me turn to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $469 million to $499 million, which represents 72% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative $65 million to negative $55 million. For the full year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2,349 million to $2,409 million, which represents 48% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative $240 million to negative $200 million. 23:08 As you can see, we are deliberately investing to drive long-term growth. The stakes have never been higher for restaurants. The restaurant industry is going through massive change driven by undeniable trends in the world across labor, supply chain and guest adoption of technology. Our investments in 2022 are reflective of this opportunity we have ahead of us. With only approximately 7% market share here in the United States, we continue to believe we are in the early innings of this opportunity. As such, we will continue to invest in research and development as well as in sales and marketing to cost effectively capture our market share. 23:48 Our primary focus is on being the trusted platform of choice for the restaurant industry. Our business is performing well and there is enormous demand for the Toast platform as restaurants need to streamline their operations, increase revenue and retain great employees. Our ambition continues to be to serve restaurants all around the world. And with that we will be making foundational investments in 2022 to drive growth internationally. We look forward to updating you on this multi-year journey in future quarters. 24:18 In closing, our strong 2021 performance demonstrates our success in capturing market share. We are built to serve large -- built to serve a large and growing addressable market and we've shown we can execute at scale with healthy unit economics. We continue to believe we are uniquely positioned to drive durable growth for ourselves and for the restaurants using our platform. 24:40 Now I'd like to turn the call back to the moderator for our Q&A session. 25:29 Yeah, I can start. At the highest level without me guiding for locations, we've intentionally invested, Josh, in adding to our sales force. And we've often said that TAM is our number one priority and then ARPU will follow. We're actually balancing both. But we're pretty excited about the locations we added on our platform in 2021. And we see no reason why we wouldn't continue to have success, adding locations, frankly, very efficiently to with the 12 month payback period that we experienced in 2021. We feel confident to make this investment and we'll continue to see growth on our platform. 26:52 Yeah. I can -- yeah. Go ahead. 28:24 Yeah. No. It's a -- took (ph) a question. Let me just start by saying we have a ton of confidence and conviction about our opportunity and that has not changed at all, actually. In fact, I would say after our performance in 2021, we have even more conviction. And so our prioritization has always been, let's focus on capturing the opportunity ahead with the TAM. And we know we're in the early innings, as you know. And we also have seen some data points, proof points. Demand continues to be strong and customers engaging on our platform, whether that's NRR, as you saw that we talked about or just consistent addition of locations to our platform. 29:04 And so we're going to remain very disciplined and have a lot of rigor about our investments and point investments to things that will drive growth. And then, of course, back to your timing point, the pandemic really amplified the need that customers have for technology and to make their operations more efficient. And we believe when you put all that data together, we're well positioned to capture that opportunity. So it's really important that we're intentional about this investment. I would tell you, it doesn't mean we're not thinking about profitability, so I don't want you to take that from this at all. In fact, in our executive alignment -- in our comp plans, we've aligned on the fact that we do, at the right time need to drive operating leverage, right? We're going to drive and orient to durable growth today. But of course, over time, we will drive operating leverage. 30:19 Yeah. That's a great question. So I would just point to a couple of things. As a reminder, last year at this time, vaccines were coming back and people were coming back, right. So just don't forget that as you guys. I know a lot of you look at sequential moves. So pay attention to that because we had a big surge last year. We didn't expect that to repeat this year, right, because we've now been unfortunately used to this kind of quasi environment, we're operating in. But even without that dynamic from last year, there's always seasonality in our payments, as you know. So Q1 tends to be a quarter where the seasonality is such that we have lower GPV than, say, Q2 and Q3. So that was not much -- that's not what -- that did not surprise us. 31:05 I would tell you we had a little bit of Omicron in the early part -- late days of December and early part of January, but we believe that's transitory and frankly behind us at this point. The other thing I'll point to that you may not see in the guidance is we anticipate SaaS will continue to increase. So you will see that sequential increase Q4 to Q1. So that's -- I hope that gives you enough color to kind of give you the backdrop for Q1. 31:32 Great. 33:23 Yeah. I mean, I think in our guidance, as we entered into the year, there's a few trends that really, really, we pay attention to that you guys are familiar with. Card not present is one of those, debit and credit mix, all those impact our fintech ARPU. So for card not present, I said in my script, we do believe consumer behavior has largely changed. I think all of us are probably using online ordering more than we did in the past. And so we believe some of that behavior is going to persist. And we -- therefore, we believe CNP will remain somewhat elevated. Debit and credit mix has largely come back to pre-COVID levels, so we factored that into our thinking. 34:06 And then I would just call out on the COGS side, as I mentioned in the script, we have elevated freight costs, and we believe that's going to persist for the near term. We're keeping an eye on it, of course. But that's -- those are the things that come to mind when you ask a little bit about what do we think about recovery. I think we've seen Omicron come and go, which is great. I think it shows restaurants are resilient. And so we're considering that in our calculus as well. 35:08 Yeah. No, I mean, we're proud of our payback. I wouldn't say it was a surprise. I think my finance team would get really mad at me, if we said it was a surprise because actually it wasn't a surprise, like I think we are so focused on unit economics and payback periods. But we did benefit from -- in the first part of the year, we had -- if I say the puts and takes in the first part of the year, we had higher card not present and just higher take rates, obviously, but then you counter that with freight costs being elevated, so all those puts and takes really come into play there. But as I think about the future, as we said in our S1, as long as our payback period is in the mid-teens, I'm happy with that. Obviously, we're always going to do better. We're always going to try to make our operation more efficient, but I'm happy with that. So I would think about that as more of a longer-term trend than what we had in 2021. 38:17 Yeah. No, Brent, that's a really good question. I had to go back and myself for the reason you described than it was before my time. But I think the thing we'll call out is Q2 and Q3 summer months tend to be our high GPV per location quarters. Q1 tends to be the lower quarter, and same with Q4 with the holidays and whatnot. So warm weather gets people out, and that's why you see a lot of increase in our GPV going in Q2 and Q3. So you should expect that more, hopefully, more normal this year going into 2022. And that's how we think about it, too. That's how we planned. 42:03 Yeah, I think the only thing I would add is just making sure that we get the product localized for -- if there's any languages that we need to consider, of course, that's important and making sure that we invest in that over the long term but also being measured about our investment and just making sure we learn in 2022 is really important to us. 43:30 Yeah, I mean, I can tell you, Stephen, so when we looked a couple of years ago, our initial -- our customers was at -- would typically add about two products. That's well over four now and we talked about 50% of our customers more than four products. The typical products are online ordering, Toast Co. devices, gift cards, those are all really, loyalty, all really popular products. And also with our new customers, a lot of them are adopting the payroll product. We see the majority of our new customers adopting the payroll product. So we're excited about that. And of course, there's an opportunity to sell that to our existing installed base as well. 46:38 Yeah. So actually, our take rate, I think, is slightly down in Q4, and that's primarily because we're getting back to normal on debit and credit. CNP is remaining elevated and so I feel comfortable with where we are. And stable is probably a pretty solid term in terms of how we think about 2022. But I would just remind you, the beauty of the model, right, is both take rate but then we also have an opportunity to monetize through SaaS. So I would just encourage you as you think about our growth, consider both the take rate but also the SaaS ARPU as well. 51:16 Yeah. I think that's a really good question. I would say our ARPU growth will be steady but having a steep growth is probably not the way I would model it. I would just plan for steady improvement in our ARPU over time. And that's what the innovation we have today, not to mention the innovation that's coming. So that's how I would think about it, Andrew. And then on Toast Capital, the only thing I would add is the growth we've seen is, obviously, we're very encouraged by it. Chris is right, it's early days. The impact to our financials is not material today. But what we love about that program is we're testing and learning, right? We're testing and learning each time. So we started out with 90-day loans. Now we're testing longer duration loans. And that's a motion that we're going to continue to try to do as we expand what's possible with Toast Capital."

The reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is intended in today's -- is included in today's earnings press release. Both the press release and a replay of this call, including the accompanying investor presentation, will be available on our Investor Relations website.\n With that, I would like to turn it over to Chris. \nChristopher Comparato: Thanks, Alice. Welcome, everyone, to our first earnings call as a public company. I am Chris Comparato, CEO of Toast. I'm excited to be with you today to share my thoughts on our company, our opportunity and our Q3 performance. Given that it's our very first earnings call, I'd like to start by zooming out a bit and providing you an overview of our business, the restaurant industry and our opportunity.\n Toast provides restaurants with an all-in-one technology platform that combines point-of-sale, front of house, back of house and guest-facing technology integrated with financial technology and payments, all built with the restaurant's success in mind. Toast works for all restaurants regardless of size, concept or cuisine, from independent cafes to enterprise brands. At Toast, our mission is to empower the restaurant community to delight their guests, do what they love and thrive.\n When we say restaurant community, we mean every stakeholder, from the guest to the GM or owner, to the wait staff, to the chef, to the suppliers and the entire ecosystem. Together, we believe we can delight guests with fast and seamless service, make employees happier with higher wages, tips and a better work experience and help restaurants be more successful with increased sales, deeper customer relationships and lower employee turnover. Our success is tied to our customers' success, and working with them to be better together underpins everything that we do.\n At no time was that commitment tested more than during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We responded by accelerating certain product releases, which empowered restaurants to provide a contactless dining experience, fulfill online takeout and delivery orders and communicate with their customers as we all navigated constantly changing public health business and consumer pressures. In addition, we supported grassroots campaigns and lobbied Congress directly on behalf of restaurants. We are proud to see that these efforts have resulted in overall same-store sales of Toast customers exceeding pre-COVID levels and continuing to improve.\n Market research suggests that there are approximately 860,000 restaurants in the U.S. alone. Collectively, the industry is one of the largest employers, providing jobs to more than 11 million people and generating nearly $700 billion of sales each year, around 3% of the U.S. GDP. Yet it has one of the lowest levels of tech spend as a percentage of sales of any sector.\n If you've worked in a restaurant, you know it's a complex business with a lot of moving parts. They operate with low margins, high employee turnover, highly perishable products and complex regulations, yet many restaurants continue to run on legacy systems, pen and paper or disconnected horizontal and point solutions, each with their own costs and barriers to scalability.\n So we believe there is a massive opportunity for us to support this industry as it grows and evolves and as its tech spend closes the gap with that of other sectors. We're conservatively estimating our current serviceable addressable market, or SAM, at approximately $15 billion. We see an approximately $55 billion total addressable market, or TAM, in the U.S. for restaurant technology spend by 2024. This TAM at least doubles if we look globally. As we continue to grow and add more products to our portfolio, we believe we have the right strategy to go after this massive opportunity.\n This strategy starts with our relentless focus on product innovation. Our powerful platform integrates software with our payment processing system, supporting over 15 products. Because our platform is all-in-one covering every aspect of a restaurant's operation, Toast restaurants are empowered to use that data to unlock new insights and further optimize their businesses, which has led to higher sales and margins, more seamless operations and lower employee turnover.\n Our customers provide us tremendous insight into our product road map. A major example of this is our recent acquisition of xtraCHEF in June. We heard from customers how challenging it has been to manage their supply chain, especially during the last 1.5 years. In a survey, over half of our customer community told us that high operating costs and food costs were a top challenge. By simply snapping photos of supplier invoices, coding and categorizing, our customers will have access to digitize line item details that are accurate and available to their team from anywhere and can unlock insights into purchasing behavior, supplier optimization, financial performance and ultimately savings.\n Our unique go-to-market strategy serves as a competitive differentiator for us, knowing that the restaurant market is hyper local we've invested in a sales force and a customer success team of localized, field-based industry experts trusted by these local communities. Our employees live in these communities and dine in these restaurants, night in and night out, and our true partners to our customers.\n When we create raving fans, they spread the word throughout a region. This is why approximately 2/3 of our new locations come from inbound channels and 1/5 from customer or partner referrals. This creates further efficiency in our go-to-market motion, and our sales productivity typically increases as our positive reputation spreads within a local restaurant community.\n Our ongoing expansion is supported by our customer success team, who brings vast technical and industry knowledge to the restaurants we work with quickly accessible through a single point of contact, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, critical to avoiding downtime in an industry that is always on and does so much of their business on weekends and holidays.\n We also have a robust ecosystem of over 150 suppliers, tech and local partners. These relationships enable us to deliver more value to customers while providing significant visibility into customer adoption. This data can lead to valuable insights into selectively pursuing M&A opportunities, which was the case in our acquisition of Stratix for payroll management and xtraCHEF for invoice and accounts payable solutions.\n Now I'd like to go into the details for the quarter. In Q3, we delivered strong results across the board. We grew revenue 105% year-over-year to $486 million, an annual recurring run rate, or ARR, growth 77% year-over-year to $544 million. This was driven by strong gross payment volume, or GPV, growth of 123% year-over-year, landing at $16.5 billion and strong customer adoption of our products. As of Q3, 56% of our Toast locations used 4 or more products on top of our integrated POS and payment solution compared to 44% a year ago.\n We continue to see a consistent trend of guests returning to restaurants as well as off-premise trends such as online ordering, delivery and takeout sustain, which demonstrates that these consumer behaviors are here to stay for the long term.\n Let me now share with you some customer wins in the quarter. We signed a new deal with Fat Tuesday, a national chain known for its frozen drinks. Fat Tuesday is rolling out toast at 40 locations nationwide and will build its entire technology stack on toast starting with our point of sale, order and pay at the table, kitchen display screens and multi-location management products. Organic juice bar Clean Juice has franchise locations in 28 states and is making ordering, payments and delivery more seamless with Toast.\n In Q3, Clean Juice expanded with Toast, renewing its agreement for 121 locations and adding a commitment to bring Toast to 50 net new locations. Clean Juice uses Toast point-of-sale, Toast Go devices, Toast Flex terminals, Toast kitchen display systems and kiosks, along with our gift card software, multichannel location management and API ecosystem integrations.\n We also expanded our relationship with Eggs Up Grill, a rapidly growing breakfast, brunch and lunch brand. Eggs Up Grill currently uses Toast point-of-sale, Toast Flexes, Toast Go devices and Toast printers. This quarter, they signed an agreement to expand Toast to an additional 30 locations. With new revenue channels developed during the pandemic, Eggs Up Grill saw a 13% increase in 2021 sales compared to 2019 and 60% ahead of 2020.\n Next week, on November 16, we'll host Spark, our inaugural restaurant innovation event. At Spark, we will share major new product releases and provide a sneak peek into our innovation road map. The name for our event is a reference to the Spark that lights a stove or an oven to make the magic of a restaurant happen. It also alludes to the spark of imagination that leads to innovation and transformative change. This all-virtual 2-hour event will consist of keynotes, product updates and guest speakers, including world-renowned chef, restaurateur, humanitarian and Toast customer, Jose Andres.\n You'll hear about how we're moving the restaurant industry forward with innovative new products that empower the restaurant, the guests and employees. If you'd like more information on attending the event, please contact our investor relations team at ir@toasttab.com or visit our website for more information and to sign up.\n As part of our continued efforts to support the restaurant community, we recently signed a public letter from the Independent Restaurant Coalition, advocating for replenishment of the restaurant revitalization fund. We've also joined the Pledge 1% movement to donate our capital to fund social impact programs through our philanthropic group, Toast.org.\n Before I turn the call over to Elena to walk you through the financials, I wanted to thank our employees, our customers, our partners and our shareholders for their support in helping us achieve a major milestone in becoming a public company. Restaurants are resilient and they make up the social fabric of our community, and we believe our commitment to aligning our success with the success of the restaurant community will lead to a stronger and exciting future ahead.\n Now I'd like to hand it over to our CFO, Elena Gomez. \nElena Gomez: Thanks, Chris. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to recognize the entire Toast team on their efforts to become a public company, and a special call out to my own Toast finance team. It's because of the collective efforts of this team that we are where we are today. I also want to thank our existing and new shareholders. We are excited to be on this journey with you as a public company. \n While we are proud of this milestone, we are just getting started. As Chris mentioned, we believe we have a total addressable market of $55 billion in the U.S., and we estimate the global TAM to be twice as large. As a leader in one of the world's largest industries, we've built a unique business model to address this opportunity and support rapid growth at scale.\n Before I go into the results of the quarter, let me share with you why we have a powerful business model. First, we have proven we can achieve high growth at scale. Second, we have an integrated software and payments model Thus, we benefit from not only the predictability of SaaS, but also from the increase in transaction volumes as our customers grow. Third, our all-in-one platform, combined with our boots-on-the-ground, go-to-market strategy, keeps our customers happy and drive strong retention. Finally, as our customers continue to expand with us, we've been able to maintain strong unit economics.\n Now let me walk you through how we generate revenue. We generate revenue in 4 ways: subscription services, financial technology solutions, hardware and professional services. We consider subscription services and financial technology solutions as our recurring revenue streams.\n Subscription services revenue is generated from our SaaS products such as digital ordering, delivery and team management, to name a few. Financial technology solutions revenue is generated primarily from facilitating payment transactions and also includes fees earned for loans we offer through our Toast capital program. We recognize our Financial Technology Solutions revenue on a gross basis.\n We consider our other 2 revenue streams, hardware and professional services revenue, as onetime and effectively part of our customer acquisition costs. We price them competitively to minimize barrier to entry.\n Since the majority of our revenue comes from financial technology solutions, we believe annual recurring run rate, or ARR, which excludes transaction-based costs, is the operational metric that best reflects the scale and growth of our business. You can find the full definition of ARR in our earnings press release and our Form 10-Q for the third quarter.\n The key drivers of ARR include growth of restaurant locations on our platform, the adoption of our SaaS products and the total GPV processed.\n Before I turn to the results for the quarter, please note again, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to today's press release for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial performance and additional disclosures regarding these measures.\n I'll now turn to the results for the third quarter. We delivered strong performance in the first quarter as a public company. In Q3, we continue to see growth from both new locations as well as an increase in GPV on our platform as the restaurant industry continues to recover.\n Additionally, customers continue to adopt more Toast products. As a result, in Q3, we delivered revenue of $486 million, up 105% year-over-year, an ARR of $544 million, up 77% year-over-year. Our subscription services grew 67% year-over-year to $46 million in the third quarter, driven by the increase in customers adopting more of our SaaS products.\n In Q3, 56% of our Toast locations use 4 or more products on top of integrated POS and payment solution as compared to 44% a year ago. Our financial technology solutions revenue grew 115% year-over-year to $404 million in the third quarter, driven by our strong GPV of $16.5 billion in Q3, up 123% year-over-year. We anticipate our financial technology solutions revenue to normalize as GPV per location returns to normal patterns.\n For the third quarter, non-GAAP gross profit, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, came in at $89 million, up 75% year-over-year driven by growth in our customer base and higher revenue per location driven by an increase in SaaS ARPU and elevated GPV.\n As we shared with you previously, our freight costs are elevated in Q3 due to supply chain dynamics. While they're not as high as anticipated, we do believe they will remain elevated through the near term. Despite increased costs, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver hardware for our customers.\n Now let's turn to our operating expenses, which I will review on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense for each line item. Before I do, I do want to remind you that we use customer acquisition cost and payback metrics to measure the performance of our business and guide our investment decisions. With this in mind, in Q3, we continue to invest in sales and market -- sales and marketing and research and development to capture our TAM and build out our platform.\n General and administrative expenses were elevated due to our transition to a public company and rebuilding the foundation to scale our business. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was negative $10 million compared to roughly breakeven a year ago. In Q3, we had free cash flow negative of $21 million compared to roughly breakeven a year ago and positive $53 million in Q2. Our Q2 free cash flow result was primarily impacted by a onetime benefit related to interchange billing terms.\n Now let me turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $465 million to $495 million, which represents 98% growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative $50 million to negative $40 million. For the full year 2021, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.655 million to $1.685 million, which represents 103% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative $46 million to negative $36 million.\n While I'm not providing 2022 guidance, I want to remind you that financial technology solutions revenue is benefiting from elevated GPV per location, which we anticipate will normalize as we exit 2021 into 2022.\n In closing, our strong Q3 performance demonstrates our success in continuing to execute and to capture market share as the industry continues rapid digital transformation, built to serve a large and growing addressable market, we've shown we can execute at scale with healthy unit economics. With this foundation in place, we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive durable growth for ourselves and for the restaurants using our platform. \n Now I'd like to turn the call back over to the moderator for our Q&A session. \nAlice Lopatto: Great. Thanks, Chris and Elena. We'll go ahead and start our Q&A session. Our first question comes from Will Nance of Goldman Sachs. \nWilliam Nance: Congrats on a strong quarter. You highlighted the strength in the same-store sales at Toast customers. And I think you also called out the potential for volume per live location to normalize over the course of 2022. Can you maybe just expand a bit on kind of what you're seeing on a per location? And how elevated are we relative to trend?\n And then if I think about some of the things going on today, maybe a little bit higher inflation and just the fact that your customers relative to the -- prior to the pandemic are using so much more technology, you called out the higher attach rates. \n Is there a potential that we could run rate at a higher level of sales or live location on the other side, just given the investments that your client base has made in technology? \nElena Gomez: Yes, it's a fair question. Let me try to characterize that. So we're definitely seeing elevated GPV per location. But as we continue to go into the deeper part of the TAM, we also expect that to get closer to the average. So I would just consider that as you think about your long-term modeling. \nWilliam Nance: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the attach rates that you're seeing the nice momentum and increased adoption of, I think it was 4 and more products. I mean, can you talk about where you think the biggest opportunities from your existing product lineup is? What's kind of resonating the most in the market? \nElena Gomez: Yes. No, definitely. I mean I think, obviously, our Toast Go devices and our digital products are clearly, things that we're encouraged by, but we're also really encouraged by the adoption of our payroll product. And we're seeing a significant amount of our new restaurant openings attach that as we continue. And so we're continuing to see that from a lot of -- like I said, our new customers and equally starting to see a little bit of that even from our existing customer base.\n So one thing I talk about often is through our total ARPU, and you can see that I use an example, just to give you a perspective of what's possible. We have a customer, a donut shop, that can do end-to-end in our platform, 23,000 of ARPU. So it just kind of speaks to what's possible with ARPU. \nWilliam Nance: Got it. Congrats again on the first quarter at the gate. \nAlice Lopatto: Our next question comes from Josh Baer of Morgan Stanley. \nJosh Baer: I wanted to ask about TAM and the opportunity ahead from a couple of different angles. So one within the U.S., like where specifically are you investing and focusing on? Is there a greenfield in the U.S.? \nChristopher Comparato: Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. I mean, listen, in the U.S., as of the end of Q2, we were only 6% market penetration for the TAM in the U.S. So we see a broad-based opportunity to go after the majority of TAM. If you serve 860,000 restaurants, we believe at least 2/3 of that are accessible to Toast today, both in SMB mid-market and I'd say, the lower end of enterprise. \n So we think there's a very long runway for TAM adoption and location acquisition, and we've seen broad-based momentum across the U.S. \n There's no specific geographic differences. We've just been penetrating multiple markets in parallel. \nJosh Baer: Great. And then on the maybe lower end of enterprise or upmarket, are there products or features that are needed to more fully address that, I don't know, fast food or just upmarket enterprise? Like how should investors think about that opportunity within your TAM? \nChristopher Comparato: Sure. We continue to innovate on the platform, for example, on multi-location management, the ability to manage menus and pricing across locations, the ability to publish across multiple locations. So those innovations are organic and continue.\n I would say the other area I would point you to is our strong partner ecosystem. It's super important to have strong APIs and an ecosystem of partners that you can cultivate so that you can offer to an enterprise brand of best-of-breed architecture. So I'd say those are the 2 areas that jump out at us in terms of levels of investment and what we need to do to support larger customers. \nAlice Lopatto: All right. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. \nJosh Beck: Can you hear me? \nChristopher Comparato: We can. \nAlice Lopatto: Yes, we can. \nElena Gomez: We can hear you, yes. \nJosh Beck: Excellent. I wanted to go back to xtraCHEF, obviously, the supply chain has fortunately really been raveled in a lot of different ways in the last 1.5 years. And certainly, it's being felt in the restaurant industry. So maybe just help us understand where you are with that acquisition? What type of strategic discussions it's enabling? And really where you'd like to take that in the next few years? \nChristopher Comparato: Sure. Great question, Josh. Our progress with xtraCHEF is going extremely well. The integration process has gone well. The team is continuing to execute well in terms of performance. And we're investing pretty heavily in backing innovation in and around what I would call accounts payable automation as well as food cost optimization. We think there's a unique opportunity to automate even more of the back office.\n If you think about monetizing things like bill pay and other activities on the back end of restaurants that are critical to their success to interface with suppliers, but then also optimize their costs and optimize their inventory. Running a restaurant is really difficult. And if you think about razor thin margins and the focus on operational efficiency, we think xtraCHEF really is the cornerstone of back office automation. So we're super excited about investing in that road map.\n But first steps first, we need to make sure that we execute the integration well and continue to gain adoption, and you'll see more of that in 2022. And I'll talk a little bit about this next week at Spark. \nJosh Beck: Fantastic. And maybe just a follow-up question around the sales and marketing efficiency. Obviously, you are starting to rightfully invest in this opportunity we can look at some external metrics like incremental revenue, recurring revenue per sales and marketing dollar. And all these metrics look very healthy. So maybe just provide us some qualitative context with the efficiency, how that's trending and where you'd like to see that head in the future? \nElena Gomez: Yes, I'm glad you asked the question, Josh. We are relentless in our focus on payback periods and just our efficiency overall. And we continue to see customers adopting in a self-directed mode as an example. So there's many ways that we can continue to monitor efficiency. So I would say, I feel very confident with what our payback periods are today, and we'll continue to monitor them over the next several quarters ongoing. \nAlice Lopatto: Our next question comes from Stephen Sheldon of William Blair. \nStephen Sheldon: I wanted to ask about the labor shortages and the hiring challenges that are facing restaurants. And I guess it's kind of 2-parter. One, has it influenced the urgency of restaurants to sign up for your platform or increased demand for the uptake of specific modules like handhelds and order pay at the table? And then two, has the issue changed any priorities from a product development standpoint to bring to market solutions that could help restaurants, especially if this is going to be a persistent issue? I know maybe we need to wait for Spark for that, but just thought I'd ask. \nChristopher Comparato: Yes, I'll take it. Great question, Stephen. So yes, your premise is dead on, restaurants are forced to adapt and drive as much operational efficiency as they can with minimal staff. And much of our product around team management and handhelds allows them to sort of adapt and engage their employees and allow them to offer better service to consumers.\n So if you think about order and pay at the table and Toast Go devices, for example, that allows the staff to be that much more efficient to handle, not just existing guests, but even increase the number of tables within the restaurant that they can serve. We've seen examples of restaurants that have increased their tables while maintaining or lowering their staff, but becoming as efficient as they were in the past. So we think order and pay at the table and -- what we call digital dine-in as well as the Toast Go device allowing you to build new service models within the restaurant itself are critically important.\n And restaurants recognize that, and they recognize that these innovations really benefit them and create better employee engagement as well as better consumer experiences, to be honest with you. So I think that's going to continue to hold true even past the COVID pandemic.\n As far as where we're investing, we're investing, I'd say, broadly across many of these tools. If you look at sort of the digital dine-in experience, we're continuing to invest heavily in scan and pay at the table, order and pay at the table. We're continuing to make sure that it works in conjunction with the Toast Go device. So if the consumers and the wait staff need to complement each other, there's this continued service model, where it's not one or the other, but it's both.\n That way, a wait staff can manage many more tables, but consumers can also have the delightful experience of order and pay at the table. But then we're also broadly investing in other areas of team management in and around payroll for example, the ability to manage tips. So tune in next week, and you'll hear a little bit more about some of these products, but I'd say it's broad-based investment across the board. \nAlice Lopatto: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. \nBrent Bracelin: I want to build on the narrative of the talent shortage in the restaurant industry. Anecdotally, we're seeing and using the digital dine-in options that you guys are enabling here more often.\n What is the penetration rate? What's the adoption as you look at the broader customer base, do -- or half of the customers now kind of empowering and at digital kind of ordering at the table? Or is there a broader opportunity to cross-sell those? Just give us a starting point kind of where we're at today and then the potential to help some of those small restaurants address these issues. And one quick follow-up for Elena. \nChristopher Comparato: Yes, Brent, great question. I think we're in the early days of this adoption. I mean we're talking about new service models within the restaurant itself. So you see employees adapting to these new service models. But then you also see in parallel consumers adapting to how to use these products and consumers starting to get used to it. So I'd say we're in the early days of adoption.\n But I think we're super excited about the growth ahead because then the methodology within the restaurant starts to change. And the restaurants that are really embracing these technologies are doing much better than non-toast restaurants that aren't adopting a similar set of technologies. So we're seeing the proof points, but I'd argue much of the runway is ahead of us, and much of that opportunity is ahead of us. \nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color there. And then, Elena, as we just think about the subscription services revenue, it looked like growth accelerated year-over-year slightly versus kind of the year-year growth last quarter.\n Is that just driven by lands with new customers that are taking more products and modules? Is that driven by cross-sell? What kind of drove some of the strength in subscription services growth this quarter? \nElena Gomez: Yes. It's all of the above. I think the metric I'd point you to, Brent, is the percentage of customers with more than 4 modules. You see that steady increase over time, and we're really encouraged by that. And when you look at initial implementation, we still have most customers adopting more than 4 products at one time. And so at initial launch, so I think all of that is really driving that SaaS revenue. It's multiple dimensions. \nBrent Bracelin: Got it. A higher attach across lands and expands. \nElena Gomez: Yes. \nAlice Lopatto: Our next question comes from DJ Hynes of Canaccord. \nDavid Hynes: Congrats on the good start here. Chris, I want to ask -- look, I think some of the drivers for new restaurants to onboard Toast during the pandemic were a little bit unique, right? You had things like online ordering and curbside pickup and delivery, all became really important. I'm wondering if you're seeing any change or maybe normalization of the drivers of new customer acquisition today? And maybe you could touch on some of the cohort dynamics of that COVID group expansion, growth, that sort of thing would be helpful? \nChristopher Comparato: Yes. The first thing, DJ, is -- I mean, we've seen broad momentum. If you zoom out we've seen broad momentum of growth of our platform within restaurants and then outside of COVID, right? And I think there's 3 things that really drive restaurants to leverage our platform.\n Number one, the depth and breadth of the platform and the restaurant specificity to the functions and features that the restaurants need to operate. So we feel like we've got the broadest and deepest restaurant-specific platform in the market.\n Number two, we're obsessed with customers' happiness and building trust on the platform, and that starts in the go-to-market motion and carry through all the elements of Toast downstream. So making sure that restaurants have a great experience when they use our platform is critically important. And then number three, it's really the engine of innovation, I mean we've been innovating on this platform for 9 years. I mean we launched integrated online ordering back in 2014.\n So many of the products that restaurants are adopting were pre-COVID products that are now built into the platform, simple and easy to use, and we're expanding upon those products, but then also looking for other control points that make the lives of restaurants difficult and what can we do to collapse those control points into this unified operating system to make their life easier.\n So I'd argue that restaurants are starting to see the benefits of this type of platform to their future and Toast restaurants are proving that they can perform and perform quite well. They've been incredibly resilient, and we're proud of that. \nDavid Hynes: Yes, yes. Super helpful color. And maybe just as a follow-up for Elena. You had a comment in your prepared remarks around confidence to procure hardware to serve your customers. I just want to double-click there and make sure that we're not going to have any supply chain issues sneak up on us, and that you'll have what you need to kind of onboard all your new customers in Q4 and I guess into next year? \nElena Gomez: Yes. No, I feel actually confident in this, DJ. As you know, During COVID, obviously, that was -- we were battlefield tested in terms of supply chain, and we felt it was really important to make sure we did not disrupt our customers' onboarding and making sure they had what they needed to get going. And so it's no different now. I think we're paying attention, of course, to the elevated freight costs and being thoughtful about that. But we're confident we are focused on not disrupting our customers and not opting our growth rate either as a result of supply chain issues. \nAlice Lopatto: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Congrats on the listing and the great results out the gate here. Just on the supply chain stuff, I want to make sure on the hardware side, if there's anything surprising there. Do you have a good read on what's happening there? Looks like hardware came in quite strong in the quarter. I'm assuming that's more tied to new locations versus refreshes? Just curious what trends you're seeing on the hardware side. \nElena Gomez: Yes. No, it's definitely tied to new locations, and we feel really good, like I mentioned with DJ, about our confidence in making sure we get the hardware in the customers' hands that need it. And we've been able to prove -- navigate that fairly well. I'm actually proud of our hardware team for navigating so well during the pandemic. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Good. Just to zoom in on the fourth quarter revenue guide a little bit. I guess the midpoint is a little bit below the third quarter, so sequentially, I'm just trying to think about the factors as we think about seasonality and weather and other factors. Any call outs there? \nElena Gomez: Yes. I mean I think you hit it on the head. It's really the seasonality that we typically see on the payment front that is reflected in our guidance, but we'll continue to see growth in our SaaS revenue, et cetera. So -- The guidance reflects that seasonality. \nAlice Lopatto: Our next question comes from Mayank Tandon of Needham. \nMayank Tandon: Congrats on the quarter. I was going to ask you more of a topical question. Can you share any metrics around win rates, competitive takeaways to give us a feel for how Toast is faring versus some of your competition, like, let's say, TouchBistro, Square, Clover, et cetera? Maybe just some -- any metrics that would be helpful to put your share gains in perspective, that would be very helpful. \nChristopher Comparato: Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean we're not going to comment specifically on win rates versus any one competitor. We've seen a lot of success across the board. Like I mentioned, it's mostly due to the depth and breadth of the platform and our obsession with customer happiness and then the innovation behind that.\n But in general, we compete against legacy players, Cloud 1.0 players and point solutions, but we feel like we're in a good position to compete well and differentiate ourselves and sort of win the hearts and minds of restaurants moving forward. \nMayank Tandon: Elena, a quick follow-up for you. Could you provide any perspective on the payments margin? Any noticeable shift in terms of debit, credit and card-present versus not-present, just so when you think about our models into 2022? \nElena Gomez: Yes. It's a fair question. So card-not-present has been stabilizing, but I would say it's elevated a little bit above pre-COVID levels, and we think that's in part because we've been investing in a lot of our digital products. So there's a little dynamic there. But take rate, obviously, in Q3 came down a bit, and that's on its way to normalization. And then debit credit mix is also trending back to pre-COVID levels, and I would expect that over time to normalize. \nAlice Lopatto: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev of Mizuho. \nChristopher Comparato: Yes, Dan, you're on mute. \nDan Dolev: Am I better now? Can you hear me now? \nAlice Lopatto: Yes, we can hear you. \nChristopher Comparato: yes, we can, yes. \nDan Dolev: Okay. Sorry about that. Congrats on the first quarter out. So on the -- at the S-1, you gave a lot of detail on locations. And correct me if I'm wrong, I didn't see that in the press release. And sorry, I jumped on late because we were on another earnings. I just wanted to know if that -- did I miss that metric? Or is it not available? Or... \nElena Gomez: Yes. Dan, so it's a fair question. We're going to be disclosing locations more likely on an annualized basis. But the primary reason is because we're focused on -- as we talk about our powerful business model, we talk about both integrated payments of SaaS and payments together. And so ARR is a metric we believe is most reflective of the growth of our business and really how we manage the business internally.\n So I would tell you, both locations were in line with expectations, even though we're not going to disclose that number, and ARPU was slightly ahead of our expectations for the third quarter. \nDan Dolev: Understood. And then my follow-up is on just gross payment volume and you might have covered it, and I apologize because I did jump on late, but kind of the sequential deceleration in GPV growth Q3 versus Q2 and then that big jump Q2 versus Q1. Is there any -- are there any data points you can provide some color on what's causing that or maybe that 2Q was abnormally high of that? That's kind of my understanding. \nElena Gomez: No, what typically, summer months have some seasonality in there. So you should consider that in your models. Q2 and Q3 are typically elevated, but we're seeing, as I noted in the script, some elevated GTV per location, and we expect that over time to normalize. \nDan Dolev: Understood. Congrats again on the first quarter. \nElena Gomez: Thanks, Dan. \nChristopher Comparato: Thanks, Dan. \nAlice Lopatto: And our last question comes from Andrew Bauch of SMBC. \nAndrew Bauch: I just wanted to touch upon the EBITDA guide here. I mean I know that you're investing pretty heavily against the big market opportunity. But thinking about this business in the long run, how should we think about what EBITDA margins would look like under certain levels of growth? And maybe a sense of the long run kind of profile of this business? \nElena Gomez: Yes. The -- so for the near term, we view this opportunity is massive, and we're going to invest for growth. and that's what we've been talking about for some time. Obviously, we will continue to focus on payback period on unit economics. So just appreciate that behind the scenes, we have that good hygiene internally to make sure we're managing how we invest, where we invest, focus on investments that drive growth. And so as we get further into the public markets, I'll share more about our long-term profitability. But for the near term, we should focus on the fact that we will be investing for growth. \nAndrew Bauch: Great. And looking forward to Spark. \nChristopher Comparato: Thank you. \nAlice Lopatto: All right, everyone. Well, that concludes our call. Thank you so much for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Have a good one.",

            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to recognize the entire Toast team on their efforts to become a public company, and a special call out to my own Toast finance team. It's because of the collective efforts of this team that we are where we are today. I also want to thank our existing and new shareholders. We are excited to be on this journey with you as a public company. \n While we are proud of this milestone, we are just getting started. As Chris mentioned, we believe we have a total addressable market of $55 billion in the U.S., and we estimate the global TAM to be twice as large. As a leader in one of the world's largest industries, we've built a unique business model to address this opportunity and support rapid growth at scale.\n Before I go into the results of the quarter, let me share with you why we have a powerful business model. First, we have proven we can achieve high growth at scale. Second, we have an integrated software and payments model Thus, we benefit from not only the predictability of SaaS, but also from the increase in transaction volumes as our customers grow. Third, our all-in-one platform, combined with our boots-on-the-ground, go-to-market strategy, keeps our customers happy and drive strong retention. Finally, as our customers continue to expand with us, we've been able to maintain strong unit economics.\n Now let me walk you through how we generate revenue. We generate revenue in 4 ways: subscription services, financial technology solutions, hardware and professional services. We consider subscription services and financial technology solutions as our recurring revenue streams.\n Subscription services revenue is generated from our SaaS products such as digital ordering, delivery and team management, to name a few. Financial technology solutions revenue is generated primarily from facilitating payment transactions and also includes fees earned for loans we offer through our Toast capital program. We recognize our Financial Technology Solutions revenue on a gross basis.\n We consider our other 2 revenue streams, hardware and professional services revenue, as onetime and effectively part of our customer acquisition costs. We price them competitively to minimize barrier to entry.\n Since the majority of our revenue comes from financial technology solutions, we believe annual recurring run rate, or ARR, which excludes transaction-based costs, is the operational metric that best reflects the scale and growth of our business. You can find the full definition of ARR in our earnings press release and our Form 10-Q for the third quarter.\n The key drivers of ARR include growth of restaurant locations on our platform, the adoption of our SaaS products and the total GPV processed.\n Before I turn to the results for the quarter, please note again, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to today's press release for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial performance and additional disclosures regarding these measures.\n I'll now turn to the results for the third quarter. We delivered strong performance in the first quarter as a public company. In Q3, we continue to see growth from both new locations as well as an increase in GPV on our platform as the restaurant industry continues to recover.\n Additionally, customers continue to adopt more Toast products. As a result, in Q3, we delivered revenue of $486 million, up 105% year-over-year, an ARR of $544 million, up 77% year-over-year. Our subscription services grew 67% year-over-year to $46 million in the third quarter, driven by the increase in customers adopting more of our SaaS products.\n In Q3, 56% of our Toast locations use 4 or more products on top of integrated POS and payment solution as compared to 44% a year ago. Our financial technology solutions revenue grew 115% year-over-year to $404 million in the third quarter, driven by our strong GPV of $16.5 billion in Q3, up 123% year-over-year. We anticipate our financial technology solutions revenue to normalize as GPV per location returns to normal patterns.\n For the third quarter, non-GAAP gross profit, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, came in at $89 million, up 75% year-over-year driven by growth in our customer base and higher revenue per location driven by an increase in SaaS ARPU and elevated GPV.\n As we shared with you previously, our freight costs are elevated in Q3 due to supply chain dynamics. While they're not as high as anticipated, we do believe they will remain elevated through the near term. Despite increased costs, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver hardware for our customers.\n Now let's turn to our operating expenses, which I will review on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense for each line item. Before I do, I do want to remind you that we use customer acquisition cost and payback metrics to measure the performance of our business and guide our investment decisions. With this in mind, in Q3, we continue to invest in sales and market -- sales and marketing and research and development to capture our TAM and build out our platform.\n General and administrative expenses were elevated due to our transition to a public company and rebuilding the foundation to scale our business. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was negative $10 million compared to roughly breakeven a year ago. In Q3, we had free cash flow negative of $21 million compared to roughly breakeven a year ago and positive $53 million in Q2. Our Q2 free cash flow result was primarily impacted by a onetime benefit related to interchange billing terms.\n Now let me turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $465 million to $495 million, which represents 98% growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative $50 million to negative $40 million. For the full year 2021, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.655 million to $1.685 million, which represents 103% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of negative $46 million to negative $36 million.\n While I'm not providing 2022 guidance, I want to remind you that financial technology solutions revenue is benefiting from elevated GPV per location, which we anticipate will normalize as we exit 2021 into 2022.\n In closing, our strong Q3 performance demonstrates our success in continuing to execute and to capture market share as the industry continues rapid digital transformation, built to serve a large and growing addressable market, we've shown we can execute at scale with healthy unit economics. With this foundation in place, we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive durable growth for ourselves and for the restaurants using our platform. \n Now I'd like to turn the call back over to the moderator for our Q&A session. Yes, it's a fair question. Let me try to characterize that. So we're definitely seeing elevated GPV per location. But as we continue to go into the deeper part of the TAM, we also expect that to get closer to the average. So I would just consider that as you think about your long-term modeling. Yes. No, definitely. I mean I think, obviously, our Toast Go devices and our digital products are clearly, things that we're encouraged by, but we're also really encouraged by the adoption of our payroll product. And we're seeing a significant amount of our new restaurant openings attach that as we continue. And so we're continuing to see that from a lot of -- like I said, our new customers and equally starting to see a little bit of that even from our existing customer base.\n So one thing I talk about often is through our total ARPU, and you can see that I use an example, just to give you a perspective of what's possible. We have a customer, a donut shop, that can do end-to-end in our platform, 23,000 of ARPU. So it just kind of speaks to what's possible with ARPU. We can hear you, yes. Yes, I'm glad you asked the question, Josh. We are relentless in our focus on payback periods and just our efficiency overall. And we continue to see customers adopting in a self-directed mode as an example. So there's many ways that we can continue to monitor efficiency. So I would say, I feel very confident with what our payback periods are today, and we'll continue to monitor them over the next several quarters ongoing. Yes. It's all of the above. I think the metric I'd point you to, Brent, is the percentage of customers with more than 4 modules. You see that steady increase over time, and we're really encouraged by that. And when you look at initial implementation, we still have most customers adopting more than 4 products at one time. And so at initial launch, so I think all of that is really driving that SaaS revenue. It's multiple dimensions. Yes. Yes. No, I feel actually confident in this, DJ. As you know, During COVID, obviously, that was -- we were battlefield tested in terms of supply chain, and we felt it was really important to make sure we did not disrupt our customers' onboarding and making sure they had what they needed to get going. And so it's no different now. I think we're paying attention, of course, to the elevated freight costs and being thoughtful about that. But we're confident we are focused on not disrupting our customers and not opting our growth rate either as a result of supply chain issues. Yes. No, it's definitely tied to new locations, and we feel really good, like I mentioned with DJ, about our confidence in making sure we get the hardware in the customers' hands that need it. And we've been able to prove -- navigate that fairly well. I'm actually proud of our hardware team for navigating so well during the pandemic. Yes. I mean I think you hit it on the head. It's really the seasonality that we typically see on the payment front that is reflected in our guidance, but we'll continue to see growth in our SaaS revenue, et cetera. So -- The guidance reflects that seasonality. Yes. It's a fair question. So card-not-present has been stabilizing, but I would say it's elevated a little bit above pre-COVID levels, and we think that's in part because we've been investing in a lot of our digital products. So there's a little dynamic there. But take rate, obviously, in Q3 came down a bit, and that's on its way to normalization. And then debit credit mix is also trending back to pre-COVID levels, and I would expect that over time to normalize. Yes. Dan, so it's a fair question.

            "name": "Christopher Comparato",
            "content": "Thanks, Alice. Welcome, everyone, to our first earnings call as a public company. I am Chris Comparato, CEO of Toast. I'm excited to be with you today to share my thoughts on our company, our opportunity and our Q3 performance. Given that it's our very first earnings call, I'd like to start by zooming out a bit and providing you an overview of our business, the restaurant industry and our opportunity.\n Toast provides restaurants with an all-in-one technology platform that combines point-of-sale, front of house, back of house and guest-facing technology integrated with financial technology and payments, all built with the restaurant's success in mind. Toast works for all restaurants regardless of size, concept or cuisine, from independent cafes to enterprise brands. At Toast, our mission is to empower the restaurant community to delight their guests, do what they love and thrive.\n When we say restaurant community, we mean every stakeholder, from the guest to the GM or owner, to the wait staff, to the chef, to the suppliers and the entire ecosystem. Together, we believe we can delight guests with fast and seamless service, make employees happier with higher wages, tips and a better work experience and help restaurants be more successful with increased sales, deeper customer relationships and lower employee turnover. Our success is tied to our customers' success, and working with them to be better together underpins everything that we do.\n At no time was that commitment tested more than during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We responded by accelerating certain product releases, which empowered restaurants to provide a contactless dining experience, fulfill online takeout and delivery orders and communicate with their customers as we all navigated constantly changing public health business and consumer pressures. In addition, we supported grassroots campaigns and lobbied Congress directly on behalf of restaurants. We are proud to see that these efforts have resulted in overall same-store sales of Toast customers exceeding pre-COVID levels and continuing to improve.\n Market research suggests that there are approximately 860,000 restaurants in the U.S. alone. Collectively, the industry is one of the largest employers, providing jobs to more than 11 million people and generating nearly $700 billion of sales each year, around 3% of the U.S. GDP. Yet it has one of the lowest levels of tech spend as a percentage of sales of any sector.\n If you've worked in a restaurant, you know it's a complex business with a lot of moving parts. They operate with low margins, high employee turnover, highly perishable products and complex regulations, yet many restaurants continue to run on legacy systems, pen and paper or disconnected horizontal and point solutions, each with their own costs and barriers to scalability.\n So we believe there is a massive opportunity for us to support this industry as it grows and evolves and as its tech spend closes the gap with that of other sectors. We're conservatively estimating our current serviceable addressable market, or SAM, at approximately $15 billion. We see an approximately $55 billion total addressable market, or TAM, in the U.S. for restaurant technology spend by 2024. This TAM at least doubles if we look globally. As we continue to grow and add more products to our portfolio, we believe we have the right strategy to go after this massive opportunity.\n This strategy starts with our relentless focus on product innovation. Our powerful platform integrates software with our payment processing system, supporting over 15 products. Because our platform is all-in-one covering every aspect of a restaurant's operation, Toast restaurants are empowered to use that data to unlock new insights and further optimize their businesses, which has led to higher sales and margins, more seamless operations and lower employee turnover.\n Our customers provide us tremendous insight into our product road map. A major example of this is our recent acquisition of xtraCHEF in June. We heard from customers how challenging it has been to manage their supply chain, especially during the last 1.5 years. In a survey, over half of our customer community told us that high operating costs and food costs were a top challenge. By simply snapping photos of supplier invoices, coding and categorizing, our customers will have access to digitize line item details that are accurate and available to their team from anywhere and can unlock insights into purchasing behavior, supplier optimization, financial performance and ultimately savings.\n Our unique go-to-market strategy serves as a competitive differentiator for us, knowing that the restaurant market is hyper local we've invested in a sales force and a customer success team of localized, field-based industry experts trusted by these local communities. Our employees live in these communities and dine in these restaurants, night in and night out, and our true partners to our customers.\n When we create raving fans, they spread the word throughout a region. This is why approximately 2/3 of our new locations come from inbound channels and 1/5 from customer or partner referrals. This creates further efficiency in our go-to-market motion, and our sales productivity typically increases as our positive reputation spreads within a local restaurant community.\n Our ongoing expansion is supported by our customer success team, who brings vast technical and industry knowledge to the restaurants we work with quickly accessible through a single point of contact, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, critical to avoiding downtime in an industry that is always on and does so much of their business on weekends and holidays.\n We also have a robust ecosystem of over 150 suppliers, tech and local partners. These relationships enable us to deliver more value to customers while providing significant visibility into customer adoption. This data can lead to valuable insights into selectively pursuing M&A opportunities, which was the case in our acquisition of Stratix for payroll management and xtraCHEF for invoice and accounts payable solutions.\n Now I'd like to go into the details for the quarter. In Q3, we delivered strong results across the board. We grew revenue 105% year-over-year to $486 million, an annual recurring run rate, or ARR, growth 77% year-over-year to $544 million. This was driven by strong gross payment volume, or GPV, growth of 123% year-over-year, landing at $16.5 billion and strong customer adoption of our products. As of Q3, 56% of our Toast locations used 4 or more products on top of our integrated POS and payment solution compared to 44% a year ago.\n We continue to see a consistent trend of guests returning to restaurants as well as off-premise trends such as online ordering, delivery and takeout sustain, which demonstrates that these consumer behaviors are here to stay for the long term.\n Let me now share with you some customer wins in the quarter. We signed a new deal with Fat Tuesday, a national chain known for its frozen drinks. Fat Tuesday is rolling out toast at 40 locations nationwide and will build its entire technology stack on toast starting with our point of sale, order and pay at the table, kitchen display screens and multi-location management products. Organic juice bar Clean Juice has franchise locations in 28 states and is making ordering, payments and delivery more seamless with Toast.\n In Q3, Clean Juice expanded with Toast, renewing its agreement for 121 locations and adding a commitment to bring Toast to 50 net new locations. Clean Juice uses Toast point-of-sale, Toast Go devices, Toast Flex terminals, Toast kitchen display systems and kiosks, along with our gift card software, multichannel location management and API ecosystem integrations.\n We also expanded our relationship with Eggs Up Grill, a rapidly growing breakfast, brunch and lunch brand. Eggs Up Grill currently uses Toast point-of-sale, Toast Flexes, Toast Go devices and Toast printers. This quarter, they signed an agreement to expand Toast to an additional 30 locations. With new revenue channels developed during the pandemic, Eggs Up Grill saw a 13% increase in 2021 sales compared to 2019 and 60% ahead of 2020.\n Next week, on November 16, we'll host Spark, our inaugural restaurant innovation event. At Spark, we will share major new product releases and provide a sneak peek into our innovation road map. The name for our event is a reference to the Spark that lights a stove or an oven to make the magic of a restaurant happen. It also alludes to the spark of imagination that leads to innovation and transformative change. This all-virtual 2-hour event will consist of keynotes, product updates and guest speakers, including world-renowned chef, restaurateur, humanitarian and Toast customer, Jose Andres.\n You'll hear about how we're moving the restaurant industry forward with innovative new products that empower the restaurant, the guests and employees. If you'd like more information on attending the event, please contact our investor relations team at ir@toasttab.com or visit our website for more information and to sign up.\n As part of our continued efforts to support the restaurant community, we recently signed a public letter from the Independent Restaurant Coalition, advocating for replenishment of the restaurant revitalization fund. We've also joined the Pledge 1% movement to donate our capital to fund social impact programs through our philanthropic group, Toast.org.\n Before I turn the call over to Elena to walk you through the financials, I wanted to thank our employees, our customers, our partners and our shareholders for their support in helping us achieve a major milestone in becoming a public company. Restaurants are resilient and they make up the social fabric of our community, and we believe our commitment to aligning our success with the success of the restaurant community will lead to a stronger and exciting future ahead.\n Now I'd like to hand it over to our CFO, Elena Gomez. Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. I mean, listen, in the U.S., as of the end of Q2, we were only 6% market penetration for the TAM in the U.S. So we see a broad-based opportunity to go after the majority of TAM. If you serve 860,000 restaurants, we believe at least 2/3 of that are accessible to Toast today, both in SMB mid-market and I'd say, the lower end of enterprise. \n So we think there's a very long runway for TAM adoption and location acquisition, and we've seen broad-based momentum across the U.S. \n There's no specific geographic differences. We've just been penetrating multiple markets in parallel. Sure. We continue to innovate on the platform, for example, on multi-location management, the ability to manage menus and pricing across locations, the ability to publish across multiple locations. So those innovations are organic and continue.\n I would say the other area I would point you to is our strong partner ecosystem. It's super important to have strong APIs and an ecosystem of partners that you can cultivate so that you can offer to an enterprise brand of best-of-breed architecture. So I'd say those are the 2 areas that jump out at us in terms of levels of investment and what we need to do to support larger customers. We can. Sure. Great question, Josh. Our progress with xtraCHEF is going extremely well. The integration process has gone well. The team is continuing to execute well in terms of performance. And we're investing pretty heavily in backing innovation in and around what I would call accounts payable automation as well as food cost optimization. We think there's a unique opportunity to automate even more of the back office.\n If you think about monetizing things like bill pay and other activities on the back end of restaurants that are critical to their success to interface with suppliers, but then also optimize their costs and optimize their inventory. Running a restaurant is really difficult. And if you think about razor thin margins and the focus on operational efficiency, we think xtraCHEF really is the cornerstone of back office automation. So we're super excited about investing in that road map.\n But first steps first, we need to make sure that we execute the integration well and continue to gain adoption, and you'll see more of that in 2022. And I'll talk a little bit about this next week at Spark. Yes, I'll take it. Great question, Stephen. So yes, your premise is dead on, restaurants are forced to adapt and drive as much operational efficiency as they can with minimal staff. And much of our product around team management and handhelds allows them to sort of adapt and engage their employees and allow them to offer better service to consumers.\n So if you think about order and pay at the table and Toast Go devices, for example, that allows the staff to be that much more efficient to handle, not just existing guests, but even increase the number of tables within the restaurant that they can serve. We've seen examples of restaurants that have increased their tables while maintaining or lowering their staff, but becoming as efficient as they were in the past. So we think order and pay at the table and -- what we call digital dine-in as well as the Toast Go device allowing you to build new service models within the restaurant itself are critically important.\n And restaurants recognize that, and they recognize that these innovations really benefit them and create better employee engagement as well as better consumer experiences, to be honest with you. So I think that's going to continue to hold true even past the COVID pandemic.\n As far as where we're investing, we're investing, I'd say, broadly across many of these tools. If you look at sort of the digital dine-in experience, we're continuing to invest heavily in scan and pay at the table, order and pay at the table. We're continuing to make sure that it works in conjunction with the Toast Go device. So if the consumers and the wait staff need to complement each other, there's this continued service model, where it's not one or the other, but it's both.\n That way, a wait staff can manage many more tables, but consumers can also have the delightful experience of order and pay at the table. But then we're also broadly investing in other areas of team management in and around payroll for example, the ability to manage tips. So tune in next week, and you'll hear a little bit more about some of these products, but I'd say it's broad-based investment across the board. Yes, Brent, great question. I think we're in the early days of this adoption. I mean we're talking about new service models within the restaurant itself. So you see employees adapting to these new service models. But then you also see in parallel consumers adapting to how to use these products and consumers starting to get used to it. So I'd say we're in the early days of adoption.\n But I think we're super excited about the growth ahead because then the methodology within the restaurant starts to change. And the restaurants that are really embracing these technologies are doing much better than non-toast restaurants that aren't adopting a similar set of technologies. So we're seeing the proof points, but I'd argue much of the runway is ahead of us, and much of that opportunity is ahead of us. Yes. The first thing, DJ, is -- I mean, we've seen broad momentum. If you zoom out we've seen broad momentum of growth of our platform within restaurants and then outside of COVID, right? And I think there's 3 things that really drive restaurants to leverage our platform.\n Number one, the depth and breadth of the platform and the restaurant specificity to the functions and features that the restaurants need to operate. So we feel like we've got the broadest and deepest restaurant-specific platform in the market.\n Number two, we're obsessed with customers' happiness and building trust on the platform, and that starts in the go-to-market motion and carry through all the elements of Toast downstream. So making sure that restaurants have a great experience when they use our platform is critically important. And then number three, it's really the engine of innovation, I mean we've been innovating on this platform for 9 years. I mean we launched integrated online ordering back in 2014.\n So many of the products that restaurants are adopting were pre-COVID products that are now built into the platform, simple and easy to use, and we're expanding upon those products, but then also looking for other control points that make the lives of restaurants difficult and what can we do to collapse those control points into this unified operating system to make their life easier.\n So I'd argue that restaurants are starting to see the benefits of this type of platform to their future and Toast restaurants are proving that they can perform and perform quite well. They've been incredibly resilient, and we're proud of that. Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean we're not going to comment specifically on win rates versus any one competitor. We've seen a lot of success across the board. Like I mentioned, it's mostly due to the depth and breadth of the platform and our obsession with customer happiness and then the innovation behind that.\n But in general, we compete against legacy players, Cloud 1.0 players and point solutions, but we feel like we're in a good position to compete well and differentiate ourselves and sort of win the hearts and minds of restaurants moving forward. Yes, Dan, you're on mute. yes, we can, yes. Thanks, Dan. Thank you."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChristopher Comparato: Thank you, Michael, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Toast finished 2022 with another quarter marked by strong top line growth of over 50%, further margin improvement and continued product innovation. Our solid results throughout the year are a great testament to the quality of our battle-tested team and consistent execution on our strategy, driving location growth, more deeply serving all segments of the restaurant industry and pushing the industry forward through bold product innovation.  The complexity of running a restaurant is only increasing. This was particularly evident over the last year with restaurants facing inflation, supply chain challenges and labor constraints while continuing to adapt as guests demand a more seamless experience.  With that backdrop, the need for restaurants to leverage technology to improve efficiency, grow sales and quickly adapt is more critical than ever. And the value of Toast all in one digital platform continues to grow. We added approximately 23,000 net new locations to our platform in 2022 and the percentage of locations attaching 6 or more SaaS modules increased by nearly 10 points evidence of strong customer demand.  There are countless examples of how Toast is helping our customers deliver better top and bottom line results, including Alpine Inn, a tavern in California unlocked a 76% increase in revenue since adding Toast Mobile Order & Pay, driving higher check sizes, a better guest experience and helping manage the labor shortage.  Another example is Silver Diner, which rolled out Toast to 21 locations. Since implementing our platform, servers using Tosco handhelds are able to cover 1 to 2 more tables than before, decreasing table turn times by an average of 3 to 5 minutes, providing tangible efficiency benefits. These examples also show how our platform feeds a virtuous cycle that creates a better experience for restaurant ecosystem, enabling staff to be more efficient and effective leads to happier employees, which translates to a better experience for guests who leaves higher tips and reinforce the restaurant as a great place to work for employees.  This dynamic leads to more successful better run restaurants. And as restaurants use more of our integrated platform, it strengthens the cycle, creating powerful network effects for our customers. Restaurants operate in a competitive, rapidly evolving industry within profit margins, magnifying the importance of technology. And with the value of our industry-leading platform can offer, we see a generational opportunity to serve as the industry's technology backbone. We are still in the early stages of our potential market opportunity even after our growth over the last few years, less than 10% of U.S. restaurant locations around the Toast platform, and our Q4 ARR only represents about 2% of the $55 billion market opportunity, leaving a long runway of growth ahead as we continue to execute.  Turning to our Q4 results. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue grew 50% to $759 million. ARR increased 59% to $901 million and GPV was up 49% to $25.5 billion. Sustaining our top line momentum while delivering consistent margin expansion throughout 2022 is evidence of both the scalability of our business model and our commitment to balancing investments in key growth areas with efficiency and cost discipline.  In Q4, adjusted EBITDA improved to an $18 million loss. We also sustained healthy location growth, adding approximately 5,500 net new locations in Q4 to end the year with approximately 79,000 total live locations. We consistently executed on our proven, scalable go-to-market strategy throughout 2022, and we continue to benefit from the flywheel effects we've discussed in more and more markets.  As we increase penetration, we're confident that we can continue to efficiently grow locations and ARR. Underpinning our location growth is strong demand across restaurant segments. In addition to momentum with SMB restaurants, we continue to gain traction upmarket with larger customers as we invest in our platform.  I'll highlight a few bookings from the past quarter. After working with Toast at their bud dairy food hall location, Cameron Mitchell restaurants is rolling out Toast to all restaurant brands in their multi-concept FSR focused portfolio. They were impressed with how Toast easily supported various partners and tech integrations and saw potential for Toast to be their trusted tech partner as the company grows.  In addition to our API integrations, Cameron Mitchell is using our multi-location management module to help standardize operations and easily configure menus. They are using our Toast Go handhelds for smoother dining experiences in the front of house and our kitchen display systems to improve back-of-house operations. They also plan to trial additional features that will further help them control the guest experience.  Here, north of Boston, Michael's Harborside is a well-known waterfront eatery with a significant uptick in business in warmer months. After enduring another busy season of payroll and scheduling pain in an outdated POS, they look to Toast to help revamp their approach. In addition to our robust all-in-one platform, Michael's Harborside was attracted to our payroll and team management solution to help digitally onboard their influx of seasonal employees enable workers to independently swap shifts using our Sling app and dramatically reduce weekly time spent on payroll from the hour plus they were used to.  Michael's Harborside is also excited to leverage Toast handhelds to help servers work their various rooms, decks and outdoor dining spaces business when the busy season returns. California-based bubble T shop Teaspoon selected Toast to be their tech partner at 45 locations in their franchise-focused, rapidly expanding footprint, Teaspoon was impressed by a restaurant-specific enterprise-grade features, our strong customer references and our proven track record of onboarding and supporting franchise-based QSRs. With Toast, Teaspoon will offer franchisees a turnkey all-in-one solution that includes our Toast Go handhelds for line busting, our kitchen display systems for back-of-house experience, our digital kiosks, which they see as a real differentiator to control labor costs. They will also leverage Toast multi-location management, our scheduling and payroll products and extra chef for invoice automation.  On top of our location growth momentum, customers like Teaspoon continue to attach more products. As of the end of Q4, 41% of our customers attached 6 or more SaaS modules. That percentage has more than doubled in just 2 years thanks to our continued platform expansion, improving packaging designed to enable our sales team to efficiently attach more products at booking and the growing momentum of our multichannel upsell strategy.  These factors contributed to the subscription revenue increasing over 90% year-over-year in 2022, and we continue to see a significant opportunity to further expand SaaS ARPU over time. Helping our customers succeed by unlocking growth and increasing efficiency is at the heart of our business and is what informs our product innovation as the needs of guests rapidly evolve and the importance of developing incremental revenue streams grow, restaurants are increasingly diversifying into more service models.  Our voice of the restaurant industry survey from last year found that on average, restaurants employ 7 different service models. In Q3, we launched Toast invoicing, enabling restaurants to efficiently manage wholesale and catering orders, along with their core restaurant business in 1 integrated system. Over 5,000 customers have already used our invoicing product to streamline their billing and payment processes and with an average transaction value over $650, it's also an opportunity for these customers to grow their business.  To further expand the service models available through our platform, today, we announced the acquisition of Delphi Display Systems, a leading provider of digital menu and drive-through products Integrating Delphi into the Toast platform will enable us to offer drive-through capabilities on our platform for the first time, giving our customers the option to employ this critical service model to grow their business and offer guests a more omnichannel experience.  Adding a drive-through offering and digital menu boards enhances our offering for both small and large quick-serve restaurants. In Q2 of last year, we launched Toast for quick-serve restaurants, and we've seen strong follow-through in our funnel from QSRs over the last few quarters. Drive-thru is a critical service model for QSRs and has become an even more important over the past few years. We're excited to welcome the Delphi team to our Toast family and partner more deeply to serve these restaurants.  We plan to continue to add more capabilities to our QSR offering in 2023 to drive even deeper penetration in this segment going forward. Last week, we announced our order with Google integration, expanding our suite of digital ordering products, this capability expands the online reach of our restaurants by providing visibility in Google Search and Google Maps and unlocks another channel for customers to grow their online ordering business. Order with Google is fully integrated with our platform, making it easy for restaurants to update their menus and hours in 1 place and seamlessly manage order flow.  Together with online ordering and the Toast takeout app, we continue to offer restaurants more options to grow their off-premise business efficiently with commission-free online ordering while enabling them to offer guests a cost-efficient, seamless experience.  In addition to our broad platform, our extensive partner ecosystem continues to expand. During Q4, we exceeded 200 partners in our network, which encompasses technology integration partners, local partners and large national food and beverage suppliers. Our growing partner ecosystem gives customers access to a wide range of products and services to meet the needs of their restaurant complementing our existing expanding platform and further enhancing the value Toast provides to customers.  Over half our customers are using a partner integration today through our API module. And these customers are using 3 integrations on average. Customers that use our partner integrations have over 30% higher total ARPU and a lower churn rate than customers not using API integrations, evidence of the value our partner ecosystem adds for customers and how it enhances our platform. This is another example of the reinforcing benefits from our platform as we jointly help customers grow, our partners grow and we grow. Thank you to our partners for sharing in the mission to help the restaurant industry thrive.  So as we move into 2023, we are focused on continuing to execute on the same strategy that has been delivering consistent strong results. First, as we continue to drive location growth, customer trust will always be the foundation of everything we do. The opportunity ahead is massive and ensuring we are the trusted platform for the restaurant industry as our business scales is always our top priority. Second, product innovation is integral to our DNA. We have an exciting pipeline of new products to help restaurant owners further optimize their operations and to build on the suites of products we offer restaurants to deepen their touch points with their most important stakeholders, guests, employees and suppliers.  Third, we will keep investing to more deeply serve all segments of the restaurant industry. This includes tailored offerings to better serve restaurant types like QSRs and enhancing the capabilities for customer segments like mid-market and enterprise.  And fourth, we will continue building out our international business, while we're still very early, the potential opportunity is significant, and we look forward to taking the next steps in the multiyear journey. Our focus on balancing key investments with disciplined cost management throughout 2022 sets us up well to maintain our operating momentum and deliver another year of strong durable growth in 2023.  We expect to deliver 32% revenue growth for full year 2023 at the midpoint of our guidance range while driving further margin improvement as we progress toward adjusted EBITDA profitability by the end of the year. We remain committed to prudently investing to capitalize on the significant market opportunity while efficiently scaling our business.  As we start the year, the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain, while the restaurant industry has continued to perform relatively well, we're aware there is less visibility on consumer trends and restaurants continue to operate in a dynamic environment. Our top priority is to continue to help restaurants leverage our platform to overcome the challenges they face and emerge stronger.  The uncertainty also calls for us to remain flexible. We've proven our ability to navigate uncertainty in the past and we're well prepared to adapt quickly to any change in trends. Our progress over the last year to ensure a lean cost structure positions us to move even faster as the environment evolves and the flexibility to maintain a disciplined growth mindset as we execute against the massive opportunity ahead.  As we turn the page on 2022 and look ahead to 2023, I want to thank our growing customer community for their confidence in Toast, our employees for their focus and dedication, and our extended network of partners, investors and others who continue to support Toast and the broader restaurant community. While we've accomplished a lot together over the past year, we believe we are just getting started, and we're excited about the opportunity in the years to come.  Now I'll turn the call over to Elena.\nElena Gomez: Good morning, and thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining. I want to start with a shout out to the entire Toast team, thank you for another great quarter and consistent execution and hard work that drove our strong performance throughout the past year. We sustained our operating momentum in Q4, exceeding the high end of our range on both our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. Our industry-leading software and payments platform continues to drive solid top line growth while our commitment to scalable, efficient growth has resulted in 4 consecutive quarters of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. And we're just getting started. . We're still in the early stages of a generational opportunity to be the restaurant industry's trusted technology partner with smart targeted investments in product innovation to continue to expand our industry-leading platform combined with the same consistent disciplined execution we delivered in 2022, we believe we have a long runway of top and bottom line growth ahead.  In Q4, we added approximately 5,500 net new locations, increasing the total number of live locations on our platform to approximately 79,000, our differentiated go-to-market approach and the strong execution of our sales team led to consistent strong net location adds throughout the year, enabling us to sustain approximately 40% year-over-year location growth.  As demonstrated in many examples Chris just shared, we're seeing success across the full breadth of our restaurant segments, maintaining our strength in SMB while building momentum upmarket. Total revenue grew 50% year-over-year to $769 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2022, total revenue of $2.7 billion was up 60% from the previous year. ARR, which is our core operational metric, closed the year at $901 million, up 59% year-over-year.  Subscription revenue and fintech gross profit, the key components of our recurring revenue totaled $232 million in Q4, up 73% year-over-year, driven by our continued location growth and healthy ARPU growth across both SaaS and fintech. Our 2022 performance resulted in a total net retention rate, or NRR, of 118%. That's down from 135% in 2021. As a reminder, we anticipated the decline since 2021 benefited from GPV recovery and higher margin debit and credit non-present volume during COVID, which stabilized in 2022.  Our SaaS NRR increased 5 points to 128%, driven by our momentum and upsell, continued location expansion from existing customers and low churn. Subscription services revenue grew 76% year-over-year in Q4, while total SaaS ARPU increased nearly 20% and is up by more than 50% from 2 years ago as we continue to see new customers join the platform with higher ARPU and existing customers adopt more products.  As of the end of Q4, 41% of our restaurant locations attach 6 or more SaaS modules compared to just 32% last year, and the average SaaS ARPU for this cohort is significantly higher than our overall SaaS ARPU. This is a great example of the longer-term ARPU potential as we continue to expand the platform, optimize our packaging and refine our upsell motion.  Moving to fintech solutions. Revenue grew 52% to $640 million, and gross profit was up 71% year-over-year to $137 million in the fourth quarter. GPV growth remained solid and increased 49% to $25.5 billion in Q4. Average annualized GPV per processing location was just below $1.4 million, up 7% year-over-year and slightly below Q3 levels, in line with typical seasonal patterns.  We also continue to benefit from our nonpayment fintech products and services led by Toast Capital. These products drove approximately $24 million of gross profit in Q4. Our growing Toast Capital offering provides eligible customers with fast, flexible access to capital to grow their business. And as our customers grow and expand their business, we grow with them. For example, a steakhouse in Georgia used funds from Toast Capital to install powered curtains to enclose its patio during colder months. That opened up about 70 additional seats driving incremental sales in the winter and contributed to 20% sales growth in 2022, providing the restaurant a great ROI.  We're uniquely positioned to manage the risk profile of our portfolio and prudently scale the offering, our restaurant POS and payment processing data provides insight to assess and monitor the health of a restaurant to inform our underwriting process and pricing. Loans are repaid using a portion of each restaurant's daily payment volume reducing repayment risk. Our banking partnership also includes a loss cap to offer further protection.  These factors enable us to balance risk while helping our customers grow and continuing to expand our business. Net take rate increased to 54 basis points, driven by the growth in other fintech products, slightly offset by the seasonal higher credit mix similar to what we typically see in Q4. We expect net take rate to remain in a similar range in 2023.  In Q4, total gross profit grew 110% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter to $172 million, resulting in total gross margin of 22.4%. Looking at our recurring stream, subscription and fintech gross profit totaled $207 million in the fourth quarter, up 78% year-over-year, showcasing the power of our integrated business model.  Turning to customer acquisition costs. Hardware margins improved slightly due to lower shipping costs. Hardware revenue decreased year-over-year due to the pricing and packaging of bundled product sales. Excluding that impact, hardware revenue increased driven by upsell and location growth. Our sales and marketing investments continue to deliver solid returns as evidenced by our consistent net new location adds each quarter. We expect to continue to efficiently scale our go-to-market engine as we drive deeper penetration and build a flywheel effect in more markets over time.  Managing customer acquisition costs and maintaining healthy unit economics is a key focus as we scale the business and help inform our investment decisions. For the full year in 2022, our payback period was in line with our expectations at approximately 15 months. We remain confident in our ability to scale our unit economics as we benefit from increasing market penetration, the rep tenure driving the productivity of our sales team, opportunities to optimize hardware costs and continued momentum in ARPU growth.  As Chris highlighted, our order with Google integration is the latest example of the ongoing product innovation resulting from our R&D investments and we have an exciting pipeline of new products and capabilities on tap for 2023 that will further enhance our platform and unlock more value for our customers and drive sustained ARPU in location over the long term.  In Q4, total general and administrative expenses increased 39% year-over-year. Excluding bad debt and credit-related expenses, G&A expenses grew 5% year-over-year as we started to lap the step-up in public company costs and benefit from operating leverage. Bad debt and credit-related expenses totaled $18 million in Q4, which includes bad debt on outstanding receivables as well as liabilities related to Toast Capital and other fintech offerings.  As a reminder, we expect bad debt and credit-related expenses related to Toast Capital to increase as we grow the program. The overall operating margin for Toast Capital is healthy and accretive to the overall business, and we believe indicative of the health of the program.  Total Q4 adjusted EBITDA was negative $18 million and margin was 2.3% over 600 basis points improvement from the prior year. This progress is a direct result of our focus on having a lean cost structure combined with durable top line growth. The improvements to our cost structure and commitment to disciplined investing and efficiency put us in a great position to drive sustained margin improvements in 2023 and increase our ability to adapt quickly in this dynamic environment.  Now let me turn to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $745 million to $775 million, representing 42% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of negative $30 million to negative $20 million. Our guidance reflects a typical seasonal decline in GPV per processing location as Q1 is historically the lowest quarter of the year.  For full year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.66 billion, which represents 32% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, negative $10 million. At the midpoint, this implies a 370 basis point margin improvement and nearly $100 million profit improvement compared to 2022. We also remain on target to deliver a quarterly adjusted EBITDA profit by the end of 2023.  To provide some additional context on our guidance, we intend to maintain a balanced approach in 2023 with disciplined targeted investments to capitalize on the opportunity to be the trusted platform for the restaurant industry, while staying lean and efficient as we scale. We also plan to make further investments in longer-term initiatives, such as building enterprise capabilities and expanding internationally, which both expand our market opportunity and position Toast for sustained strong growth over the long term.  Now looking beyond 2023, we're confident that our integrated software and payments model will continue to scale efficiently, as total subscription plus fintech gross profit in our core business compounds over time, we expect to show meaningful operating leverage. As we achieve larger scale, we expect adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total subscription plus fintech gross profit to reach 30% to 35% range.  This financial profile reflects our current business mix and does not factor in the impact from nascent long-term opportunities like expansion into enterprise segment or international. We intend to execute the same playbook going forward balancing efficiency and margin improvement with disciplined targeted investments to capitalize on the massive opportunity in our core business, which we believe will drive several years of sustained strong growth.  As we balance growth and profitability each year, our goal is to consistently exceed the rule of 40 on the path to our target margin -- target financial profile. Certain years that may mean delivering more margin expansion and in some years, we may decide to invest more to deepen penetration or increase our ARPU potential. We'll assess those decisions in the context of optimizing our long-term cash flow potential.  And given the size of the opportunity ahead and the power of our integrated software and payments model, we expect to operate above the Rule of 40 even as our core business grows into this margin profile. Subscription and fintech are our recurring gross profit streams and the basis on which we operate the business and serves as the anchor for our margin and how we assess our operating expenses. We expect a combination of improving unit economics and leverage on overhead cost to drive the path to 30% to 35% margins.  I'll highlight a few key areas we will see leverage as our total ARR continues to scale. In addition, as we've discussed, sales and rep productivity is correlated with both rep tenure and market penetration. We've seen this dynamic play out in our flywheel markets and expect that as we continue to drive higher penetration and as rep tenure increases, sales and marketing costs will continue to become more efficient.  Longer term, we expect hardware and services margin to improve as we see the full benefit from shift to lower cost shipping and further supply chain optimization plus increased efficiency in onboarding new customers. Our focus on cost discipline and efficiency will also be evident in G&A. We expect operating leverage starting in 2023 and our underlying G&A expenses to benefit from automation and increased scale over time. Our long-term G&A profile also factors in credit liability expenses proportionate with the growth in Toast Capital.  In closing, 2022 was a strong year for Toast, and we continue to have a lot of conviction about our long-term opportunity. The consistent execution across the company led to durable growth where our focus on efficiency and disciplined cost management drove meaningfully margin improvement. We remain in very early stages of an incredible market opportunity and are confident that continuing to relentlessly execute our strategy will lead to sustained location and ARPU growth and create significant long-term shareholder value. I want to thank all of our employees customers and partners, and we look forward to an exciting 2023.  Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho.\nDan Dolev: Great results. Much appreciate it. So I do have a question about -- 2 questions, a question and a quick follow-up about the SaaS thing. So -- if I look at your SaaS growth, revenue per customer was basically like flattish and like slightly down year-over-year. And what happened there? Like I think a lot of people were very bullish or expecting with massive growth in that SaaS revenue per customer? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nElena Gomez: Yes. So SaaS -- so first of all, I just want to complement our upsell team and our growth team for positioning the platform and really, we're seeing a lot of momentum there. And I also want to remind you that our SaaS ARPU overall is up 20%, Dan, and over 2 years, up 50%. So I just want to start there and provide that context. And also SaaS revenue in Q4 was up 75%. So really, really actually proud of way the team has executed. And we're going to continue to see progress as we innovate more on our platform, we're going to continue to see more customers bringing on more upfront as we land customers at a higher ARPU, but also our upsell team is having really good progress so far.\nDan Dolev: Got it. It's really helpful. And then my follow-up is on like ARPU trends into 2023. How should we think about the pace of location ads in 2023 and the cadence for the year?\nElena Gomez: Yes. In terms of location ads, like, first of all, again, a complement to the execution by the sales team in 2022, and we continue to see momentum heading into 2023. The funnel is strong and the sales team is executing well. So the 1 thing I would point you to is Q1 seasonally typically lower than Q2 and Q3. So just keep that in mind. But we continue to believe we've got momentum in the business at this point.\nDan Dolev: Great. Great results. Congratulations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.\nStephen Sheldon: I wanted to start with, I guess, a more high-level question. And I know you're still early in gaining market share across most markets. But if you just looked at some of your more mature markets, does it seem like location market share caps out or slows down in a certain threshold? And maybe it's still too early to know that, but I guess asked another way, do you think it's harder to get that initial 20% location market share in a certain market? Or is it harder to get the next 20% if you more frequently have to unseat another SaaS incumbent. And I guess even with some of the flywheel dynamics that you're clearly seeing.\nChristopher Comparato: Yes, Stephen, great question. Look, I think we continue to see the same dynamic where as we gain market share and get market density and rep tenure up in these markets, the productivity of our reps and our ease continues to improve. That's the trend we continue to see. And I think that's not only in terms of the productivity, but also the win rates we see against our competitors. And so there is nothing in our data that we're seeing that says that we can continue to grow into plywood markets. And I think in terms of your question, whether it's the first 20% of the last 20%, I'll tell you the first 10% is what's the hardest.\nStephen Sheldon: Got it. That's really helpful. And just a follow-up, great to see the order with Google integration, would love to get your thoughts on how big of an opportunity that might be, what kind of topline growth implications there could and whether those any notable impact on unit economics for orders and payments that flow through there relative to your existing online ordering solutions?\nChristopher Comparato: Yes, it's a good question. I think it's super important for any restaurant to meet the guest and consumer where they are. So we're pretty bullish on the opportunity with Google. Seamlessly integrating with them so as our consumer is on Google Maps or searching on Google and then connecting to the restaurants first-party online ordering capability is a critical success factor and it streamlines both the revenue attach as well as the productivity of the teams. It also eliminates third-party restaurant should be taken advantage of that and we think it's a unique opportunity in the market.\nStephen Sheldon: Great. Nice results.\nOperator: The next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse.\nTimothy Chiodo: I want to talk a little bit about the net take rate for fintech. So 54 basis points in the quarter. And the comment was that next year, the expectation is for that take rate to be roughly in that same range. But given some of the pricing comments by Clover and Fiserv overall in the last quarter, they saw a big yield uptick and took some pricing. There's also the ramping of Toast Capital. And there's also been some reports of tests of price increases that you've been considering in the marketplace. Those 3 factors suggest that maybe there could be some upside to that take rate. And I was hoping you could just comment on those factors and the pricing changes in particular.\nElena Gomez: Yes. No. So good question, Tim. Thanks for the question. First of all, complement to the Toast Capital team for the momentum and really the fact that we're meeting the demand that we're seeing from our customers on Toast Capital, and that definitely plays into the take rate for the quarter. And just remember that Q4 credit is seasonally higher. So in Q4, we had in our core take rate a bit of a lower take rate, of course. But just keep in mind, year-over-year, our take rate has increased.  And then I think what we often talk about, and I'll just remind everyone, we're always focused on both pricing and cost optimization, but cost optimization is important over the long term. And that's just a muscle that we have built in the company that we're focused on. And then finally, I would just zoom out and say that the take rate overall, there's opportunity to -- a longer-term opportunity to offer products to drive more payment volume and drive more digital transaction. And then, of course, there's opportunity to optimize pricing. And I'll let Aman comment on your specific question around pricing.\nAman Narang: Sure. Thanks, Elena. Tim, look, we're focused on gaining market share, right? And we're always testing pricing, like pricing and packaging is something we're always optimizing, but there's nothing material to report in terms of changes in our pricing and our take rate.\nTimothy Chiodo: Okay. I really appreciate that. The very, very brief follow-up is you mentioned the $24 million, I believe, for Q4 for Toast Capital and take card, and it was $17 million last quarter. So I might have missed it. Did you give a full year number for those or just the second half?\nElena Gomez: No, we haven't given the full year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rayna Kumar with UBS.\nRayna Kumar: You gave some really helpful detail on the macro backdrop. Just curious on your actual '23 guidance. Does that assume macro gets worse or it remains as is?\nElena Gomez: Yes, it's a fair question. We contemplated the macro and our guidance was with that in the backdrop, we felt like our guidance was prudent just given that there's uncertainty out there. But we've seen resilience in our customers and restaurants in the past. So that's also in our calculus as well.\nRayna Kumar: Got it. That's helpful. And then you continue to improve the percentage of customers using elective products. Can you talk a little bit about how demand has evolved for elective products in recent months? And are you finding it easier or more difficult to sell these products given the macro environment we're in?\nChristopher Comparato: I think it's less about the macro environment, and it's more about restaurants wanting to adopt an all-in-one solution and then also have really strong -- really strong partner ecosystem on top of that platform. So at the end of the day, if you think about the restaurants challenges, they're facing labor challenges, inflation and how to drive top line growth.  So having a platform that connects those dots and allows them to be much more efficient is what we're after. So we're seeing that value proposition resonate in the market, both for SMB as well as upmarket. And we want to make sure that we give them great technology at their fingertips to drive improvements and do that with our partner ecosystem as well. So we're seeing that broader adoption of modules based on that value proposition.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Great growth here. Just wanted to -- I think, Elena, or Chris, you mentioned exciting new products for fiscal '23. Just curious, is that more of the Google variety or products on enterprise? Just hoping to give a little bit more flavor on the power of a map here for the year.\nChristopher Comparato: Yes. No, it's a good question. You're going to see pilots and opportunities across all lines of business. So both guest facing. You think about the Delphi acquisition this morning, bringing Ken and the team into our fold so that we can more broadly serve QSR restaurants, specifically with drive-through capabilities. So you're going to see guest-facing opportunities, employee-facing opportunities within our employee cloud and payroll management solution. And then obviously, in the back office, as restaurants fight food cost inflation in and around extra chef is a unique opportunity to continue to show visibility and price tracking across the restaurant sector so that they can optimize their spend. So I'd say it's a broad-based attack on different opportunities across the different stakeholders. But again, with the mission of empowering restaurants of all types to improve their operations.\nTien-Tsin Huang: I appreciate that response. Just my quick follow-up then, maybe just thinking about -- I know a lot of questions around the outlook here. But are you expecting a high level any change in growth composition between location growth and ARPU in '23 versus '22? Just trying to get a sense of relative growth here in we should expect to change?\nElena Gomez: Yes. No, the composition sensing of our location should be relatively consistent. Like I think the 1 thing we said is the platform resonates with various parts of the market. So whether it's QSR, FSR, or whether it's smaller-format restaurants, larger format restaurants. So I think the breadth of our offering has allowed us to resonate in different parts of the TAM. And so we expect that to be consistent.\nChristopher Comparato: On the product side, we're just constantly investing to increase our TAM -- and then SaaS, as Elena mentioned, on the call, is up 20% year-over-year, and we continue -- expect to continue to see that in '23 as well.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Great. Thanks for the thoughts.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley.\nJoshua Baer: Great. Thanks for the question. With Delphi coming on board and innovations around QSR and hospitality, not so long ago, what are some of the other big areas of innovation, product features, functionality that are needed to further unlock upmarket?\nChristopher Comparato: Yes. Very similar to what I just mentioned, Josh. I think you're going to see us push out solutions in our platform that help each stakeholder in the restaurants thrive. So guest-facing omnichannel experiences, we want restaurants to meet the guest where they are. So whether it's online through a search through Google or in drive-thru or in-store through kiosk or at the table, we want to make sure that we create an amazing set of guest experiences and service models that allow the restaurant to drive top line, but then also allow their staff to be productive. If you go inside the restaurant, a good example with Silver Diner, we're seeing progress on staff productivity amidst labor changes for restaurants gaining productivity through our platform so that they can better treat their guests, have staff productivity go up and then see happier consumers, happier employees, higher tips and wages, higher ticket sizes and a flywheel within the restaurant that improves the restaurant itself.  And then as I mentioned in the back office, we believe there's opportunities to better connect food cost optimization back into the supply chain so that the restaurant is optimizing their cost. So you're going to see opportunities across these different stakeholder groups. And that's what gets us excited about the all-in-one platform because our mission is to make sure that we're advancing this platform so that all of these stakeholders can thrive.\nJoshua Baer: Is there any appetite to accelerate international expansion through M&A?\nElena Gomez: Right now, it's a fair question. I mean I think just our overall M&A philosophy for international isn't different than it is for our overall business. So we're looking at is there something that gets us to market faster? Or is there something that's complementary to our product road map.  Right now, our focus is building off of the foundation we started in 2022 internationally, and I don't anticipate that will have a material impact or a meaningful impact anyway in 2023.\nOperator: The next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs.\nWilliam Nance: Can you spend a little time on some of the macro trends that you guys saw throughout the fourth quarter and into the first quarter? We've heard from other some sort of SMB software-oriented names in the market talking about a temporary slowdown and uptake on new software platforms. I'd note the kind of software ARPU expansion was a little lower, net adds a little lower than in the third quarter. The recent retail sales data, particularly for dining, suggests that spending has been particularly robust in January or into 2023 though. So maybe you could just talk about some of the macro trends you're seeing and how things kind of progressed over the fourth quarter and whether you guys are seeing the same sort of traction in the end market so far in 2023?\nChristopher Comparato: Sure. Good question, Will. So we're not seeing meaningful changes in consumer demand or spending across our business. So restaurants are seeing demand, and it's in line with our expectations for what I would call historic seasonality trends. We continue to see consumers moving more spend to services like dining out versus food at home. Certainly, January, some of the signals from January on retail sales were strong with continued strength for food services, but we're not really seeing any material or meaningful impact in consumer demand or across restaurants.  As we've mentioned before, I think we mentioned this last quarter, consumer spend on dining has proven pretty resilient during past economic slowdowns. So I think that keeps us optimistic that what we're seeing will hopefully continue. That being said, we're pretty mindful of the mixed macro signals and we're monitoring things closely.  I think the last point I would make is our platform really helps restaurants adapt and be resilient during tough times. And if you look at the past 2.5 years, we've been incredibly successful allowing restaurants to adjust their business, adapt and have stronger survivability. So I think our platform becomes really valuable in tough market conditions, and that's what we're seeing with things like our SaaS ARPU growth and customers using more modules on the platform.  So in general, it's stay the course and continue to be mindful of the signals that are out there.\nElena Gomez: Yes. And also, Josh, I would tell you 2 things. One is our location adds in Q4 were in line with what we expected and comparable to Q3. So not down and not below our expectations. And I'd also reinforce our ARPU is up year-over-year, 20% and up over 2 years, 50%. So just keep that in mind as you consider Q4. .\nWilliam Nance: Got it. Yes. I see those numbers. And then maybe a follow-up question on Toast Capital. The relationship, I think you mentioned on the timing and some of the rev rec on revenues, and most of that is upfront upon origination. Can you just talk through kind of the drivers of that bad debt expense on a quarterly basis? You kind of called out the sum total of all of credit-related expenses in the P&L. Like how do we think about the relationship between that and revenue? Is that also largely booked upfront?\nElena Gomez: Yes. So the way to think about that is -- and so without we gave you sort of a proxy, but the way to think about what drives that is really the tenure of the loan. So if it's a 90-day, 270-day or 360 day, that's going to have a different reserve, if you will. And then the creditworthiness of the customers, so all the typical underwriting that you would expect plays into how we reserve for potential future losses. That's the analysis that the team does.\nWilliam Nance: Got it. And most of that is booked upfront at origination as opposed to over the life of loan?\nElena Gomez: Correct.\nWilliam Nance: I appreciate you take my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe.\nDarrin Peller: Nice results. Could we just touch on the thought process around the profitability cadence again. I know you've talked about it and that was really helpful, the slide you gave us on the long-term margins. But just considering your views on trade-off on investments and timing on inflection and really just updated thoughts on when you think we could be showing more pronounced profitability levels would love to hear some thoughts.\nElena Gomez: Yes. Thanks for the question. So I think, hopefully, you can see from how we've executed in the last year that we've consistently delivered margin improvement. And so that's pretty intentional focus by this management team that won't change. And so we're going to continue to balance and that's a really important thing I want people to hear is we're going to balance this opportunity because we have so much conviction about our opportunity at this moment.  And so as you think about the next couple of years, we're going to continue to still have healthy growth, but at the same time, continue to deliver margin expansion with this idea that we're going to be balancing and exceeding the Rule of 40. That's how we -- our ambition is to plan in that way. So that's what I would tell you.  And I think it's important for you to realize that we will not -- our path to that margin profile may not always be linear. So as opportunities present themselves, we want that flexibility to kind of lean into that investment.\nDarrin Peller: That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up, and I appreciate that. I just -- if you could just touch on how the front book ARPU has trended? Is it still around 6,000 level you guys have spoken about in the past? Or is it change at all?\nElena Gomez: No, we're definitely in that zone. .\nDarrin Peller: Great. Great. It looks like there's some some traction going forward. All right. Appreciate it, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Beck with KeyBanc.\nJosh Beck: I want to ask a little bit about the payback assumption. Certainly, a really good result this year in the mid-teens. And it sounds like efficiency-wise, you feel like there's more opportunity. So as we look forward into '23 and beyond, how important is headcount growth? And is that a good reference point just to think about in terms of efficiency?\nElena Gomez: Yes. I mean, I think -- so a couple of things. One is we always sort of manage to that mid-teens, Josh. And -- the commentary we tend to make on flywheel markets is really important because that -- as we see more rep tenure and we get deeper into a market, we're going to see productivity increase, and we're going to see that play out.  And so as we continue to replicate these flywheel markets, the need to add capacity that we've added like as an example that we've added in the last few years will be less, right? We should be able to continue to increase rep productivity, which will drive some of that leverage that we anticipate and will allow us to stay within the payback periods that we feel are healthy.\nChristopher Comparato: And just to add to that, Josh, we've been opportunistic. So the upsell team, for example, we've seen good progress in ARPU growth, good -- the attach rates of our guest products are holding as we adding more locations. There's lots of upside on our extra shaft and payroll products given they aren't penetrated in our base. So we're investing in some of the emerging markets and upsell -- but to Elena's point, the biggest driver we feel in our mature markets is really driving market density and driving the tenure were reps up.\nJosh Beck: Okay. And then maybe a follow-up a little bit to Darren's question just around the target P&L. Thank you for the the framework. It's very helpful. But yes, I mean, how should we frame up the horizon around the type of scale that's required. And then what type of impact could because I believe that, that profile excludes enterprise and international like should those factors be included? Would it be more so in the sales and marketing, go-to-market spend? Just curious how to think about those 2 items?\nElena Gomez: Yes. No, thanks for the call out. You're exactly right. Look, I consider those emerging investments to more like options to continue to sustain our growth over time. But I think what you should hear is we have a big opportunity ahead, and we feel confident we can continue to compound our ARR and fintech gross profit for the next -- for the years -- next years to come. And that's going to be both continued R&D investment, obviously, to continue to deepen our penetration and drive more ARPU.  And the 1 way to think about it is we'll be -- what we'd like to think is that at a larger scale, we can drive that profit margin profile. So -- that's probably the best way I can think about it. I don't want to be precise on the timing because, as I said, we want to have that flexibility to invest into opportunities as the market evolves, but we'll always kind of come back to this notion that we want to exceed the Rule of 40 over time.\nDarrin Peller: Makes sense.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from the line of Andrew Bauch with SMBC Nikko.\nAndrew Bauch: First question on Delphi. How much of this are you contributing in the full year revenue guide or from the EBITDA perspective. And then have a quick follow-up after that.\nElena Gomez: Yes. Delphi is not material to our 2023 P&L. But it is important strategically to our QSR offering. So just consider that over the long term.\nAndrew Bauch: Got it. And then looking at the long-term financial profile, very helpful to kind of pick apart of these pieces. Could you give us a sense on what you're using there for your terminal fintech and subscription gross margins potentially on each line?\nElena Gomez: Yes, we're not going to give that detail. But overall, I think you should expect to see leverage in the entire business over time, but we're going to continue to balance that with investing in R&D and innovation, obviously, to continue to drive that ARPU over time.\nAndrew Bauch: But the gross margin line should be fairly stable, we can assume? .\nElena Gomez: I'm not going to comment on that.\nAndrew Bauch: All right.\nOperator: Those are all the questions we have time for today. So I would like to turn the call back over to the presenters.\nChristopher Comparato: Okay. Thank you all. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining. I want to start with a shout out to the entire Toast team, thank you for another great quarter and consistent execution and hard work that drove our strong performance throughout the past year. We sustained our operating momentum in Q4, exceeding the high end of our range on both our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. Our industry-leading software and payments platform continues to drive solid top line growth while our commitment to scalable, efficient growth has resulted in 4 consecutive quarters of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. And we're just getting started. . We're still in the early stages of a generational opportunity to be the restaurant industry's trusted technology partner with smart targeted investments in product innovation to continue to expand our industry-leading platform combined with the same consistent disciplined execution we delivered in 2022, we believe we have a long runway of top and bottom line growth ahead.  In Q4, we added approximately 5,500 net new locations, increasing the total number of live locations on our platform to approximately 79,000, our differentiated go-to-market approach and the strong execution of our sales team led to consistent strong net location adds throughout the year, enabling us to sustain approximately 40% year-over-year location growth.  As demonstrated in many examples Chris just shared, we're seeing success across the full breadth of our restaurant segments, maintaining our strength in SMB while building momentum upmarket. Total revenue grew 50% year-over-year to $769 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2022, total revenue of $2.7 billion was up 60% from the previous year. ARR, which is our core operational metric, closed the year at $901 million, up 59% year-over-year.  Subscription revenue and fintech gross profit, the key components of our recurring revenue totaled $232 million in Q4, up 73% year-over-year, driven by our continued location growth and healthy ARPU growth across both SaaS and fintech. Our 2022 performance resulted in a total net retention rate, or NRR, of 118%. That's down from 135% in 2021. As a reminder, we anticipated the decline since 2021 benefited from GPV recovery and higher margin debit and credit non-present volume during COVID, which stabilized in 2022.  Our SaaS NRR increased 5 points to 128%, driven by our momentum and upsell, continued location expansion from existing customers and low churn. Subscription services revenue grew 76% year-over-year in Q4, while total SaaS ARPU increased nearly 20% and is up by more than 50% from 2 years ago as we continue to see new customers join the platform with higher ARPU and existing customers adopt more products.  As of the end of Q4, 41% of our restaurant locations attach 6 or more SaaS modules compared to just 32% last year, and the average SaaS ARPU for this cohort is significantly higher than our overall SaaS ARPU. This is a great example of the longer-term ARPU potential as we continue to expand the platform, optimize our packaging and refine our upsell motion.  Moving to fintech solutions. Revenue grew 52% to $640 million, and gross profit was up 71% year-over-year to $137 million in the fourth quarter. GPV growth remained solid and increased 49% to $25.5 billion in Q4. Average annualized GPV per processing location was just below $1.4 million, up 7% year-over-year and slightly below Q3 levels, in line with typical seasonal patterns.  We also continue to benefit from our nonpayment fintech products and services led by Toast Capital. These products drove approximately $24 million of gross profit in Q4. Our growing Toast Capital offering provides eligible customers with fast, flexible access to capital to grow their business. And as our customers grow and expand their business, we grow with them. For example, a steakhouse in Georgia used funds from Toast Capital to install powered curtains to enclose its patio during colder months. That opened up about 70 additional seats driving incremental sales in the winter and contributed to 20% sales growth in 2022, providing the restaurant a great ROI.  We're uniquely positioned to manage the risk profile of our portfolio and prudently scale the offering, our restaurant POS and payment processing data provides insight to assess and monitor the health of a restaurant to inform our underwriting process and pricing. Loans are repaid using a portion of each restaurant's daily payment volume reducing repayment risk. Our banking partnership also includes a loss cap to offer further protection.  These factors enable us to balance risk while helping our customers grow and continuing to expand our business. Net take rate increased to 54 basis points, driven by the growth in other fintech products, slightly offset by the seasonal higher credit mix similar to what we typically see in Q4. We expect net take rate to remain in a similar range in 2023.  In Q4, total gross profit grew 110% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter to $172 million, resulting in total gross margin of 22.4%. Looking at our recurring stream, subscription and fintech gross profit totaled $207 million in the fourth quarter, up 78% year-over-year, showcasing the power of our integrated business model.  Turning to customer acquisition costs. Hardware margins improved slightly due to lower shipping costs. Hardware revenue decreased year-over-year due to the pricing and packaging of bundled product sales. Excluding that impact, hardware revenue increased driven by upsell and location growth. Our sales and marketing investments continue to deliver solid returns as evidenced by our consistent net new location adds each quarter. We expect to continue to efficiently scale our go-to-market engine as we drive deeper penetration and build a flywheel effect in more markets over time.  Managing customer acquisition costs and maintaining healthy unit economics is a key focus as we scale the business and help inform our investment decisions. For the full year in 2022, our payback period was in line with our expectations at approximately 15 months. We remain confident in our ability to scale our unit economics as we benefit from increasing market penetration, the rep tenure driving the productivity of our sales team, opportunities to optimize hardware costs and continued momentum in ARPU growth.  As Chris highlighted, our order with Google integration is the latest example of the ongoing product innovation resulting from our R&D investments and we have an exciting pipeline of new products and capabilities on tap for 2023 that will further enhance our platform and unlock more value for our customers and drive sustained ARPU in location over the long term.  In Q4, total general and administrative expenses increased 39% year-over-year. Excluding bad debt and credit-related expenses, G&A expenses grew 5% year-over-year as we started to lap the step-up in public company costs and benefit from operating leverage. Bad debt and credit-related expenses totaled $18 million in Q4, which includes bad debt on outstanding receivables as well as liabilities related to Toast Capital and other fintech offerings.  As a reminder, we expect bad debt and credit-related expenses related to Toast Capital to increase as we grow the program. The overall operating margin for Toast Capital is healthy and accretive to the overall business, and we believe indicative of the health of the program.  Total Q4 adjusted EBITDA was negative $18 million and margin was 2.3% over 600 basis points improvement from the prior year. This progress is a direct result of our focus on having a lean cost structure combined with durable top line growth. The improvements to our cost structure and commitment to disciplined investing and efficiency put us in a great position to drive sustained margin improvements in 2023 and increase our ability to adapt quickly in this dynamic environment.  Now let me turn to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $745 million to $775 million, representing 42% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of negative $30 million to negative $20 million. Our guidance reflects a typical seasonal decline in GPV per processing location as Q1 is historically the lowest quarter of the year.  For full year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.66 billion, which represents 32% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, negative $10 million. At the midpoint, this implies a 370 basis point margin improvement and nearly $100 million profit improvement compared to 2022. We also remain on target to deliver a quarterly adjusted EBITDA profit by the end of 2023.  To provide some additional context on our guidance, we intend to maintain a balanced approach in 2023 with disciplined targeted investments to capitalize on the opportunity to be the trusted platform for the restaurant industry, while staying lean and efficient as we scale. We also plan to make further investments in longer-term initiatives, such as building enterprise capabilities and expanding internationally, which both expand our market opportunity and position Toast for sustained strong growth over the long term.  Now looking beyond 2023, we're confident that our integrated software and payments model will continue to scale efficiently, as total subscription plus fintech gross profit in our core business compounds over time, we expect to show meaningful operating leverage. As we achieve larger scale, we expect adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total subscription plus fintech gross profit to reach 30% to 35% range.  This financial profile reflects our current business mix and does not factor in the impact from nascent long-term opportunities like expansion into enterprise segment or international. We intend to execute the same playbook going forward balancing efficiency and margin improvement with disciplined targeted investments to capitalize on the massive opportunity in our core business, which we believe will drive several years of sustained strong growth.  As we balance growth and profitability each year, our goal is to consistently exceed the rule of 40 on the path to our target margin -- target financial profile. Certain years that may mean delivering more margin expansion and in some years, we may decide to invest more to deepen penetration or increase our ARPU potential. We'll assess those decisions in the context of optimizing our long-term cash flow potential.  And given the size of the opportunity ahead and the power of our integrated software and payments model, we expect to operate above the Rule of 40 even as our core business grows into this margin profile. Subscription and fintech are our recurring gross profit streams and the basis on which we operate the business and serves as the anchor for our margin and how we assess our operating expenses. We expect a combination of improving unit economics and leverage on overhead cost to drive the path to 30% to 35% margins.  I'll highlight a few key areas we will see leverage as our total ARR continues to scale. In addition, as we've discussed, sales and rep productivity is correlated with both rep tenure and market penetration. We've seen this dynamic play out in our flywheel markets and expect that as we continue to drive higher penetration and as rep tenure increases, sales and marketing costs will continue to become more efficient.  Longer term, we expect hardware and services margin to improve as we see the full benefit from shift to lower cost shipping and further supply chain optimization plus increased efficiency in onboarding new customers. Our focus on cost discipline and efficiency will also be evident in G&A. We expect operating leverage starting in 2023 and our underlying G&A expenses to benefit from automation and increased scale over time. Our long-term G&A profile also factors in credit liability expenses proportionate with the growth in Toast Capital.  In closing, 2022 was a strong year for Toast, and we continue to have a lot of conviction about our long-term opportunity. The consistent execution across the company led to durable growth where our focus on efficiency and disciplined cost management drove meaningfully margin improvement. We remain in very early stages of an incredible market opportunity and are confident that continuing to relentlessly execute our strategy will lead to sustained location and ARPU growth and create significant long-term shareholder value. I want to thank all of our employees customers and partners, and we look forward to an exciting 2023.  Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A. Yes. So SaaS -- so first of all, I just want to complement our upsell team and our growth team for positioning the platform and really, we're seeing a lot of momentum there. And I also want to remind you that our SaaS ARPU overall is up 20%, Dan, and over 2 years, up 50%. So I just want to start there and provide that context. And also SaaS revenue in Q4 was up 75%. So really, really actually proud of way the team has executed. And we're going to continue to see progress as we innovate more on our platform, we're going to continue to see more customers bringing on more upfront as we land customers at a higher ARPU, but also our upsell team is having really good progress so far. Yes. In terms of location ads, like, first of all, again, a complement to the execution by the sales team in 2022, and we continue to see momentum heading into 2023. The funnel is strong and the sales team is executing well. So the 1 thing I would point you to is Q1 seasonally typically lower than Q2 and Q3. So just keep that in mind. But we continue to believe we've got momentum in the business at this point. Yes. No. So good question, Tim. Thanks for the question. First of all, complement to the Toast Capital team for the momentum and really the fact that we're meeting the demand that we're seeing from our customers on Toast Capital, and that definitely plays into the take rate for the quarter. And just remember that Q4 credit is seasonally higher. So in Q4, we had in our core take rate a bit of a lower take rate, of course. But just keep in mind, year-over-year, our take rate has increased.  And then I think what we often talk about, and I'll just remind everyone, we're always focused on both pricing and cost optimization, but cost optimization is important over the long term. And that's just a muscle that we have built in the company that we're focused on. And then finally, I would just zoom out and say that the take rate overall, there's opportunity to -- a longer-term opportunity to offer products to drive more payment volume and drive more digital transaction. And then, of course, there's opportunity to optimize pricing. And I'll let Aman comment on your specific question around pricing. No, we haven't given the full year. Yes, it's a fair question. We contemplated the macro and our guidance was with that in the backdrop, we felt like our guidance was prudent just given that there's uncertainty out there. But we've seen resilience in our customers and restaurants in the past. So that's also in our calculus as well. Yes. No, the composition sensing of our location should be relatively consistent. Like I think the 1 thing we said is the platform resonates with various parts of the market. So whether it's QSR, FSR, or whether it's smaller-format restaurants, larger format restaurants. So I think the breadth of our offering has allowed us to resonate in different parts of the TAM. And so we expect that to be consistent. Right now, it's a fair question. I mean I think just our overall M&A philosophy for international isn't different than it is for our overall business. So we're looking at is there something that gets us to market faster? Or is there something that's complementary to our product road map.  Right now, our focus is building off of the foundation we started in 2022 internationally, and I don't anticipate that will have a material impact or a meaningful impact anyway in 2023. Yes. And also, Josh, I would tell you 2 things. One is our location adds in Q4 were in line with what we expected and comparable to Q3. So not down and not below our expectations. And I'd also reinforce our ARPU is up year-over-year, 20% and up over 2 years, 50%. So just keep that in mind as you consider Q4. . Yes. So the way to think about that is -- and so without we gave you sort of a proxy, but the way to think about what drives that is really the tenure of the loan. So if it's a 90-day, 270-day or 360 day, that's going to have a different reserve, if you will. And then the creditworthiness of the customers, so all the typical underwriting that you would expect plays into how we reserve for potential future losses. That's the analysis that the team does. Correct. Yes. Thanks for the question. So I think, hopefully, you can see from how we've executed in the last year that we've consistently delivered margin improvement. And so that's pretty intentional focus by this management team that won't change. And so we're going to continue to balance and that's a really important thing I want people to hear is we're going to balance this opportunity because we have so much conviction about our opportunity at this moment.  And so as you think about the next couple of years, we're going to continue to still have healthy growth, but at the same time, continue to deliver margin expansion with this idea that we're going to be balancing and exceeding the Rule of 40. That's how we -- our ambition is to plan in that way. So that's what I would tell you.  And I think it's important for you to realize that we will not -- our path to that margin profile may not always be linear. So as opportunities present themselves, we want that flexibility to kind of lean into that investment. No, we're definitely in that zone. . Yes. I mean, I think -- so a couple of things. One is we always sort of manage to that mid-teens, Josh. And -- the commentary we tend to make on flywheel markets is really important because that -- as we see more rep tenure and we get deeper into a market, we're going to see productivity increase, and we're going to see that play out.  And so as we continue to replicate these flywheel markets, the need to add capacity that we've added like as an example that we've added in the last few years will be less, right? We should be able to continue to increase rep productivity, which will drive some of that leverage that we anticipate and will allow us to stay within the payback periods that we feel are healthy. Yes. No, thanks for the call out. You're exactly right. Look, I consider those emerging investments to more like options to continue to sustain our growth over time. But I think what you should hear is we have a big opportunity ahead, and we feel confident we can continue to compound our ARR and fintech gross profit for the next -- for the years -- next years to come. And that's going to be both continued R&D investment, obviously, to continue to deepen our penetration and drive more ARPU.  And the 1 way to think about it is we'll be -- what we'd like to think is that at a larger scale, we can drive that profit margin profile. So -- that's probably the best way I can think about it. I don't want to be precise on the timing because, as I said, we want to have that flexibility to invest into opportunities as the market evolves, but we'll always kind of come back to this notion that we want to exceed the Rule of 40 over time. Yes. Delphi is not material to our 2023 P&L. But it is important strategically to our QSR offering. So just consider that over the long term. Yes, we're not going to give that detail. But overall, I think you should expect to see leverage in the entire business over time, but we're going to continue to balance that with investing in R&D and innovation, obviously, to continue to drive that ARPU over time. I'm not going to comment on that."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Toast finished 2022 with another quarter marked by strong top line growth of over 50%, further margin improvement and continued product innovation. Our solid results throughout the year are a great testament to the quality of our battle-tested team and consistent execution on our strategy, driving location growth, more deeply serving all segments of the restaurant industry and pushing the industry forward through bold product innovation.  The complexity of running a restaurant is only increasing. This was particularly evident over the last year with restaurants facing inflation, supply chain challenges and labor constraints while continuing to adapt as guests demand a more seamless experience.  With that backdrop, the need for restaurants to leverage technology to improve efficiency, grow sales and quickly adapt is more critical than ever. And the value of Toast all in one digital platform continues to grow. We added approximately 23,000 net new locations to our platform in 2022 and the percentage of locations attaching 6 or more SaaS modules increased by nearly 10 points evidence of strong customer demand.  There are countless examples of how Toast is helping our customers deliver better top and bottom line results, including Alpine Inn, a tavern in California unlocked a 76% increase in revenue since adding Toast Mobile Order & Pay, driving higher check sizes, a better guest experience and helping manage the labor shortage.  Another example is Silver Diner, which rolled out Toast to 21 locations. Since implementing our platform, servers using Tosco handhelds are able to cover 1 to 2 more tables than before, decreasing table turn times by an average of 3 to 5 minutes, providing tangible efficiency benefits. These examples also show how our platform feeds a virtuous cycle that creates a better experience for restaurant ecosystem, enabling staff to be more efficient and effective leads to happier employees, which translates to a better experience for guests who leaves higher tips and reinforce the restaurant as a great place to work for employees.  This dynamic leads to more successful better run restaurants. And as restaurants use more of our integrated platform, it strengthens the cycle, creating powerful network effects for our customers. Restaurants operate in a competitive, rapidly evolving industry within profit margins, magnifying the importance of technology. And with the value of our industry-leading platform can offer, we see a generational opportunity to serve as the industry's technology backbone. We are still in the early stages of our potential market opportunity even after our growth over the last few years, less than 10% of U.S. restaurant locations around the Toast platform, and our Q4 ARR only represents about 2% of the $55 billion market opportunity, leaving a long runway of growth ahead as we continue to execute.  Turning to our Q4 results. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue grew 50% to $759 million. ARR increased 59% to $901 million and GPV was up 49% to $25.5 billion. Sustaining our top line momentum while delivering consistent margin expansion throughout 2022 is evidence of both the scalability of our business model and our commitment to balancing investments in key growth areas with efficiency and cost discipline.  In Q4, adjusted EBITDA improved to an $18 million loss. We also sustained healthy location growth, adding approximately 5,500 net new locations in Q4 to end the year with approximately 79,000 total live locations. We consistently executed on our proven, scalable go-to-market strategy throughout 2022, and we continue to benefit from the flywheel effects we've discussed in more and more markets.  As we increase penetration, we're confident that we can continue to efficiently grow locations and ARR. Underpinning our location growth is strong demand across restaurant segments. In addition to momentum with SMB restaurants, we continue to gain traction upmarket with larger customers as we invest in our platform.  I'll highlight a few bookings from the past quarter. After working with Toast at their bud dairy food hall location, Cameron Mitchell restaurants is rolling out Toast to all restaurant brands in their multi-concept FSR focused portfolio. They were impressed with how Toast easily supported various partners and tech integrations and saw potential for Toast to be their trusted tech partner as the company grows.  In addition to our API integrations, Cameron Mitchell is using our multi-location management module to help standardize operations and easily configure menus. They are using our Toast Go handhelds for smoother dining experiences in the front of house and our kitchen display systems to improve back-of-house operations. They also plan to trial additional features that will further help them control the guest experience.  Here, north of Boston, Michael's Harborside is a well-known waterfront eatery with a significant uptick in business in warmer months. After enduring another busy season of payroll and scheduling pain in an outdated POS, they look to Toast to help revamp their approach. In addition to our robust all-in-one platform, Michael's Harborside was attracted to our payroll and team management solution to help digitally onboard their influx of seasonal employees enable workers to independently swap shifts using our Sling app and dramatically reduce weekly time spent on payroll from the hour plus they were used to.  Michael's Harborside is also excited to leverage Toast handhelds to help servers work their various rooms, decks and outdoor dining spaces business when the busy season returns. California-based bubble T shop Teaspoon selected Toast to be their tech partner at 45 locations in their franchise-focused, rapidly expanding footprint, Teaspoon was impressed by a restaurant-specific enterprise-grade features, our strong customer references and our proven track record of onboarding and supporting franchise-based QSRs. With Toast, Teaspoon will offer franchisees a turnkey all-in-one solution that includes our Toast Go handhelds for line busting, our kitchen display systems for back-of-house experience, our digital kiosks, which they see as a real differentiator to control labor costs. They will also leverage Toast multi-location management, our scheduling and payroll products and extra chef for invoice automation.  On top of our location growth momentum, customers like Teaspoon continue to attach more products. As of the end of Q4, 41% of our customers attached 6 or more SaaS modules. That percentage has more than doubled in just 2 years thanks to our continued platform expansion, improving packaging designed to enable our sales team to efficiently attach more products at booking and the growing momentum of our multichannel upsell strategy.  These factors contributed to the subscription revenue increasing over 90% year-over-year in 2022, and we continue to see a significant opportunity to further expand SaaS ARPU over time. Helping our customers succeed by unlocking growth and increasing efficiency is at the heart of our business and is what informs our product innovation as the needs of guests rapidly evolve and the importance of developing incremental revenue streams grow, restaurants are increasingly diversifying into more service models.  Our voice of the restaurant industry survey from last year found that on average, restaurants employ 7 different service models. In Q3, we launched Toast invoicing, enabling restaurants to efficiently manage wholesale and catering orders, along with their core restaurant business in 1 integrated system. Over 5,000 customers have already used our invoicing product to streamline their billing and payment processes and with an average transaction value over $650, it's also an opportunity for these customers to grow their business.  To further expand the service models available through our platform, today, we announced the acquisition of Delphi Display Systems, a leading provider of digital menu and drive-through products Integrating Delphi into the Toast platform will enable us to offer drive-through capabilities on our platform for the first time, giving our customers the option to employ this critical service model to grow their business and offer guests a more omnichannel experience.  Adding a drive-through offering and digital menu boards enhances our offering for both small and large quick-serve restaurants. In Q2 of last year, we launched Toast for quick-serve restaurants, and we've seen strong follow-through in our funnel from QSRs over the last few quarters. Drive-thru is a critical service model for QSRs and has become an even more important over the past few years. We're excited to welcome the Delphi team to our Toast family and partner more deeply to serve these restaurants.  We plan to continue to add more capabilities to our QSR offering in 2023 to drive even deeper penetration in this segment going forward. Last week, we announced our order with Google integration, expanding our suite of digital ordering products, this capability expands the online reach of our restaurants by providing visibility in Google Search and Google Maps and unlocks another channel for customers to grow their online ordering business. Order with Google is fully integrated with our platform, making it easy for restaurants to update their menus and hours in 1 place and seamlessly manage order flow.  Together with online ordering and the Toast takeout app, we continue to offer restaurants more options to grow their off-premise business efficiently with commission-free online ordering while enabling them to offer guests a cost-efficient, seamless experience.  In addition to our broad platform, our extensive partner ecosystem continues to expand. During Q4, we exceeded 200 partners in our network, which encompasses technology integration partners, local partners and large national food and beverage suppliers. Our growing partner ecosystem gives customers access to a wide range of products and services to meet the needs of their restaurant complementing our existing expanding platform and further enhancing the value Toast provides to customers.  Over half our customers are using a partner integration today through our API module. And these customers are using 3 integrations on average. Customers that use our partner integrations have over 30% higher total ARPU and a lower churn rate than customers not using API integrations, evidence of the value our partner ecosystem adds for customers and how it enhances our platform. This is another example of the reinforcing benefits from our platform as we jointly help customers grow, our partners grow and we grow. Thank you to our partners for sharing in the mission to help the restaurant industry thrive.  So as we move into 2023, we are focused on continuing to execute on the same strategy that has been delivering consistent strong results. First, as we continue to drive location growth, customer trust will always be the foundation of everything we do. The opportunity ahead is massive and ensuring we are the trusted platform for the restaurant industry as our business scales is always our top priority. Second, product innovation is integral to our DNA. We have an exciting pipeline of new products to help restaurant owners further optimize their operations and to build on the suites of products we offer restaurants to deepen their touch points with their most important stakeholders, guests, employees and suppliers.  Third, we will keep investing to more deeply serve all segments of the restaurant industry. This includes tailored offerings to better serve restaurant types like QSRs and enhancing the capabilities for customer segments like mid-market and enterprise.  And fourth, we will continue building out our international business, while we're still very early, the potential opportunity is significant, and we look forward to taking the next steps in the multiyear journey. Our focus on balancing key investments with disciplined cost management throughout 2022 sets us up well to maintain our operating momentum and deliver another year of strong durable growth in 2023.  We expect to deliver 32% revenue growth for full year 2023 at the midpoint of our guidance range while driving further margin improvement as we progress toward adjusted EBITDA profitability by the end of the year. We remain committed to prudently investing to capitalize on the significant market opportunity while efficiently scaling our business.  As we start the year, the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain, while the restaurant industry has continued to perform relatively well, we're aware there is less visibility on consumer trends and restaurants continue to operate in a dynamic environment. Our top priority is to continue to help restaurants leverage our platform to overcome the challenges they face and emerge stronger.  The uncertainty also calls for us to remain flexible. We've proven our ability to navigate uncertainty in the past and we're well prepared to adapt quickly to any change in trends. Our progress over the last year to ensure a lean cost structure positions us to move even faster as the environment evolves and the flexibility to maintain a disciplined growth mindset as we execute against the massive opportunity ahead.  As we turn the page on 2022 and look ahead to 2023, I want to thank our growing customer community for their confidence in Toast, our employees for their focus and dedication, and our extended network of partners, investors and others who continue to support Toast and the broader restaurant community. While we've accomplished a lot together over the past year, we believe we are just getting started, and we're excited about the opportunity in the years to come.  Now I'll turn the call over to Elena. Yes, Stephen, great question. Look, I think we continue to see the same dynamic where as we gain market share and get market density and rep tenure up in these markets, the productivity of our reps and our ease continues to improve. That's the trend we continue to see. And I think that's not only in terms of the productivity, but also the win rates we see against our competitors. And so there is nothing in our data that we're seeing that says that we can continue to grow into plywood markets. And I think in terms of your question, whether it's the first 20% of the last 20%, I'll tell you the first 10% is what's the hardest. Yes, it's a good question. I think it's super important for any restaurant to meet the guest and consumer where they are. So we're pretty bullish on the opportunity with Google. Seamlessly integrating with them so as our consumer is on Google Maps or searching on Google and then connecting to the restaurants first-party online ordering capability is a critical success factor and it streamlines both the revenue attach as well as the productivity of the teams. It also eliminates third-party restaurant should be taken advantage of that and we think it's a unique opportunity in the market. I think it's less about the macro environment, and it's more about restaurants wanting to adopt an all-in-one solution and then also have really strong -- really strong partner ecosystem on top of that platform. So at the end of the day, if you think about the restaurants challenges, they're facing labor challenges, inflation and how to drive top line growth.  So having a platform that connects those dots and allows them to be much more efficient is what we're after. So we're seeing that value proposition resonate in the market, both for SMB as well as upmarket. And we want to make sure that we give them great technology at their fingertips to drive improvements and do that with our partner ecosystem as well. So we're seeing that broader adoption of modules based on that value proposition. Yes. No, it's a good question. You're going to see pilots and opportunities across all lines of business. So both guest facing. You think about the Delphi acquisition this morning, bringing Ken and the team into our fold so that we can more broadly serve QSR restaurants, specifically with drive-through capabilities. So you're going to see guest-facing opportunities, employee-facing opportunities within our employee cloud and payroll management solution. And then obviously, in the back office, as restaurants fight food cost inflation in and around extra chef is a unique opportunity to continue to show visibility and price tracking across the restaurant sector so that they can optimize their spend. So I'd say it's a broad-based attack on different opportunities across the different stakeholders. But again, with the mission of empowering restaurants of all types to improve their operations. On the product side, we're just constantly investing to increase our TAM -- and then SaaS, as Elena mentioned, on the call, is up 20% year-over-year, and we continue -- expect to continue to see that in '23 as well. Yes. Very similar to what I just mentioned, Josh. I think you're going to see us push out solutions in our platform that help each stakeholder in the restaurants thrive. So guest-facing omnichannel experiences, we want restaurants to meet the guest where they are. So whether it's online through a search through Google or in drive-thru or in-store through kiosk or at the table, we want to make sure that we create an amazing set of guest experiences and service models that allow the restaurant to drive top line, but then also allow their staff to be productive. If you go inside the restaurant, a good example with Silver Diner, we're seeing progress on staff productivity amidst labor changes for restaurants gaining productivity through our platform so that they can better treat their guests, have staff productivity go up and then see happier consumers, happier employees, higher tips and wages, higher ticket sizes and a flywheel within the restaurant that improves the restaurant itself.  And then as I mentioned in the back office, we believe there's opportunities to better connect food cost optimization back into the supply chain so that the restaurant is optimizing their cost. So you're going to see opportunities across these different stakeholder groups. And that's what gets us excited about the all-in-one platform because our mission is to make sure that we're advancing this platform so that all of these stakeholders can thrive. Sure. Good question, Will. So we're not seeing meaningful changes in consumer demand or spending across our business. So restaurants are seeing demand, and it's in line with our expectations for what I would call historic seasonality trends. We continue to see consumers moving more spend to services like dining out versus food at home. Certainly, January, some of the signals from January on retail sales were strong with continued strength for food services, but we're not really seeing any material or meaningful impact in consumer demand or across restaurants.  As we've mentioned before, I think we mentioned this last quarter, consumer spend on dining has proven pretty resilient during past economic slowdowns. So I think that keeps us optimistic that what we're seeing will hopefully continue. That being said, we're pretty mindful of the mixed macro signals and we're monitoring things closely.  I think the last point I would make is our platform really helps restaurants adapt and be resilient during tough times. And if you look at the past 2.5 years, we've been incredibly successful allowing restaurants to adjust their business, adapt and have stronger survivability. So I think our platform becomes really valuable in tough market conditions, and that's what we're seeing with things like our SaaS ARPU growth and customers using more modules on the platform.  So in general, it's stay the course and continue to be mindful of the signals that are out there. And just to add to that, Josh, we've been opportunistic. So the upsell team, for example, we've seen good progress in ARPU growth, good -- the attach rates of our guest products are holding as we adding more locations. There's lots of upside on our extra shaft and payroll products given they aren't penetrated in our base. So we're investing in some of the emerging markets and upsell -- but to Elena's point, the biggest driver we feel in our mature markets is really driving market density and driving the tenure were reps up. Okay. Thank you all. Have a great day."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Comparato: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I jump in, I'm going to apologize up-front for any coughing outburst or sips of hot tea as I'm recovering from a nasty cold. So let's jump in. This past quarter marked the first anniversary of Toast IPO. I want to thank all of our employees for their focus and dedication as well as our partners, customers and investors. We look forward to our ongoing partnership. And while we've accomplished a lot over the past year, we're even more excited about the opportunity in the years to come. Toast delivered a strong Q3, delivering continued efficient time growth and improved profitability. In addition to topping our revenue and EBITDA expectations, we surpassed $100 billion in annualized GPV for the first time. These results are a testament to the consistent execution of our core strategy, driving location growth, deepening our ability to serve all segments of the restaurant industry and delivering product innovation. On the product front, last month, we hosted Spark, our annual innovation event, where we announced the new product updates to help restaurants grow and expand their business and overcome key challenges. A key highlight is Toast invoicing, a new product to help restaurants seamlessly manage catering and wholesale orders alongside their in-store take out and delivery businesses. a great example of our continued product innovation and how we're leveraging new products to better serve different restaurant types. While the fundamentals in our business remain strong, we continue to closely monitor the uncertain macroeconomic environment that both we and our customers are operating in. Toast customers continue to see solid consumer demand, and the restaurant industry remains healthy. We're focused on partnering with both new and existing customers to ensure they are able to adapt and thrive in this dynamic environment. In addition, we are equally prepared to adapt our business to any macro changes in the restaurant industry. In the third quarter, we grew revenue 55% year-over-year to $752 million, and ARR was up 60% to $868 million. GPV remains healthy, increasing 53% year-over-year in Q3. We also continue to drive strong location growth, adding approximately 5,500 net new locations and ending the quarter with approximately 74,000 total locations, sustaining over 40% growth in total locations even as our scale grows is indicative of our powerful go-to-market strategy and industry-leading platform. As a result of this consistent execution, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by 3% at the midpoint of the range which implies 59% year-over-year growth. We're also increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance by nearly $30 million at the midpoint. The continued margin improvement in Q3 is further evidence of our focus on cost discipline and efficiency efforts and our progress towards profitability. We remain committed to balancing investments in our most important areas to go after the massive market opportunity in front of us with disciplined cost management and healthy unit economics to sustain that efficient growth as we scale. Our ability to scale our proven go-to-market strategy gives us confidence that our unit economics will continue to improve over time. We've discussed the flywheel effect that drives increasing referrals and inbounds as we increase penetration in a local market. That results in higher and more efficient productivity. That higher productivity leads to more ARR and better profit contribution as these markets scale. Over the past year, the percentage of total SMB restaurant locations in markets to have over 20% penetration has increased by more than 5 times, and we continue to gain share in these markets, proof that we still have significant room to keep increasing share even in our more established markets. A large majority of our markets are still below that 20% penetration, and we're investing to replicate that flywheel effect in more markets. When you combine the significant untapped SMB opportunity with our nascent share in the enterprise and international segments, we still have a long runway of growth ahead, and we're well positioned to capitalize on the digital transformation in the restaurant industry. Demand for Toast across the full spectrum of the restaurant types remains strong, and our new customers continue to take advantage of more products across our platform to operate more efficiently and grow their business. I'll highlight a few examples from the past quarter. Antoine's, one of New Orleans storied French Quarter restaurants selected Toast as its technology partner, known for its classic fine dining experience Antoine's wanted a new partner who could modernize its back of house while also preserving its special front-of-house experience. In addition to our robust all-in-one platform, Antoine was attracted to our payroll and Toast's manager solution to help eliminate the inefficiency of making multiple back-office trips each night to aggregate tips with their legacy POS. They're also using 13 of Toast's kitchen display systems in their spans kitchen, along with several of our guest modules. Antoine came to us via a strong referral from another New Orleans Toast customer. A great example of the relationships our local go-to-market team builds and how that flywheel effect works as we gain traction in these local markets. Walk On's is excited to leverage Toast across its growing footprint of nearly 100 existing and planned locations across the South and Midwest, co-owned by NFL star Drew Brees and named the number one Best Sports Bar in America by ESPN and the number one sports bar franchise two years running by entrepreneur Walk On's has started to Toast's at some of their locations. Seem to enhance their technology, Walk On's is adopting our POS for its ease of use, our Toast Go handhelds to help navigate seas of sports fans and our API integrations to provide superior service through all of our ordering channels. Taco Maya is a fast casual QSR with 6 existing and 4 planned locations throughout Chicago and Illinois. Taco Maya will be implementing 10 Toast's module assets footprint, including xtraCHEF for better visibility into costs, multi-location management for easier menu updating and online ordering and Mobile Order & Pay among others, to provide an efficient, seamless customer experience. Every location also includes a patio, which Taco Maya will equip servers with our Toast Go handhelds to service. It's a great use case for our Toast Gos, which have proven to benefit staff productivity. Taco Maya is just one example of the momentum we're building in the QSR segment. Earlier this year, we announced Toast for QSR. And in Q3, QSRs represented nearly half of our bookings, its highest level in recent years. One important benefit of our vertical focus on the restaurant industry is the ability to leverage the Toast platform to develop offerings tailored to the needs of specific restaurant types, enabling us to deepen our penetration across restaurant segments. With restaurants operating in an increasingly dynamic environment, it's critical that we constantly speak to and stay connected with our customers. We recently conducted our annual Voice of the Restaurant Industry Survey to gain insights into the major challenges facing restaurants and how tech can help them thrive. Similar to themes we've seen this year, labor shortages and inflation are the challenges facing our customers. 1 in 3 restaurants said they've had a difficult time hiring in 2022 and almost 40% started tracking the prices of key ingredients. The survey also highlighted employee scheduling as one of our customers' biggest technology pain points, reinforcing the importance of adding Sling to our team management product suite. In addition, our customers are also diversifying their businesses to meet the evolving needs of guests and to develop new revenue streams. On average, restaurant surveyed employed 7 different service models such as on-premise, takeout, delivery, catering, wholesale, curbside and drive-thru. Our recent product innovations highlight how Toast is uniquely positioned to help restaurants navigate these challenges and take advantage of new opportunities to transform and grow. At Spark, we announced Toast invoicing, which enables restaurants to efficiently manage wholesale and catering orders along with their core restaurant business in 1 integrated system. Our customers can save time on managing paperwork and multiple systems while getting paid faster and seamlessly capitalizing on the opportunity to grow their business with more service models. Toast invoicing showcases our ability to deeply serve hybrid locations and provide a seamless billing and payment solution for both B2B and B2C. We estimate over 70% of restaurants already offer catering in addition to their on-premise business, and catering is one of the top 3 focus areas for restaurant owners and operators as we head into 2023. A great example of how customers are leveraging our new invoicing offering is founders table, which operates 2 QSR Dos Toros Taqueria and Chopt Creative Salad and is a great strategic partner of ours. They went live with invoicing in June at 19 of their Dos Toros locations in order to streamline their operations and payments for catering into 1 platform after previously using a separate point solution. In addition to the efficiency of managing this through a single integrated platform over the past 3 months, Dos Toros monthly invoice and usage with Toast's more than doubled. And in September alone, invoicing drove a 17% uplift in their payments volume on Toast. At Spark, we also featured our xtraCHEF Price Tracker. As I mentioned earlier, this is a major pain point for restaurants due to the inflationary environment. Our customers can access the price tracker directly from our newly designed xtraCHEF dashboard to stay on top of fluctuating ingredient prices and costs. Restaurants like Plaza Pizza are watching price fluctuations week-to-week and in response to these insights have engaged in negotiations with food distributors. Plaza Pizza was able to successfully reduce food costs by nearly 10%. Other customers are monitoring key price changes to make strategic decisions about their menus, their recipes and pricing. Our ability to help customers navigate this important issue is evident in how quickly the attach rate for xtraCHEF has ramped. After only adding it to our sales motion in Q1 this year, the percentage of locations that went live in Q3 using xtraCHEF is already in the mid-teens, and we continue to see a significant opportunity to reach customers and further develop our product suite to help restaurants manage their suppliers. Finally, I'd like to highlight Toast Capital, where our data on restaurant performance enables us to help offer restaurants seamless, low friction access to capital. The majority of applicants received an approval decision in 1 business day, and on average, funds are dispersed to customers just 2 days after signing their loan agreement. That differentiated customer experience is evident in customer retention. Among the 2021 customer cohort, over 70% have taken a second loan and in some cases, multiple additional loans. In Q3, we exceeded our offering, adding a 360-day loan with larger available loan sizes to give customers more choice and meet a wider range of use cases. The strong customer value proposition of Toast Capital and the different offerings we've added over the past year continue to drive healthy growth with SMB businesses underserved by the banking community in an estimated two-thirds of all SMB businesses having financial needs each year. We have a clear opportunity to leverage our expanding portfolio of banking products to both add significant value for our customers and drive strong growth going forward. In summary, Toast delivered strong execution and continued momentum in Q3, balancing targeted investments to drive product innovation with focus on healthy unit economics and disciplined cost management. Amid uncertain times, we are more committed than ever to our mission to empower the restaurant community, to delight guests, do what they love and thrive. We believe that serving as the restaurant industry trusted technology partner and giving restaurants the tools they need to adapt and succeed will benefit our customers while helping Toast deliver durable, efficient growth for many years to come. Now I'll turn the call over to Elena.\nElena Gomez: Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining. Before jumping into the results, I want to thank the entire Toast team for another great quarter, the sustained execution and momentum we've built in the year since our IPO, thanks to the hard work and dedication of our great team. That execution contributed to another strong quarter with revenue and adjusted EBITDA both coming in above the high end of our guidance in Q3. Our integrated software and payments model together with a differentiated go-to-market approach is built to scale efficiently. And our balanced top line growth and improved profitability is early evidence of that. We're still less than 2% of the $55 billion U.S. market and have a huge opportunity ahead as we lead the restaurant industry's digital transition. We're confident that continuing to invest in innovation scale, our integrated business model will enable us to sustain both strong growth and margin improvement. In Q3, we added approximately 5,500 net new locations, increasing the number of total live location on our platform to approximately 74, 000. The growth is broad based with a healthy balance of existing restaurants switching over to Toast, existing customers expanding their footprint and new restaurants partnering with those. As evidenced by the examples Chris just shared, we're gaining traction across different types and segments of restaurants, thanks to the breadth of our industry-leading platform and the ability to deeply serve the entire industry. We expect to sustain our momentum in Q4 with net location adds in a similar range as Q3. Turning to our financial results. ARR, which is our core operational metric ended Q3 at $868 million, up 60% year-over-year. Total revenue grew 55% year-over-year to $752 million. Looking at what we operationally view as recurring revenue, subscription revenue and fintech gross profit totaled $224 million, up 82% year-over-year driven by our continued location growth and healthy ARPU increases across both SaaS and fintech solutions. Subscription services revenue increased 96% year-over-year in the third quarter, benefiting from our sustained location growth and increased product adoption. Total shop ARPU grew more than 20% year-over-year, driven by both new and existing customers. As we've discussed, new customers are joining the platform at higher ARPU than in prior years as they leverage the expanding breadth of our platform. Chris alluded to the increasing attach rate of nascent products like xtraCHEF, that's just one example of how our sales team is attaching more products at booking contributing to higher SaaS ARPU for our more recent customer cohorts. Existing customers are leveraging upsell channels to add more products. The ARPU for each of our pre-2022 annual customer cohorts is growing at double-digit rates, and we're still only scratching the surface on the potential for upsell. New products like payroll and xtraCHEF are still early on their growth and have much higher penetration with new customers than older cohorts. Plus, we have an exciting pipeline of new products for our customers to benefit from. As we continue to develop our upsell team and refine our sales motion, we believe we can continue to increase SaaS ARPU across our annual customer cohort. On the fintech solutions side, revenue grew 55% to $628 million, and gross profit was up 74% year-over-year to $134 million in the quarter. GPV growth remains healthy and increased 53% to $25 billion in Q3. Average annualized GPV per processing location of $1.4 million was roughly flat with Q2 and up 8% year-over-year. The growth in GPV per processing location is a result of higher average ticket and the continued rebound in customer transactions, which remains slightly below 2019 levels in Q3. In addition to healthy payments volume, we're also benefiting from our growing portfolio of fintech products and services led by Toast Capital. Those products drove $17 million of gross profit in Q3. Toast Capital offers a strong value proposition, and we have a great opportunity to further penetrate the significant restaurant lending, marketing opportunity as we expand the offering. In addition to Toast Capital, our portfolio of non-POS fintech products with nascent offerings like PayCard and payout and other products currently in development highlight the strategic benefit of our fintech capabilities and the opportunity to build products that add value for our customers while differentiating our offering and driving additional monetization. The combined -- the combination of continued optimization efforts from our payments platform investments, coupled with the growth in other fintech products resulted in a net take rate increasing to 53 basis points. As a reminder, GPV per processing location is typically higher during peak season in the second and third quarters each year. We expect GPV per processing location to seasonally decline quarter-over-quarter in Q4 and in Q1 each year. Total gross profit of 8% year-over-year and 31% quarter-over-quarter to $164 million, resulting in gross margin of 21.8%. We delivered gross margin improvement in each of our reporting lines leading to over 300 basis point gross margin improvement compared to Q2. Turning to customer acquisition costs. Hardware margins improved quarter-over-quarter due to lower shipping costs. Hardware Harbor revenue decreased year-over-year, mainly due to tough seasonal comp and accounting guidelines that require allocation of revenue across bundled products. We've seen upsell to existing customers revert to a typical seasonal pattern with Q2 benefiting from more hardware sales to existing customers in preparation for the outdoor season followed by a drop off in Q3. Last year with in-person dining still recovering after COVID, hardware upsell sales in Q3 were stronger than usual. On operating expenses, we continue to take a balanced approach to position for sustained top line momentum as we lead the digitization of the restaurant industry while putting in place a lean, flexible cost structure. Our hiring is focused on key investment areas with the strongest ROI potential, and we're rigorously prioritizing those opportunities as we tightly manage expense growth. At the same time, we're closely monitoring the dynamic macro backdrop and maintaining the flexibility in our cost structure to adapt to the changing environment. Moving to our other customer acquisition costs. Sales and marketing expense growth slowed to 54% year-over-year and further decline as a percentage of recurring revenue in Q3. Our go-to-market engine is well positioned to scale efficiently. As we drive sustained share gains and build flywheel effect an increasing number of markets, we expect rep productivity to increase, driving deeper market penetration and improving unit economics. The recent Spark event and release of our Toast's invoicing products, the latest example of how our investments in research and development are driving innovation to help our customers grow their business and improve their bottom line. We believe our balanced investments across core products, emerging growth products and our pipeline of new products will continue -- contribute to continued ARPU and location growth. General and admirative expenses were 25% of recurring revenue. Our G&A expenses include bad debt and credit-related expenses, which were approximately $13 million in Q3. Excluding bad debt and credit-related expenses, G&A grew 66% year-over-year as we continue to absorb public company costs. With our emphasis on disciplined cost management, we expect growth in the core G&A expenses to moderate in Q4 and anticipate operating leverage on G&A going forward. Bad debt and credit-related expenses include bad debt on outstanding receivables as well as liabilities related to Toast Capital and other fintech offerings. Our data advantage allows us to closely monitor the health of the restaurant and its repayment ability to maintain low default rates and manage our risk. And while we expect bad debt and credit expenses related to Toast Capital to grow as we expand the program, the overall operating margin is healthy and accretive to the business. Total Q3 adjusted EBITDA was negative $19 million. Our negative 2.6% margin was a 230 basis points improvement quarter-over-quarter. Q3 is a great example of our ability to drive healthy top line growth, continue to invest in key areas that will help sustain growth while operating efficiently to improve profitability. We remain focused on optimizing our cost base and rigorously prioritize investments in order to sustain this trajectory going forward. Now turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million, which represents 46% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, with adjusted EBITDA expected to be in the range of negative $30 million to negative $20 million. We continue to see healthy GPV trends into Q4 and our guidance reflects a seasonal decline in GPV per location similar to our typical historical trend. Based on strong Q3 performance and Q4 guidance, our full year 2022 revenue expectations are 3% higher at the midpoint. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $2.69 billion to $2.72 billion, a 59% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Our updated full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range is negative $127 million to negative $117 million, a nearly $30 million improvement at the midpoint from our last guidance. This implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of negative 4.5% for the year at the midpoint. Our focus on efficiency and disciplined cost management this year has enabled us to both meaningfully improve margins the last few quarters and invest in key areas that we believe will contribute to durable efficient growth. We intend to maintain this balanced approach going forward, investing in areas of product innovation as we go after the big market opportunity in front of us while driving operating leverage. The progress we've made to adopt our cost structure this year, along with our continued focus on efficient growth puts us on a trajectory to deliver a quarterly adjusted EBITDA profit by the end of 2023. This assumes the current macro environment remains relatively consistent. We're closely monitoring the key indicators. And if there were a meaningful change to the macro environment that impacts the restaurant industry, we would reassess that timing, but we have a proven ability to navigate changing market conditions and with the improvements in our cost structure, we're prepared to quickly adapt our business to any changes. In closing, we had a great third quarter, posting strong financial results on building on our operating momentum. I want to reiterate my thanks to our team for their focused execution. In the face of this dynamic operating environment, restaurants need a trusted technology partner more than ever to help them drive efficiency, offer differentiated guest experiences and enable new service models. Our relentless focus on being that partner to the restaurant industry and solving their biggest pain points is driving the strong growth in our business. And with investments to further strengthen our industry-leading platform, put Toast in a great position to lead the digital transition for the restaurant industry. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tisn Huang JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Great results here. I wanted to ask, I like Slide 18, if you don't mind, going to that was helpful to see. I'm curious how hard or how big a focus is it to narrow this ARPU gap between the '21 cohort and the pre-'21 class, it looks like. What are some of the big products you need to do it with? And I think it sounds like the product upsell team will be tasked to do that. Any detail there would be great.\nAman Narang: Thanks for the question. This is Aman. Look, I think one of the things we're really proud of is just a great performance by our go-to-market team in Q3. You're seeing not only that with new customers are booking, they're booking at a higher ARPU. And you're also seeing that core of customers over time, as you saw on Slide 18, are expanding ARPU over time. And it's really across the board, right? We've got, on the upsell team, our growth as are getting more familiar with these newer products, as Elena mentioned, the attach rates of some of these products like employee cloud and xtraCHEF is lower and their high ARPU products. And then on to shop, we've got products like our guest products, even capital, as Chris talked about and also our core products in terms of just adding more hardware and software subscriptions through kiosks and such. And so across the board seeing really good momentum, and it's really both on new business bookings as well as an upsell as well.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Great. And just my quick follow-up, if you don't mind. Just bigger picture question around risk appetite. Going into a less certain macro, just risk appetite in general with underwriting new locations, the capital business, you talked about xtraCHEF. What do you, what signals are you watching there to dial it up or down?\nElena Gomez: Yes. So our just capital business, we -- first of all, we see a lot of the data with our customers, so we're well positioned to really understand their ability to pay, their sort of their payment volume and so on. So the risk is largely managed. We pay careful attention to signals, but we're not seeing anything so far in our loan portfolio that leads us to believe that default rates are out of line. In fact, they're very much in line with our expectations, Tien. So we're not seeing that risk. But of course, we're going to keep monitoring it in light of the backdrop that we're in.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes of Canaccord. Please proceed.\nDJ Hynes: Nice set of results here. Elena, maybe I'll start with you. I wanted to ask about inflationary impacts on GPV per location and how we should think about that going forward that there's kind of a mix of pros and cons, right? On the one hand, high prices are a good thing for payment volume. I presume at some point, it works against traffic. So how should we be thinking about that as we factor the data points into our model?\nElena Gomez: Yes. No, that's a great question. So inflation is definitely a factor, and we know that in our GPV per location, and we know that we're benefiting from that. And we're also benefiting from higher transaction volumes. And I sort of commented on the fact that our ticket is being up, but also our transaction levels are close but not all the way back to 2019. So we're going to benefit a bit as that with respect to pre-COVID levels. Then the other interesting data point we look at is the cost of food. At home and the cost of food away from home, and we're seeing that the cost of food at home is growing faster than the cost of food away from home. So as diners have become more comfortable, and we're seeing that trend of consumer demand shifting to food away from home. We expect to continue to benefit from that as well.\nDJ Hynes: Yes. Interesting. Okay. And then maybe a more strategic follow-up. Just around like the importance of building out the self-serve product-led motion to the long-term margin profile of the business. And I'm just thinking like as you scale refilling the natural customer attrition do you see with kind of lower and lower cost of acquisition channels is obviously going to be important. But would love to get your thoughts a, on progress there; and b, just how important that is.\nChris Comparato: Yes. DJ, this is Chris. I think you want to put yourself in a position to support the restaurants demands whether it's a net new customer upfront, as Aman mentioned, bundling more of the platform up-front in efficient motion to win that customer. But then over time, given existing customers the flexibility either through self-service, product-led growth or the upsell motion to have really clear accessibility to our platform and all of its modules. So we spend a lot of time looking at that customer journey for restaurant segments of all types to identify what is the right channel for which they can get exposed to the right products, and then we capitalize on those efforts. And we're seeing that those teams are becoming more and more productive over time. So that's what we look at. But then we complement that with making sure that the platform has all the needs that address the restaurant's pain points, and we continue to select and build the right products to address those pain points.\nOperator: The next question comes from Will Nance of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nWill Nance: Nice results today. It's great to see the strength on the top line and particularly in the subscription revenues. And I guess I wanted to follow up, on I think Tien-Tsing's question on the subscription ARPUs. I thought Slide 18 was great as well. Wondering if you could maybe dig into the step function change in ARPUs in the 2021 cohort. I mean is that primarily a result of payroll and maybe a little bit of xtraCHEF? Or is there something specific you would kind of point us to that drove that step function? And then the follow-on is, what does the sales motion look like, the upsell motion for the back book to get some of these higher ARPU products kind of penetrated in the base?\nElena Gomez: Sure, I'll take that and Aman, feel free to chime in as well. So that step-function is really broad based as we started testing different bundles that resonate with our customers. We started understanding that customers are actually, our sales team is getting really good at positioning the breadth of the platform. That's really the important part. They're getting used to solution selling. And in that, they're selling all elements of the platform, whether it's the guest products, online ordering, things like that as well as hardware, so it's really the breadth of products, payroll on xtraCHEF, payroll more obviously played a role, but we still have a continued opportunity with payroll. And xtraCHEF is too early to have that big of an impact. In fact, in 2021 was really nascent. So I would -- I don't even know it shows so early in 2021. So it's really a payroll and the broad breadth of the platform versus any 1 product.\nDJ Hynes: The take rate came in a bit ahead of where we were looking for, it sounds like there may have been some contribution from Toast Capital in there. Just wondering if you could talk through the trajectory of Toast Capital over the last couple of quarters. It sounded like it was a little bit bigger than maybe we thought it was running. So any color you could provide on what the cadence of adoption of those capital has been over the last several quarters would be great.\nElena Gomez: Yes. No, we're really encouraged by Toast Capital, and we commented on it because we wanted to give you guys more transparency. But we launched a 360-day product in Q3 and the take rate benefited from that. Our take rate, though, is a combination of two factors. It's not just Toast Capital, but also the improving the focus we have on improving our payment operations and infrastructure. So there's always going to be that focus. We have a whole team focused on that all the time. But in Q3, the primary -- the two primary drivers for both of those things, not just Toast Capital.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mayank Tandon of Needham. Please proceed.\nMayank Tandon: Congrats on the quarter. Aman, you commented I think that you expect to be EBITDA profitable exiting 2023. Could you just maybe walk through the different levers, specifically in terms of what you would then have to deliver on gross margins on the recurring revenue? Any kind of framework around that? And then what are some of the levers on the OpEx line that would need to come through to get to that level?\nElena Gomez: Yes. I'll start by saying we're very early in our -- or we're in the middle and not early, but we're in the middle of our 2023 planning. So I'll have more specifics at our next earnings call. But at the highest level, we're going to continue to focus on cost discipline that we've -- and we've shown you guys for the last several quarters. So that's number one. We're going to continue to gain leverage in the obvious places like G&A. But I want to remind you, we have a massive opportunity ahead. So we're going to continue to invest in areas that are going to drive long-term sustainable growth. And that's how I would think about it as a very balanced approach to 2023 in light of the macro.\nMayank Tandon: Right. It's still encouraging to hear also definitely should be viewed positively by investors. But just as a follow-up, Chris, I think a few months ago, you had identified the hospitality opportunity, I believe, in the press release, you had 40,000-plus locations as a target market. I guess my question there would be, typically, when we think of hospitality, those terminals are usually integrated into the property management systems, where I think a company like macro is the incumbent. So any progress around that? How do you go about displacing someone that has been an incumbent for so long? I would just love to hear any color around your progress on the hospitality side and how do you see the opportunity playing out?\nChris Comparato: Sure. So we're very excited about the hotel opportunity. We continue to build out our PMS integrations and they're well beyond Oracle's PMS. There's a span of PMS integrations that we are now capable of interfacing with at hotel properties, but the team continues to build out that foundation. We're very confident that we can support the restaurants within those hotels. We've got a number of opportunities in our pipeline that are exciting. But I'll caution you that it's still early days. We're winning hotels. But again, we're building that muscle as we speak. And over the course of the next few quarters, you'll see us continue to execute within that segment, and we're excited about it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Baer of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJosh Baer: I wanted to ask about locations, the 5,500, better than expected, given I think we were looking for the lower seasonality in Q3. Just wondering about the linearity of location adds. Was there any deterioration going month-to-month from September to October or even into November?\nElena Gomez: Yes. So I'll talk about Q3. And you're right, Q3 net location adds came in better than we expected, and that's really a testament to the onboarding team. They were converting existing restaurants that were switching to Toast and converting them faster. So we saw a great performance from that team. That pulled some locations into Q3. Based on the current pipeline, I commented in my prepared remarks, we expect Q4 net location to be in a similar range to Q3, and we're still on track for strong growth in the full year.\nJosh Baer: Great. And then one on guidance. Just wanted to make sure I heard right. You were saying that guidance reflects a decline in GPV per location that was similar to historical trends?\nElena Gomez: Yes. Typically, GPV per location and in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that it's seasonally higher in Q2 and Q3 and dips down into Q4. So that's not unusual. It's typical of historical patterns and our revenue guidance reflects that.\nJosh Baer: Okay. I guess the question is on macro and consumer spending. I guess is there any like level of prudence around macro and potential shift in consumer spending that's incorporated in that guidance?\nChris Comparato: Well, Josh, I'll jump in. We're not seeing any signs of changes in consumer demand or spending across our business. Restaurants continue to see healthy demand in line with what we think are historical seasonality trends. And that said, we're mindful of the macro environment. We believe consumer spend on dining has proven resilient during past recessions. And then the last thing I'll leave you with is for restaurants, we fundamentally believe that our platform becomes even more valuable in a tough market. Restaurants are turning to us for driving efficiency, growing their business, as we mentioned, things like invoicing and new service models, maintaining their teams and then driving operational costs across the board. So we think we're in a good spot when it comes to looking at the macro and the situations that have been looming.\nElena Gomez: And just to comment on your guidance comments. In October, we're seeing the same seasonal pattern we've seen historically.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Timothy Chiodo of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nTimothy Chiodo: First one is a simple one just around the subscription services. The gross margins were up nicely quarter-over-quarter. Maybe just dig into a little bit of that was there pricing, with some cost leverage? And what were some of the drivers that helped that? And then in terms of the follow-up, just in terms of the credit losses on capital, maybe you could just recap again the mechanics around when you take the lawsuits versus your partner, what the sharing is, what the thresholds are there in terms of that working its way into your P&L?\nElena Gomez: Yes, sure. So on SaaS gross margin, it's really scaling the business. And of course, you saw a healthy beat on the top line in both in the subscription side, and that's really our dress positioning the platform and our ARPU being strong, et cetera, that we've talked about. So that's really what's the story on SaaS gross margin. On your other question was bad debt related. Is that right?\nTimothy Chiodo: Yes, the mechanics.\nElena Gomez: Okay. Yes. So basically, as we expand our Toast's loan program, we have to add and accrue for related future potential default rates. And our default rates have not been out of line with what we're expecting, and we should expect that to continue to grow. But overall, the Toast Capital program is a healthy business and actually accretive to the business, Tim.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon of William Blair. Please proceed.\nStephen Sheldon: First one here, just another really strong quarter location growth. And so I'm just curious if you're seeing any changes in the types of wins that you're getting. Are these still mostly greenfield wins and situations where you're replacing legacy vendors? Or are you starting to also see wins where locations or previously on competitive SaaS solutions? Just curious if that's changed at all this quarter or this year relative to what you've seen historically.\nAman Narang: Sure, Stephen. Great question. Look, I think we, as Chris and Elena mentioned, really proud of the results in Q3. The sales team is really efficient in terms of driving growth. And it's really the story of Q3 is really consistency across the board. We saw really healthy win rates across legacy and cloud providers. We saw -- when we go into a buying decision, we tend to win more than 50% of the time as we've shared in the past. We've talked about, in previous calls, we talked about our focus on with our QSR launch and that start to make an impact and the balance in QSR and QSR is starting to improve. We've seen -- as Chris mentioned, we saw some good momentum in mid-market with things like the Walk On's win. We also had expansion from of our enterprise customers, Nothing Bundt Cakes and Jamba Juice. And even in terms of trends like new and existing, we -- just coming out of COVID, we've seen some small tailwind on new restaurants opening up and are seeing a good healthy balance in new and opening, existing restaurants as well.\nStephen Sheldon: Great. That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I know it's very small. You're really talking, I think, about placing seed investments on the international side this year. But love an update on the progress you're seeing there, how you're thinking about investing behind international next year? And any thoughts on when international could be a revenue contributor? Or are we still kind of a ways away from that?\nElena Gomez: Yes. No, I'll start by saying we're super early in the international opportunities but very encouraged already by what we're seeing, but I would view -- we view 2022 is really a building year and into 2023, frankly. We talked earlier in the year about our investment level. It hasn't changed. We're kind of on the low end of the range of $10 million to $20 million that we talked about. And I would tell you, as the year has gone on, the investment has been increasing, obviously, as we're building the team out. But it's still early. We're evaluating all the things that you would expect the go-to-market motion, making sure we understand the product that we want to put out there in international. We've got a few early customers in Canada, Dublin and U.K. So we're learning from our early customers. And so far, the feedback has been really encouraging. So we're going to continue to make that investment into 2023.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harshita Rawat of Bernstein. Please proceed.\nHarshita Rawat: So I have a question on churn. So Elena, how would you think about the kind of industry level restaurant churn you've seen in the past year or so? Is that much lower versus history? And more importantly, how can you kind of let your net location as can change if the churn kind of, I guess, becomes big in a downturn? And I fully appreciate that restaurant in Toast do better versus an average restaurant.\nElena Gomez: Yes. No, we haven't seen any change in our churn. And even during COVID, which was a pretty difficult time for restaurants, our churn was relatively low and consistent. So I wouldn't expect that we would see a change in pattern. We have and we'll keep watching it, of course, but we haven't seen a change in our pattern. And also, when we double-click on the churn, most of the churn historically has been for restaurants that go out of business versus restaurants that are leading to us to another platform. But it continues to be low single digits -- I mean, in the single digits. So we're encouraged by that.\nChris Comparato: The one thing I'll add -- this is Chris. The one thing I'll add is some of these questions related to churn are oriented towards the short term. And I just want to remind the audience that we're still only at 9% of our total addressable market for U.S. locations alone, and we're less than 2% of our total addressable market when you look at ARR as a potential. So we want to be mindful that the restaurant industry is going through a transformation to digital, and it's happening across the back of house to the front of house, and we believe we're still in the early days of leading this transformation. So just a reminder, because as we talk about recession warnings, we believe these are short-term considerations, but on the long term, we are increasingly excited about the opportunity ahead.\nHarshita Rawat: And just a follow-up. On capital allocation, so roll-up of scale smaller restaurant software providers kind of like very good sense in this valuation environment, but at the same time, a good balance sheet is also guidance has done going into a downturn. So how do you -- how are you kind of like thinking about the balance between these two?\nElena Gomez: Sorry, can you clarify your question? Are you asking the balance between a strong balance sheet and investing?\nHarshita Rawat: And acquiring some of the smaller, continuing to acquire some of the smaller providers, especially in the pertinent.\nElena Gomez: Yes. Yes, fair. I understand the question. Yes, look, our M&A strategy hasn't really changed. I think, obviously, the backdrop has changed. So we're going to continue to canvass the market like we always do. And our guiding principles around acquiring assets to the platform would be consistent with they've always done, which is, is it going to get us to market faster, is it going to be something that is an adjacency to our platform that really solves a pain point for the customer? So that's not changing. Of course, the valuations are different now, and so we're paying attention to that. So we'll be opportunistic if there's a fit.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rayna Kumar of UBS. Please proceed.\nRayna Kumar: You had a very strong net take rate in the quarter, 53 basis points. Just wondering what the key drivers are there? And if there's anything unusual to call out as in onetime items?\nElena Gomez: Yes. So I'll repeat what I said earlier, which is there's really two factors driving the take rate benefit. One is our continued focus on just payment optimization and we have a whole team focused on that. And then, of course, we had healthy demand from our Toast Capital product, and we benefited from launching the 360-day loan, which was encouraging. So it's a combination of those. And really, when you zoom out and think about our take rate and monetization opportunity, you want to think beyond take rate and really think about the power of the platform and the fact that we have an opportunity to monetize on the SaaS side. And then over the long term, we're going to continue to drive product innovation that will drive more payment volume to our platform and continue to drive more digital -- digitization of our platform. And as we do that, we'll have more opportunity to drive more volume through the platform and more monetization. But I would zoom out and think of it broader than just the in-quarter take rate.\nRayna Kumar: That's very helpful. And just one follow-up. If you can just comment on your progress moving upmarket to more enterprise larger restaurants, please?\nAman Narang: Sure. So look, I think that this is a spectrum, right? We started the business in SMB and have gradually gone into bigger and bigger groups. And we've -- as I just mentioned, we -- in mid-market and enterprise, we saw some good expansion in wins this year. So things like Nothing Bundt Cakes which has been a customer for us for a while, expanded just about 400 units out of Texas. Jamba Juice expanded with Toast as well. Chris called out, Walk On's out of Louisiana. And I think there's a lot of interest in our enterprise offering. So the amount of inbound we're seeing continues to grow as well. And when I think about like just for some context, the 4 walls of a restaurant, right? The value proposition we offer to an SMB or a larger chain in many ways is similar. Things like handhelds improve operational efficiency, digital tools to improve automation, self-service. It's certainly outside the 4 walls, where things like config management, menu management, security and compliance, right through. And we continue to work on a lot of those capabilities, and we're confident over time that we're going to grow into that time gradually.\nOperator: We will now take our final question from the line of Josh Beck of KeyBanc.\nJosh Beck: I also was a big fan of Slide 20. Certainly has had really good progress in the flywheel markets, but they're still less than 10% of the total. So I guess my question is, in future years, is this trajectory likely to continue? Or is there some element of the emerging markets that you're just investing in that could maybe limit the slope of the flywheel markets. Just curious about how this trend progress over time?\nAman Narang: Yes. Look, great question. Look, we are really proud of the performance of our sales team and what we accomplished in Q3. And as you correctly pointed out, just for context for the audience, [indiscernible] markets where we have about 20% or more penetration, and that's less than 10% of our overall market. And we continue to see the same trend we've seen for a while now where as we see rep tenure because end market tend to improve, we tend to see productivity continue to improve. And there's nothing that's telling us that, that trend should not continue.\nJosh Beck: Excellent. And then maybe a follow-up, just to close on the invoicing products, certainly seem like an exciting launch at the Spark event. When you look across your existing base of customers, I'm curious how applicable the product is. I'm also curious, does it help you get into new segments? Just curious where the strongest product market fit may lie for that product.\nChris Comparato: Yes, Josh, it's extremely applicable. In my script, I talked about the different service models that restaurants are deploying to attract and deliver demand. Catering and invoice is one of those key service models. We believe that roughly 70% of our customer base and the industry has a need to drive catering, whether it's events, whether it's different types of meals, whether it's certain types of opportunities off of the kitchen, we believe the majority of restaurants have this need. It's in the early days for us. So on top of invoicing, you'll see this evolve to a broader catering platform. Restaurants today tend to use either manual processes or point solutions to deliver those engagements, but doing it on an all-in-one integrated platform makes it a lot easier for the restaurant operator. And then they could drive more invoicing. As I mentioned, Dos Toros tripled the amount of their invoicing usage over the course of the past 3 months and the payments volume for the restaurants increased 17% and, so we think it's a unique opportunity. It's still early days, but we'll continue to tell stories on how that evolves over the next few quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to the presenters.\nChris Comparato: Okay. Thank you all. Have a great evening, and thank you for your time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks for the question. This is Aman. Look, I think one of the things we're really proud of is just a great performance by our go-to-market team in Q3. You're seeing not only that with new customers are booking, they're booking at a higher ARPU. And you're also seeing that core of customers over time, as you saw on Slide 18, are expanding ARPU over time. And it's really across the board, right? We've got, on the upsell team, our growth as are getting more familiar with these newer products, as Elena mentioned, the attach rates of some of these products like employee cloud and xtraCHEF is lower and their high ARPU products. And then on to shop, we've got products like our guest products, even capital, as Chris talked about and also our core products in terms of just adding more hardware and software subscriptions through kiosks and such. And so across the board seeing really good momentum, and it's really both on new business bookings as well as an upsell as well. Sure, Stephen. Great question. Look, I think we, as Chris and Elena mentioned, really proud of the results in Q3. The sales team is really efficient in terms of driving growth. And it's really the story of Q3 is really consistency across the board. We saw really healthy win rates across legacy and cloud providers. We saw -- when we go into a buying decision, we tend to win more than 50% of the time as we've shared in the past. We've talked about, in previous calls, we talked about our focus on with our QSR launch and that start to make an impact and the balance in QSR and QSR is starting to improve. We've seen -- as Chris mentioned, we saw some good momentum in mid-market with things like the Walk On's win. We also had expansion from of our enterprise customers, Nothing Bundt Cakes and Jamba Juice. And even in terms of trends like new and existing, we -- just coming out of COVID, we've seen some small tailwind on new restaurants opening up and are seeing a good healthy balance in new and opening, existing restaurants as well. Sure. So look, I think that this is a spectrum, right? We started the business in SMB and have gradually gone into bigger and bigger groups. And we've -- as I just mentioned, we -- in mid-market and enterprise, we saw some good expansion in wins this year. So things like Nothing Bundt Cakes which has been a customer for us for a while, expanded just about 400 units out of Texas. Jamba Juice expanded with Toast as well.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining. Before jumping into the results, I want to thank the entire Toast team for another great quarter, the sustained execution and momentum we've built in the year since our IPO, thanks to the hard work and dedication of our great team. That execution contributed to another strong quarter with revenue and adjusted EBITDA both coming in above the high end of our guidance in Q3. Our integrated software and payments model together with a differentiated go-to-market approach is built to scale efficiently. And our balanced top line growth and improved profitability is early evidence of that. We're still less than 2% of the $55 billion U.S. market and have a huge opportunity ahead as we lead the restaurant industry's digital transition. We're confident that continuing to invest in innovation scale, our integrated business model will enable us to sustain both strong growth and margin improvement. In Q3, we added approximately 5,500 net new locations, increasing the number of total live location on our platform to approximately 74, 000. The growth is broad based with a healthy balance of existing restaurants switching over to Toast, existing customers expanding their footprint and new restaurants partnering with those. As evidenced by the examples Chris just shared, we're gaining traction across different types and segments of restaurants, thanks to the breadth of our industry-leading platform and the ability to deeply serve the entire industry. We expect to sustain our momentum in Q4 with net location adds in a similar range as Q3. Turning to our financial results. ARR, which is our core operational metric ended Q3 at $868 million, up 60% year-over-year. Total revenue grew 55% year-over-year to $752 million. Looking at what we operationally view as recurring revenue, subscription revenue and fintech gross profit totaled $224 million, up 82% year-over-year driven by our continued location growth and healthy ARPU increases across both SaaS and fintech solutions. Subscription services revenue increased 96% year-over-year in the third quarter, benefiting from our sustained location growth and increased product adoption. Total shop ARPU grew more than 20% year-over-year, driven by both new and existing customers. As we've discussed, new customers are joining the platform at higher ARPU than in prior years as they leverage the expanding breadth of our platform. Chris alluded to the increasing attach rate of nascent products like xtraCHEF, that's just one example of how our sales team is attaching more products at booking contributing to higher SaaS ARPU for our more recent customer cohorts. Existing customers are leveraging upsell channels to add more products. The ARPU for each of our pre-2022 annual customer cohorts is growing at double-digit rates, and we're still only scratching the surface on the potential for upsell. New products like payroll and xtraCHEF are still early on their growth and have much higher penetration with new customers than older cohorts. Plus, we have an exciting pipeline of new products for our customers to benefit from. As we continue to develop our upsell team and refine our sales motion, we believe we can continue to increase SaaS ARPU across our annual customer cohort. On the fintech solutions side, revenue grew 55% to $628 million, and gross profit was up 74% year-over-year to $134 million in the quarter. GPV growth remains healthy and increased 53% to $25 billion in Q3. Average annualized GPV per processing location of $1.4 million was roughly flat with Q2 and up 8% year-over-year. The growth in GPV per processing location is a result of higher average ticket and the continued rebound in customer transactions, which remains slightly below 2019 levels in Q3. In addition to healthy payments volume, we're also benefiting from our growing portfolio of fintech products and services led by Toast Capital. Those products drove $17 million of gross profit in Q3. Toast Capital offers a strong value proposition, and we have a great opportunity to further penetrate the significant restaurant lending, marketing opportunity as we expand the offering. In addition to Toast Capital, our portfolio of non-POS fintech products with nascent offerings like PayCard and payout and other products currently in development highlight the strategic benefit of our fintech capabilities and the opportunity to build products that add value for our customers while differentiating our offering and driving additional monetization. The combined -- the combination of continued optimization efforts from our payments platform investments, coupled with the growth in other fintech products resulted in a net take rate increasing to 53 basis points. As a reminder, GPV per processing location is typically higher during peak season in the second and third quarters each year. We expect GPV per processing location to seasonally decline quarter-over-quarter in Q4 and in Q1 each year. Total gross profit of 8% year-over-year and 31% quarter-over-quarter to $164 million, resulting in gross margin of 21.8%. We delivered gross margin improvement in each of our reporting lines leading to over 300 basis point gross margin improvement compared to Q2. Turning to customer acquisition costs. Hardware margins improved quarter-over-quarter due to lower shipping costs. Hardware Harbor revenue decreased year-over-year, mainly due to tough seasonal comp and accounting guidelines that require allocation of revenue across bundled products. We've seen upsell to existing customers revert to a typical seasonal pattern with Q2 benefiting from more hardware sales to existing customers in preparation for the outdoor season followed by a drop off in Q3. Last year with in-person dining still recovering after COVID, hardware upsell sales in Q3 were stronger than usual. On operating expenses, we continue to take a balanced approach to position for sustained top line momentum as we lead the digitization of the restaurant industry while putting in place a lean, flexible cost structure. Our hiring is focused on key investment areas with the strongest ROI potential, and we're rigorously prioritizing those opportunities as we tightly manage expense growth. At the same time, we're closely monitoring the dynamic macro backdrop and maintaining the flexibility in our cost structure to adapt to the changing environment. Moving to our other customer acquisition costs. Sales and marketing expense growth slowed to 54% year-over-year and further decline as a percentage of recurring revenue in Q3. Our go-to-market engine is well positioned to scale efficiently. As we drive sustained share gains and build flywheel effect an increasing number of markets, we expect rep productivity to increase, driving deeper market penetration and improving unit economics. The recent Spark event and release of our Toast's invoicing products, the latest example of how our investments in research and development are driving innovation to help our customers grow their business and improve their bottom line. We believe our balanced investments across core products, emerging growth products and our pipeline of new products will continue -- contribute to continued ARPU and location growth. General and admirative expenses were 25% of recurring revenue. Our G&A expenses include bad debt and credit-related expenses, which were approximately $13 million in Q3. Excluding bad debt and credit-related expenses, G&A grew 66% year-over-year as we continue to absorb public company costs. With our emphasis on disciplined cost management, we expect growth in the core G&A expenses to moderate in Q4 and anticipate operating leverage on G&A going forward. Bad debt and credit-related expenses include bad debt on outstanding receivables as well as liabilities related to Toast Capital and other fintech offerings. Our data advantage allows us to closely monitor the health of the restaurant and its repayment ability to maintain low default rates and manage our risk. And while we expect bad debt and credit expenses related to Toast Capital to grow as we expand the program, the overall operating margin is healthy and accretive to the business. Total Q3 adjusted EBITDA was negative $19 million. Our negative 2.6% margin was a 230 basis points improvement quarter-over-quarter. Q3 is a great example of our ability to drive healthy top line growth, continue to invest in key areas that will help sustain growth while operating efficiently to improve profitability. We remain focused on optimizing our cost base and rigorously prioritize investments in order to sustain this trajectory going forward. Now turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million, which represents 46% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, with adjusted EBITDA expected to be in the range of negative $30 million to negative $20 million. We continue to see healthy GPV trends into Q4 and our guidance reflects a seasonal decline in GPV per location similar to our typical historical trend. Based on strong Q3 performance and Q4 guidance, our full year 2022 revenue expectations are 3% higher at the midpoint. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $2.69 billion to $2.72 billion, a 59% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Our updated full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range is negative $127 million to negative $117 million, a nearly $30 million improvement at the midpoint from our last guidance. This implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of negative 4.5% for the year at the midpoint. Our focus on efficiency and disciplined cost management this year has enabled us to both meaningfully improve margins the last few quarters and invest in key areas that we believe will contribute to durable efficient growth. We intend to maintain this balanced approach going forward, investing in areas of product innovation as we go after the big market opportunity in front of us while driving operating leverage. The progress we've made to adopt our cost structure this year, along with our continued focus on efficient growth puts us on a trajectory to deliver a quarterly adjusted EBITDA profit by the end of 2023. This assumes the current macro environment remains relatively consistent. We're closely monitoring the key indicators. And if there were a meaningful change to the macro environment that impacts the restaurant industry, we would reassess that timing, but we have a proven ability to navigate changing market conditions and with the improvements in our cost structure, we're prepared to quickly adapt our business to any changes. In closing, we had a great third quarter, posting strong financial results on building on our operating momentum. I want to reiterate my thanks to our team for their focused execution. In the face of this dynamic operating environment, restaurants need a trusted technology partner more than ever to help them drive efficiency, offer differentiated guest experiences and enable new service models. Our relentless focus on being that partner to the restaurant industry and solving their biggest pain points is driving the strong growth in our business. And with investments to further strengthen our industry-leading platform, put Toast in a great position to lead the digital transition for the restaurant industry. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A. Yes. So our just capital business, we -- first of all, we see a lot of the data with our customers, so we're well positioned to really understand their ability to pay, their sort of their payment volume and so on. So the risk is largely managed. We pay careful attention to signals, but we're not seeing anything so far in our loan portfolio that leads us to believe that default rates are out of line. In fact, they're very much in line with our expectations, Tien. So we're not seeing that risk. But of course, we're going to keep monitoring it in light of the backdrop that we're in. Yes. No, that's a great question. So inflation is definitely a factor, and we know that in our GPV per location, and we know that we're benefiting from that. And we're also benefiting from higher transaction volumes. And I sort of commented on the fact that our ticket is being up, but also our transaction levels are close but not all the way back to 2019. So we're going to benefit a bit as that with respect to pre-COVID levels. Then the other interesting data point we look at is the cost of food. At home and the cost of food away from home, and we're seeing that the cost of food at home is growing faster than the cost of food away from home. So as diners have become more comfortable, and we're seeing that trend of consumer demand shifting to food away from home. We expect to continue to benefit from that as well. Sure, I'll take that and Aman, feel free to chime in as well. So that step-function is really broad based as we started testing different bundles that resonate with our customers. We started understanding that customers are actually, our sales team is getting really good at positioning the breadth of the platform. That's really the important part. They're getting used to solution selling. And in that, they're selling all elements of the platform, whether it's the guest products, online ordering, things like that as well as hardware, so it's really the breadth of products, payroll on xtraCHEF, payroll more obviously played a role, but we still have a continued opportunity with payroll. And xtraCHEF is too early to have that big of an impact. In fact, in 2021 was really nascent. So I would -- I don't even know it shows so early in 2021. So it's really a payroll and the broad breadth of the platform versus any 1 product. Yes. No, we're really encouraged by Toast Capital, and we commented on it because we wanted to give you guys more transparency. But we launched a 360-day product in Q3 and the take rate benefited from that. Our take rate, though, is a combination of two factors. It's not just Toast Capital, but also the improving the focus we have on improving our payment operations and infrastructure. So there's always going to be that focus. We have a whole team focused on that all the time. But in Q3, the primary -- the two primary drivers for both of those things, not just Toast Capital. Yes. I'll start by saying we're very early in our -- or we're in the middle and not early, but we're in the middle of our 2023 planning. So I'll have more specifics at our next earnings call. But at the highest level, we're going to continue to focus on cost discipline that we've -- and we've shown you guys for the last several quarters. So that's number one. We're going to continue to gain leverage in the obvious places like G&A. But I want to remind you, we have a massive opportunity ahead. So we're going to continue to invest in areas that are going to drive long-term sustainable growth. And that's how I would think about it as a very balanced approach to 2023 in light of the macro. Yes. So I'll talk about Q3. And you're right, Q3 net location adds came in better than we expected, and that's really a testament to the onboarding team. They were converting existing restaurants that were switching to Toast and converting them faster. So we saw a great performance from that team. That pulled some locations into Q3. Based on the current pipeline, I commented in my prepared remarks, we expect Q4 net location to be in a similar range to Q3, and we're still on track for strong growth in the full year. Yes. Typically, GPV per location and in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that it's seasonally higher in Q2 and Q3 and dips down into Q4. So that's not unusual. It's typical of historical patterns and our revenue guidance reflects that. And just to comment on your guidance comments. In October, we're seeing the same seasonal pattern we've seen historically. Yes, sure. So on SaaS gross margin, it's really scaling the business. And of course, you saw a healthy beat on the top line in both in the subscription side, and that's really our dress positioning the platform and our ARPU being strong, et cetera, that we've talked about. So that's really what's the story on SaaS gross margin. On your other question was bad debt related. Is that right? Okay. Yes. So basically, as we expand our Toast's loan program, we have to add and accrue for related future potential default rates. And our default rates have not been out of line with what we're expecting, and we should expect that to continue to grow. But overall, the Toast Capital program is a healthy business and actually accretive to the business, Tim. Yes. No, I'll start by saying we're super early in the international opportunities but very encouraged already by what we're seeing, but I would view -- we view 2022 is really a building year and into 2023, frankly. We talked earlier in the year about our investment level. It hasn't changed. We're kind of on the low end of the range of $10 million to $20 million that we talked about. And I would tell you, as the year has gone on, the investment has been increasing, obviously, as we're building the team out. But it's still early. We're evaluating all the things that you would expect the go-to-market motion, making sure we understand the product that we want to put out there in international. We've got a few early customers in Canada, Dublin and U.K. So we're learning from our early customers. And so far, the feedback has been really encouraging. So we're going to continue to make that investment into 2023. Yes. No, we haven't seen any change in our churn. And even during COVID, which was a pretty difficult time for restaurants, our churn was relatively low and consistent. So I wouldn't expect that we would see a change in pattern. We have and we'll keep watching it, of course, but we haven't seen a change in our pattern. And also, when we double-click on the churn, most of the churn historically has been for restaurants that go out of business versus restaurants that are leading to us to another platform. But it continues to be low single digits -- I mean, in the single digits. So we're encouraged by that. Sorry, can you clarify your question? Are you asking the balance between a strong balance sheet and investing? Yes. Yes, fair. I understand the question. Yes, look, our M&A strategy hasn't really changed. I think, obviously, the backdrop has changed. So we're going to continue to canvass the market like we always do. And our guiding principles around acquiring assets to the platform would be consistent with they've always done, which is, is it going to get us to market faster, is it going to be something that is an adjacency to our platform that really solves a pain point for the customer? So that's not changing. Of course, the valuations are different now, and so we're paying attention to that. So we'll be opportunistic if there's a fit. Yes. So I'll repeat what I said earlier, which is there's really two factors driving the take rate benefit. One is our continued focus on just payment optimization and we have a whole team focused on that. And then, of course, we had healthy demand from our Toast Capital product, and we benefited from launching the 360-day loan, which was encouraging. So it's a combination of those. And really, when you zoom out and think about our take rate and monetization opportunity, you want to think beyond take rate and really think about the power of the platform and the fact that we have an opportunity to monetize on the SaaS side. And then over the long term, we're going to continue to drive product innovation that will drive more payment volume to our platform and continue to drive more digital -- digitization of our platform. And as we do that, we'll have more opportunity to drive more volume through the platform and more monetization. But I would zoom out and think of it broader than just the in-quarter take rate."

            "name": "Chris Comparato",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I jump in, I'm going to apologize up-front for any coughing outburst or sips of hot tea as I'm recovering from a nasty cold. So let's jump in. This past quarter marked the first anniversary of Toast IPO. I want to thank all of our employees for their focus and dedication as well as our partners, customers and investors. We look forward to our ongoing partnership. And while we've accomplished a lot over the past year, we're even more excited about the opportunity in the years to come. Toast delivered a strong Q3, delivering continued efficient time growth and improved profitability. In addition to topping our revenue and EBITDA expectations, we surpassed $100 billion in annualized GPV for the first time. These results are a testament to the consistent execution of our core strategy, driving location growth, deepening our ability to serve all segments of the restaurant industry and delivering product innovation. On the product front, last month, we hosted Spark, our annual innovation event, where we announced the new product updates to help restaurants grow and expand their business and overcome key challenges. A key highlight is Toast invoicing, a new product to help restaurants seamlessly manage catering and wholesale orders alongside their in-store take out and delivery businesses. a great example of our continued product innovation and how we're leveraging new products to better serve different restaurant types. While the fundamentals in our business remain strong, we continue to closely monitor the uncertain macroeconomic environment that both we and our customers are operating in. Toast customers continue to see solid consumer demand, and the restaurant industry remains healthy. We're focused on partnering with both new and existing customers to ensure they are able to adapt and thrive in this dynamic environment. In addition, we are equally prepared to adapt our business to any macro changes in the restaurant industry. In the third quarter, we grew revenue 55% year-over-year to $752 million, and ARR was up 60% to $868 million. GPV remains healthy, increasing 53% year-over-year in Q3. We also continue to drive strong location growth, adding approximately 5,500 net new locations and ending the quarter with approximately 74,000 total locations, sustaining over 40% growth in total locations even as our scale grows is indicative of our powerful go-to-market strategy and industry-leading platform. As a result of this consistent execution, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by 3% at the midpoint of the range which implies 59% year-over-year growth. We're also increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance by nearly $30 million at the midpoint. The continued margin improvement in Q3 is further evidence of our focus on cost discipline and efficiency efforts and our progress towards profitability. We remain committed to balancing investments in our most important areas to go after the massive market opportunity in front of us with disciplined cost management and healthy unit economics to sustain that efficient growth as we scale. Our ability to scale our proven go-to-market strategy gives us confidence that our unit economics will continue to improve over time. We've discussed the flywheel effect that drives increasing referrals and inbounds as we increase penetration in a local market. That results in higher and more efficient productivity. That higher productivity leads to more ARR and better profit contribution as these markets scale. Over the past year, the percentage of total SMB restaurant locations in markets to have over 20% penetration has increased by more than 5 times, and we continue to gain share in these markets, proof that we still have significant room to keep increasing share even in our more established markets. A large majority of our markets are still below that 20% penetration, and we're investing to replicate that flywheel effect in more markets. When you combine the significant untapped SMB opportunity with our nascent share in the enterprise and international segments, we still have a long runway of growth ahead, and we're well positioned to capitalize on the digital transformation in the restaurant industry. Demand for Toast across the full spectrum of the restaurant types remains strong, and our new customers continue to take advantage of more products across our platform to operate more efficiently and grow their business. I'll highlight a few examples from the past quarter. Antoine's, one of New Orleans storied French Quarter restaurants selected Toast as its technology partner, known for its classic fine dining experience Antoine's wanted a new partner who could modernize its back of house while also preserving its special front-of-house experience. In addition to our robust all-in-one platform, Antoine was attracted to our payroll and Toast's manager solution to help eliminate the inefficiency of making multiple back-office trips each night to aggregate tips with their legacy POS. They're also using 13 of Toast's kitchen display systems in their spans kitchen, along with several of our guest modules. Antoine came to us via a strong referral from another New Orleans Toast customer. A great example of the relationships our local go-to-market team builds and how that flywheel effect works as we gain traction in these local markets. Walk On's is excited to leverage Toast across its growing footprint of nearly 100 existing and planned locations across the South and Midwest, co-owned by NFL star Drew Brees and named the number one Best Sports Bar in America by ESPN and the number one sports bar franchise two years running by entrepreneur Walk On's has started to Toast's at some of their locations. Seem to enhance their technology, Walk On's is adopting our POS for its ease of use, our Toast Go handhelds to help navigate seas of sports fans and our API integrations to provide superior service through all of our ordering channels. Taco Maya is a fast casual QSR with 6 existing and 4 planned locations throughout Chicago and Illinois. Taco Maya will be implementing 10 Toast's module assets footprint, including xtraCHEF for better visibility into costs, multi-location management for easier menu updating and online ordering and Mobile Order & Pay among others, to provide an efficient, seamless customer experience. Every location also includes a patio, which Taco Maya will equip servers with our Toast Go handhelds to service. It's a great use case for our Toast Gos, which have proven to benefit staff productivity. Taco Maya is just one example of the momentum we're building in the QSR segment. Earlier this year, we announced Toast for QSR. And in Q3, QSRs represented nearly half of our bookings, its highest level in recent years. One important benefit of our vertical focus on the restaurant industry is the ability to leverage the Toast platform to develop offerings tailored to the needs of specific restaurant types, enabling us to deepen our penetration across restaurant segments. With restaurants operating in an increasingly dynamic environment, it's critical that we constantly speak to and stay connected with our customers. We recently conducted our annual Voice of the Restaurant Industry Survey to gain insights into the major challenges facing restaurants and how tech can help them thrive. Similar to themes we've seen this year, labor shortages and inflation are the challenges facing our customers. 1 in 3 restaurants said they've had a difficult time hiring in 2022 and almost 40% started tracking the prices of key ingredients. The survey also highlighted employee scheduling as one of our customers' biggest technology pain points, reinforcing the importance of adding Sling to our team management product suite. In addition, our customers are also diversifying their businesses to meet the evolving needs of guests and to develop new revenue streams. On average, restaurant surveyed employed 7 different service models such as on-premise, takeout, delivery, catering, wholesale, curbside and drive-thru. Our recent product innovations highlight how Toast is uniquely positioned to help restaurants navigate these challenges and take advantage of new opportunities to transform and grow. At Spark, we announced Toast invoicing, which enables restaurants to efficiently manage wholesale and catering orders along with their core restaurant business in 1 integrated system. Our customers can save time on managing paperwork and multiple systems while getting paid faster and seamlessly capitalizing on the opportunity to grow their business with more service models. Toast invoicing showcases our ability to deeply serve hybrid locations and provide a seamless billing and payment solution for both B2B and B2C. We estimate over 70% of restaurants already offer catering in addition to their on-premise business, and catering is one of the top 3 focus areas for restaurant owners and operators as we head into 2023. A great example of how customers are leveraging our new invoicing offering is founders table, which operates 2 QSR Dos Toros Taqueria and Chopt Creative Salad and is a great strategic partner of ours. They went live with invoicing in June at 19 of their Dos Toros locations in order to streamline their operations and payments for catering into 1 platform after previously using a separate point solution. In addition to the efficiency of managing this through a single integrated platform over the past 3 months, Dos Toros monthly invoice and usage with Toast's more than doubled. And in September alone, invoicing drove a 17% uplift in their payments volume on Toast. At Spark, we also featured our xtraCHEF Price Tracker. As I mentioned earlier, this is a major pain point for restaurants due to the inflationary environment. Our customers can access the price tracker directly from our newly designed xtraCHEF dashboard to stay on top of fluctuating ingredient prices and costs. Restaurants like Plaza Pizza are watching price fluctuations week-to-week and in response to these insights have engaged in negotiations with food distributors. Plaza Pizza was able to successfully reduce food costs by nearly 10%. Other customers are monitoring key price changes to make strategic decisions about their menus, their recipes and pricing. Our ability to help customers navigate this important issue is evident in how quickly the attach rate for xtraCHEF has ramped. After only adding it to our sales motion in Q1 this year, the percentage of locations that went live in Q3 using xtraCHEF is already in the mid-teens, and we continue to see a significant opportunity to reach customers and further develop our product suite to help restaurants manage their suppliers. Finally, I'd like to highlight Toast Capital, where our data on restaurant performance enables us to help offer restaurants seamless, low friction access to capital. The majority of applicants received an approval decision in 1 business day, and on average, funds are dispersed to customers just 2 days after signing their loan agreement. That differentiated customer experience is evident in customer retention. Among the 2021 customer cohort, over 70% have taken a second loan and in some cases, multiple additional loans. In Q3, we exceeded our offering, adding a 360-day loan with larger available loan sizes to give customers more choice and meet a wider range of use cases. The strong customer value proposition of Toast Capital and the different offerings we've added over the past year continue to drive healthy growth with SMB businesses underserved by the banking community in an estimated two-thirds of all SMB businesses having financial needs each year. We have a clear opportunity to leverage our expanding portfolio of banking products to both add significant value for our customers and drive strong growth going forward. In summary, Toast delivered strong execution and continued momentum in Q3, balancing targeted investments to drive product innovation with focus on healthy unit economics and disciplined cost management. Amid uncertain times, we are more committed than ever to our mission to empower the restaurant community, to delight guests, do what they love and thrive. We believe that serving as the restaurant industry trusted technology partner and giving restaurants the tools they need to adapt and succeed will benefit our customers while helping Toast deliver durable, efficient growth for many years to come. Now I'll turn the call over to Elena. Yes. DJ, this is Chris. I think you want to put yourself in a position to support the restaurants demands whether it's a net new customer upfront, as Aman mentioned, bundling more of the platform up-front in efficient motion to win that customer. But then over time, given existing customers the flexibility either through self-service, product-led growth or the upsell motion to have really clear accessibility to our platform and all of its modules. So we spend a lot of time looking at that customer journey for restaurant segments of all types to identify what is the right channel for which they can get exposed to the right products, and then we capitalize on those efforts. And we're seeing that those teams are becoming more and more productive over time. So that's what we look at. But then we complement that with making sure that the platform has all the needs that address the restaurant's pain points, and we continue to select and build the right products to address those pain points. Sure. So we're very excited about the hotel opportunity. We continue to build out our PMS integrations and they're well beyond Oracle's PMS. There's a span of PMS integrations that we are now capable of interfacing with at hotel properties, but the team continues to build out that foundation. We're very confident that we can support the restaurants within those hotels. We've got a number of opportunities in our pipeline that are exciting. But I'll caution you that it's still early days. We're winning hotels. But again, we're building that muscle as we speak. And over the course of the next few quarters, you'll see us continue to execute within that segment, and we're excited about it. Well, Josh, I'll jump in. We're not seeing any signs of changes in consumer demand or spending across our business. Restaurants continue to see healthy demand in line with what we think are historical seasonality trends. And that said, we're mindful of the macro environment. We believe consumer spend on dining has proven resilient during past recessions. And then the last thing I'll leave you with is for restaurants, we fundamentally believe that our platform becomes even more valuable in a tough market. Restaurants are turning to us for driving efficiency, growing their business, as we mentioned, things like invoicing and new service models, maintaining their teams and then driving operational costs across the board. So we think we're in a good spot when it comes to looking at the macro and the situations that have been looming. The one thing I'll add -- this is Chris. The one thing I'll add is some of these questions related to churn are oriented towards the short term. And I just want to remind the audience that we're still only at 9% of our total addressable market for U.S. locations alone, and we're less than 2% of our total addressable market when you look at ARR as a potential. So we want to be mindful that the restaurant industry is going through a transformation to digital, and it's happening across the back of house to the front of house, and we believe we're still in the early days of leading this transformation. So just a reminder, because as we talk about recession warnings, we believe these are short-term considerations, but on the long term, we are increasingly excited about the opportunity ahead. Yes, Josh, it's extremely applicable. In my script, I talked about the different service models that restaurants are deploying to attract and deliver demand. Catering and invoice is one of those key service models. We believe that roughly 70% of our customer base and the industry has a need to drive catering, whether it's events, whether it's different types of meals, whether it's certain types of opportunities off of the kitchen, we believe the majority of restaurants have this need. It's in the early days for us. So on top of invoicing, you'll see this evolve to a broader catering platform. Restaurants today tend to use either manual processes or point solutions to deliver those engagements, but doing it on an all-in-one integrated platform makes it a lot easier for the restaurant operator. And then they could drive more invoicing. As I mentioned, Dos Toros tripled the amount of their invoicing usage over the course of the past 3 months and the payments volume for the restaurants increased 17% and, so we think it's a unique opportunity. It's still early days, but we'll continue to tell stories on how that evolves over the next few quarters. Okay. Thank you all. Have a great evening, and thank you for your time."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Comparato: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Toast continues to build on our operational momentum in Q2, posting strong efficient growth, exceeding both our revenue and profit expectations, and delivering another record quarter of new location additions. This momentum stems from the consistent execution of our core growth strategy, driving location growth, deepening our ability to serve all segments of the restaurant industry and delivering product innovation for restaurants. On that front, last month, we announced the acquisition of Sling to further expand our team management suite and help restaurants deepen their relationship with employees. We're excited to welcome the Sling team to the Toast family. While we have tremendous momentum across our business, we're also cognizant of the current macroeconomic backdrop and what it means for our customers. Restaurants are operating in a challenging environment, facing heightened food cost inflation, labor constraints, higher wages and uncertainty in this broader economy. But the restaurant industry has faced challenges many times before and proven incredibly resilient over time. Restaurants adapted and bounced back from unprecedented conditions during COVID and have successfully navigated prior economic downturns. It's a testament to how much people enjoy the restaurant experience. Even in the most challenging times, people love eating out, and restaurants are often at the center of our communities. Turning to our results for the quarter. Revenue increased 58% year-over-year to $675 million in the second quarter, and ARR was up 59% to $787 million. GPV remains strong, growing 62% year-over-year to $23 billion in Q2. We also continue to drive on location growth. After adding over 5,000 net new restaurant locations in a quarter for the first time in Q1, we now exceeded 6,000 net new restaurant locations in Q2, just incredible growth that is being driven by our strong bookings pipeline as well as continued low churn. As a result of our consistent execution and first half performance, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by 5% at the midpoint of the range, which implies 55% year-over-year growth. Driving towards profitability is a key priority for our team, and the progress is clear in the significant adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in Q2. With the increased focus on efficiency and rigorous prioritization of our investment opportunities, we expect to sustain these improvements, and we're raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook for 2022 by $35 million at the midpoint to reflect that. Elena will provide more detail on our outlook shortly. With the restaurant industry in the midst of a generational shift to cloud-based digital solutions, we continue to seamlessly execute our proven go-to-market strategy to capitalize on that opportunity. As we increase density in more established territories, we benefit from the flywheel effect that drives referrals and inbound leads, driving higher and more efficient productivity. At the same time, we're gaining traction in less developed markets and are on a path to replicate that flywheel effect as we gain share. In addition to the strong growth in new locations, customer churn remains low. Our industry-leading platform adds tremendous value to our customers, helping them grow and creating a passionate and loyal customer base. The success of the Toast restaurants we support lie at the heart of our business model. We grow as our customers grow. In Q2, we continue to see success with all formats and types of restaurants. I'll highlight a few examples. In enterprise, we expanded our relationship with Jamba Juice by 40 locations, bringing our partnership to more than 700 total locations. As part of the expanded relationship, Jamba is piloting the addition of the Toast kiosk product to streamline checkout and help combat heightened labor costs. Jamba Juice showcases how Toast is designed to increase throughput in high-volume environments like QSR and fast-casual and how some of our largest customers continue to adopt more of our platform to increase efficiency and drive growth. Chip Cookies selected Toast in Q2 to support its growing 13-location business. From making it back-of-house more efficient with our Payroll, xtraCHEF and multi-location management products to using our point-of-sale and delivery services to more efficiently serve customers, Chip Cookies saw the value of Toast as an all-in-one solution that could help them grow while managing their business more efficiently. By leveraging more than 10 of our modules, Chip Cookies is a great example of how the benefits to customers increase as they leverage more of our integrated platform. While Chip highlights how new customers are using more of our platform, we also have a significant opportunity to help customers find more ways to leverage the full expense of our platform to create value for their businesses. Our e-commerce offering, Toast Shop, provides customers an efficient self-service options to seamlessly add products and has been a consistent source of incremental SaaS ARPU. Last year, we also started a growth sales team, solely focused on selling to our existing customers to complement Toast Shop. We continue to invest in and evolve that team, and the second quarter marked the first time the entire growth team with selling our full product set. This enables each of our reps to efficiently partner with customers on ways to utilize the full breadth of our platform. A good example of the benefit of our growth team that \u2013 a good example of the benefit our growth teams can bring customers is Maize Mexican Grill, a fast casual restaurant group. Maize initially inquired about adding our loyalty product across its locations. Our growth team worked with the customer to highlight the benefits of our full platform, which led to them adopting several of our guest products as well as Payroll and xtraCHEF. This showcases the power of having a team focused on upsell and reps equipped to help customers take advantage of the full power of our integrated platform. While we are pleased with the initial results, we're still early on in this area. We see a big opportunity to drive broader adoption of our platform among existing customers. One of Toast's key differentiators is our focus on restaurants and our ability to deeply serve different customer segments regardless of size or format. Earlier this year, we announced Toast for Hotel Restaurants, a powerful new solution designed to meet unique the needs of hotel restaurant operators by seamlessly integrating leading hotel property management system with the Toast platform. As a result of that new capability, in Q2, we signed a regional hotel chain for its full-service restaurant concept across over 10 locations. This hotel chain will use our handheld point-of-sale for table-side order and pay, our kitchen display systems to expedite orders and our multi-location management to efficiently manage menus. This is evidence of the opportunity we have to go much deeper in the hotel restaurant segment with our new offering. Shifting to products. As we continue to enable our customers to deeply connect with all of their stakeholders, I want to focus on the critical employee touch point. In the midst of an extremely challenging labor market, winning the hearts and minds of employees is more important than ever. Last month, we announced the acquisition of Sling, a leading employee scheduling and communications solution. Integrating scheduling and communications into our platform alongside our other team management products, including Payroll, Tips Manager and PayCard, will help restaurants deepen their relationship with employees, more efficiently manage labor and create a differentiated employee experience. Employee communications and scheduling is a high-engagement product, and it's also an important new touch point for Toast, with more than 11 million restaurant workers in the U.S. Similar to our prior acquisitions, our relationship with Sling started as a partnership, which launched early last year. The strong customer signal informed our view on how the product can enhance our entire team management suite. After incorporating Sling into our sales motion, our win rate was higher when customers evaluated Sling and Payroll together compared to when only quoting Payroll. This offers early proof of how Sling complements our existing team management suite and can enhance the overall value proposition to our customers. With Sling as part of the Toast family, we plan to fully integrate the offering into our platform to provide customers a seamless experience. The acquisition also allows us to accelerate product development in alignment with the road map for our team management suite and continue to build features specifically targeted for our restaurant customers and their employees. Sling makes our team management suite more robust and is another example of how, with our cloud-based platform, purpose built to meet the specific needs of restaurants, no partner is better positioned to help the industry adapt and thrive than Toast. While restaurant industry sales have fully bounced back from COVID and are above 2019 levels, as I noted earlier, restaurants are facing challenges. Labor and food are two \u2013 are the two biggest expenses for restaurants, and the current environment has amplified the pressure on both. Inflation is at a multi-decade high, and the restaurant workforce is still about 6% below prepandemic levels, creating staff and constraints. But our platform is built to help restaurants navigate these challenges. We provide restaurants with an array of products to automate processes and increase efficiency across their workflows so they can focus on what matters the most, the food, their guests and their employees. xtraCHEF not only automates manual invoice processing and inventory management, it also provides restaurant managers with real-time data on food cost trends to inform decisions on menu pricing and sourcing to help preserve profitability. With the help of xtraCHEF, under Valley Hospitality Group in Texas was able to reduce costs by 3% on average across their locations, saving over $330,000 per year. This is an invaluable tool with food costs rising at historic levels, and we are seeing adoption of xtraCHEF increase as restaurants seek to optimize margins. Products like our Toast Go handheld, kiosks and mobile order and pay allows savvy operators to better manage labor expenses and employees to handle more orders per hour, leading to higher tests while also providing a better guest experience. More QSR and fast casual restaurants are rolling out these digital touch points for guests to overcome staffing shortages while meeting evolving customer preferences. And Toast is well positioned to lead that transition. For example, New England Lobster Market & Eatery, a fast casual restaurant, is using our mobile order and pay solution for the majority of its on-premise transactions. In addition to requiring less staff, tips have more than doubled and are automatically split amongst employees, helping the restaurant significantly reduce turnover without incremental wage pressure. In summary, the Toast platform is more relevant and valuable than ever to our customers as they navigate these changing conditions. As customers use more of our platform, they can drive efficiency across their business to mitigate costs while continuing to offer a great guest experience. Simply put, our goal is to get restaurants all the tools they need to adapt and thrive. Restaurants deserve a trusted partner who shares their vision for a future where the restaurant in the entire industry thrives, and their businesses flourish, a partner who helps restaurants spend more time delighting customers and less time confused by technology, a partner who will advocate for the industry, and Toast is that partner. In closing, I want to thank our employees for a great first half of the year. I'm proud of how we're executing and our team's tireless effort to add value for our customers. Now I'll turn the call over to Elena.\nElena Gomez: Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining. And a big thank you to the Toast team. All your hard work and dedication to serving our customers led to another quarter of great results. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA came in ahead of expectations in Q2. The power of our integrated software and payments model, together with our industry-leading platform, continue to drive strong top line growth. And our commitment to cost discipline was evident in our significant adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Not only are we proud of the strong results this quarter, we're also excited to welcome the Sling team to Toast. As Chris mentioned, Sling strengthens our team management product suite and will serve to further differentiate our platform as we focus on being the technology backbone for the restaurant industry. Our proven go-to-market strategy investments to scale the sales team continues to pay off. Net new location adds further accelerated in Q2 to over 6,000, increasing the number of total live locations on our platform to approximately 68,000. The continued market share gains highlight the tremendous value our platform provides restaurants, which also contributes to our consistently low churn rate. It's worth noting that Q2 is seasonally our strongest quarter for net location adds. Summer is the peak season for restaurants. And with some less likely to switch platforms during their busiest period, we typically add fewer new locations in Q3 than in Q2. We've seen the seasonal pattern in our business over several years and expect the same this year. That said, our pipeline remains strong. The value proposition is clearly resonating, and we are well positioned to sustain our momentum. Turning to our quarterly results. Total revenue grew 58% year-over-year to $675 million. ARR, which is our core operational metric, ended at \u2013 ended Q2 at $787 million, up 59% year-over-year and 24% compared to Q1. Total ARPU eclipsed 11,000 for the first time driven by strong growth in both our recurring revenue stream, SaaS and payments. Subscription services revenue increased 100% year-over-year in the second quarter, benefiting from our location growth and increased product adoption as both new and existing customers leverage more of our platform. As of the end of Q2, 61% of our Toast locations use four or more products on top of our integrated POS and payment solution, but even a higher percentage of new live customers join the platform with four or more products. As a result, SaaS ARPU continues to increase for each new quarterly cohort of live customers and is above the average for our platform. As we think about our long-term ARPU potential, we also believe upsell will be a big contributor. As Chris mentioned, our Toast shop e-commerce store has been an efficient channel for existing customers to add products. With our gross sales team now complementing the e-commerce solution and all those reps selling our full array of products, we have an opportunity to drive deeper adoption of our products like xtraCHEF and Payroll and help customers leverage more of our integrated platform to create value for their business. Total upsell across Toast shop and our growth sales team contributed over 20% of the incremental SaaS ARR in Q2, and we see a big opportunity to unlock incremental ARPU growth over time. On the fintech solutions side, revenue grew 59% to $562 million, and gross profit was up 54% year-over-year to $114 million in the quarter. As a reminder, SaaS revenue and fintech gross profit comprise what we operationally view as recurring revenue. Fintech gross profit benefited from sustained strength in GPV, which increased 62% to $23 billion in Q2. Average annualized GPV per processing location was up 16% year-over-year to $1.4 million. The growth in GPV per processing location is a result of both higher average ticket and the continued rebound in customer transaction, which was slightly below 2019 levels in Q2. The net take rate of 49 basis points was within the range we expect in the near term. Debit mix declined quarter-over-quarter, in line with typical seasonal patterns, partly offset by the benefit of our continued cost optimization efforts. Total gross profit grew 33% year-over-year and 24% quarter-over-quarter to $125 million, resulting in gross margin of 18.5%. Looking at our recurring stream, subscription and fintech gross profit totaled $169 million, up 67% year-over-year, driven by our continued location growth and strong ARPU increases across both SaaS and fintech solutions. Looking at customer acquisition costs. We continue to tightly manage unit economics to maintain healthy payback periods even as we navigate headwinds on the hardware side and invest to scale the business. As we noted last quarter, hardware margin declined quarter-over-quarter. We expect hardware margins to improve in the second half of the year as we benefit from the shift to lower cost shipping methods. Our decision to strategically increase inventory not only drives cost savings on shipping, but also insulates us from short-term supply chain disruptions, allowing us to continue to seamlessly serve our customers. Before discussing our other cost lines, I want to provide context on the pace of our overall operating expense growth. Over the past year, we accelerated hiring across the business to rebuild our teams following the staff reductions in early 2020 to sustain our momentum as the business rapidly scales and to position Toast to capitalize on this large opportunity ahead. We're now largely past that ramp in hiring. With what's reflected in our updated outlook for the rest of 2022, we believe our cost structure will align with the scale and growth trajectory of the business. That positions us to continue to invest in key growth areas to sustain top line momentum while further improving profitability going forward. Sales and marketing expense declined as a percentage of recurring revenue in Q2. The initial benefit from scaling our sales team is already evident in the strong location and ARPU growth. Last quarter, we discussed how our go-to-market strategy creates a flywheel effect. As we increased market share in a territory, inbound traffic and referrals grow and our sales reps deliver higher productivity. We expect that to be a tailwind going forward, particularly as we gain traction in the less penetrated territories that we're investing into. In addition, our sales reps naturally become more productive as they gain experience. By ramping hiring over the past year, the average tenure of our sales force has naturally declined. With our sales rep base closer to our target level, we plan to increase the team at a more steady state and expect our average tenure to increase, which historically led to increased productivity. We expect both of these dynamics to contribute to increased efficiency in sales and marketing expenses over time. Research and development is another area where we accelerated investment over the past year. This includes continuing to develop and broaden our platform and scaling the team to support the incredible growth we've experienced over the past two years. We now have more than doubled the number of locations on our platform than the onset of COVID, and our ambitions have grown significantly. We're investing to build platform scalability and stability in order to support hundreds of thousands of restaurants over the coming years. Product innovation also remains core to our growth strategy. Our strong ARPU growth gives us conviction on the ROI of our product investments. And we still have a huge opportunity to add more products that restaurants want and provide features and functionality that will enable us to both broaden and more deeply penetrate our TAM. In the first half of 2022, approximately 20% of our R&D spend went towards products and initiatives that represent less than 5% of our ARR today. We expect [indiscernible] to become important drivers over the next few years. That investment is skewed towards products where we've already seen initial traction like our team management suite, notably Payroll. A smaller portion is allocated to initiatives that we expect to be meaningful drivers in the medium term. We're committed to maintaining a balanced R&D profile, investing to drive continued innovation in our core products and to scale our platform while allocating capital to emerging areas that we have high conviction can increase our ARPU potential and expand our market opportunity. Moving down the P&L. The year-over-year growth in general and administrative expenses continue to be primarily related to public company-related expenses. The growth in G&A should decline to a more steady-state level in Q4 as we fully lap the initial step-up from late last year. We intend to remain disciplined in managing overhead and expect to deliver operating leverage in G&A starting in 2023. Total Q2 adjusted EBITDA was negative $33 million, well ahead of our guidance, and margins improved 350 basis points quarter-over-quarter to negative 4.9%. Our increased focus on efficiency and cost discipline contributed to the beat. Additionally, with GPV seasonally higher, we typically see greater quarter-over-quarter margin improvement in Q2, and that was amplified with GPV exceeding expectations. Now turning to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $700 million to $730 million, which represents 47% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, with adjusted EBITDA expected to be in the range of negative $40 million to negative $30 million. Following our strong first half of the year, we are increasing our revenue expectations for the full year by 5% at the midpoint. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.66 billion, a 55% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. We are also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to negative $160 million to negative $140 million for 2022. This includes the integration of Sling, which is a modest drag on EBITDA. The midpoint of our updated range is a $70 million and 360 basis point margin improvement compared to the initial '22 guidance we gave in February. In addition to our strong execution and continued top line momentum, the improvement reflects our increased cost discipline and current pace of hiring as we focus on delivering durable efficient growth. Our current outlook puts us on track for a 130 basis point margin improvement in the second half of the year compared to the first while continuing to make targeted investments in key growth areas to position Toast for a sustained location and ARPU growth for years to come. Improving profitability is a top priority across the company. Our results and our improved outlook are indicative of our focus on efficiency and cost discipline. These efforts will enable us to drive toward profitability faster. As we look ahead, while our business remains healthy into Q3, we recognize the economic outlook in the U.S. is mixed. Given that, we have been measured in our guidance for the rest of the year to factor in that uncertainty and the potential for slower consumer trends. Overall, we've made great progress on positioning our cost structure for the scale and growth profile of our business, which will enable us to deliver operating leverage and move even faster on growth opportunities to sustain top line momentum. It also gives us the flexibility to adapt quickly to any change in the business or macro environment. Looking back at the first half. While we are very pleased with our performance, we're still early \u2013 in the early innings, with only 1% penetration of this massive $55 billion market opportunity. We remain focused on our goal to serve as the technology backbone for the restaurant industry, continually bolstering our platform with more products and features to add value for our customers and to help them outperform their competitors. And we're confident that continuing to execute on our mission will drive sustained location and ARPU growth and create significant long-term shareholder value. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed\nWill Nance: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Nice results today. I wanted to ask on some of the comments that you made around operating leverage starting in next year as well as a lot of the progress that you've made year-to-date in controlling costs and, obviously, raising the EBITDA margin expectations for the year. I don't think you guys have given a long-term profitability target, but I think last quarter, you guys talked about kind of getting the cash flow breakeven over the near term. I'm wondering if you can kind of update us on your latest thoughts on when you guys would expect to get there over the next couple of quarters, particularly as we look out to 2023 and you're kind of signaling more operating leverage to come.\nElena Gomez: Yes. Thanks for the question. So hopefully, you can tell that improving profitability is one of our biggest priorities. And we've made great progress in the first half of the year on EBITDA, and you can see that reflected in our guidance. And we believe we'll exit this year in a position to balance the investments of growth and margin improvement. And I just want to be mindful of the macro. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our guidance reflected some of that, which is also part of the reason we didn't want to give guidance beyond 2022 because we want to be incredibly balanced in that. And we also, frankly, want to take advantage of this market opportunity that's presented to us. We still believe and have a ton of conviction that there's a lot of growth to come, and we're in the early innings. So we're trying to balance that growth with also cost discipline, as you guys can see in our results.\nWill Nance: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on some of the take rate dynamics in the quarter. I know you mentioned mix and then some of the optimization things going on. Any color on the recent kind of small business interchange changes that the networks announced? And how much \u2013 how meaningful that was to you guys of net take rate?\nElena Gomez: Yes. The biggest impact really was the mix shift from credit \u2013 from debit to credit. So that's really the primary driver, offset by some of our own cost optimization efforts. So I would say that's the primary story. There is nothing different to report on that.\nWill Nance: Got it. I appreciate for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJosh Baer: Thanks for the question and great quarter. Wanted to ask about the 6,000-plus location additions. Any more commentary on regions of strength or market segments that were driving the location additions or any big restaurant groups, restaurant chains? Just looking for more context on that success on the location number.\nChris Comparato: Yes, Josh. Good question. On the whole, the bookings trends remain really solid, and we're pleased with how the sales team is executing across the board. And we're pretty encouraged with the incremental demand from some of our recent product announcements. The team continues to do quite well in FSR as well as QSR. And I'd say it's broad growth across the board. And there's no segment specific breakout. It's really just been across the board.\nJosh Baer: Okay. Got it. And then one on Sling. Any financial impact to the model to call out?\nElena Gomez: The impact of Sling is just not material to the numbers today. So we're not going to call it out.\nJosh Baer: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please proceed.\nStephen Sheldon: Hi, good afternoon and congrats on the really strong performance here. Wanted to ask about consumer behavior. I think you said you're being a little cautious with your assumptions there in the guidance. But just based on the visibility you have, have there been any shifts in the way consumers are engaging with your restaurant clients as the macro environment has gotten tougher, as consumer sentiment has weakened here? Any general changes to call out there during the quarter and into July?\nChris Comparato: Sure. Thanks, Stephen. First, we're not seeing any signs of a drop in consumer demand or pull back in spending in our business. Restaurants are seeing healthy demand. Consumers continue to spend on services like dining, and the GPV trends are strong. That said, we're pretty mindful of the mixed macroeconomic signals, and we're monitoring closely. We still have \u2013 and even through July, we haven't seen any pullback on consumer demand. And while we're not immune, consumer spend at restaurants has held up relatively well during past recessions, and we've been looking at past recessions. And we feel pretty confident in what consumers will spend within the restaurant market. And then the last point I'd make is for restaurants, our platform becomes even more valuable in a tough market. So if we did see signal, you could rest assured that we've got scenarios planned, and we feel like our platform is in a good spot to help restaurants adapt and navigate uncertainty. So we feel pretty good on that consumer dimension.\nStephen Sheldon: Very helpful. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up. As you talk about a bigger focus on profit and margins, just want to make sure I understand how you plan to manage things there. Is that more \u2013 the margins will continue to stabilize? Or are you also expecting absolute losses to moderate as we think about 2023 and beyond?\nElena Gomez: Yes. I mean I think the way to think about it is what you guys probably don't see is we're metering our hiring and really focusing on investments in high ROI areas. We're taking a deep inspection in areas that don't drive revenue today and being incredibly ruthless in our prioritization there. And so as we think about margins, you should see a steady improvement over time and a commitment from this management team to get to breakeven and profitability over the near term.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Please proceed.\nDJ Hynes: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. Chris, just thinking strategically in context of the industry challenges you mentioned, right, you guys have tons of data. You have areas of regional concentration. You talked about heightened food cost. Is there an opportunity to create a group purchasing solution? Like would that make sense as part of the finance suite? I know there are others that do this, but I just think that you guys would be really well positioned to participate in that opportunity.\nChris Comparato: Yes, DJ. It's a good question. I'm not going to comment specifically on that opportunity. But as Elena had mentioned in her script, about 20% of our R&D investment goes towards medium- and longer-term growth initiatives. This includes opportunities that sit within our existing product portfolios. For example, xtraCHEF and what we could be doing with xtraCHEF over the long term. You look at team management and what we could be doing with Payroll, now with Sling and with Pay Card in the future. So each of our product lines of business within the platform have substantial innovation ahead of them. And then on top of that, we continue to experiment and invest in new ventures. And these are things that I'm not going to talk about today, but we're planting the seeds for how restaurants will thrive in the future. And we're talking 5 to 10 years down the road, basically the next acts for how we think restaurants will operate. So this 20% of our R&D is super important because you'll continue to see us experiment, listen to our customers and then adapt to their needs. But I'm not going to speak specifically to group purchasing as an idea.\nDJ Hynes: Yes. Yes. Understood. We'll stay tuned there. Elena, just on the 68,000 locations, can you remind us the ballpark mix of quick serve versus full service and how that feeds into the distribution curve of GPV per location?\nAman Narang: Okay. DJ, so this is Aman, by the way. We had \u2013 look, if you look at our quick serve segment of the market, we have had customers in quick serve for a long time. That's been core to how we've grown. And over time, we have added capability within our platform to help serve this segment better. And so a couple of things. One, in Q2, we saw that as a percentage of our overall bookings, QSR increase, and we're confident that, that can continue going forward as well. As Chris mentioned, you saw Jamba, right, piloting in the enterprise space, Jamba piloting our kiosk solutions. And really, if you look at our core capabilities that we offer, that QSR we depend on, some of the things that I'll highlight, one, our guest facing display, right, our self-ordering kiosk, our kitchen display screens, online ordering and loyalty. And then some of the capabilities that I think are unique to the Toast platform that QSRs really benefit from are things like \u2013 a little bit specific, but text on fulfillment so instead of a buzzer for example, the ability for a [indiscernible] to text someone when their food is ready. Mobile order and pick, the ability to add to order to see you go through the line and then add \u2013 want to add a coffee or dessert later, right? Toast delivery services, the ability to have integrated delivery is partly online ordering or single-use promo codes. And so there's a lot within that platform that's easily accessible for QSR, and that's what gives us confidence in our opportunity ahead in the segment.\nDJ Hynes: Okay, thanks for the color guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thank you. I appreciate taking the question. I want to talk \u2013 given your comments about the restaurant operating environment, I want to see if you could give us some more context around when we look at your gross adds, so not the net adds, but the gross adds, and we think about what portion of those are coming from either a brand-new restaurant that was just started, just a brand-new company versus an existing restaurant that either is using another system or no system, what is the mix of that within your gross adds? And then the follow-up is, has the trend in that mix been pretty stable? Or has it changed over time?\nChris Comparato: Yes. So Tim, it's a good question. It's really a balanced growth across our bookings and our net adds. We certainly see restaurants that are already operating move to Toast, and they believe in a digital platform. And these are existing restaurants that are hyper local go-to-market team, knows how to tap into, and we see those restaurants move to Toast. Secondly, we're seeing restaurants already on Toast expand, and those are net adds as well. So we're seeing quite a bit of expansion within our portfolio from existing customers. And then thirdly, we certainly see net new locations in the form of new constructions. And it's always been a sort of a balanced attack across those three. I think as a reminder, I want to remind you that we're still only [Audio Dip] of the U.S. total addressable market. So our reps in these markets have a lot of surface area to go after, and we're in the early innings of them penetrating these markets to create, call it, flywheel market. So it's a little bit of a balancing attack in these markets across those three dimensions. The other thing that I'll mention is beyond net adds \u2013 just remember that net adds on locations is only one lever that we play with. The second lever is ARPU. So as we win a customer and build trust, we're growing more of the platform that the average restaurant is using. And that's a really important lever for us because restaurants are adopting more and more of our modules. So it's a little bit of a balanced attack across those growth levers.\nTimothy Chiodo: Thanks, Chris. Thank you for the context.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Josh Beck with KeyBanc. Please proceed.\nJosh Beck: Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the secondary effects of what you're seeing in the industry. Obviously, restaurants, like you said, have record inflation in a lot of their input costs. So I'm just curious if that is effectively pressing the case for automation and if, in any way, it's helping either improve the top of the funnel activity or the sales cycle in any way.\nChris Comparato: Yes. So I'll start with macro. And so we've been at this for 10 years. And at the macro, we fundamentally believe that the restaurant industry is going to shift. That's a secular shift to a unified digital platform that powers all of the stakeholders across the landscape. And it's been in existence for 10 years, and it's going to continue for many years to come. So we're seeing restaurants transition to digital, both to drive same-store sales, to drive operational efficiency, to drive staff productivity and then to drive automation in the back office. So it's really across the spectrum, Josh. And I think in the back office, there's a unique opportunity for restaurants to really understand food cost optimization. It starts with xtraCHEF, and that's why we're seeing momentum with xtraCHEF, but it's going to go beyond xtraCHEF with innovations in the back office that help restaurants understand their menu profitability, understand where they're wasting money, understand where they can drive better pricing and better food costs, as I mentioned. So I think we're just in the early stages of the opportunity in and around xtraCHEF. And it's exciting for us because we're helping restaurants really adapt and adapt quickly in the back office. Aman, I don't know if you want to add anything else to that.\nAman Narang: I think, Chris, look, the xtraCHEF launch has been strong for Toast. We only started selling this in Q1. And I think what's exciting about what we're doing with xtraCHEF is how easy it is for restaurateurs to be able to process invoices just by taking a picture on their phones, right? And that allows our accountants and restaurateurs to actually get a sense of food cost really efficiently. And one example is one of our customers out of Cincinnati, they \u2013 with all the inflation that we're all seeing, notice just through the reporting with the xtraCHEF as they start scanning invoices, they saw the cost of beef and potatoes were up 20%, 20% less. And just getting that visibility allows them to pay attention to it, and they're able to find a different provider for beef. They looked at ways to increase \u2013 to purchase in bulk and profit increase on the burgers by 20%, which is the top item they sell. And it's really meaningful, right, for \u2013 given just as Chris and Elena mentioned, how much of a restaurant spend is on food.\nJosh Beck: Very helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on the subscription ARPU. It certainly seems to have had another nice sequential jump this quarter. My thought was that maybe that would slow down a bit as we went from, say, more front office-oriented adoption maybe during \u2013 and coming out of the pandemic to maybe more back-office types of functionality. So just would be curious to unpack that within the quarter. And then, really, how we should think about the pace of expansion moving forward?\nElena Gomez: Yes. No, I think it's a good call out. So as you can tell from our prepared remarks, increasing ARPU is such an important part of our growth strategy. And we continue to see the sales team execute. We talked about Toast Shop. We talked about our growth team and our sell team. And then really, our go-to-market team, our reps are very good at positioning the entirety of the platform. They've been trained to do that and to really position that upfront. So all of that, combined with the innovation that you're seeing in team management and xtraCHEF, is really coming together to drive that outcome that you're seeing. So we feel confident that we'll continue to see progress on ARPU. I won't guide to it specifically, but you continue to see \u2013 as we add new customers, our newer customers are actually having higher ARPU as well, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So really encouraging. And if I look at what's really driving that, it's a combination of our core products \u2013 our core commerce products, but also xtraCHEF and Payroll, which are very early for us. So really encouraging to see that growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Koning with Baird. Please proceed.\nDavid Koning: Oh, yes. Hi, guys. Thanks so much. Nice job. And maybe if I could ask just the ARPU has been going up so consistently, I think five quarters in a row of 7% to 12% yield growth, I guess, you could say ARPU growth in that subscription line. Do you have insight into how fast that grows in the future? Or are we at a point now \u2013 I can't imagine it continuing to grow quite that rapidly on a sequential basis. But is there a way for you to almost see \u2013 give some insight, like could that grow 3% sequentially for a while still? Or how should we think about that?\nElena Gomez: Yes. I just answered that. But at the highest level, obviously, that's something that we're completely focused on. I'm not going to guide, obviously, to the future. But what I can tell you is, as we're bringing on more, more locations, the newer customers that are coming on are coming on with more products. So that should give you a sign that as we're growing, and we're growing fast, you'll start to see that improve over time.\nDavid Koning: Okay. Thank you. And then secondly, just on the hardware revenue. That's been pretty stable, 29 to 31 or so per quarter for a long time. But inventory has grown significantly, I think up 40% sequentially, up 100% year-over-year, give or take. Why isn't hardware revenue growing faster? And maybe how should we see that in the future?\nElena Gomez: Yes. So there's a couple of things. So we did \u2013 there's a couple of things going on there. One is we had lower year-over-year growth in our new customers. So Q2 was our strongest quarter ever for net location adds. But keep in mind, Q1 last year was still depressed by COVID. So the year-over-year growth rate in Q1 was meaningfully higher. And then even while our realized price for hardware sales improved, GAAP accounting requires us to proportionately allocate revenue across bundled products. So this meant we shifted some revenue out of hardware in Q2. But on the whole, when you take out the noise, I look at the revenue and say it's been relatively consistent.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question...\nElena Gomez: I would \u2013 I'll also add that \u2013 I'll also add that and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks. We have been strategically adding inventory to insulate us from supply chain \u2013 near-term supply chain issues. So I feel confident that our guide reflects all of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Bauch with SMBC Nikko. Please proceed.\nAndrew Bauch: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Nice set of results here. I wanted to hone in on the gross margin side, and specifically, trying to understand kind of pricing flexibility you have be it in SaaS or on FinTech Solutions. And then on the cost of revenue side, can you give us a little bit more color on where you can drive efficiency in fintech and in SaaS?\nElena Gomez: Yes. So I love the question because you're reinforcing something that we think is really important to our business model, which is the opportunity to monetize both on the fintech side and on the SaaS. So that's an important part of our model over time. On the fintech side, we have opportunities to continue to drive more volume to our platform, which obviously would drive more GPV on our platform and higher take rates. But then at the same time, and we've mentioned this a few times, we have a team really focused on cost optimization. And these are operational things that they're doing behind the scenes, including some R&D efforts, et cetera. So the combination of those two is sort of how we think about the monetization and the pricing impacts over time on fintech. And then on the SaaS side, obviously, we're going to continue to innovate. And the combination of those two really drive over time our ability to continue to grow.\nAndrew Bauch: Got it. And then I know it's still early days, but a lot of questions have been asked here. So any update on the investments you've made in international and what you learned thus far that's working or may be scaling back?\nElena Gomez: Yes. No, we're still very committed to international. Our investment, as you guys know, wasn't a significant investment, but it's perceiving as planned. We have some early customers. The REIT is really good with those initial customers. And just as a reminder 2022 is really a year of building the foundation. So this is a multiyear journey for us. And like you said, very early innings, but we're encouraged by what we see with the initial customers we have.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Jeff Cantwell with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nJeff Cantwell: Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask you a quick one on efficiency. And your Slide 11 talks about 2/3 of your new locations are coming from inbound channels, and 1/5 are coming from restaurant partner referrals. So can you just remind us what that might have looked like a year ago, two years ago? I just want to get a sense of how the trend is about over time because I think that has implications for your ability to continue to scale and grow more efficient over time. So I was just hoping for any additional color you might provide on that. Thank you.\nAman Narang: Sure. Thanks for the question. Look, I think we're seeing consistency in our funnel, whether across segments, as Chris mentioned earlier. The percentage of inbound, percentage of referrals has remained consistent. And I think the thing that we're most focused on is continue to invest in our go-to-market team and our customer-facing teams because we know that as we increase tenure on the sales reps and we increase market density, that's the number one driver of efficiency and growth in our business.\nJeff Cantwell: Okay. Great. And then on your ARR, can you talk just a little bit more about that? Because we noticed that the growth come from last year was pretty impressive growth this quarter off of a growth come from last year. So can you just remind us about typical seasonality, 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, just so we can be aware of what expectations should be for ARR as we look ahead? Thanks, again.\nElena Gomez: Yes. I think the way to think about it is two things. One is both from a location standpoint, typically, Q2 is our highest \u2013 or seasonally higher than Q3, and then it comes back in Q4. So that's the location side. GPV per location also tends to be higher in the summer months. So just keep that in mind. So that's probably the two things I'd say about seasonality.\nJeff Cantwell: Okay, great. Got it. Thanks very much and congrats on the results.\nElena Gomez: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters.\nChris Comparato: Okay. Thank you, everyone. We appreciate your time. We appreciate the good questions, and we'll be in touch. So have a great night.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Okay. DJ, so this is Aman, by the way. We had \u2013 look, if you look at our quick serve segment of the market, we have had customers in quick serve for a long time.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining. And a big thank you to the Toast team. All your hard work and dedication to serving our customers led to another quarter of great results. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA came in ahead of expectations in Q2. The power of our integrated software and payments model, together with our industry-leading platform, continue to drive strong top line growth. And our commitment to cost discipline was evident in our significant adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Not only are we proud of the strong results this quarter, we're also excited to welcome the Sling team to Toast. As Chris mentioned, Sling strengthens our team management product suite and will serve to further differentiate our platform as we focus on being the technology backbone for the restaurant industry. Our proven go-to-market strategy investments to scale the sales team continues to pay off. Net new location adds further accelerated in Q2 to over 6,000, increasing the number of total live locations on our platform to approximately 68,000. The continued market share gains highlight the tremendous value our platform provides restaurants, which also contributes to our consistently low churn rate. It's worth noting that Q2 is seasonally our strongest quarter for net location adds. Summer is the peak season for restaurants. And with some less likely to switch platforms during their busiest period, we typically add fewer new locations in Q3 than in Q2. We've seen the seasonal pattern in our business over several years and expect the same this year. That said, our pipeline remains strong. The value proposition is clearly resonating, and we are well positioned to sustain our momentum. Turning to our quarterly results. Total revenue grew 58% year-over-year to $675 million. ARR, which is our core operational metric, ended at \u2013 ended Q2 at $787 million, up 59% year-over-year and 24% compared to Q1. Total ARPU eclipsed 11,000 for the first time driven by strong growth in both our recurring revenue stream, SaaS and payments. Subscription services revenue increased 100% year-over-year in the second quarter, benefiting from our location growth and increased product adoption as both new and existing customers leverage more of our platform. As of the end of Q2, 61% of our Toast locations use four or more products on top of our integrated POS and payment solution, but even a higher percentage of new live customers join the platform with four or more products. As a result, SaaS ARPU continues to increase for each new quarterly cohort of live customers and is above the average for our platform. As we think about our long-term ARPU potential, we also believe upsell will be a big contributor. As Chris mentioned, our Toast shop e-commerce store has been an efficient channel for existing customers to add products. With our gross sales team now complementing the e-commerce solution and all those reps selling our full array of products, we have an opportunity to drive deeper adoption of our products like xtraCHEF and Payroll and help customers leverage more of our integrated platform to create value for their business. Total upsell across Toast shop and our growth sales team contributed over 20% of the incremental SaaS ARR in Q2, and we see a big opportunity to unlock incremental ARPU growth over time. On the fintech solutions side, revenue grew 59% to $562 million, and gross profit was up 54% year-over-year to $114 million in the quarter. As a reminder, SaaS revenue and fintech gross profit comprise what we operationally view as recurring revenue. Fintech gross profit benefited from sustained strength in GPV, which increased 62% to $23 billion in Q2. Average annualized GPV per processing location was up 16% year-over-year to $1.4 million. The growth in GPV per processing location is a result of both higher average ticket and the continued rebound in customer transaction, which was slightly below 2019 levels in Q2. The net take rate of 49 basis points was within the range we expect in the near term. Debit mix declined quarter-over-quarter, in line with typical seasonal patterns, partly offset by the benefit of our continued cost optimization efforts. Total gross profit grew 33% year-over-year and 24% quarter-over-quarter to $125 million, resulting in gross margin of 18.5%. Looking at our recurring stream, subscription and fintech gross profit totaled $169 million, up 67% year-over-year, driven by our continued location growth and strong ARPU increases across both SaaS and fintech solutions. Looking at customer acquisition costs. We continue to tightly manage unit economics to maintain healthy payback periods even as we navigate headwinds on the hardware side and invest to scale the business. As we noted last quarter, hardware margin declined quarter-over-quarter. We expect hardware margins to improve in the second half of the year as we benefit from the shift to lower cost shipping methods. Our decision to strategically increase inventory not only drives cost savings on shipping, but also insulates us from short-term supply chain disruptions, allowing us to continue to seamlessly serve our customers. Before discussing our other cost lines, I want to provide context on the pace of our overall operating expense growth. Over the past year, we accelerated hiring across the business to rebuild our teams following the staff reductions in early 2020 to sustain our momentum as the business rapidly scales and to position Toast to capitalize on this large opportunity ahead. We're now largely past that ramp in hiring. With what's reflected in our updated outlook for the rest of 2022, we believe our cost structure will align with the scale and growth trajectory of the business. That positions us to continue to invest in key growth areas to sustain top line momentum while further improving profitability going forward. Sales and marketing expense declined as a percentage of recurring revenue in Q2. The initial benefit from scaling our sales team is already evident in the strong location and ARPU growth. Last quarter, we discussed how our go-to-market strategy creates a flywheel effect. As we increased market share in a territory, inbound traffic and referrals grow and our sales reps deliver higher productivity. We expect that to be a tailwind going forward, particularly as we gain traction in the less penetrated territories that we're investing into. In addition, our sales reps naturally become more productive as they gain experience. By ramping hiring over the past year, the average tenure of our sales force has naturally declined. With our sales rep base closer to our target level, we plan to increase the team at a more steady state and expect our average tenure to increase, which historically led to increased productivity. We expect both of these dynamics to contribute to increased efficiency in sales and marketing expenses over time. Research and development is another area where we accelerated investment over the past year. This includes continuing to develop and broaden our platform and scaling the team to support the incredible growth we've experienced over the past two years. We now have more than doubled the number of locations on our platform than the onset of COVID, and our ambitions have grown significantly. We're investing to build platform scalability and stability in order to support hundreds of thousands of restaurants over the coming years. Product innovation also remains core to our growth strategy. Our strong ARPU growth gives us conviction on the ROI of our product investments. And we still have a huge opportunity to add more products that restaurants want and provide features and functionality that will enable us to both broaden and more deeply penetrate our TAM. In the first half of 2022, approximately 20% of our R&D spend went towards products and initiatives that represent less than 5% of our ARR today. We expect [indiscernible] to become important drivers over the next few years. That investment is skewed towards products where we've already seen initial traction like our team management suite, notably Payroll. A smaller portion is allocated to initiatives that we expect to be meaningful drivers in the medium term. We're committed to maintaining a balanced R&D profile, investing to drive continued innovation in our core products and to scale our platform while allocating capital to emerging areas that we have high conviction can increase our ARPU potential and expand our market opportunity. Moving down the P&L. The year-over-year growth in general and administrative expenses continue to be primarily related to public company-related expenses. The growth in G&A should decline to a more steady-state level in Q4 as we fully lap the initial step-up from late last year. We intend to remain disciplined in managing overhead and expect to deliver operating leverage in G&A starting in 2023. Total Q2 adjusted EBITDA was negative $33 million, well ahead of our guidance, and margins improved 350 basis points quarter-over-quarter to negative 4.9%. Our increased focus on efficiency and cost discipline contributed to the beat. Additionally, with GPV seasonally higher, we typically see greater quarter-over-quarter margin improvement in Q2, and that was amplified with GPV exceeding expectations. Now turning to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $700 million to $730 million, which represents 47% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, with adjusted EBITDA expected to be in the range of negative $40 million to negative $30 million. Following our strong first half of the year, we are increasing our revenue expectations for the full year by 5% at the midpoint. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.66 billion, a 55% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. We are also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to negative $160 million to negative $140 million for 2022. This includes the integration of Sling, which is a modest drag on EBITDA. The midpoint of our updated range is a $70 million and 360 basis point margin improvement compared to the initial '22 guidance we gave in February. In addition to our strong execution and continued top line momentum, the improvement reflects our increased cost discipline and current pace of hiring as we focus on delivering durable efficient growth. Our current outlook puts us on track for a 130 basis point margin improvement in the second half of the year compared to the first while continuing to make targeted investments in key growth areas to position Toast for a sustained location and ARPU growth for years to come. Improving profitability is a top priority across the company. Our results and our improved outlook are indicative of our focus on efficiency and cost discipline. These efforts will enable us to drive toward profitability faster. As we look ahead, while our business remains healthy into Q3, we recognize the economic outlook in the U.S. is mixed. Given that, we have been measured in our guidance for the rest of the year to factor in that uncertainty and the potential for slower consumer trends. Overall, we've made great progress on positioning our cost structure for the scale and growth profile of our business, which will enable us to deliver operating leverage and move even faster on growth opportunities to sustain top line momentum. It also gives us the flexibility to adapt quickly to any change in the business or macro environment. Looking back at the first half. While we are very pleased with our performance, we're still early \u2013 in the early innings, with only 1% penetration of this massive $55 billion market opportunity. We remain focused on our goal to serve as the technology backbone for the restaurant industry, continually bolstering our platform with more products and features to add value for our customers and to help them outperform their competitors. And we're confident that continuing to execute on our mission will drive sustained location and ARPU growth and create significant long-term shareholder value. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A session. Yes. Thanks for the question. So hopefully, you can tell that improving profitability is one of our biggest priorities. And we've made great progress in the first half of the year on EBITDA, and you can see that reflected in our guidance. And we believe we'll exit this year in a position to balance the investments of growth and margin improvement. And I just want to be mindful of the macro. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our guidance reflected some of that, which is also part of the reason we didn't want to give guidance beyond 2022 because we want to be incredibly balanced in that. And we also, frankly, want to take advantage of this market opportunity that's presented to us. We still believe and have a ton of conviction that there's a lot of growth to come, and we're in the early innings. So we're trying to balance that growth with also cost discipline, as you guys can see in our results. Yes. The biggest impact really was the mix shift from credit \u2013 from debit to credit. So that's really the primary driver, offset by some of our own cost optimization efforts. So I would say that's the primary story. There is nothing different to report on that. The impact of Sling is just not material to the numbers today. So we're not going to call it out. Yes. I mean I think the way to think about it is what you guys probably don't see is we're metering our hiring and really focusing on investments in high ROI areas. We're taking a deep inspection in areas that don't drive revenue today and being incredibly ruthless in our prioritization there. And so as we think about margins, you should see a steady improvement over time and a commitment from this management team to get to breakeven and profitability over the near term. Yes. No, I think it's a good call out. So as you can tell from our prepared remarks, increasing ARPU is such an important part of our growth strategy. And we continue to see the sales team execute. We talked about Toast Shop. We talked about our growth team and our sell team. And then really, our go-to-market team, our reps are very good at positioning the entirety of the platform. They've been trained to do that and to really position that upfront. So all of that, combined with the innovation that you're seeing in team management and xtraCHEF, is really coming together to drive that outcome that you're seeing. So we feel confident that we'll continue to see progress on ARPU. I won't guide to it specifically, but you continue to see \u2013 as we add new customers, our newer customers are actually having higher ARPU as well, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So really encouraging. And if I look at what's really driving that, it's a combination of our core products \u2013 our core commerce products, but also xtraCHEF and Payroll, which are very early for us. So really encouraging to see that growth. Yes. I just answered that. But at the highest level, obviously, that's something that we're completely focused on. I'm not going to guide, obviously, to the future. But what I can tell you is, as we're bringing on more, more locations, the newer customers that are coming on are coming on with more products. So that should give you a sign that as we're growing, and we're growing fast, you'll start to see that improve over time. Yes. So there's a couple of things. So we did \u2013 there's a couple of things going on there. One is we had lower year-over-year growth in our new customers. So Q2 was our strongest quarter ever for net location adds. But keep in mind, Q1 last year was still depressed by COVID. So the year-over-year growth rate in Q1 was meaningfully higher. And then even while our realized price for hardware sales improved, GAAP accounting requires us to proportionately allocate revenue across bundled products. So this meant we shifted some revenue out of hardware in Q2. But on the whole, when you take out the noise, I look at the revenue and say it's been relatively consistent. I would \u2013 I'll also add that \u2013 I'll also add that and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks. We have been strategically adding inventory to insulate us from supply chain \u2013 near-term supply chain issues. So I feel confident that our guide reflects all of that. Yes. So I love the question because you're reinforcing something that we think is really important to our business model, which is the opportunity to monetize both on the fintech side and on the SaaS. So that's an important part of our model over time. On the fintech side, we have opportunities to continue to drive more volume to our platform, which obviously would drive more GPV on our platform and higher take rates. But then at the same time, and we've mentioned this a few times, we have a team really focused on cost optimization. And these are operational things that they're doing behind the scenes, including some R&D efforts, et cetera. So the combination of those two is sort of how we think about the monetization and the pricing impacts over time on fintech. And then on the SaaS side, obviously, we're going to continue to innovate. And the combination of those two really drive over time our ability to continue to grow. Yes. No, we're still very committed to international. Our investment, as you guys know, wasn't a significant investment, but it's perceiving as planned. We have some early customers. The REIT is really good with those initial customers. And just as a reminder 2022 is really a year of building the foundation. So this is a multiyear journey for us. And like you said, very early innings, but we're encouraged by what we see with the initial customers we have. Yes. I think the way to think about it is two things. One is both from a location standpoint, typically, Q2 is our highest \u2013 or seasonally higher than Q3, and then it comes back in Q4. So that's the location side. GPV per location also tends to be higher in the summer months. So just keep that in mind. So that's probably the two things I'd say about seasonality. Thanks."

            "name": "Chris Comparato",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. Toast continues to build on our operational momentum in Q2, posting strong efficient growth, exceeding both our revenue and profit expectations, and delivering another record quarter of new location additions. This momentum stems from the consistent execution of our core growth strategy, driving location growth, deepening our ability to serve all segments of the restaurant industry and delivering product innovation for restaurants. On that front, last month, we announced the acquisition of Sling to further expand our team management suite and help restaurants deepen their relationship with employees. We're excited to welcome the Sling team to the Toast family. While we have tremendous momentum across our business, we're also cognizant of the current macroeconomic backdrop and what it means for our customers. Restaurants are operating in a challenging environment, facing heightened food cost inflation, labor constraints, higher wages and uncertainty in this broader economy. But the restaurant industry has faced challenges many times before and proven incredibly resilient over time. Restaurants adapted and bounced back from unprecedented conditions during COVID and have successfully navigated prior economic downturns. It's a testament to how much people enjoy the restaurant experience. Even in the most challenging times, people love eating out, and restaurants are often at the center of our communities. Turning to our results for the quarter. Revenue increased 58% year-over-year to $675 million in the second quarter, and ARR was up 59% to $787 million. GPV remains strong, growing 62% year-over-year to $23 billion in Q2. We also continue to drive on location growth. After adding over 5,000 net new restaurant locations in a quarter for the first time in Q1, we now exceeded 6,000 net new restaurant locations in Q2, just incredible growth that is being driven by our strong bookings pipeline as well as continued low churn. As a result of our consistent execution and first half performance, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by 5% at the midpoint of the range, which implies 55% year-over-year growth. Driving towards profitability is a key priority for our team, and the progress is clear in the significant adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in Q2. With the increased focus on efficiency and rigorous prioritization of our investment opportunities, we expect to sustain these improvements, and we're raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook for 2022 by $35 million at the midpoint to reflect that. Elena will provide more detail on our outlook shortly. With the restaurant industry in the midst of a generational shift to cloud-based digital solutions, we continue to seamlessly execute our proven go-to-market strategy to capitalize on that opportunity. As we increase density in more established territories, we benefit from the flywheel effect that drives referrals and inbound leads, driving higher and more efficient productivity. At the same time, we're gaining traction in less developed markets and are on a path to replicate that flywheel effect as we gain share. In addition to the strong growth in new locations, customer churn remains low. Our industry-leading platform adds tremendous value to our customers, helping them grow and creating a passionate and loyal customer base. The success of the Toast restaurants we support lie at the heart of our business model. We grow as our customers grow. In Q2, we continue to see success with all formats and types of restaurants. I'll highlight a few examples. In enterprise, we expanded our relationship with Jamba Juice by 40 locations, bringing our partnership to more than 700 total locations. As part of the expanded relationship, Jamba is piloting the addition of the Toast kiosk product to streamline checkout and help combat heightened labor costs. Jamba Juice showcases how Toast is designed to increase throughput in high-volume environments like QSR and fast-casual and how some of our largest customers continue to adopt more of our platform to increase efficiency and drive growth. Chip Cookies selected Toast in Q2 to support its growing 13-location business. From making it back-of-house more efficient with our Payroll, xtraCHEF and multi-location management products to using our point-of-sale and delivery services to more efficiently serve customers, Chip Cookies saw the value of Toast as an all-in-one solution that could help them grow while managing their business more efficiently. By leveraging more than 10 of our modules, Chip Cookies is a great example of how the benefits to customers increase as they leverage more of our integrated platform. While Chip highlights how new customers are using more of our platform, we also have a significant opportunity to help customers find more ways to leverage the full expense of our platform to create value for their businesses. Our e-commerce offering, Toast Shop, provides customers an efficient self-service options to seamlessly add products and has been a consistent source of incremental SaaS ARPU. Last year, we also started a growth sales team, solely focused on selling to our existing customers to complement Toast Shop. We continue to invest in and evolve that team, and the second quarter marked the first time the entire growth team with selling our full product set. This enables each of our reps to efficiently partner with customers on ways to utilize the full breadth of our platform. A good example of the benefit of our growth team that \u2013 a good example of the benefit our growth teams can bring customers is Maize Mexican Grill, a fast casual restaurant group. Maize initially inquired about adding our loyalty product across its locations. Our growth team worked with the customer to highlight the benefits of our full platform, which led to them adopting several of our guest products as well as Payroll and xtraCHEF. This showcases the power of having a team focused on upsell and reps equipped to help customers take advantage of the full power of our integrated platform. While we are pleased with the initial results, we're still early on in this area. We see a big opportunity to drive broader adoption of our platform among existing customers. One of Toast's key differentiators is our focus on restaurants and our ability to deeply serve different customer segments regardless of size or format. Earlier this year, we announced Toast for Hotel Restaurants, a powerful new solution designed to meet unique the needs of hotel restaurant operators by seamlessly integrating leading hotel property management system with the Toast platform. As a result of that new capability, in Q2, we signed a regional hotel chain for its full-service restaurant concept across over 10 locations. This hotel chain will use our handheld point-of-sale for table-side order and pay, our kitchen display systems to expedite orders and our multi-location management to efficiently manage menus. This is evidence of the opportunity we have to go much deeper in the hotel restaurant segment with our new offering. Shifting to products. As we continue to enable our customers to deeply connect with all of their stakeholders, I want to focus on the critical employee touch point. In the midst of an extremely challenging labor market, winning the hearts and minds of employees is more important than ever. Last month, we announced the acquisition of Sling, a leading employee scheduling and communications solution. Integrating scheduling and communications into our platform alongside our other team management products, including Payroll, Tips Manager and PayCard, will help restaurants deepen their relationship with employees, more efficiently manage labor and create a differentiated employee experience. Employee communications and scheduling is a high-engagement product, and it's also an important new touch point for Toast, with more than 11 million restaurant workers in the U.S. Similar to our prior acquisitions, our relationship with Sling started as a partnership, which launched early last year. The strong customer signal informed our view on how the product can enhance our entire team management suite. After incorporating Sling into our sales motion, our win rate was higher when customers evaluated Sling and Payroll together compared to when only quoting Payroll. This offers early proof of how Sling complements our existing team management suite and can enhance the overall value proposition to our customers. With Sling as part of the Toast family, we plan to fully integrate the offering into our platform to provide customers a seamless experience. The acquisition also allows us to accelerate product development in alignment with the road map for our team management suite and continue to build features specifically targeted for our restaurant customers and their employees. Sling makes our team management suite more robust and is another example of how, with our cloud-based platform, purpose built to meet the specific needs of restaurants, no partner is better positioned to help the industry adapt and thrive than Toast. While restaurant industry sales have fully bounced back from COVID and are above 2019 levels, as I noted earlier, restaurants are facing challenges. Labor and food are two \u2013 are the two biggest expenses for restaurants, and the current environment has amplified the pressure on both. Inflation is at a multi-decade high, and the restaurant workforce is still about 6% below prepandemic levels, creating staff and constraints. But our platform is built to help restaurants navigate these challenges. We provide restaurants with an array of products to automate processes and increase efficiency across their workflows so they can focus on what matters the most, the food, their guests and their employees. xtraCHEF not only automates manual invoice processing and inventory management, it also provides restaurant managers with real-time data on food cost trends to inform decisions on menu pricing and sourcing to help preserve profitability. With the help of xtraCHEF, under Valley Hospitality Group in Texas was able to reduce costs by 3% on average across their locations, saving over $330,000 per year. This is an invaluable tool with food costs rising at historic levels, and we are seeing adoption of xtraCHEF increase as restaurants seek to optimize margins. Products like our Toast Go handheld, kiosks and mobile order and pay allows savvy operators to better manage labor expenses and employees to handle more orders per hour, leading to higher tests while also providing a better guest experience. More QSR and fast casual restaurants are rolling out these digital touch points for guests to overcome staffing shortages while meeting evolving customer preferences. And Toast is well positioned to lead that transition. For example, New England Lobster Market & Eatery, a fast casual restaurant, is using our mobile order and pay solution for the majority of its on-premise transactions. In addition to requiring less staff, tips have more than doubled and are automatically split amongst employees, helping the restaurant significantly reduce turnover without incremental wage pressure. In summary, the Toast platform is more relevant and valuable than ever to our customers as they navigate these changing conditions. As customers use more of our platform, they can drive efficiency across their business to mitigate costs while continuing to offer a great guest experience. Simply put, our goal is to get restaurants all the tools they need to adapt and thrive. Restaurants deserve a trusted partner who shares their vision for a future where the restaurant in the entire industry thrives, and their businesses flourish, a partner who helps restaurants spend more time delighting customers and less time confused by technology, a partner who will advocate for the industry, and Toast is that partner. In closing, I want to thank our employees for a great first half of the year. I'm proud of how we're executing and our team's tireless effort to add value for our customers. Now I'll turn the call over to Elena. Yes, Josh. Good question. On the whole, the bookings trends remain really solid, and we're pleased with how the sales team is executing across the board. And we're pretty encouraged with the incremental demand from some of our recent product announcements. The team continues to do quite well in FSR as well as QSR. And I'd say it's broad growth across the board. And there's no segment specific breakout. It's really just been across the board. Sure. Thanks, Stephen. First, we're not seeing any signs of a drop in consumer demand or pull back in spending in our business. Restaurants are seeing healthy demand. Consumers continue to spend on services like dining, and the GPV trends are strong. That said, we're pretty mindful of the mixed macroeconomic signals, and we're monitoring closely. We still have \u2013 and even through July, we haven't seen any pullback on consumer demand. And while we're not immune, consumer spend at restaurants has held up relatively well during past recessions, and we've been looking at past recessions. And we feel pretty confident in what consumers will spend within the restaurant market. And then the last point I'd make is for restaurants, our platform becomes even more valuable in a tough market. So if we did see signal, you could rest assured that we've got scenarios planned, and we feel like our platform is in a good spot to help restaurants adapt and navigate uncertainty. So we feel pretty good on that consumer dimension. Yes, DJ. It's a good question. I'm not going to comment specifically on that opportunity. But as Elena had mentioned in her script, about 20% of our R&D investment goes towards medium- and longer-term growth initiatives. This includes opportunities that sit within our existing product portfolios. For example, xtraCHEF and what we could be doing with xtraCHEF over the long term. You look at team management and what we could be doing with Payroll, now with Sling and with Pay Card in the future. So each of our product lines of business within the platform have substantial innovation ahead of them. And then on top of that, we continue to experiment and invest in new ventures. And these are things that I'm not going to talk about today, but we're planting the seeds for how restaurants will thrive in the future. And we're talking 5 to 10 years down the road, basically the next acts for how we think restaurants will operate. So this 20% of our R&D is super important because you'll continue to see us experiment, listen to our customers and then adapt to their needs. But I'm not going to speak specifically to group purchasing as an idea. Yes. So Tim, it's a good question. It's really a balanced growth across our bookings and our net adds. We certainly see restaurants that are already operating move to Toast, and they believe in a digital platform. And these are existing restaurants that are hyper local go-to-market team, knows how to tap into, and we see those restaurants move to Toast. Secondly, we're seeing restaurants already on Toast expand, and those are net adds as well. So we're seeing quite a bit of expansion within our portfolio from existing customers. And then thirdly, we certainly see net new locations in the form of new constructions. And it's always been a sort of a balanced attack across those three. I think as a reminder, I want to remind you that we're still only [Audio Dip] of the U.S. total addressable market. So our reps in these markets have a lot of surface area to go after, and we're in the early innings of them penetrating these markets to create, call it, flywheel market. So it's a little bit of a balancing attack in these markets across those three dimensions. The other thing that I'll mention is beyond net adds \u2013 just remember that net adds on locations is only one lever that we play with. The second lever is ARPU. So as we win a customer and build trust, we're growing more of the platform that the average restaurant is using. And that's a really important lever for us because restaurants are adopting more and more of our modules. So it's a little bit of a balanced attack across those growth levers. Yes. So I'll start with macro. And so we've been at this for 10 years. And at the macro, we fundamentally believe that the restaurant industry is going to shift. That's a secular shift to a unified digital platform that powers all of the stakeholders across the landscape. And it's been in existence for 10 years, and it's going to continue for many years to come. So we're seeing restaurants transition to digital, both to drive same-store sales, to drive operational efficiency, to drive staff productivity and then to drive automation in the back office. So it's really across the spectrum, Josh. And I think in the back office, there's a unique opportunity for restaurants to really understand food cost optimization. It starts with xtraCHEF, and that's why we're seeing momentum with xtraCHEF, but it's going to go beyond xtraCHEF with innovations in the back office that help restaurants understand their menu profitability, understand where they're wasting money, understand where they can drive better pricing and better food costs, as I mentioned. So I think we're just in the early stages of the opportunity in and around xtraCHEF. And it's exciting for us because we're helping restaurants really adapt and adapt quickly in the back office. Aman, I don't know if you want to add anything else to that. Okay. Thank you, everyone. We appreciate your time. We appreciate the good questions, and we'll be in touch. So have a great night."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Comparato: Thank you, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. Toast delivered a strong first quarter coming in well ahead of expectations across the board. We added a record number of net new locations to our platform, as we continue to lead the digitization of the $800 billion restaurant industry and penetrate our $55 billion market opportunity.  Our performance is a function of continued execution on our three core growth drivers, increasing the number of restaurant locations on our platform, delivering product innovations, so restaurants use more of our platform to drive success with all of their stakeholders and deepening our ability to serve all segments of the market. Despite being one of the largest industries in the world, restaurants have been underserved by technology with one of the lowest levels of digitization of any sector.  Running a restaurant is also an incredibly complex and competitive business, the pandemic, a tight labor market, supply chain constraints and inflation have only magnified the challenges. The stakes have never been higher for restaurant owners to embrace technology to help them improve operational efficiency and increased sales, so they can thrive in this dynamic new world. Over the next several years, we expect every restaurant to operate on a unified digital platform. And just like we've seen in other industries, restaurants that embrace a digital platform perform better. As the restaurant industry goes through this wholesale digital transformation, we expect restaurant spend on technology to increase, closing the gap with other industries. Amid the secular shift to digital and the cloud Toast is executing on a generational opportunity to become the trusted partner restaurants need and to serve as the industries technology backbone.  We are leaving restaurants into a new era of hospitality. With our laser focus on restaurants and a proven track record of innovation, we've built the best-in-class platform that offers restaurants everything they need to win, to delight their guests, attract and retain employees, manage supplier relationships and ultimately do what they love and thrive. We understand the unique needs of restaurants of any size or concept in a way that no other platform can and we are adding more capabilities to help serve every segment of the market and expand our reach.  Now turning to our results for the quarter. Revenue increased 90% year-over-year to $535 million in the first quarter, and ARR increased 66% year-over-year to $637 million. This was driven by an acceleration in subscription revenue growth from the addition of new locations and continued customer adoption of our growing portfolio of products, as well as strong growth in GPV. Customers using four or more core modules beyond point of sale and payments reached 60% in Q1, contributing to the robust 103% year-over-year growth in subscription revenue. GPV on our platform increased 98% year-over-year to $18 billion in Q1. And for the first time ever, we exceeded 5,000 net new locations in a quarter. We ended Q1 with approximately 62,000 live locations on our platform, up nearly 45% year-over-year and we're still just scratching the surface of this massive long-term opportunity. Even as our ARR has more than tripled over the past two years, it still represents only about 1% of our $55 billion market opportunity in the U.S. On the back of our strong start to the year, we increased our full year revenue guidance by 6% at the midpoint of the range, which implies 48% year-over-year growth. We also improved our adjusted EBITDA outlook as we focus on driving efficient growth.  I want to add additional context on our investment levels this year. Our Q1 results are further evidence of the momentum in our business and the reason we have conviction to invest to capture the massive market opportunity in front of us. At the same time, the current environment calls for heightened discipline and we're actively evaluating our spend to make sure we scale in a sustainable efficient manner. That means identifying efficiency opportunities throughout our business and directing our investments only to areas that drive growth and have a proven return profile.  We've shown in the past, we can grow efficiently and deliver profits, with a proven go-to-market approach that gains leverage with scale, healthy unit economics and disciplined cost management. We're confident we will drive sustained strong growth and healthy long-term profitability. Our updated guidance implies a margin improvement in the second half of the year and we expect to continue on that trajectory moving forward.  Now I want to turn to how we're executing on our core growth drivers. As the restaurant industry undergoes the secular shift to digital and the cloud, driving location growth is a key priority and we're leaning into this in a number of ways to build on our momentum. We continue to benefit from our proven scalable go-to-market formula. The restaurant industry is a uniquely local business and our model feeds on that. As we've seen in our most established markets, as our penetration increases and more customers in a market experience our superior product offering, the number of referrals and inbound leads accelerate, creating a flywheel effect that drives strong and efficient growth.  We're investing in less developed markets to build that same flywheel as we build this muscle broadly across more markets. We expect it to continue to drive efficient location growth. Not only are we rapidly adding locations, we are seeing that our new customers are leveraging more of our products from the onset, a strong signal of the demand for our broader platform.  Software ARPU for locations booked in Q1 approximately doubled from just two years ago. We've seen strong uptake for our guests modules as we've significantly enhanced our products to help customers cater to the evolving guest needs over the past two years. Our payroll and team management offering is also building momentum. And we continue to see a significant opportunity to attach more products to our existing customer base, an important indication of our long-term ARPU growth potential.  Let me share with you a few examples of the strong demand we are seeing across restaurant segments. This quarter, we expanded our relationship with Union Square Hospitality Group, which has created some of New York's most beloved restaurants cafes and bars. They are expanding Toast to 16 total locations, including Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Caf\u00e9, the modern and their daily provisions concepts.  In addition to our Toast Go handheld point of sale and kitchen operations USHG will manage their multiple concepts and menu configurations using our Multi-Location menu management. They\u2019re also planning on using Toast for hotel restaurants to manage their mark-to-location, allowing them to seamlessly charge to hotel rooms during the payment process. This quarter, we also expanded our Nothing Bundt Cakes, a national bakery chain.  Nothing Bundt Cakes expanded its relationship with Toast purchasing our product for 70 new locations in Q1, which will increase our partnership to over 500 locations in the next 12 months. They are using Toast to drive revenue and help build a seamless purchase process for their guests. [indiscernible] a growing fast casual Mexican food chain expanded with Toast in Q1. They were live with Toast in 30 locations, using our Toast Go our Toast Flex and Multi-Location Management products and they signed a contract to add several more locations in the next 12 months using all of these products.  Additionally [indiscernible] is adding our Kitchen Display System in their current locations. In addition to our broad and growing platform, we also continue to grow our extensive partner ecosystem which now includes more than 180 partners across large national food and beverage suppliers, technology integration partners and local partners. This quarter, we extended our reseller partnership with U.S. Foods, a leading foodservice distributor that works with approximately 250,000 restaurants and foodservice operators. We focused on continuing to strengthen our partner network to give our customers seamless access to every product and service they need further enhancing the value our platform provides. Shifting to product innovation. I talked to many of our customers every quarter and a consistent theme I hear is they didn't get into the restaurant industry because they love technology, but they do realize that the industry is going through a digital transformation and they need a partner who they can grow it, so they can do what they love. That's why we consider Toast an extension of R&D for the restaurant industry. We give restaurants all the tools they need to run their business, integrated point of sale and payments, mobile ordering and delivery, marketing and loyalty, team management, friction access to -- frictionless access to capital and a growing array of integrated services to meet the evolving needs of our customers.  We've built in array of products that serve restaurant owners at their core, but also create a better experience for all stakeholders in the restaurant ecosystem, guests, employees and suppliers there tends to be a flywheel between happier employees leading to happier restaurant guests and both contributing to more successful better run restaurants. We're continuing to invest in products to further differentiate our platform by enhancing and deepening the touch points between restaurants and each stakeholder. And with our integrated platform, as restaurant add more of our products, it strengthens the flywheel, creating powerful network effects for our customers. In supplier management, we're making great progress with our extra chef products, which provides accounts payable automation and inventory management. With restaurant space and supply chain challenges and inflation, we're seeing just how important it is to help our customers manage profitability by easily comparing the cost of a menu item versus what they're charging. In longer term, we have opportunities to expand the services we offer restaurants in this area and further optimize and automate their supplier management. Our payroll and team management products speed up employee onboarding, simplify payroll and ensure employees are paid on time. With restaurants still facing labor challenges, if you're not providing a great employee experience and paying your employees quickly, it will be more difficult for you to hire and retain great talent, which impacts the guest experience in sales. We believe both selling payroll into our existing customer base and continuing to innovate in this space to help restaurants offer employees even more services that can differentiate them in this tough labor market, represent meaningful growth opportunities going forward. As we continue to build scale and drive growth in our core segments, another key growth strategy is to position Toast to increase penetration in all restaurant segments and expand to new markets. With our laser focus on serving the restaurant industry, we're uniquely able to adapt our platform to meet the specific needs of different types of restaurants. One example from this quarter is targeted for quick service restaurants. We've built an offering that better suits the needs of these restaurants and helps them get results even quicker.  As I mentioned, we also announced Toast for hotel restaurants, a new solution designed to meet the unique needs of hotel restaurant operators. Toast now integrates with several hotel management software providers, allowing us to better serve this segment and we're focused on continuing to adapt our product and packaging to serve the specific needs of each type of restaurant in order to drive deeper penetration across segments. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we've seeded an initial investment in international this year. We believe our best-in-class product offerings and go-to-market approach translates well to other markets, which will enable us to tap into our broader TAM and become another driver -- growth driver longer term. Before closing, I wanted to thank our customers and employees. The restaurant industry remains resilient even amid the many macro challenges across the globe and we are incredibly proud to be able to partner with our customers as they navigate these challenges. And thank you to our great employees for helping get Toast off to a great start in 2022 and build on our terrific operating momentum. We're still very early in our journey and we're confident that by continuing to relentlessly execute on our strategy will create significant value for our customers and shareholders over the long term.  Finally, before I pass the call over to Elena to go through our financials, I want to congratulate her on her one-year anniversary at Toast. What an incredible year it's been. Elena, I'm excited to partner with you on this journey ahead.  And now, Elena, I'll turn it over to you. \nElena Gomez: Thanks, Chris. One year went really fast and equally excited about the partnership. And thank you everyone for joining. To start, I wanted to echo Chris in thinking both our customers for their continued partnership and the entire Toast team, whose dedication and tireless work led to another great quarter. Thanks to them that we got off to a great start in 2022 coming in ahead of our expectations across our key metrics.  This is evidence of our solid operating momentum and the power of our industry-leading platform. We're still in the very early stages of this massive opportunity to provide restaurants of all the products and services they need as the industry transitions to digital and navigate new challenges. As Chris mentioned, the number of net new locations added to our platform accelerated in Q1 to over 5,000 and we ended the quarter with approximately 62,000 locations. Driving location growth is one of our key priorities and we're investing to build on this momentum and continue to efficiently increase our market penetration.  Total revenue grew 90% year-over-year to $535 million and ARR hit $637 million as of the end of Q1, up 66% from last year. As we discussed, ARR is our core operational metrics and the best indication of our underlying growth. And we continue to see healthy trends in both our recurring revenue stream, SaaS and payments, which underpins our ARR growth.  Subscription services revenue growth accelerated to a robust 103% in the first quarter, driven by our strong growth in new locations, as well as increasing adoption of our portfolio of SaaS products by new and existing customers. As of March 31, 2022, 60% of our Toast locations use four or more core products.  On top of our integrated POS and payment solution, compared to 51% a year ago, reflecting the benefit of our continued product innovation. With customers using more of our end-to-end platform, our SaaS ARPU continues to increase at a healthy clip. The growing ARPU is particularly evident in our new book locations. The average SaaS ARPU for new bookings in Q1 has more than doubled in just two years to nearly 6,000, as customers continue to adopt more of our products at booking.  In addition, we still have a meaningful opportunity to drive deeper product adoption among our existing customer base over time. We believe the trends in new bookings and the upsell opportunity point a long runway to drive continued ARPU growth. One example is the growing adoption of our payroll product which Chris alluded to. In Q1, approximately 30% of our total bookings included Toast payroll on initial sale, up from 15% last year.  We're seeing early benefits from expanding our sales efforts to focus on existing restaurants that switch to the Toast platform. In addition, the majority of new restaurant openings coming onto our platform continue to attach Toast payroll at the time of booking. We're still early in this opportunity and as an example, while we can continue to increase attach rates at booking and drive upsell to existing customers to drive further ARPU growth. Longer term, we have the potential to layer on more features and services for our restaurant employees helping our customers differentiate themselves in a tight labor market, while unlocking incremental monetization on our platform.  Moving to financial technology solutions. Revenue grew 93% to $438 million. FinTech solutions gross profit, which is net of payment transaction costs and what we operationally as -- what we operationally as a second component of our recurring revenue was $91 million in the quarter, a 66% year-over-year increase. That was driven by GPV growth of 98% to $18 billion. Annualized GPV per processing location remains strong at an average of $1.2 million.  As a reminder, we typically see seasonally higher GPV per processing location in the second and third quarter. As we noted last quarter, our debit and credit mix has returned to pre-COVID trends. While the mix of card-not-present volumes continues to moderate when consumers increasingly returning to dining in restaurants.  Total gross profit grew 38% year-over-year and 23% quarter-over-quarter to $101 million. Gross margin improved by over 250 basis points compared to Q4 to 18.9%m boosted by improvements across our subscription services, FinTech solutions and hardware margins. Looking at our recurring revenue stream subscription and FinTech gross profit totaled $135 million for a 73% increase year-over-year, reflecting the strong customer growth and healthy ARPU increases across both SaaS and FinTech solutions. Turning to our customer acquisition costs. We are focused on maintaining efficient unit economics as we invest to scale the business. And our track record of attractive payback periods continue to give us the confidence to lean into the significant opportunity in front of us. As a reminder, operationally, we manage our hardware and professional services gross profit as customer acquisition costs. Hardware costs remain elevated and increased year-over-year due to higher freight and product costs related to supply chain dynamics.  Compared to Q4, hardware cost improved quarter-over-quarter as freight expenses decline of peak levels and we benefited from one-time adjustments. We're in the process of strategically increasing our hardware inventory enabling us to shift to a lower -- to lower shipping methods, while continuing to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner. While we expect hardware costs to remain high over the next few quarters, we believe they will normalize over time as we leverage lower cost shipping methods and focus on optimizing other parts of our supply chain. Sales and marketing is our other customer acquisition of funds. After reducing our sales force at the onset of COVID, we're investing to rebuild the team in order to continue to drive market share. As part of that investment we're strengthening our process in less penetrated areas. The power of our go-to-market approach is that we increased market share in a territory, we see increasing inbound lead to referrals and from brand awareness, resulting in higher productivity for our sales reps. That flywheel effect enables us to scale efficiently as we gain traction and we're investing to build the foundation to kick start our flywheel in more and more markets.  Even as we increased investment in sales and marketing, we've maintained consistent efficiency. We believe measuring sales and marketing expense as a percentage of recurring revenue is the best indication of how we're executing. Sales and marketing as a percent of recurring revenue decline significantly after the cost cuts in the first half of 2020, and has now held in the same range seven quarters since then. That's been driven by an increasing number of new locations we are adding to the platform each quarter and continued growth in ARPU. This gives us further conviction to lean into the large opportunity we have ahead. As we do so, we continue to manage our unit economics and we're confident that as we gain scale will deliver a leverage on our sales and marketing costs over time.  Moving down the P&L, we're also investing in research and development to build out our platform. This includes deepening the integration and features on year products like payroll and extra chef, (ph) which we believe represent strong monetization opportunity longer term. In addition, as Chris mentioned, we're adding capabilities to better serve different restaurant segment, which will position us to penetrate segments where we've typically had less of a presence. Similar to last quarter, the increase in general and administrative costs were mainly due to public company related expenses. Overall adjusted EBITDA of negative $45 million in Q1 was better than our expectations. The outperformance reflects continued strength in GPV and SaaS revenue growth. In addition to the progress on reducing hardware costs, as we navigate the challenging macro environment. Now let me turn to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $635 million to $665 million, which represents 53% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $60 million to negative $59 million. For the full year, we are increasing our revenue expectations by 6% at the midpoint, to reflect the momentum in software revenue growth and our expectation for GPV growth to remain strong. We now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion, which represents 48% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Following our strong Q1 performance, we're also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be in the range of negative $195 million to negative $175 million for 2022. This reflects the targeted investments we're making across sales and marketing and research and development to drive the core growth strategies that Chris highlighted. Given the incredible demand for our product growing ARPU as customers do more with us and the massive market opportunity in front of us. We're confident that these investments will deliver strong returns.  While these investments are resulting in higher burn today, make no mistake, we remain focused on working towards long-term profitability in the current environment has only increased urgency. We're actively driving efficiencies across the company and tightly managing all discretionary spend in order to help fund our key growth initiatives while improving profitability.  Making sure, we have a lean cost structure is a priority. It will enable us to stay nimble as we rapidly grow and gain operating leverage with scale. Our guidance implies that EBITDA margins will improve by 200 basis points in the second half of the year compared to the first half. And we're positioning the business to continue to deliver consistent margin improvement with durable top line growth in 2023 and beyond.  In closing, we're off to a great start in 2022, evidence of our strong execution and industry-leading platform. The restaurant industry is going through a generational shift to digital and our priority is to further cement our leadership position as the trusted platform of choice for the restaurant industry. We believe through our portfolio of offerings, we can help restaurants boost sales, improve efficiency, retain employees and thrive in one of the most competitive industries. And as we execute on that, we believe it will translate into strong, durable growth and healthy profits over the long term.  Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Elena. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien-Tsin, your line is open. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey. Thank you so much for the great results here. Appreciate all of your comments. Chris, I wanted to ask about your -- I think about down your driving efficient growth, heightened discipline, those kinds of things, I think, Elena you also talked about watching discretionary, but can you just elaborate on what that might look like? What investments are non-negotiable for you in terms of growing and where you might see a little bit of belt tightening, if you want to call it that? Thank you. \nElena Gomez: Yeah, Chris, I can comment if you [Multiple Speakers]. \nChris Comparato: Sure.\nElena Gomez: So at the highest level, great question, so things that are not something we would not invest in, right. We're going to really focus, continue to focus in sales. We're going to continue to focus in R&D. We're going to focus on areas that really drive high ROI. That's really important. It's non-negotiable for us to not go after this market opportunity, given the momentum we're seeing, given the signals that we're getting from our customers et cetera. So those are non-negotiable for us. Areas where we're focused on discretionary on managing tightly are things such as overhead discretionary expenses, of course, the typical T&E type of things and also over time really trying to gain leverage in our G&A functions. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Perfect. Thank you for that. My quick follow-up, just the 1000 net new locations, records ahead of where we had. Can you keep it up, is that nominal level sustainable given what you see any callouts on return or types of restaurants or channels that did especially well? Thank you. \nChris Comparato: Yeah, so I can chime in from. My answer is that. Okay. I was going to say absolutely, we believe what we're grabbing market share in multiple segments. Our core segment, our core SMB segment is performing extremely well and it continues to drive the largest portion of opportunity. And then we're continuing to see success upmarket and midmarket and enterprise and we're seeing some pull in that market. So we absolutely believe that we can sustain the growth that we're seeing on location acquisition. I'll remind you that we're still very early in our TAM penetration. Today, we're only about 7% of the 860,000 restaurants across the U.S. So we're certainly focused on consistent execution and our unit economics tell us that we should continue to go fast on that loans.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, Tien-Tsin. The next question is from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Stephen, your line is open. \nStephen Sheldon: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to kind of follow up on the location additions. Great results there and you just talked about some areas seeing growth. Curious, if you've seen any changes on the churn levels. I mean, I think you have some natural churn, just given the heavy weighting towards SMB, but your customers I think fair significantly better than industry average during the pandemic, so curious if you continue to see moderation there and just general outperformance versus industry averages?\nElena Gomez: Yeah. No, we've actually not seen that. We've actually seen churn remained low something we're really proud of and it's just a testament to the power of the platform. So we're really encouraged by the fact that churn has remained relatively low.\nStephen Sheldon: Got it. That's great to hear. On the expansion in the QSR, I guess, from a product side, are you need to build out or develop anything new to support these customers. And I guess just as an example, clearly QSRs have a much bigger focus on drive through. So just curious what the expansion in the QSR could mean, when you think about the product roadmap?\nChris Comparato: Yes. So we have a solid QSR customer base today, but we feel we have the potential to grow faster moving forward. So think of the platform as, we have this restaurant for us in depth platform. But now we're adapting it to specific segments to further accelerate our growth. So take QSR, it's basically a tailored set of products that are packaged and priced in a way that makes sense for QSR businesses. So tying mobile ordering to KDS and then the ability to SMS, text message a guest when the order is ready. That's a super-fast flywheel and we're seeing results where restaurants are telling us, a good example is, there is a restaurant chain called Bultaco. They're telling us when they apply that packaging and configuration to their concept, they are increasing throughput by more than 20%. So really think about our segmentation work as adapting the platform to be really concept specific which allows these concepts to then move faster. So that's really what's happening with the segmentation strategy, which is, QSR is just one example, Toast for hotel restaurants is yet another example.\nStephen Sheldon: It's great to hear. Congrats on the results. \nOperator: Thank you, Stephen. Next question is from the line of Timothy Chiodo of Credit Suisse. Timothy, your line is open. \nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I wanted to ask about what's implied in the guide in terms of the payback periods have been incredibly impressive and stable. I was just wondering if you would, if you would just give a comment on what might be implied there for that stability for the rest of the year, particularly in light of the comments that you made around some of the cost savings initiatives in terms of the shipping cost that you might be looking at and also the potential for the hardware costs to normalize, maybe not this year, but over time? Thanks a lot. \nElena Gomez: Yeah. Great question. Thanks. So we actually have very healthy payback periods and consistent with what we've -- and that's despite the elevated hardware costs that we've experienced over the last couple of quarters. Our goal, as I mentioned in the last call, continues to be in the mid-teens and we have confidence, we'll be able to accomplish that through this year. \nTimothy Chiodo: Excellent. Thank you and a very helpful. And a follow-up is on the financial technology solutions stake, [indiscernible] little bit higher than maybe some of us would have expected, may be you could just comment on, was there anything that came through there may be from the capital side that might have contributed or is that really just more of the pure payments net take rate was a little bit higher than maybe we had forecasted?\nElena Gomez: Yeah. The Toast Capital continues to be just not material for our total results. But as I mentioned, some of the debit, we had a little bit higher debit in Q1 than typical. So that, that's really the dynamic that is causing our take rates to be what it is. I would just tell you that we believe the take rates that you see in Q1 is a reasonable take rate for the near term. And then I would also just take this opportunity to make sure to zoom out and just think about take rate is, is just one dimension of our business, right. We really think about our business beyond take rate and you saw the performance in our SaaS business as well. So I would just encourage you to look at the broader picture beyond take rate.\nTimothy Chiodo: Excellent. Really helpful, look like there might have been something else there, but that's really helpful, clarify. Thank you. \nElena Gomez: Sure. \nOperator: Thanks, Timothy. The next question is from the line of Josh Baer of Morgan Stanley. Josh, your line is open. \nJosh Baer: Great. Thanks for the question and congrats on a great quarter. Wanted to talk about GPV. I guess to what extent from your data, were restaurants able to pass on some higher cost to the customers and just thinking about the benefit to you as far as your payments revenue stream from GPV. And then I have a follow-up.\nElena Gomez: We had a -- so thanks for the question. We've seen really healthy GPV per processing location and obviously, we know that it's an inflationary environment and we're seeing our customers of course, play with pricing, but really the demand has been really strong. So we're encouraged by that and that's really what's reflecting in our confidence and our guide, but also just strong execution in Q1 and really strong demand all the way around. \nJosh Baer: Great. And that's clear, especially given on Omicron impacts or real in January in Q1. I guess like on the strong guide maybe thinking month-to-month throughout Q1 or into April or even into May. Just wondering, if you are seeing like any signs of consumer weakening, just given the focus on macro environment inflation, thinking about forward expectations on GPV. \nChris Comparato: I can jump in. Yeah. So we've not seen any material impact on the current sort of macro trends. There is no evidence of a slowdown from our perspective on restaurant spend. In fact like we feel restaurants are seeing healthy demand from consumers and a good example is, dine-in, if you look at restaurants across the U.S. running Toast dine-in is up 46% year-over-year from Q1 of 2021 to Q1 of this year.  So that's a really healthy dynamic that tells us that consumers are going back into restaurants and doing it quite frequently especially post-COVID. So we think that trend will continue. And we think the consumer demand is high and we believe that restaurants have pricing power, the play with pricing to continue to serve those consumers. So we don't see any, any evident for the slowdown or material risk on that front. \nJosh Baer: Very helpful, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, Josh. Your next question is from the line of Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Will your line is open. \nWill Nance: Hi, guys. Good afternoon and good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to maybe ask a few questions on the efficiency initiatives that you guys talked about obviously, very nice to hear, particularly in the current environment about taking a second look at spending, I'm sure that will be well received. I guess my question is more longer term and I totally get that, investing in profitable growth is the focus for now and there is no reason to slow down. And I don't think [indiscernible] want to pin you down on a near-term target of profitability. But as you guys look out farther and how this business can kind of scale to profitability over time. How do you think about the long-term profitability profile and maybe what's sort of the path of the building blocks to getting there?\nElena Gomez: Yeah. Great question. I'll take that. So we don't have a specific target to share today. But it's really important, so we're balancing sustain sort of durable growth, with improving profitability, which is a key priority growth, which I hope came through in our scripts. And at the highest level, we're positioning the business for consistent margin improvement as we look into the back half of 2022 which was reflected in the guide.  And going forward from there, we want to focus on consistent improvement in our margin profile. In longer term, we believe an integrated model, which we always talk about and we have multiple monetization streams, which will be highly profitable in a steady state. So when you look at the various components, you think about strong unit economics, you think about investing in R&D and then really getting scale in our G&A.  So there is a bunch of levers we have, but we are focused on building a lean cost structure, which will allow us to pivot and really continue to sustain this high growth profile with a very lean cost structure along the way. So with that, I would say that we will see consistent improvement in margin over time. But I'm not going to share a specific timeframe or target today. \nWill Nance: Got it. Okay. I appreciate the question. And, yeah, no, definitely came across in the script. Second question on related is more on the software side, interesting stat on that new business coming out of around 6,000 ARPU is like 50% higher than where the business is today. As you look, maybe could you talk a little bit about the process of upsell on the existing customer base. What does that look like? And what's the success you've had in getting some of the existing customers to adopt say something like the payroll products or additional modules. \nElena Gomez: Yeah. We've -- monolithic comment as well. But we've been investing in upsell. We started an upsell team in 2020. We also have an ability for our customers to go on to shop, which allows them to buy products online as well but our upsell team is very much focused on building that muscle of selling incremental products to our existing installed base and payroll has been a great example that were early in that opportunity, but we're definitely and this upsell team was an investment we made in 2020 built-on it in 2021 and continue to invest and see good signal there as well and that's what's reflected in our of our overall ARPU growth and as well even in the consistency of our execution and positioning the entirety of the platform, not really having impact across our entire sales base, but I'll let him on comment.\nAman Narang: Thanks, Will. I think you made it actually, like, we are focused on scaling up sales and marketing team, both on new business [indiscernible] and we are also scaling up our top service capability and include e-commerce and Toast to let our customers buy from us they want.\nWill Nance: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate all the color and very nice results today. \nAman Narang: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, Will. Your next question is from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Dave, your line is open. \nDave Koning: Hey, guys. A couple of questions. I guess first of all a little similar to the last one, your subscription revenue up 103%. I think it was mid '40s growth in locations and mid '40s growth in average revenue per location, but how much of that is just bigger locations. And then how much of it is kind of what you described before, just a lot more selling to your kind of existing group of locations. [Multiple Speakers] \nChris Comparato: Go ahead, Elena, if you want. \nElena Gomez: It's a little bit of both. I mean, first, kudos to the sales team for their great execution and what you're seeing in the fast growth being over a 100 -- up 100% and having record locations. It's really adoption from both new and existing customers and also higher sale of booking, which is, which we talked about on the script. And that's really coming back to the positioning of the entirety of the platform upfront, which is obviously really important and an indicator of our competence in our ability to position on tariffs the entirety of the platform, and have a higher booking -- ARPU booking at upfront yeah. \nChris Comparato: Yeah. One clarification is, it's not -- one clarification it's not bigger locations. It's just doing a much better job at selling the entirety of the platform both upfront, as well as downstream. But it's not as if we're going after a bigger, bigger locations. It's really just making doing a better job at some of the platform story to existing locations that are similarly size.\nDave Koning: Yes. Got you. So that's what I was kind of getting at. So that's really, that's great. And I guess my second question, sequentially, I think your guidance is revenue up something like 19% to 24% I guess that's very normal seasonality to be up, but is our all segments, expected to be up kind of in that same range or is there going to be somewhat divergence?\nElena Gomez: Yeah, I would say we're seeing strength across our entirety of our business. \nDave Koning: Okay. Got you. A great job. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, Dave. Your next question is from the line of Josh Beck with KeyBanc. Josh, your line is open. \nJosh Beck: Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to drill down on the subscription ARPU. Certainly, it continues to grow at a really nice clip, even though the multi-product adoption just very slightly expanded less so does this mean that your customers are gravitating towards some of these larger products just not sure if there is any a call out on the drivers there?\nElena Gomez: Yeah, I mean I think\u2026\nChris Comparato: Yeah. I think what I'm here -- sorry, Josh, effectively our customers are telling us that they want more and more from the platform. So I think what you're seeing is, as you're seeing us better position the platform story upfront, as well as downstream and then they're telling us that they want to see even more innovation within those modules across the platform. So a good example is, what Elena referenced for payroll. We're doing a much better job at attach and payroll upfront, as well as upselling it downstream, but then restaurants are coming back to us saying over time. We'd love for you to, when you look at the employee value proposition to recruit onboard, developed manage pay, retain employees that has its own road map of opportunity and that will be over the long haul that we continue to innovate on top of the existing ARPU base. So, we expect we will continue to see the modules used by average customer tick up, but then we'll continue to evolve that module landscape over time. \nJosh Beck: Okay. Great. And maybe just a follow-up on the guidance, certainly you are taking up the full-year revenue at the midpoint, a nicely above the [indiscernible] I think it's about $95 million just listening to the answers that it sounds like it's pretty broad based across the business. Any callouts where things just materialize quite a bit better than what you were maybe forecasting 90 days ago to drive this kind of upward revision in the full year. \nElena Gomez: Yeah, No, I think heading into the year, if you think back 90 days ago, we had a little bit of Omnicom ahead. There is a big macro that we factored into our guidance. And what we've really seen is strong GPV growth and strong momentum in our business. And so that's really what's reflected in the guide. And actually I would say that what we're balancing now is the same thing we're balancing the macro, we're balancing -- making sure we're investing in a lean cost structure and just being prudent with what we see.\nJosh Beck: Fantastic. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you, Josh. Your next question is from the line of Brent Bracelin Piper Sandler. Brent, your line is open. \nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. I guess one for Chris and a follow up for Elena. Chris, you were excited about payroll, I think nine months ago. Clearly, payroll continues to kind of perform well both you would new customer attach and now it sounds like better cross on the installed base. You have 62,000 locations, today looking out three to five years, what's the potential here, do you think a third of those locations could can attach the payroll. Could you get the 50% penetration I\u2019d love to better understand based on 90 to have success here where could look like in five years? \nChris Comparato: I'm not going to give you a number, but what I know in talking to restaurants every day is that they need more technology capability to not just pay their employees, but to recruit onboard develop them, plan their schedules, pay them and then retain them. So we see that value chain just within the employee stakeholder and we've built out a roadmap from there on what this piece of the platform could become and that excites us because we know every restaurant needs us, like every restaurant needs to get off of manual processes and spreadsheets to better attract and retain their employees and pay their employees and employees want to be paid faster. So we're excited about this section of the platform that continues to perform well, but there is a long journey ahead on its potential. I'm not going to give you a number, except that every restaurant grapples with how to attract and retain their employees and we see opportunity there. \nBrent Bracelin: Got it. So like payroll, just the start of a much bigger ambition you have relative to [indiscernible] software.\nChris Comparato: Exactly. \nBrent Bracelin: Elena as a follow-up, clearly, everyone is asking about the cost structure and payback and philosophy. So I'm mean I'm going to ask it a slightly different way. If I look at the plan here to lean in, you clearly are going to have some heavier free cash flow investments here this year and next, but you do have a strong balance sheet, $1.2 billion in cash even with those two years of heavy investments, it looks like you're going to have about $900 million in cash exiting 2023.  My question for you is, with that much cash even after two years of heavy investments, is the model fully funded to a path to free cash flow or do you think you'd have to raise more money, just trying to better understand how much cash you actually need to get a positive free cash flow state? Thanks. \nElena Gomez: Yeah. No, it's a fair question and I feel like we're in a good position where -- with our performance and consistent execution. We're looking to get to free cash flow breakeven over the near term, I would say brent. So I'm not worried about additional funding needed to help us succeed and go after this opportunity. \nBrent Bracelin: That's helpful. Thank you. That\u2019s all I had. \nOperator: Thank you, Brent. Next question is from the line of Andrew Bauch with SMBC Nikko. Andrew, your line is open. \nAndrew Bauch: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch upon the international opportunity that you guys are starting to invest in this year. I mean maybe what have you learned over the first three months and what's sort of timeline we should think about before you're --actually launching live locations outside the U.S.? \nElena Gomez: Yeah, No, that's a great question. We're in the early, early innings. And I would, just remind you that our 2022 years is really a foundational year for us. We've got a few customers live and we're getting some really great, great feedback and we're learning that the demand is strong. But that said, we're in the early innings. And this is sort of a multi-year journey for us. So I think we're aways from having meaningful impact on our P&L, but we're encouraged by the early signal from the customers that we're engaging with.\nAndrew Bauch: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, even having a couple live is a good test run. And then touch kind of more modeling point you mentioned that the hardware cost of goods sold came down pretty considerably as freight costs kind of came off peak, I mean it's even more impressive on a net new location basis. So how confident are you that that line item kind of remains relatively stable through the rest of 2022 and does even have room to come down over time?\nElena Gomez: Yeah. Then we -- so you're right, we had some benefit in Q1, some one-time benefits and also we had lower freight costs in Q1. I do expect a little bit of a tick up in Q2. But over the long term. I feel like we can keep -- definitely keep our payback periods in order, which is a goal of ours, but also I would remind you that we do anticipate hardware costs to remain elevated, but definitely something we can manage, and we've been strategically shifting to having more inventory, which is allowing us to lower that shipping cost. So I have a bit more visibility into that, but other than the uptick in Q2, I think we've got a good handle on it. \nAndrew Bauch: Great. Fantastic quarter. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, Andrew. We\u2019ll now take our last question from the line of Harshita Rawat of Bernstein. Harshita, your line is open.\nHarshita Rawat: Hi. Good afternoon. I want to ask about B2B so you acquire extra share last year. COGS a significant portion of the restaurant expense base. Tell us about how you cross selling extra share into restaurants and more importantly, what we've can you participate in B2B AP automation flows. Thank you. \nChris Comparato: Yeah. Great question. I'll remind everyone that it's still early for extra chef and we're excited about the opportunity ahead. We just enabled our entire sales force to position and sell extra chef in Q1. So we're excited about their performance. It was ahead of our plan in Q1, but we're very much in the early stages of the product roadmap on B2B. For example, extra chef today does a great job of AP automation.  Great job at inventory management and recipe management, so we can do really good food cost optimization, but over time, the opportunity for this section of the platform is very similar to payroll, if you think about the opportunity to better manage the books and work with accountants. The opportunity to better work with suppliers and consider bill pay to suppliers. So we see a tremendous opportunity in the back office around supplier management and we're very much in the infancy of this product roadmap. So that's exactly why we went after extra chef and they've been an integral part of our Toast team and building out this vision, but a really good question. \nHarshita Rawat: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, Harshita. I would like to turn the call back over to the presenters at this time. \nChris Comparato: Just thank, everyone [Multiple Speakers] Yeah. I think we are good. Thank you, everyone. \nOperator: That concludes the Toast first quarter 2022 earnings call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. One year went really fast and equally excited about the partnership. And thank you everyone for joining. To start, I wanted to echo Chris in thinking both our customers for their continued partnership and the entire Toast team, whose dedication and tireless work led to another great quarter. Thanks to them that we got off to a great start in 2022 coming in ahead of our expectations across our key metrics.  This is evidence of our solid operating momentum and the power of our industry-leading platform. We're still in the very early stages of this massive opportunity to provide restaurants of all the products and services they need as the industry transitions to digital and navigate new challenges. As Chris mentioned, the number of net new locations added to our platform accelerated in Q1 to over 5,000 and we ended the quarter with approximately 62,000 locations. Driving location growth is one of our key priorities and we're investing to build on this momentum and continue to efficiently increase our market penetration.  Total revenue grew 90% year-over-year to $535 million and ARR hit $637 million as of the end of Q1, up 66% from last year. As we discussed, ARR is our core operational metrics and the best indication of our underlying growth. And we continue to see healthy trends in both our recurring revenue stream, SaaS and payments, which underpins our ARR growth.  Subscription services revenue growth accelerated to a robust 103% in the first quarter, driven by our strong growth in new locations, as well as increasing adoption of our portfolio of SaaS products by new and existing customers. As of March 31, 2022, 60% of our Toast locations use four or more core products.  On top of our integrated POS and payment solution, compared to 51% a year ago, reflecting the benefit of our continued product innovation. With customers using more of our end-to-end platform, our SaaS ARPU continues to increase at a healthy clip. The growing ARPU is particularly evident in our new book locations. The average SaaS ARPU for new bookings in Q1 has more than doubled in just two years to nearly 6,000, as customers continue to adopt more of our products at booking.  In addition, we still have a meaningful opportunity to drive deeper product adoption among our existing customer base over time. We believe the trends in new bookings and the upsell opportunity point a long runway to drive continued ARPU growth. One example is the growing adoption of our payroll product which Chris alluded to. In Q1, approximately 30% of our total bookings included Toast payroll on initial sale, up from 15% last year.  We're seeing early benefits from expanding our sales efforts to focus on existing restaurants that switch to the Toast platform. In addition, the majority of new restaurant openings coming onto our platform continue to attach Toast payroll at the time of booking. We're still early in this opportunity and as an example, while we can continue to increase attach rates at booking and drive upsell to existing customers to drive further ARPU growth. Longer term, we have the potential to layer on more features and services for our restaurant employees helping our customers differentiate themselves in a tight labor market, while unlocking incremental monetization on our platform.  Moving to financial technology solutions. Revenue grew 93% to $438 million. FinTech solutions gross profit, which is net of payment transaction costs and what we operationally as -- what we operationally as a second component of our recurring revenue was $91 million in the quarter, a 66% year-over-year increase. That was driven by GPV growth of 98% to $18 billion. Annualized GPV per processing location remains strong at an average of $1.2 million.  As a reminder, we typically see seasonally higher GPV per processing location in the second and third quarter. As we noted last quarter, our debit and credit mix has returned to pre-COVID trends. While the mix of card-not-present volumes continues to moderate when consumers increasingly returning to dining in restaurants.  Total gross profit grew 38% year-over-year and 23% quarter-over-quarter to $101 million. Gross margin improved by over 250 basis points compared to Q4 to 18.9%m boosted by improvements across our subscription services, FinTech solutions and hardware margins. Looking at our recurring revenue stream subscription and FinTech gross profit totaled $135 million for a 73% increase year-over-year, reflecting the strong customer growth and healthy ARPU increases across both SaaS and FinTech solutions. Turning to our customer acquisition costs. We are focused on maintaining efficient unit economics as we invest to scale the business. And our track record of attractive payback periods continue to give us the confidence to lean into the significant opportunity in front of us. As a reminder, operationally, we manage our hardware and professional services gross profit as customer acquisition costs. Hardware costs remain elevated and increased year-over-year due to higher freight and product costs related to supply chain dynamics.  Compared to Q4, hardware cost improved quarter-over-quarter as freight expenses decline of peak levels and we benefited from one-time adjustments. We're in the process of strategically increasing our hardware inventory enabling us to shift to a lower -- to lower shipping methods, while continuing to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner. While we expect hardware costs to remain high over the next few quarters, we believe they will normalize over time as we leverage lower cost shipping methods and focus on optimizing other parts of our supply chain. Sales and marketing is our other customer acquisition of funds. After reducing our sales force at the onset of COVID, we're investing to rebuild the team in order to continue to drive market share. As part of that investment we're strengthening our process in less penetrated areas. The power of our go-to-market approach is that we increased market share in a territory, we see increasing inbound lead to referrals and from brand awareness, resulting in higher productivity for our sales reps. That flywheel effect enables us to scale efficiently as we gain traction and we're investing to build the foundation to kick start our flywheel in more and more markets.  Even as we increased investment in sales and marketing, we've maintained consistent efficiency. We believe measuring sales and marketing expense as a percentage of recurring revenue is the best indication of how we're executing. Sales and marketing as a percent of recurring revenue decline significantly after the cost cuts in the first half of 2020, and has now held in the same range seven quarters since then. That's been driven by an increasing number of new locations we are adding to the platform each quarter and continued growth in ARPU. This gives us further conviction to lean into the large opportunity we have ahead. As we do so, we continue to manage our unit economics and we're confident that as we gain scale will deliver a leverage on our sales and marketing costs over time.  Moving down the P&L, we're also investing in research and development to build out our platform. This includes deepening the integration and features on year products like payroll and extra chef, (ph) which we believe represent strong monetization opportunity longer term. In addition, as Chris mentioned, we're adding capabilities to better serve different restaurant segment, which will position us to penetrate segments where we've typically had less of a presence. Similar to last quarter, the increase in general and administrative costs were mainly due to public company related expenses. Overall adjusted EBITDA of negative $45 million in Q1 was better than our expectations. The outperformance reflects continued strength in GPV and SaaS revenue growth. In addition to the progress on reducing hardware costs, as we navigate the challenging macro environment. Now let me turn to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $635 million to $665 million, which represents 53% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $60 million to negative $59 million. For the full year, we are increasing our revenue expectations by 6% at the midpoint, to reflect the momentum in software revenue growth and our expectation for GPV growth to remain strong. We now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion, which represents 48% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Following our strong Q1 performance, we're also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be in the range of negative $195 million to negative $175 million for 2022. This reflects the targeted investments we're making across sales and marketing and research and development to drive the core growth strategies that Chris highlighted. Given the incredible demand for our product growing ARPU as customers do more with us and the massive market opportunity in front of us. We're confident that these investments will deliver strong returns.  While these investments are resulting in higher burn today, make no mistake, we remain focused on working towards long-term profitability in the current environment has only increased urgency. We're actively driving efficiencies across the company and tightly managing all discretionary spend in order to help fund our key growth initiatives while improving profitability.  Making sure, we have a lean cost structure is a priority. It will enable us to stay nimble as we rapidly grow and gain operating leverage with scale. Our guidance implies that EBITDA margins will improve by 200 basis points in the second half of the year compared to the first half. And we're positioning the business to continue to deliver consistent margin improvement with durable top line growth in 2023 and beyond.  In closing, we're off to a great start in 2022, evidence of our strong execution and industry-leading platform. The restaurant industry is going through a generational shift to digital and our priority is to further cement our leadership position as the trusted platform of choice for the restaurant industry. We believe through our portfolio of offerings, we can help restaurants boost sales, improve efficiency, retain employees and thrive in one of the most competitive industries. And as we execute on that, we believe it will translate into strong, durable growth and healthy profits over the long term.  Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A. Yeah, Chris, I can comment if you [Multiple Speakers]. So at the highest level, great question, so things that are not something we would not invest in, right. We're going to really focus, continue to focus in sales. We're going to continue to focus in R&D. We're going to focus on areas that really drive high ROI. That's really important. It's non-negotiable for us to not go after this market opportunity, given the momentum we're seeing, given the signals that we're getting from our customers et cetera. So those are non-negotiable for us. Areas where we're focused on discretionary on managing tightly are things such as overhead discretionary expenses, of course, the typical T&E type of things and also over time really trying to gain leverage in our G&A functions. Yeah. No, we've actually not seen that. We've actually seen churn remained low something we're really proud of and it's just a testament to the power of the platform. So we're really encouraged by the fact that churn has remained relatively low. Yeah. Great question. Thanks. So we actually have very healthy payback periods and consistent with what we've -- and that's despite the elevated hardware costs that we've experienced over the last couple of quarters. Our goal, as I mentioned in the last call, continues to be in the mid-teens and we have confidence, we'll be able to accomplish that through this year. Yeah. The Toast Capital continues to be just not material for our total results. But as I mentioned, some of the debit, we had a little bit higher debit in Q1 than typical. So that, that's really the dynamic that is causing our take rates to be what it is. I would just tell you that we believe the take rates that you see in Q1 is a reasonable take rate for the near term. And then I would also just take this opportunity to make sure to zoom out and just think about take rate is, is just one dimension of our business, right. We really think about our business beyond take rate and you saw the performance in our SaaS business as well. So I would just encourage you to look at the broader picture beyond take rate. Sure. We had a -- so thanks for the question. We've seen really healthy GPV per processing location and obviously, we know that it's an inflationary environment and we're seeing our customers of course, play with pricing, but really the demand has been really strong. So we're encouraged by that and that's really what's reflecting in our confidence and our guide, but also just strong execution in Q1 and really strong demand all the way around. Yeah. Great question. I'll take that. So we don't have a specific target to share today. But it's really important, so we're balancing sustain sort of durable growth, with improving profitability, which is a key priority growth, which I hope came through in our scripts. And at the highest level, we're positioning the business for consistent margin improvement as we look into the back half of 2022 which was reflected in the guide.  And going forward from there, we want to focus on consistent improvement in our margin profile. In longer term, we believe an integrated model, which we always talk about and we have multiple monetization streams, which will be highly profitable in a steady state. So when you look at the various components, you think about strong unit economics, you think about investing in R&D and then really getting scale in our G&A.  So there is a bunch of levers we have, but we are focused on building a lean cost structure, which will allow us to pivot and really continue to sustain this high growth profile with a very lean cost structure along the way. So with that, I would say that we will see consistent improvement in margin over time. But I'm not going to share a specific timeframe or target today. Yeah. We've -- monolithic comment as well. But we've been investing in upsell. We started an upsell team in 2020. We also have an ability for our customers to go on to shop, which allows them to buy products online as well but our upsell team is very much focused on building that muscle of selling incremental products to our existing installed base and payroll has been a great example that were early in that opportunity, but we're definitely and this upsell team was an investment we made in 2020 built-on it in 2021 and continue to invest and see good signal there as well and that's what's reflected in our of our overall ARPU growth and as well even in the consistency of our execution and positioning the entirety of the platform, not really having impact across our entire sales base, but I'll let him on comment. It's a little bit of both. I mean, first, kudos to the sales team for their great execution and what you're seeing in the fast growth being over a 100 -- up 100% and having record locations. It's really adoption from both new and existing customers and also higher sale of booking, which is, which we talked about on the script. And that's really coming back to the positioning of the entirety of the platform upfront, which is obviously really important and an indicator of our competence in our ability to position on tariffs the entirety of the platform, and have a higher booking -- ARPU booking at upfront yeah. Yeah, I would say we're seeing strength across our entirety of our business. Yeah, I mean I think... Yeah, No, I think heading into the year, if you think back 90 days ago, we had a little bit of Omnicom ahead. There is a big macro that we factored into our guidance. And what we've really seen is strong GPV growth and strong momentum in our business. And so that's really what's reflected in the guide. And actually I would say that what we're balancing now is the same thing we're balancing the macro, we're balancing -- making sure we're investing in a lean cost structure and just being prudent with what we see. Yeah. No, it's a fair question and I feel like we're in a good position where -- with our performance and consistent execution. We're looking to get to free cash flow breakeven over the near term, I would say brent. So I'm not worried about additional funding needed to help us succeed and go after this opportunity. Yeah, No, that's a great question. We're in the early, early innings. And I would, just remind you that our 2022 years is really a foundational year for us. We've got a few customers live and we're getting some really great, great feedback and we're learning that the demand is strong. But that said, we're in the early innings. And this is sort of a multi-year journey for us. So I think we're aways from having meaningful impact on our P&L, but we're encouraged by the early signal from the customers that we're engaging with. Yeah. Then we -- so you're right, we had some benefit in Q1, some one-time benefits and also we had lower freight costs in Q1. I do expect a little bit of a tick up in Q2. But over the long term.

            "name": "Chris Comparato",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. Toast delivered a strong first quarter coming in well ahead of expectations across the board. We added a record number of net new locations to our platform, as we continue to lead the digitization of the $800 billion restaurant industry and penetrate our $55 billion market opportunity.  Our performance is a function of continued execution on our three core growth drivers, increasing the number of restaurant locations on our platform, delivering product innovations, so restaurants use more of our platform to drive success with all of their stakeholders and deepening our ability to serve all segments of the market. Despite being one of the largest industries in the world, restaurants have been underserved by technology with one of the lowest levels of digitization of any sector.  Running a restaurant is also an incredibly complex and competitive business, the pandemic, a tight labor market, supply chain constraints and inflation have only magnified the challenges. The stakes have never been higher for restaurant owners to embrace technology to help them improve operational efficiency and increased sales, so they can thrive in this dynamic new world. Over the next several years, we expect every restaurant to operate on a unified digital platform. And just like we've seen in other industries, restaurants that embrace a digital platform perform better. As the restaurant industry goes through this wholesale digital transformation, we expect restaurant spend on technology to increase, closing the gap with other industries. Amid the secular shift to digital and the cloud Toast is executing on a generational opportunity to become the trusted partner restaurants need and to serve as the industries technology backbone.  We are leaving restaurants into a new era of hospitality. With our laser focus on restaurants and a proven track record of innovation, we've built the best-in-class platform that offers restaurants everything they need to win, to delight their guests, attract and retain employees, manage supplier relationships and ultimately do what they love and thrive. We understand the unique needs of restaurants of any size or concept in a way that no other platform can and we are adding more capabilities to help serve every segment of the market and expand our reach.  Now turning to our results for the quarter. Revenue increased 90% year-over-year to $535 million in the first quarter, and ARR increased 66% year-over-year to $637 million. This was driven by an acceleration in subscription revenue growth from the addition of new locations and continued customer adoption of our growing portfolio of products, as well as strong growth in GPV. Customers using four or more core modules beyond point of sale and payments reached 60% in Q1, contributing to the robust 103% year-over-year growth in subscription revenue. GPV on our platform increased 98% year-over-year to $18 billion in Q1. And for the first time ever, we exceeded 5,000 net new locations in a quarter. We ended Q1 with approximately 62,000 live locations on our platform, up nearly 45% year-over-year and we're still just scratching the surface of this massive long-term opportunity. Even as our ARR has more than tripled over the past two years, it still represents only about 1% of our $55 billion market opportunity in the U.S. On the back of our strong start to the year, we increased our full year revenue guidance by 6% at the midpoint of the range, which implies 48% year-over-year growth. We also improved our adjusted EBITDA outlook as we focus on driving efficient growth.  I want to add additional context on our investment levels this year. Our Q1 results are further evidence of the momentum in our business and the reason we have conviction to invest to capture the massive market opportunity in front of us. At the same time, the current environment calls for heightened discipline and we're actively evaluating our spend to make sure we scale in a sustainable efficient manner. That means identifying efficiency opportunities throughout our business and directing our investments only to areas that drive growth and have a proven return profile.  We've shown in the past, we can grow efficiently and deliver profits, with a proven go-to-market approach that gains leverage with scale, healthy unit economics and disciplined cost management. We're confident we will drive sustained strong growth and healthy long-term profitability. Our updated guidance implies a margin improvement in the second half of the year and we expect to continue on that trajectory moving forward.  Now I want to turn to how we're executing on our core growth drivers. As the restaurant industry undergoes the secular shift to digital and the cloud, driving location growth is a key priority and we're leaning into this in a number of ways to build on our momentum. We continue to benefit from our proven scalable go-to-market formula. The restaurant industry is a uniquely local business and our model feeds on that. As we've seen in our most established markets, as our penetration increases and more customers in a market experience our superior product offering, the number of referrals and inbound leads accelerate, creating a flywheel effect that drives strong and efficient growth.  We're investing in less developed markets to build that same flywheel as we build this muscle broadly across more markets. We expect it to continue to drive efficient location growth. Not only are we rapidly adding locations, we are seeing that our new customers are leveraging more of our products from the onset, a strong signal of the demand for our broader platform.  Software ARPU for locations booked in Q1 approximately doubled from just two years ago. We've seen strong uptake for our guests modules as we've significantly enhanced our products to help customers cater to the evolving guest needs over the past two years. Our payroll and team management offering is also building momentum. And we continue to see a significant opportunity to attach more products to our existing customer base, an important indication of our long-term ARPU growth potential.  Let me share with you a few examples of the strong demand we are seeing across restaurant segments. This quarter, we expanded our relationship with Union Square Hospitality Group, which has created some of New York's most beloved restaurants cafes and bars. They are expanding Toast to 16 total locations, including Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Cafe\u0301, the modern and their daily provisions concepts.  In addition to our Toast Go handheld point of sale and kitchen operations USHG will manage their multiple concepts and menu configurations using our Multi-Location menu management. They're also planning on using Toast for hotel restaurants to manage their mark-to-location, allowing them to seamlessly charge to hotel rooms during the payment process. This quarter, we also expanded our Nothing Bundt Cakes, a national bakery chain.  Nothing Bundt Cakes expanded its relationship with Toast purchasing our product for 70 new locations in Q1, which will increase our partnership to over 500 locations in the next 12 months. They are using Toast to drive revenue and help build a seamless purchase process for their guests. [indiscernible] a growing fast casual Mexican food chain expanded with Toast in Q1. They were live with Toast in 30 locations, using our Toast Go our Toast Flex and Multi-Location Management products and they signed a contract to add several more locations in the next 12 months using all of these products.  Additionally [indiscernible] is adding our Kitchen Display System in their current locations. In addition to our broad and growing platform, we also continue to grow our extensive partner ecosystem which now includes more than 180 partners across large national food and beverage suppliers, technology integration partners and local partners. This quarter, we extended our reseller partnership with U.S. Foods, a leading foodservice distributor that works with approximately 250,000 restaurants and foodservice operators. We focused on continuing to strengthen our partner network to give our customers seamless access to every product and service they need further enhancing the value our platform provides. Shifting to product innovation. I talked to many of our customers every quarter and a consistent theme I hear is they didn't get into the restaurant industry because they love technology, but they do realize that the industry is going through a digital transformation and they need a partner who they can grow it, so they can do what they love. That's why we consider Toast an extension of R&D for the restaurant industry. We give restaurants all the tools they need to run their business, integrated point of sale and payments, mobile ordering and delivery, marketing and loyalty, team management, friction access to -- frictionless access to capital and a growing array of integrated services to meet the evolving needs of our customers.  We've built in array of products that serve restaurant owners at their core, but also create a better experience for all stakeholders in the restaurant ecosystem, guests, employees and suppliers there tends to be a flywheel between happier employees leading to happier restaurant guests and both contributing to more successful better run restaurants. We're continuing to invest in products to further differentiate our platform by enhancing and deepening the touch points between restaurants and each stakeholder. And with our integrated platform, as restaurant add more of our products, it strengthens the flywheel, creating powerful network effects for our customers. In supplier management, we're making great progress with our extra chef products, which provides accounts payable automation and inventory management. With restaurant space and supply chain challenges and inflation, we're seeing just how important it is to help our customers manage profitability by easily comparing the cost of a menu item versus what they're charging. In longer term, we have opportunities to expand the services we offer restaurants in this area and further optimize and automate their supplier management. Our payroll and team management products speed up employee onboarding, simplify payroll and ensure employees are paid on time. With restaurants still facing labor challenges, if you're not providing a great employee experience and paying your employees quickly, it will be more difficult for you to hire and retain great talent, which impacts the guest experience in sales. We believe both selling payroll into our existing customer base and continuing to innovate in this space to help restaurants offer employees even more services that can differentiate them in this tough labor market, represent meaningful growth opportunities going forward. As we continue to build scale and drive growth in our core segments, another key growth strategy is to position Toast to increase penetration in all restaurant segments and expand to new markets. With our laser focus on serving the restaurant industry, we're uniquely able to adapt our platform to meet the specific needs of different types of restaurants. One example from this quarter is targeted for quick service restaurants. We've built an offering that better suits the needs of these restaurants and helps them get results even quicker.  As I mentioned, we also announced Toast for hotel restaurants, a new solution designed to meet the unique needs of hotel restaurant operators. Toast now integrates with several hotel management software providers, allowing us to better serve this segment and we're focused on continuing to adapt our product and packaging to serve the specific needs of each type of restaurant in order to drive deeper penetration across segments. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we've seeded an initial investment in international this year. We believe our best-in-class product offerings and go-to-market approach translates well to other markets, which will enable us to tap into our broader TAM and become another driver -- growth driver longer term. Before closing, I wanted to thank our customers and employees. The restaurant industry remains resilient even amid the many macro challenges across the globe and we are incredibly proud to be able to partner with our customers as they navigate these challenges. And thank you to our great employees for helping get Toast off to a great start in 2022 and build on our terrific operating momentum. We're still very early in our journey and we're confident that by continuing to relentlessly execute on our strategy will create significant value for our customers and shareholders over the long term.  Finally, before I pass the call over to Elena to go through our financials, I want to congratulate her on her one-year anniversary at Toast. What an incredible year it's been. Elena, I'm excited to partner with you on this journey ahead.  And now, Elena, I'll turn it over to you. Sure. Yeah, so I can chime in from. My answer is that. Okay. I was going to say absolutely, we believe what we're grabbing market share in multiple segments. Our core segment, our core SMB segment is performing extremely well and it continues to drive the largest portion of opportunity. And then we're continuing to see success upmarket and midmarket and enterprise and we're seeing some pull in that market. So we absolutely believe that we can sustain the growth that we're seeing on location acquisition. I'll remind you that we're still very early in our TAM penetration. Today, we're only about 7% of the 860,000 restaurants across the U.S. So we're certainly focused on consistent execution and our unit economics tell us that we should continue to go fast on that loans. Yes. So we have a solid QSR customer base today, but we feel we have the potential to grow faster moving forward. So think of the platform as, we have this restaurant for us in depth platform. But now we're adapting it to specific segments to further accelerate our growth. So take QSR, it's basically a tailored set of products that are packaged and priced in a way that makes sense for QSR businesses. So tying mobile ordering to KDS and then the ability to SMS, text message a guest when the order is ready. That's a super-fast flywheel and we're seeing results where restaurants are telling us, a good example is, there is a restaurant chain called Bultaco. They're telling us when they apply that packaging and configuration to their concept, they are increasing throughput by more than 20%. So really think about our segmentation work as adapting the platform to be really concept specific which allows these concepts to then move faster. So that's really what's happening with the segmentation strategy, which is, QSR is just one example, Toast for hotel restaurants is yet another example. I can jump in. Yeah. So we've not seen any material impact on the current sort of macro trends. There is no evidence of a slowdown from our perspective on restaurant spend. In fact like we feel restaurants are seeing healthy demand from consumers and a good example is, dine-in, if you look at restaurants across the U.S. running Toast dine-in is up 46% year-over-year from Q1 of 2021 to Q1 of this year.  So that's a really healthy dynamic that tells us that consumers are going back into restaurants and doing it quite frequently especially post-COVID. So we think that trend will continue. And we think the consumer demand is high and we believe that restaurants have pricing power, the play with pricing to continue to serve those consumers. So we don't see any, any evident for the slowdown or material risk on that front. Go ahead, Elena, if you want. Yeah. One clarification is, it's not -- one clarification it's not bigger locations. It's just doing a much better job at selling the entirety of the platform both upfront, as well as downstream. But it's not as if we're going after a bigger, bigger locations. It's really just making doing a better job at some of the platform story to existing locations that are similarly size. Yeah. I think what I'm here -- sorry, Josh, effectively our customers are telling us that they want more and more from the platform. So I think what you're seeing is, as you're seeing us better position the platform story upfront, as well as downstream and then they're telling us that they want to see even more innovation within those modules across the platform. So a good example is, what Elena referenced for payroll. We're doing a much better job at attach and payroll upfront, as well as upselling it downstream, but then restaurants are coming back to us saying over time. We'd love for you to, when you look at the employee value proposition to recruit onboard, developed manage pay, retain employees that has its own road map of opportunity and that will be over the long haul that we continue to innovate on top of the existing ARPU base. So, we expect we will continue to see the modules used by average customer tick up, but then we'll continue to evolve that module landscape over time. I'm not going to give you a number, but what I know in talking to restaurants every day is that they need more technology capability to not just pay their employees, but to recruit onboard develop them, plan their schedules, pay them and then retain them. So we see that value chain just within the employee stakeholder and we've built out a roadmap from there on what this piece of the platform could become and that excites us because we know every restaurant needs us, like every restaurant needs to get off of manual processes and spreadsheets to better attract and retain their employees and pay their employees and employees want to be paid faster. So we're excited about this section of the platform that continues to perform well, but there is a long journey ahead on its potential. I'm not going to give you a number, except that every restaurant grapples with how to attract and retain their employees and we see opportunity there. Exactly. Yeah. Great question. I'll remind everyone that it's still early for extra chef and we're excited about the opportunity ahead. We just enabled our entire sales force to position and sell extra chef in Q1. So we're excited about their performance. It was ahead of our plan in Q1, but we're very much in the early stages of the product roadmap on B2B. For example, extra chef today does a great job of AP automation.  Great job at inventory management and recipe management, so we can do really good food cost optimization, but over time, the opportunity for this section of the platform is very similar to payroll, if you think about the opportunity to better manage the books and work with accountants. The opportunity to better work with suppliers and consider bill pay to suppliers. So we see a tremendous opportunity in the back office around supplier management and we're very much in the infancy of this product roadmap. So that's exactly why we went after extra chef and they've been an integral part of our Toast team and building out this vision, but a really good question. Just thank, everyone [Multiple Speakers] Yeah. I think we are good. Thank you, everyone."

With that, let me turn the call over to Aman.\nAman Narang: Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining today's conference call. This is my 12th year since we launched Toast in my basement with Steve Forde and Jonathan Grimm back in 2012. And I'm honored to be here today with all of you and leave this great business as CEO on my first earnings call. Before I recap 2023 and look ahead to 2024, I do want to address one topic upfront. We've made the difficult but right decision to reduce our headcount by 10%. As you know, Toast grew rapidly over the past three years to support our growing customer community. As we've taken a look across the organization, it has become clear that we grew our team to quickly in some areas, and we need to restructure the organization to best align with our most priorities. The changes we announced today primarily focused on noncustomer-facing roles and we remain committed to fitting healthy topline growth and delivering a best-in-class customer experience. I want to thank every Toaster passing present, including those who are leaving us for the important part, each of you played in getting us to where we are today. In the very immediate term, my priority is to ensure we navigate today's decision with empathy and support for those affected. As we work through this transition, I'm confident we can tap into a renewed sense of optimism for the opportunity is. Our designing challenge for 2024 is to operate with a shared urgency against our mission, raise the bar on how we collaborate, and maintain a relentless focus on our customers. Over the past decade, we've built a leading integrated software platform for the restaurant industry. And since our IPO in September 2021, we've launched so much innovation to help restaurants thrive, products like reservations, websites, scheduling, retail capabilities for restaurants, a full redesign of our POS experience, and more recently, our Toast-style operator app, to name a few. This focus on platform innovation has allowed us to double the number of restaurants in our platform to 106,000 and more than ARR to over $1.2 billion in IPO. As we look ahead, our conviction in the future is as strong as ever. We are well on our way to becoming the technology platform of choice for the entire restaurant industry. Continuing to deliver on our mission and serving as the technology backbone for restaurants will lead to significant value creation for all our stakeholders, our customers, our shareholders, and of course, our Toasters that support our community each and every day. To accomplish this, we're focused on four strategic priorities: first, scaling restaurant locations within our core business; second, driving ARR and ARPU by building products and experiences our customers love; third, expanding our addressable market by launching and scaling new growth vectors; and fourth, setting up the company to scale and deliver ongoing operating leverage. Now, let me walk through this in more detail. First, we will continue to win market share and scale restaurant locations within our core business. We added over 6,500 net locations in Q4 and ended the year with approximately 106,000 locations, a 34% increase versus 2022. Our ability to sustain over 30% location growth at this scale is a testament to our competitive differentiation. Our all-in-one platform, our localized go-to-market approach, and the consistent execution by our sales and customer success teams. The momentum in our SMB segment has allowed us to double the number of flywheel markets over the past year, with 30% of our markets now in flywheel defined by over 20% SMB market share. Our rep productivity in flywheel markets is over 10% higher than other markets, leading to faster share gains. Even in our most penetrated markets where we have over 30% market share, we are still gaining share at a healthy clip. These markets are a benchmark for how we expect other markets to evolve over time and gives us confidence in sustaining healthy location growth. The foundation of our success starts with high-value full-serve restaurants, which our go-to-market team is prioritizing. In addition, we're gaining traction across the broader TAM as we expand our product offerings to serve different restaurant types. And as our addressable market grows and we see gradual adjustments in our mix across SMB, mid-market, enterprise, and international restaurants. We expect ARPU to continue to increase and GPV permission to remain above industry averages. Our team continues to ensure we maintain a healthy unit economics as we scale locations across these categories. In addition to our SMB market segment, which is our largest share -- which is the largest share of the market and remains the biggest driver of net adds. We continue to see growth in our mid-market segment, including brands such as Wetzel's Pretzels, The 99, Dirty Dough, Romano's Macaroni Grill, that have joined Toast for the past year. Let me highlight what FSR went from the quarter. Urban Prime marketplace and restaurant honored by Chef Ercan Ekinci in Florida opened in October. Urban Prime is an upscale FSR with large indoor and outdoor dining areas, as well as the broader market featuring a butcher shop, sushi and wine. After extensive research, Urban Prime selected Toast to consolidate their business across their thriving restaurant and gourmet market and are leveraging our POS terminals, Toast handle devices, pitch-display systems, online ordering, gift cards and marketing.  Using our restaurant's retail product, they were able to consolidate POS systems across their restaurant, end markets to simplify their front and back office operations and consolidate all the ride streams into a single back end. In addition, they've also recently switched to Toast payroll to further streamline and simplify their business. It's great to see Urban Prime expand with Toast and refer several restaurants to Toast. Our second priority is driving ARR and ARPU by building products and experiences our customers love. To complement our strong location growth, we are laser-focused on increasing ARR at scale. In 2023, we grew total ARR 35% year-over-year. We believe there is runway in our existing markets to continue to scale locations while also increasing blast and fintech ARR to product innovation, pricing and our continued investment in upselling existing customers through our growth sales team. [Indiscernible] product attach rates is an import of ARPU, many of our existing products have plenty of runway to scale and our product teams continue to act on customer feedback to enhance and expand their terminal attack potential across our customer base. New customers, earlier this month, we rolled out simpler product packaging that will enable our new business reps to maximize initial product attach and ARPU, while benchmark strong location growth. And for existing customers, price adjustments is a new lever that we're looking to build into our ongoing ARPU strategy. We'll take a holistic approach across both SaaS and Fintech, and you should see progress from us in 2024 that we build on moving forward. One customer that has extended and adopted more of the platform is Angelo's Ristorante in Massachusetts. Angelo's is a classic Italian Eatery half fine dining, half tea cafeteria with joint Toast. On a busy Friday night, Angelo's may send 40 to 50 tickets of kitchen in the short 15-minute period. And to support this volume, they're when looking for a new POS. After looking at 10 different systems, they chose Toast because we estimate their needs. Since joining Toast, Angelo's SaaS ARR has almost doubled. Angelo, the restaurant owner has worked closely with us to add more products to grow revenue, including online ordering, catering events and Toast Tables. With Toast Tables, Angelo's host can more efficiently manage stable table turnover and bring in more reservations. As a new payroll customer this year, Angelo is excited about the timing and cost savings we've seen so far. So, shifting to our next priority. Our third priority is expanding our TAM by launching and scaling new growth vectors. To complement our success across restaurants, our product team is hard at work to make Toast an even better fit across enterprise, hotel restaurants and international markets. Last week, we announced an agreement with Choice Hotels. Toast will be the brand standard for Cambria and Radisson Hotels as well as a qualified vendor for other choice brands. Cambria and Radisson will leverage the best of the Toast platform, including Toast Online Ordering, Mobile Order & Pay, Kiosk and Toast Payments to support the different dining options across their properties. We are also thrilled to welcome Caribou Coffee to Toast. They chose us to maximize speed of service across their coffee shops and partner with a scalable restaurant platform to support their expansion plans. And internationally, I'm excited to share that we meet at 1,000 locations as of the fourth quarter. The team has worked hard to establish the Toast brand in parts of Canada, the UK and Ireland using the same localized go-to-market approach that has worked domestically. The customer reception in these markets has been terrific, and it reminds me what we saw here in the US in the early days. As more of our platform is available at international markets, online ordering, guest marketing and reservations, we expect to drive higher ARPU and further improve our payback trajectory and margins. This is a priority in 2024. We're confident that as the enterprise and international markets represent a significant growth opportunity for Toast. Additionally, we're also looking to leverage our differentiated go-to-market engine, our all-in-one platform and our growing scale open up new opportunities for us. We're seeding investments in new parts of the TAM where we believe our market position provides a competitive advantage. Restaurant retail is a good example of this, and these nascent initiatives should further complement our growth potential over the long-term. Next, our fourth priority is setting up the company to operate and scale to deliver ongoing leverage. In 2023, we grew ARR 35% and adjusted EBITDA to $61 million, which was a $175 million improvement year-over-year. Our progress shows the scalability of our business as we balance growth and profitability. As we continue to grow, we're committed to the ambitious priorities I laid out above as well as delivering increased operating leverage, including GAAP operating income profit by the first half of 2025. This effort includes managing our stock-based compensation expense with the same discipline that we approach all our expense lines. Additionally, as we start to scale free cash flow, our capital allocation approach will evolve. This includes prioritizing organic investments in areas we have signal and conviction that we can grow, looking at M&A if we see the right opportunities and returning capital to our shareholders. To support this, our Board has approved a $250 million share repurchase authorization, which we will leverage opportunistically based on market conditions. We plan to regularly evaluate and optimize our capital allocation priorities and we will do so with a disciplined and transparent approach. All right. To wrap-up, I want to leave you with a few points that I covered today. We have a large opportunity ahead and have built the foundation to capitalize on it. As we execute our playbook to deliver continued market share gains in our core business, we will invest in parallel and leverage our strengths to open up additional TAM and build new growth curves. We will sustain ARPU and ARR growth through a combination of product attach and pricing, and we're confident we have a scalable business model, and we'll continue to balance growth and profitability. I want to thank all our toasters including those who will be leaving us for your dedication and contribution to test. As I said earlier, this week is a tough week. But I'm confident that we will move past this and over time, build a stronger Toast. I also want to thank our customers for entrusting us to support this incredible community. And I want to thank our shareholders for believing in us and the potential in this business. Thank you and now I'll turn it over to Elena.\nElena Gomez: Thank you, Aman and to everyone for joining. I'd like to thank all of our testers for their hard work and commitments, including those we are saying goodbye today. Organizational changes like these are hard though this is a necessary step to streamline how we operate and position us to go faster to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. In 2023, we showed our ability to balance durable growth and profitability. For the year, Toast processed over $125 billion in payment volume, up 38%. ARR grew 35% and total fintech and subscription gross profit, our recurring gross profit streams increased 49% for the year. And we are efficiently scaling the business and driving cost discipline, delivering adjusted EBITDA of $61 million, a 6% margin on our recurring gross profit stream, 22 percentage points better than 2022. Over the past two years, we've embedded durable efficient growth out of a principle of how we operate the business. The midpoints of our 2024 guidance at 24% growth in our recurring gross profit streams and $210 million in adjusted EBITDA reinforces this and puts us on track for GAAP operating income profitability by the first half of 2025. As you heard from Aman, we are still in the early stages of our growth potential and committed to maintain the same approach as we lean into the growth opportunity and continue to scale. The three main areas I want to cover today are our fourth quarter results, our guidance and the impact of our restructuring lens, and our capital allocation approach, including the $250 million share repurchase program we announced today. Starting with our fourth quarter results. We added over 6,500 net locations, increasing our total locations to approximately 106,000, up 34% year-over-year. SaaS ARR grew 43% year-over-year, driven by the strong location growth and a 7% base in SaaS ARPU as we lean into our customer acquisition momentum and balance ARPU growth. Our SaaS net retention rate remained in a healthy range at 117% led by solid contributions from upsell and location expansion from existing customers. Fourth quarter payments ARR grew 28% and fintech gross profit increased 29%. Fourth quarter GPV is 32% to $33.7 billion, and GPV per location declined modestly year-over-year, in line with our expectations and consistent with the trend exiting the third quarter. As a reminder, fourth quarter GPV relocation is seasonally lower than the third quarter, and payment ARR reflects the same seasonality. Net take rate was 52 basis points in the quarter. Our non-payment fintech solutions led by Toast Capital, contributed $34 million in gross profit in Q4, reflecting steady healthy demand. We continue to take a balanced approach to growing Toast Capital and our unique position with real-time access to POS data allows us to monitor the health of restaurants and prudently balanced risk while helping our customers grow as fast, flexible access to capital. ARR remains our North Star. As Aman laid out, our two growth vectors, locations in ARPU, we have multiple levers to sustain healthy ARR growth over time. We will prioritize the highest value locations to extend our success in this segment of the market. At the same time, the breadth of our integrated platform and ongoing product innovation, opens up the entire restaurant TAM to us and we plan to catalyze or that opportunity to drive further share gains. As we expand, we will remain grounded in unit economics and will tightly manage payback periods across the portfolio to ensure we drive incremental profit as we scale our locations. In 2023, our dollar-based payback period was 14 months, in line with our target for the quarter and an improvement from 2022 to even as we expanded into more parts of the hand and increased our international investment. In fintech, our long-term growth drivers for increasing core net take -- take rate remain, driving towards lowest cost per transit leveraging our unique customer relationships to provide additional fintech solutions. We anticipate SaaS ARPU growth to be in mid-single digits over the near-term, driven by increasing attach and pricing. Across both SaaS and fintech, pricing is a lever that we will use methodically to monetize value we provide customers. As Aman discussed, this is a capability we are building to be an ongoing part of our growth algorithm over time. Turning to our expenses, we manage hardware and services as customer acquisition costs and provide these on a discounted basis to offer an easy, low friction on-ramp for customers. Q4 hardware and services gross margin improved 19 percentage points compared to last year, primarily reflecting lower shipping costs and ongoing operational efficiencies. Sales and marketing expenses increased 18% year-over-year in Q4 as we continue to invest in our upsell and international sales team and make targeted investments in our US new business team to drive deeper penetration. Sales and marketing as a percentage of our recurring gross profit streams improved by 400 basis points in Q4 relative to last year. Our go-to-market motion is a competitive differentiator and an important part of our ability to efficiently scale the business, enabling us to sustain healthy ARR growth while moderating investments in sales and marketing. R&D expenses grew 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our product investments are aligned with our priorities to serve more of the TAM to expand ARPU by increasing the addressability of our products and serving more of our customers' needs and to see longer term growth initiatives. Complementing these priorities is an emphasis on delivering best-in-class customer experiences and building scalable, resilient infrastructure to support hundreds of thousands of locations. G&A expenses grew 5% year-over-year in the quarter, excluding $20 million of bad debt and credit-related expenses primarily related to reserves for Toast Capital, G&A was up 3%. That's a result of our ongoing efficiency efforts and prudently managing overhead expense. Adjusted EBITDA was $29 million in the quarter, the 10% margin on our recurring gross profit streams marked a 19 percentage point improvement from Q4 last year, driven by the combination of continued strong topline growth and operating leverage as we efficiently scale the business. Free cash flow totaled $81 million in the quarter and $93 million for the full year. We converted over 100% of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow with working capital benefiting from stronger GPV trends in December. Over time, we anticipate the trajectory of free cash flow to broadly mirror adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow is typically lower in the first quarter each year due to seasonality of our payments business and the timing of cash bonus payments and this year in Q1 will also include severance payments. Given these factors, we expect free cash flow to be negative in Q1, then accelerate as the year progresses. In terms of the restructuring we announced today, we anticipate recognizing $45 million to $55 million in restructuring and related charges for the year, with most of it falling in Q1. In total, we expect over $100 million in annualized savings, including stock-based compensation from the restructuring and lower hiring. We will reinvest a portion of savings into our highest conviction growth initiatives. Our 2024 topline guidance is for the combination of subscription and fintech non-GAAP gross profit, our recurring gross profit streams which is the P&L metric that most closely aligns with ARR. In Q1, we expect 22% topline growth and $20 million in adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint. This reflects slower GPV trends in January due to weather headwinds across many parts of the country. GPV has stabilized over the past few weeks, and we continue to closely monitor. Net location as in 2024 will follow the typical seasonal pattern, we expect a lower Q1 similar to Q1 last year in the 5,500 range, then location adds will peak in Q2 as restaurants prepare for busy season. More broadly, with a healthy pipeline, consistent go-to-market execution and increasing contribution from new segments as the year progresses, we are well positioned to add more locations to our platform in 2024 than last year. On a full year basis, the $210 million midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects a nearly $150 million improvement and margin expansion of 10 percentage points relative to 2023. As we drive efficiency and increase profitability, we'll prudently invest in our highest priority growth areas, including product innovation and our go-to-market engine. In addition, we will continue to invest in longer term initiatives where we have conviction like international expansion and enterprise as well as plant seeds and newer initiatives where we see a clear right to win to expand our market opportunity and extend our growth potential. Stock-based compensation is an area we're managing with the same rigor and discipline as other expenses. Through a combination of disciplined headcount management, including the restructuring plan announced today, changes to equity granting practices and the roll-off of large grants made in 2021 and 2022 over the next couple of years, our goal is for stock-based comp to decline from 27% in 2023 to low double-digits as a percentage of our recurring gross profit streams over the medium term. Managing our equity program will also improve dilution. We are committed to maintaining net share dilution of total fully diluted share count, which includes all stock awards to below 2% annually. With the combination of continued adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and leverage in our stock-based compensation, we are on track for GAAP operating income profit by the first half of 2025. Lastly, let me turn to capital allocation. As our free cash flow profile grows, our capital allocation strategy will evolve. Our top priority continues to be investing organically in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth. Even as we strategically invest, we are committed to driving increasing free cash flow. With excess free cash flow, we will evaluate M&A. So we will hold a high bar given the strong organic growth outlook, and we're adding the option to return capital to shareholders to our capital allocation tool kit with a $250 million share repurchase authorization. We do not have a timetable on repurchases and will act judiciously and opportunistically. We plan to regularly optimize across these priorities to do what's best for the business at any given time. We will always optimize for long-term shareholder value. To wrap-up, we are executing across the board, growing our location count, driving value for our customers, seeding new longer term growth initiatives and positioning the company to operate fast and nimble going forward. We are planning to host an Analyst Day during the second quarter where we will put deeper into our business and share more about our market opportunity and strategy. I'm incredibly excited about what lies ahead for Toast. Thank you. And now I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will be from the line of Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nWill Nance: Hey guys. Appreciate all the color today and congrats on the strong results. You mentioned pricing a couple of times in the prepared remarks. So maybe you could just kind of expand a bit on in terms of how you're thinking about pricing. I know it's something you, guys, have been talking about in the past couple of quarters. And then, Aman, maybe just a numerical clarification on the guidance, the mid-single-digit ARPU. Is that on an ending basis, kind of like we discussed last year? Or is that more on an ongoing basis over the course of the year? Thanks.\nAman Narang: Sure. Thanks, Will. I'll start by saying, if you look at pricing, it's an important lever for us, but we plan to use it gradually as part of a broader strategy. We've been at this for over a decade, and we're continuing to invest in our restaurant-specific platform, to help restaurant's drive. And I think our customers understand that we continue to invest in this platform that we will increase prices over time. If you look at our new customers that are joining our platform, they're paying us more across both SaaS and fintech. And over time, we expect that existing customers, we will make those adjustments gradually, and it's going to be a lever that we'll use over time.\nElena Gomez: Yes. And I can -- Will, you had the question about SaaS and is that an ending point over the course of the year, and we expect it to be in that range over the course of the year.\nWill Nance: Got it. I appreciate both of those. And then maybe just a follow-up question on Toast Capital, that's been, I think, a little over a year since you rolled out the longer duration products there. You kind of mentioned prudently managing that. Just wondering if you could kind of talk about your expectations for that product? Is there something you, guys, are kind of looking to get more data on or kind of more history? And how should we think about kind of the potential for that product as you continue to scale it. Thanks.\nElena Gomez: Yes. Thanks Will for the question. So, at the highest level, we're really pleased with the performance of Toast Capital and customer demand has been really steady and default rates are in line with our expectations to, really confident in the program overall. We did launch the 360 program last year. Now, we've lapped that. So, we're more in a steady state, I would say, in the business but still seeing healthy demand. And I would expect over this course of this year, it will grow more in line with the rest of the business. But we'll scale it prudently, as you mentioned. And then over the longer term, I think we have an opportunity to continue to evolve and offer more fintech solutions to our customers. But for now, we're going to focus on optimizing this program. It's working well.\nWill Nance: Got it. Appreciate you taking the questions. Congrats again.\nAman Narang: Operator, we'll take the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Elena, can you talk about the dynamics on the gross profit on the fintech side. Looks like the net take rates came down a little bit. I know there's some seasonality here, but can you talk about the drivers here, especially looking forward? I know some of your peers have commented on favorable pricing environment. And then just as a follow-up, Aman, can you talk about the overall data for Toast to new business formation which has been kind of running above trend over the last period? Thank you.\nElena Gomez: I'll cover the first question. I didn't hear clearly the second question so we may ask you to repeat it if that's okay. On the take rate question, take rate in Q4 was 52 basis points, 10 basis points of that is related to Toast Capital. Our core take rate was 42 basis points. And so that -- and that was -- there were some customer credits in that take rate. Nothing structural to consider over the long-term. As we think about take rate over the next year, have that same seasonal pattern we do in Q1 where because of debit, it's higher. But as the year progresses, we should see it improve mostly because we're going to continue our cost optimization efforts, we'll have some surgical pricing that's planned in the latter half of the year. And then longer term, of course, as I will talk about, we always continue to optimize our take rate and drive it up steadily over time. And then your second question, do you mind repeating it?\nHarshita Rawat: Yes, of course. So, it was about your beta to overall like new business formation on the location adds. I know overall, if I look at like new business formation restaurants, it's been running higher versus trend on the long-term trend. So, just any comments there. Thank you.\nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks Harshita. Look, we've seen continue to see fairly balanced between new opening existing restaurants. Post-COVID, we saw a bit of tailwind from new restaurants, but that hasn't tailed off in any material way. I'd also just say, if you zoom out, we've been at this for over a decade. And we're the first to build this vertically innovative restaurant-specific platform, and we'll continue to invest. And what we see is across both existing restaurants and new restaurants, we see our sales team able to continue to create market share across both. This is across FSRs and QSRs. And so even in a world where there's some movement in terms of the number of new openings, and we're confident in our ability to continue to gain share.\nHarshita Rawat: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you and I appreciate all the profitability focus here. So, my question, Elena, for you, you were spot on with your location outlook here in the second half of 2023. You mentioned you're going to add more in 2024 than 2023. A question I get quite often is how did the new location additions differ than what you've seen in the past year or two years ago. I think there's a -- there's always this question of other smaller GPV potential locations. Can you maybe just comment on that big picture-wise? Thank you.\nAman Narang: Yes. I'm happy, Tien-Tsin. Thanks for the question. I'll repeat what I just said. If you think about our mission. We've been at this for 12 years now. And we were the first ones to build a platform that was purpose-built for the restaurant industry. And the team is continuing to invest to make it accessible across all restaurants, right, starting in the US and over time globally. If you look in the near-term, like SMBs continue to drive the majority of our growth, and we see a lot of -- as we gain share. We've talked about how as we get into markets, I talked about this in my prepared remarks. We see more and more markets getting into [Indiscernible] state, which is markets that have over 20% share. And then we're also expanding our products to go after the broader TAM, starting with the US TAM, and enterprise market as well as mid-market and DSMB and then in international markets as well. The impact to GPV as we expand the TAM should be minimal and gradual. Our average location, we expect will continue to remain above industry averages. And as we mentioned, like this year, we expect ARPU to continue to grow in 2024 to complement our location growth and be a vector of growth. And the team is very focused on making sure that as we get into new parts TAM, there are looking at payback periods to make sure that we're help getting economics across the broader TAM.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Great. No, thanks for going through that. I didn't mean to be redundant, but just wanted to cover that. Then just maybe as a follow-on with that ARPU comment, just the attached products. Is that evolving as well? I know the 43% using 6 plus has stayed there, but is the composition of products be taken changing at all? I know that a lot of your peers are pushing some of the higher-end stuff like payroll as well. Any update there? Thank you and I'll jump off.\nAman Narang: Sure. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Yes. Look, we're seeing -- one of the things we just rolled out was pricing and packaging 3.0, the new version, and it's really helping our new business reps optimize with location growth, as well as maximizing our ARPU upfront, and we're balancing that with our upsell team that we're continuing to scale. In terms of the product attach rates, there's nothing that's fundamentally changed. We're seeing healthy growth across our employee cloud products, our fintech products, our guest products. And the R&D team continue to focus on getting customer feedback as we continue to scale locations to see what are ways in which we can increase terminal attach in terms of expanding the product market fit for these products. But we continue to see healthy growth across the portfolio of products that we offer. Thanks Tien-Tsin. Operator, we'll take the next one.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nStephen Sheldon: Hey, thank you. So great to hear that you're now over 30% SMB market share in some markets. And I think you noted in those markets, you're still seeing healthy share gains. But curious if market share gains seem to be slowing down some once you hit a threshold like that, you reach some level of saturation where it gets a lot harder to grow locations in some of those markets?\nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks for the question Sheldon. I mean, I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, but even in our markets where we have the highest SMB patient, this is over 30%. We're still seeing some of the strongest rep productivity and some of the strongest conversion in productivity. I think a lot of that is driven by just the social proof as we make more customers successful in these markets. We continue to see strong growth. So, we haven't seen any change in terms of the rate at which customers are joining our platform as we get more share in these local markets.\nStephen Sheldon: Got it. That's helpful. And then a follow-up with international monetization, seeming like it's picking up. I think you noted a 1,000 locations those three markets. How are you thinking about expansion into other markets beyond those three that you've been focusing investment on so far?\nElena Gomez: Yes, it's a good question. We are -- for the moment, we're really focused on the markets that we're in. We're still early in the early days there, and we've got -- we've been focusing on the go-to-market motion and honing that and building out the platform. So, we want to continue to focus there, but we'll update you should not change. But for the near-term, we're focused on the contributions that we've talked about, which is the UK, Canada, and Dublin.\nAman Narang: The only thing I'll add in those markets, we see tremendous potential for growth, right? It's still in the early days of I think what's possible. The reception received from these customers in these markets is very similar to what we saw in the U.S. or early days, and we want to make sure that we're able to get these markets to a great spot before we think about expanding beyond that.\nStephen Sheldon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, The next question is from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is now open.\nDave Koning: Yes. Hey guys, great job. I guess my first question, the flow-through on recurring GP growth was like 70% to EBITDA the last two quarters. So, you're getting incredible margin kind of go through. And I guess I'm wondering, is that kind of level sustainable? And is there some sort of metric like EBITDA percent regarding GP, we could see you give at some point, is there some sort of target on that?\nElena Gomez: Yes, I mean I'd point you to our guidance. We're really confident in the guidance that we have, Dave, and it's reflecting if you think about the long-term guidance we've given out a few quarters ago, that's -- we have ambition to get to 30% to 35% long-term recurring gross profit growth. That was something we talked about over the long-term -- sorry, EBITDA margin. And so just keep that in mind, that continues to be our focus. And you see us tracking towards that based on the leverage you've seen in the business over the last several quarters and the guidance that we said today. So, our ambitions on EBITDA guidance haven't changed over the long-term.\nDave Koning: Great. Great. Thanks. And then I guess on the fintech yield, I think Harshita asked a little bit about this, too. It was a little down this year. Is the seasonal impact Q1 being the highest then going down through the year? Or because of some pricing actions, could we see a little divergence in kind of the normal yield progression through the year?\nElena Gomez: Yes, Q1 definitely is typically because of -- you'll see a higher impact. And then as the year progresses, it's not just we have a marginal in for some surgical putting in the second half of the year. But you'll continue to see us optimize cost, and that's just part of our normal mode of operating is really trying to optimize our cost structure over time. So both will play a role in the second half of the year.\nDave Koning: Got you. Thanks. Great job.\nAman Narang: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tim Chiodo with UBS. Your line is now open.\nTim Chiodo: Great. Thank you. I want to dig in a little bit to the mid-single-digit SaaS ARR per location outlook. Two components there I want to dig into. First is the newer customer cohort and also the potential from the upsell of the back book. On the newer customers or the new cohort, are you able to put a finer point on what sort of assay ARPU location level that they are coming in at maybe relative to the total company or relative to last year's new cohort? And then on the existing customers, given you've hired new or added to the sales team for the growth team or the upsell team, maybe you could talk about the contribution to that mid-single-digit growth for the existing book?\nAman Narang: Sure. Thanks for the question. Look, I think we mentioned this in our last earnings call as well. Our -- as we optimize our land and expand motion, the new customers that are joining Toast, our sales team is optimizing the number of locations as well as the product attach rate. And so the ARPU is slightly lower. And then that's complemented with our upsell team. The upsell team then takes Toast teams that are regionalized that take over and are looking to drive attach rates across the product portfolio. I think if you look at, if you just zoom out for a second and think about the growth potential in the business, we're confident in our ability to continue to drive sustained ARR growth across both locations and ARPU. And I think -- and we believe both of those will complement each other. And so I think over time, as we continue to improve the capabilities across our product portfolio and improve our pricing and packaging and our upsell motion, there should be continued levers of growth for us into the future.\nTim Chiodo: Okay. Thank you, Aman. So, essentially, the new customer cohort will be a little bit of a drag on that mid-single-digit ARPU growth. More of the growth will be driven by the other two levers than the existing customers upsell and, of course, the pricing, is that the fair characterization at least for this year?\nAman Narang: Yes, I think that's fair. I think that's fair. I think you think of pricing as a gradual lever, right, that complements both locations and price.\nTim Chiodo: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nAman Narang: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nSamad Samana: Great. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on the international side. I know it's only 1,000 locations. But just as we think about that contributing more going forward, how does the average SaaS ARPU for those locations look versus maybe your broader installed base? And similar question, how does maybe GPV per location compare? And how should we think about that maybe evolving over time as you make more progress in the international markets?\nElena Gomez: Yes. Thanks Samad for the question. So, first of all, as Aman said, we're really pleased with what we're seeing internationally. And we've really focused on the go-to-market motion. We've -- with our core platform, so we expect to add more elements to the platform. So, as a result of starting with the just the core elements of the platform. The ARPU is obviously lower. But as we add more to the platform, we should see it get closer to -- in the US. So, that's an opportunity for us. And even with platform we have, we've had a lot of great success. So we expect to add more of the platform in 2024. We'll see that play out over the next, obviously, several years in terms of the impact on ARPU. And in terms of the profile of customers, they don't look that different in the US.\nSamad Samana: Yes. Great. And then on the cost side -- sorry, go ahead. Go ahead.\nAman Narang: Go ahead Samad.\nSamad Samana: I don't know, please. I'll let you finish that. I was going to go in a different direction.\nAman Narang: I was just going to say, if you look at our business, the bulk of our net adds continue to come from our core SMB business, right? We've got -- we reach 1,000 locations over a couple of years. And as we build out the full platform internationally and see the improvements in our activities and unit economics, that's where we look at the pedal down even further. And so in terms of any changes to our mix across GPV and ARPU, you shouldn't expect that to be material in the short-term.\nSamad Samana: Understood. And maybe just on the cost side. I know that doing a reduction in force is a difficult decision. I guess, stepping away from headcount, are there any other cost savings measures that you're putting in place in addition to just the headcount reduction that we should be aware of that flows as the year progresses as well?\nElena Gomez: We terminated a lease. But just in general, when you zoom out, Samad, I want to make this very clear, like the restructuring is one of many efforts that we've -- have been working toward efficiency for several quarters, right? We delivered over $175 million of leverage this year. And we're going to continue on across the company to operate in a very disciplined fashion. So you shouldn't see this as a onetime effort on efficiency, but just how we run our business.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thanks for the question. Two on restaurant retail, I guess, first, any context for the mix of locations that might have retail or the addressable GPV opportunity not currently on the platform?\nAman Narang: Yes. Hey Josh, thanks for the question. As I mentioned earlier, like we have -- SMBs continue to drive the majority of our growth, and we see tremendous runway there. I think as we look at, in fact, a lot of the growth and expansion into restaurant retail was driven by our existing restaurants. Many of them also offer markets and grocery and wine and wanted a single platform across all these businesses. I think we do think that the GPV and ARPU potential in these businesses is stronger. But in terms of, you just zoom out and think about what's driving the bulk of our net adds, it's going to continue to be SMBs and over time, mid-market enterprise and international and then beyond that, retail, that's on retail.\nJosh Baer: Got it. And the follow-up in regard to retail, perhaps if you have a robust restaurant retail offering, you're part of the way there to more fully serving the retail vertical. Is that a TAM expanding opportunity that you're considering down the road? Thanks.\nAman Narang: Yes. I think so over time. Like if you just zoom out and think about our capabilities that we offer. We started in the restaurant vertical by building this purpose-built platform, that's exclusively built, and that's really what's allowed us to fail and gain market share to being one of the market leaders. As we think beyond this and expand the platform and the portfolio of products that we offer and the go-to-market engine that we have and the customer success engine that we have, we certainly think there's opportunity for us to expand beyond, but our focus right now is really in markets where food to serve, right? That's really, you're seeing these lines between restaurants and retail blur. And a lot of these concepts want a single system because they want a single back end that they can use, in fact all of this data, and that's where we're starting.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks guys. I'd love to hear a little bit more about what's going so well on the enterprise side for a moment. Obviously, you brought up hotels in Caribou. Maybe just a little more color on your anticipation there and expectations for that for more progress to come. Maybe a bit more on product gaps or product opportunities that you see in that category that you can do some more work on and maybe even add ARPU on that front as well?\nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks for the question, Darrin. Look, we're proud of the team's progress over the past year with new brands like, if you just look at Choice and Caribou, which I talked about in my prepared remarks. Marriott in expansion with existing like Nothing Bundt Cakes and MTY. Just we start investing in enterprise business just a couple of years ago. It's really great to see the progress we've made in a short period of time. And we're also seeing really good health pipeline and inbound requests from customers. But you got to keep in mind, these are enterprise customers, these are long cycles, and we want to be balanced also in terms of which customers we partner with, does not distract our R&D teams where a single customer has custom work that can take over product roadmaps. In terms of some of the capabilities in ARPU, I think -- it starts by building out some of the core capabilities, enterprise config management, publishing security, compliance, data APIs. And over time, like if you look at the reasons SMB choose Toast, all the platform capabilities in terms of in-store and things like handheld, for example, mobile order and pay and kiosk. We believe over time, a lot of those will be applicable in the enterprise market as well. But you should expect this to be a gradual continued momentum upmarket as we expand TAM as opposed to a step function change in terms of how we're gaining share.\nDarrin Peller: That makes sense. Maybe just a very quick follow-up is on the competitive landscape, meaning more for the SMB side, we obviously continue to hear about other companies talking about a certain type of pause that could be applicable to the restaurant space. But obviously, given the customer adds, you still continue to show strong traction. You don't notice in the competitive landscape as much. What are you, guys, seeing on that front the changes?\nAman Narang: Yes. Look, I think this has always been a competitive market, right from day 1 when we started this business, and we continue to believe what we see in our data is as we execute and get into more of the markets, restaurants are still local. And the more share we get, the more social proof we have, the more the flywheel effect it creates. That's the most important trend that we see in our business. Our team obviously is tracking at win rates and competitive dynamics in the market. But that's really -- if you think of -- we've been at this for so long, and it's really -- we've built this vertically integrated platform and expanded it over time, and that's just really driving our growth. than anything else.\nDarrin Peller: Yes. Okay. Thanks guys.\nAman Narang: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our last question from the line of Dominic Ball with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is now open.\nDominic Ball: Hey guys. Thanks for the question. Great job on execution when it comes to location growth, winning market share being clearly very, very strong. My question is, since the summer, you have been, shall we say, strongly taking price increases. I just want to make sure we get to try in terms of, how do you approach doing this? Is it raising software prices on old or new merchants? Is it on payment rate? Is it monetizing existing free products? Any more color on this would be great. Thank you.\nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks Dominic for the question. Look, as I said earlier, it's the last step then and look at the business, I think -- it's important to remember, pricing is an important lever, but it's one lever. And we want to make sure we're using it gradually as part of a broader strategy. One of the focus areas we continue to gain market share on scale is to look at opportunities where to continue to expand the terminal attach rates of the product that we have to drive ARPU is a really important driver of ARPU. In terms of the opportunity, specifically in pricing, you look at new customers that are joining our platform, what we see is across both SaaS payments, they're paying us more than our base. And so we do see opportunity over time to go back and build it as an ongoing lever as part of our growth algorithm to complement in location growth as well as product attached. And I think you should think, you should expect that to be gradual over time, starting with fintech this year and then SaaS in the out years.\nDominic Ball: Yes, that's great. And just one more, if that's okay. I mean, your answer to another question around a potential expansion to the retail vertical. It is -- sort of that Toast for retail restaurant, is that a potential gateway in the future into certain retail merchants? Or is that -- is this too far for now?\nAman Narang: Yes. As I said earlier, a lot of this was driven by our customer base. You've got our customers really pull us into these hybrid restaurant retail concepts because more and more of them offer not just the restaurant environment, but also they may offer packaged goods in a market, they may offer grocery, wine and so these lines are blurring. And the way our team thinks about, it is anywhere food to serve, we think that our platform that we built over the past decades offers us an opportunity to go create increments value for those customers and so we're starting there. And then I think over time, we'll look at where else Toast can be applicable.\nDominic Ball: Yes, thanks guys and again, well done. Cheers.\nAman Narang: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude the Q&A session today. At this time, I will turn the call back over to the team for any final closing remarks.\nAman Narang: Yes. Thank you everybody for your time today.\nElena Gomez: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: This concludes this conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aman Narang",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining today's conference call. This is my 12th year since we launched Toast in my basement with Steve Forde and Jonathan Grimm back in 2012. And I'm honored to be here today with all of you and leave this great business as CEO on my first earnings call. Before I recap 2023 and look ahead to 2024, I do want to address one topic upfront. We've made the difficult but right decision to reduce our headcount by 10%. As you know, Toast grew rapidly over the past three years to support our growing customer community. As we've taken a look across the organization, it has become clear that we grew our team to quickly in some areas, and we need to restructure the organization to best align with our most priorities. The changes we announced today primarily focused on noncustomer-facing roles and we remain committed to fitting healthy topline growth and delivering a best-in-class customer experience. I want to thank every Toaster passing present, including those who are leaving us for the important part, each of you played in getting us to where we are today. In the very immediate term, my priority is to ensure we navigate today's decision with empathy and support for those affected. As we work through this transition, I'm confident we can tap into a renewed sense of optimism for the opportunity is. Our designing challenge for 2024 is to operate with a shared urgency against our mission, raise the bar on how we collaborate, and maintain a relentless focus on our customers. Over the past decade, we've built a leading integrated software platform for the restaurant industry. And since our IPO in September 2021, we've launched so much innovation to help restaurants thrive, products like reservations, websites, scheduling, retail capabilities for restaurants, a full redesign of our POS experience, and more recently, our Toast-style operator app, to name a few. This focus on platform innovation has allowed us to double the number of restaurants in our platform to 106,000 and more than ARR to over $1.2 billion in IPO. As we look ahead, our conviction in the future is as strong as ever. We are well on our way to becoming the technology platform of choice for the entire restaurant industry. Continuing to deliver on our mission and serving as the technology backbone for restaurants will lead to significant value creation for all our stakeholders, our customers, our shareholders, and of course, our Toasters that support our community each and every day. To accomplish this, we're focused on four strategic priorities: first, scaling restaurant locations within our core business; second, driving ARR and ARPU by building products and experiences our customers love; third, expanding our addressable market by launching and scaling new growth vectors; and fourth, setting up the company to scale and deliver ongoing operating leverage. Now, let me walk through this in more detail. First, we will continue to win market share and scale restaurant locations within our core business. We added over 6,500 net locations in Q4 and ended the year with approximately 106,000 locations, a 34% increase versus 2022. Our ability to sustain over 30% location growth at this scale is a testament to our competitive differentiation. Our all-in-one platform, our localized go-to-market approach, and the consistent execution by our sales and customer success teams. The momentum in our SMB segment has allowed us to double the number of flywheel markets over the past year, with 30% of our markets now in flywheel defined by over 20% SMB market share. Our rep productivity in flywheel markets is over 10% higher than other markets, leading to faster share gains. Even in our most penetrated markets where we have over 30% market share, we are still gaining share at a healthy clip. These markets are a benchmark for how we expect other markets to evolve over time and gives us confidence in sustaining healthy location growth. The foundation of our success starts with high-value full-serve restaurants, which our go-to-market team is prioritizing. In addition, we're gaining traction across the broader TAM as we expand our product offerings to serve different restaurant types. And as our addressable market grows and we see gradual adjustments in our mix across SMB, mid-market, enterprise, and international restaurants. We expect ARPU to continue to increase and GPV permission to remain above industry averages. Our team continues to ensure we maintain a healthy unit economics as we scale locations across these categories. In addition to our SMB market segment, which is our largest share -- which is the largest share of the market and remains the biggest driver of net adds. We continue to see growth in our mid-market segment, including brands such as Wetzel's Pretzels, The 99, Dirty Dough, Romano's Macaroni Grill, that have joined Toast for the past year. Let me highlight what FSR went from the quarter. Urban Prime marketplace and restaurant honored by Chef Ercan Ekinci in Florida opened in October. Urban Prime is an upscale FSR with large indoor and outdoor dining areas, as well as the broader market featuring a butcher shop, sushi and wine. After extensive research, Urban Prime selected Toast to consolidate their business across their thriving restaurant and gourmet market and are leveraging our POS terminals, Toast handle devices, pitch-display systems, online ordering, gift cards and marketing.  Using our restaurant's retail product, they were able to consolidate POS systems across their restaurant, end markets to simplify their front and back office operations and consolidate all the ride streams into a single back end. In addition, they've also recently switched to Toast payroll to further streamline and simplify their business. It's great to see Urban Prime expand with Toast and refer several restaurants to Toast. Our second priority is driving ARR and ARPU by building products and experiences our customers love. To complement our strong location growth, we are laser-focused on increasing ARR at scale. In 2023, we grew total ARR 35% year-over-year. We believe there is runway in our existing markets to continue to scale locations while also increasing blast and fintech ARR to product innovation, pricing and our continued investment in upselling existing customers through our growth sales team. [Indiscernible] product attach rates is an import of ARPU, many of our existing products have plenty of runway to scale and our product teams continue to act on customer feedback to enhance and expand their terminal attack potential across our customer base. New customers, earlier this month, we rolled out simpler product packaging that will enable our new business reps to maximize initial product attach and ARPU, while benchmark strong location growth. And for existing customers, price adjustments is a new lever that we're looking to build into our ongoing ARPU strategy. We'll take a holistic approach across both SaaS and Fintech, and you should see progress from us in 2024 that we build on moving forward. One customer that has extended and adopted more of the platform is Angelo's Ristorante in Massachusetts. Angelo's is a classic Italian Eatery half fine dining, half tea cafeteria with joint Toast. On a busy Friday night, Angelo's may send 40 to 50 tickets of kitchen in the short 15-minute period. And to support this volume, they're when looking for a new POS. After looking at 10 different systems, they chose Toast because we estimate their needs. Since joining Toast, Angelo's SaaS ARR has almost doubled. Angelo, the restaurant owner has worked closely with us to add more products to grow revenue, including online ordering, catering events and Toast Tables. With Toast Tables, Angelo's host can more efficiently manage stable table turnover and bring in more reservations. As a new payroll customer this year, Angelo is excited about the timing and cost savings we've seen so far. So, shifting to our next priority. Our third priority is expanding our TAM by launching and scaling new growth vectors. To complement our success across restaurants, our product team is hard at work to make Toast an even better fit across enterprise, hotel restaurants and international markets. Last week, we announced an agreement with Choice Hotels. Toast will be the brand standard for Cambria and Radisson Hotels as well as a qualified vendor for other choice brands. Cambria and Radisson will leverage the best of the Toast platform, including Toast Online Ordering, Mobile Order & Pay, Kiosk and Toast Payments to support the different dining options across their properties. We are also thrilled to welcome Caribou Coffee to Toast. They chose us to maximize speed of service across their coffee shops and partner with a scalable restaurant platform to support their expansion plans. And internationally, I'm excited to share that we meet at 1,000 locations as of the fourth quarter. The team has worked hard to establish the Toast brand in parts of Canada, the UK and Ireland using the same localized go-to-market approach that has worked domestically. The customer reception in these markets has been terrific, and it reminds me what we saw here in the US in the early days. As more of our platform is available at international markets, online ordering, guest marketing and reservations, we expect to drive higher ARPU and further improve our payback trajectory and margins. This is a priority in 2024. We're confident that as the enterprise and international markets represent a significant growth opportunity for Toast. Additionally, we're also looking to leverage our differentiated go-to-market engine, our all-in-one platform and our growing scale open up new opportunities for us. We're seeding investments in new parts of the TAM where we believe our market position provides a competitive advantage. Restaurant retail is a good example of this, and these nascent initiatives should further complement our growth potential over the long-term. Next, our fourth priority is setting up the company to operate and scale to deliver ongoing leverage. In 2023, we grew ARR 35% and adjusted EBITDA to $61 million, which was a $175 million improvement year-over-year. Our progress shows the scalability of our business as we balance growth and profitability. As we continue to grow, we're committed to the ambitious priorities I laid out above as well as delivering increased operating leverage, including GAAP operating income profit by the first half of 2025. This effort includes managing our stock-based compensation expense with the same discipline that we approach all our expense lines. Additionally, as we start to scale free cash flow, our capital allocation approach will evolve. This includes prioritizing organic investments in areas we have signal and conviction that we can grow, looking at M&A if we see the right opportunities and returning capital to our shareholders. To support this, our Board has approved a $250 million share repurchase authorization, which we will leverage opportunistically based on market conditions. We plan to regularly evaluate and optimize our capital allocation priorities and we will do so with a disciplined and transparent approach. All right. To wrap-up, I want to leave you with a few points that I covered today. We have a large opportunity ahead and have built the foundation to capitalize on it. As we execute our playbook to deliver continued market share gains in our core business, we will invest in parallel and leverage our strengths to open up additional TAM and build new growth curves. We will sustain ARPU and ARR growth through a combination of product attach and pricing, and we're confident we have a scalable business model, and we'll continue to balance growth and profitability. I want to thank all our toasters including those who will be leaving us for your dedication and contribution to test. As I said earlier, this week is a tough week. But I'm confident that we will move past this and over time, build a stronger Toast. I also want to thank our customers for entrusting us to support this incredible community. And I want to thank our shareholders for believing in us and the potential in this business. Thank you and now I'll turn it over to Elena. Sure. Thanks, Will. I'll start by saying, if you look at pricing, it's an important lever for us, but we plan to use it gradually as part of a broader strategy. We've been at this for over a decade, and we're continuing to invest in our restaurant-specific platform, to help restaurant's drive. And I think our customers understand that we continue to invest in this platform that we will increase prices over time. If you look at our new customers that are joining our platform, they're paying us more across both SaaS and fintech. And over time, we expect that existing customers, we will make those adjustments gradually, and it's going to be a lever that we'll use over time. Operator, we'll take the next question. Yes. Thanks Harshita. Look, we've seen continue to see fairly balanced between new opening existing restaurants. Post-COVID, we saw a bit of tailwind from new restaurants, but that hasn't tailed off in any material way. I'd also just say, if you zoom out, we've been at this for over a decade. And we're the first to build this vertically innovative restaurant-specific platform, and we'll continue to invest. And what we see is across both existing restaurants and new restaurants, we see our sales team able to continue to create market share across both. This is across FSRs and QSRs. And so even in a world where there's some movement in terms of the number of new openings, and we're confident in our ability to continue to gain share. Yes. I'm happy, Tien-Tsin. Thanks for the question. I'll repeat what I just said. If you think about our mission. We've been at this for 12 years now. And we were the first ones to build a platform that was purpose-built for the restaurant industry. And the team is continuing to invest to make it accessible across all restaurants, right, starting in the US and over time globally. If you look in the near-term, like SMBs continue to drive the majority of our growth, and we see a lot of -- as we gain share. We've talked about how as we get into markets, I talked about this in my prepared remarks. We see more and more markets getting into [Indiscernible] state, which is markets that have over 20% share. And then we're also expanding our products to go after the broader TAM, starting with the US TAM, and enterprise market as well as mid-market and DSMB and then in international markets as well. The impact to GPV as we expand the TAM should be minimal and gradual. Our average location, we expect will continue to remain above industry averages. And as we mentioned, like this year, we expect ARPU to continue to grow in 2024 to complement our location growth and be a vector of growth. And the team is very focused on making sure that as we get into new parts TAM, there are looking at payback periods to make sure that we're help getting economics across the broader TAM. Sure. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Yes. Look, we're seeing -- one of the things we just rolled out was pricing and packaging 3.0, the new version, and it's really helping our new business reps optimize with location growth, as well as maximizing our ARPU upfront, and we're balancing that with our upsell team that we're continuing to scale. In terms of the product attach rates, there's nothing that's fundamentally changed. We're seeing healthy growth across our employee cloud products, our fintech products, our guest products. And the R&D team continue to focus on getting customer feedback as we continue to scale locations to see what are ways in which we can increase terminal attach in terms of expanding the product market fit for these products. But we continue to see healthy growth across the portfolio of products that we offer. Thanks Tien-Tsin. Operator, we'll take the next one. Yes. Thanks for the question Sheldon. I mean, I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, but even in our markets where we have the highest SMB patient, this is over 30%. We're still seeing some of the strongest rep productivity and some of the strongest conversion in productivity. I think a lot of that is driven by just the social proof as we make more customers successful in these markets. We continue to see strong growth. So, we haven't seen any change in terms of the rate at which customers are joining our platform as we get more share in these local markets. The only thing I'll add in those markets, we see tremendous potential for growth, right? It's still in the early days of I think what's possible. The reception received from these customers in these markets is very similar to what we saw in the U.S. or early days, and we want to make sure that we're able to get these markets to a great spot before we think about expanding beyond that. Thank you. Sure. Thanks for the question. Look, I think we mentioned this in our last earnings call as well. Our -- as we optimize our land and expand motion, the new customers that are joining Toast, our sales team is optimizing the number of locations as well as the product attach rate. And so the ARPU is slightly lower. And then that's complemented with our upsell team. The upsell team then takes Toast teams that are regionalized that take over and are looking to drive attach rates across the product portfolio. I think if you look at, if you just zoom out for a second and think about the growth potential in the business, we're confident in our ability to continue to drive sustained ARR growth across both locations and ARPU. And I think -- and we believe both of those will complement each other. And so I think over time, as we continue to improve the capabilities across our product portfolio and improve our pricing and packaging and our upsell motion, there should be continued levers of growth for us into the future. Yes, I think that's fair. I think that's fair. I think you think of pricing as a gradual lever, right, that complements both locations and price. Thank you. Go ahead Samad. I was just going to say, if you look at our business, the bulk of our net adds continue to come from our core SMB business, right? We've got -- we reach 1,000 locations over a couple of years. And as we build out the full platform internationally and see the improvements in our activities and unit economics, that's where we look at the pedal down even further. And so in terms of any changes to our mix across GPV and ARPU, you shouldn't expect that to be material in the short-term. Yes. Hey Josh, thanks for the question. As I mentioned earlier, like we have -- SMBs continue to drive the majority of our growth, and we see tremendous runway there. I think as we look at, in fact, a lot of the growth and expansion into restaurant retail was driven by our existing restaurants. Many of them also offer markets and grocery and wine and wanted a single platform across all these businesses. I think we do think that the GPV and ARPU potential in these businesses is stronger. But in terms of, you just zoom out and think about what's driving the bulk of our net adds, it's going to continue to be SMBs and over time, mid-market enterprise and international and then beyond that, retail, that's on retail. Yes. I think so over time. Like if you just zoom out and think about our capabilities that we offer. We started in the restaurant vertical by building this purpose-built platform, that's exclusively built, and that's really what's allowed us to fail and gain market share to being one of the market leaders. As we think beyond this and expand the platform and the portfolio of products that we offer and the go-to-market engine that we have and the customer success engine that we have, we certainly think there's opportunity for us to expand beyond, but our focus right now is really in markets where food to serve, right? That's really, you're seeing these lines between restaurants and retail blur. And a lot of these concepts want a single system because they want a single back end that they can use, in fact all of this data, and that's where we're starting. Yes. Thanks for the question, Darrin. Look, we're proud of the team's progress over the past year with new brands like, if you just look at Choice and Caribou, which I talked about in my prepared remarks. Marriott in expansion with existing like Nothing Bundt Cakes and MTY. Just we start investing in enterprise business just a couple of years ago. It's really great to see the progress we've made in a short period of time. And we're also seeing really good health pipeline and inbound requests from customers. But you got to keep in mind, these are enterprise customers, these are long cycles, and we want to be balanced also in terms of which customers we partner with, does not distract our R&D teams where a single customer has custom work that can take over product roadmaps. In terms of some of the capabilities in ARPU, I think -- it starts by building out some of the core capabilities, enterprise config management, publishing security, compliance, data APIs. And over time, like if you look at the reasons SMB choose Toast, all the platform capabilities in terms of in-store and things like handheld, for example, mobile order and pay and kiosk. We believe over time, a lot of those will be applicable in the enterprise market as well. But you should expect this to be a gradual continued momentum upmarket as we expand TAM as opposed to a step function change in terms of how we're gaining share. Yes. Look, I think this has always been a competitive market, right from day 1 when we started this business, and we continue to believe what we see in our data is as we execute and get into more of the markets, restaurants are still local. And the more share we get, the more social proof we have, the more the flywheel effect it creates. That's the most important trend that we see in our business. Our team obviously is tracking at win rates and competitive dynamics in the market. But that's really -- if you think of -- we've been at this for so long, and it's really -- we've built this vertically integrated platform and expanded it over time, and that's just really driving our growth. than anything else. Thank you. Yes. Thanks Dominic for the question. Look, as I said earlier, it's the last step then and look at the business, I think -- it's important to remember, pricing is an important lever, but it's one lever. And we want to make sure we're using it gradually as part of a broader strategy. One of the focus areas we continue to gain market share on scale is to look at opportunities where to continue to expand the terminal attach rates of the product that we have to drive ARPU is a really important driver of ARPU. In terms of the opportunity, specifically in pricing, you look at new customers that are joining our platform, what we see is across both SaaS payments, they're paying us more than our base. And so we do see opportunity over time to go back and build it as an ongoing lever as part of our growth algorithm to complement in location growth as well as product attached. And I think you should think, you should expect that to be gradual over time, starting with fintech this year and then SaaS in the out years. Yes. As I said earlier, a lot of this was driven by our customer base. You've got our customers really pull us into these hybrid restaurant retail concepts because more and more of them offer not just the restaurant environment, but also they may offer packaged goods in a market, they may offer grocery, wine and so these lines are blurring. And the way our team thinks about, it is anywhere food to serve, we think that our platform that we built over the past decades offers us an opportunity to go create increments value for those customers and so we're starting there. And then I think over time, we'll look at where else Toast can be applicable. Thank you. Yes. Thank you everybody for your time today."

            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "Thank you, Aman and to everyone for joining. I'd like to thank all of our testers for their hard work and commitments, including those we are saying goodbye today. Organizational changes like these are hard though this is a necessary step to streamline how we operate and position us to go faster to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. In 2023, we showed our ability to balance durable growth and profitability. For the year, Toast processed over $125 billion in payment volume, up 38%. ARR grew 35% and total fintech and subscription gross profit, our recurring gross profit streams increased 49% for the year. And we are efficiently scaling the business and driving cost discipline, delivering adjusted EBITDA of $61 million, a 6% margin on our recurring gross profit stream, 22 percentage points better than 2022. Over the past two years, we've embedded durable efficient growth out of a principle of how we operate the business. The midpoints of our 2024 guidance at 24% growth in our recurring gross profit streams and $210 million in adjusted EBITDA reinforces this and puts us on track for GAAP operating income profitability by the first half of 2025. As you heard from Aman, we are still in the early stages of our growth potential and committed to maintain the same approach as we lean into the growth opportunity and continue to scale. The three main areas I want to cover today are our fourth quarter results, our guidance and the impact of our restructuring lens, and our capital allocation approach, including the $250 million share repurchase program we announced today. Starting with our fourth quarter results. We added over 6,500 net locations, increasing our total locations to approximately 106,000, up 34% year-over-year. SaaS ARR grew 43% year-over-year, driven by the strong location growth and a 7% base in SaaS ARPU as we lean into our customer acquisition momentum and balance ARPU growth. Our SaaS net retention rate remained in a healthy range at 117% led by solid contributions from upsell and location expansion from existing customers. Fourth quarter payments ARR grew 28% and fintech gross profit increased 29%. Fourth quarter GPV is 32% to $33.7 billion, and GPV per location declined modestly year-over-year, in line with our expectations and consistent with the trend exiting the third quarter. As a reminder, fourth quarter GPV relocation is seasonally lower than the third quarter, and payment ARR reflects the same seasonality. Net take rate was 52 basis points in the quarter. Our non-payment fintech solutions led by Toast Capital, contributed $34 million in gross profit in Q4, reflecting steady healthy demand. We continue to take a balanced approach to growing Toast Capital and our unique position with real-time access to POS data allows us to monitor the health of restaurants and prudently balanced risk while helping our customers grow as fast, flexible access to capital. ARR remains our North Star. As Aman laid out, our two growth vectors, locations in ARPU, we have multiple levers to sustain healthy ARR growth over time. We will prioritize the highest value locations to extend our success in this segment of the market. At the same time, the breadth of our integrated platform and ongoing product innovation, opens up the entire restaurant TAM to us and we plan to catalyze or that opportunity to drive further share gains. As we expand, we will remain grounded in unit economics and will tightly manage payback periods across the portfolio to ensure we drive incremental profit as we scale our locations. In 2023, our dollar-based payback period was 14 months, in line with our target for the quarter and an improvement from 2022 to even as we expanded into more parts of the hand and increased our international investment. In fintech, our long-term growth drivers for increasing core net take -- take rate remain, driving towards lowest cost per transit leveraging our unique customer relationships to provide additional fintech solutions. We anticipate SaaS ARPU growth to be in mid-single digits over the near-term, driven by increasing attach and pricing. Across both SaaS and fintech, pricing is a lever that we will use methodically to monetize value we provide customers. As Aman discussed, this is a capability we are building to be an ongoing part of our growth algorithm over time. Turning to our expenses, we manage hardware and services as customer acquisition costs and provide these on a discounted basis to offer an easy, low friction on-ramp for customers. Q4 hardware and services gross margin improved 19 percentage points compared to last year, primarily reflecting lower shipping costs and ongoing operational efficiencies. Sales and marketing expenses increased 18% year-over-year in Q4 as we continue to invest in our upsell and international sales team and make targeted investments in our US new business team to drive deeper penetration. Sales and marketing as a percentage of our recurring gross profit streams improved by 400 basis points in Q4 relative to last year. Our go-to-market motion is a competitive differentiator and an important part of our ability to efficiently scale the business, enabling us to sustain healthy ARR growth while moderating investments in sales and marketing. R&D expenses grew 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our product investments are aligned with our priorities to serve more of the TAM to expand ARPU by increasing the addressability of our products and serving more of our customers' needs and to see longer term growth initiatives. Complementing these priorities is an emphasis on delivering best-in-class customer experiences and building scalable, resilient infrastructure to support hundreds of thousands of locations. G&A expenses grew 5% year-over-year in the quarter, excluding $20 million of bad debt and credit-related expenses primarily related to reserves for Toast Capital, G&A was up 3%. That's a result of our ongoing efficiency efforts and prudently managing overhead expense. Adjusted EBITDA was $29 million in the quarter, the 10% margin on our recurring gross profit streams marked a 19 percentage point improvement from Q4 last year, driven by the combination of continued strong topline growth and operating leverage as we efficiently scale the business. Free cash flow totaled $81 million in the quarter and $93 million for the full year. We converted over 100% of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow with working capital benefiting from stronger GPV trends in December. Over time, we anticipate the trajectory of free cash flow to broadly mirror adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow is typically lower in the first quarter each year due to seasonality of our payments business and the timing of cash bonus payments and this year in Q1 will also include severance payments. Given these factors, we expect free cash flow to be negative in Q1, then accelerate as the year progresses. In terms of the restructuring we announced today, we anticipate recognizing $45 million to $55 million in restructuring and related charges for the year, with most of it falling in Q1. In total, we expect over $100 million in annualized savings, including stock-based compensation from the restructuring and lower hiring. We will reinvest a portion of savings into our highest conviction growth initiatives. Our 2024 topline guidance is for the combination of subscription and fintech non-GAAP gross profit, our recurring gross profit streams which is the P&L metric that most closely aligns with ARR. In Q1, we expect 22% topline growth and $20 million in adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint. This reflects slower GPV trends in January due to weather headwinds across many parts of the country. GPV has stabilized over the past few weeks, and we continue to closely monitor. Net location as in 2024 will follow the typical seasonal pattern, we expect a lower Q1 similar to Q1 last year in the 5,500 range, then location adds will peak in Q2 as restaurants prepare for busy season. More broadly, with a healthy pipeline, consistent go-to-market execution and increasing contribution from new segments as the year progresses, we are well positioned to add more locations to our platform in 2024 than last year. On a full year basis, the $210 million midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects a nearly $150 million improvement and margin expansion of 10 percentage points relative to 2023. As we drive efficiency and increase profitability, we'll prudently invest in our highest priority growth areas, including product innovation and our go-to-market engine. In addition, we will continue to invest in longer term initiatives where we have conviction like international expansion and enterprise as well as plant seeds and newer initiatives where we see a clear right to win to expand our market opportunity and extend our growth potential. Stock-based compensation is an area we're managing with the same rigor and discipline as other expenses. Through a combination of disciplined headcount management, including the restructuring plan announced today, changes to equity granting practices and the roll-off of large grants made in 2021 and 2022 over the next couple of years, our goal is for stock-based comp to decline from 27% in 2023 to low double-digits as a percentage of our recurring gross profit streams over the medium term. Managing our equity program will also improve dilution. We are committed to maintaining net share dilution of total fully diluted share count, which includes all stock awards to below 2% annually. With the combination of continued adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and leverage in our stock-based compensation, we are on track for GAAP operating income profit by the first half of 2025. Lastly, let me turn to capital allocation. As our free cash flow profile grows, our capital allocation strategy will evolve. Our top priority continues to be investing organically in our business to drive sustainable long-term growth. Even as we strategically invest, we are committed to driving increasing free cash flow. With excess free cash flow, we will evaluate M&A. So we will hold a high bar given the strong organic growth outlook, and we're adding the option to return capital to shareholders to our capital allocation tool kit with a $250 million share repurchase authorization. We do not have a timetable on repurchases and will act judiciously and opportunistically. We plan to regularly optimize across these priorities to do what's best for the business at any given time. We will always optimize for long-term shareholder value. To wrap-up, we are executing across the board, growing our location count, driving value for our customers, seeding new longer term growth initiatives and positioning the company to operate fast and nimble going forward. We are planning to host an Analyst Day during the second quarter where we will put deeper into our business and share more about our market opportunity and strategy. I'm incredibly excited about what lies ahead for Toast. Thank you. And now I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Yes. And I can -- Will, you had the question about SaaS and is that an ending point over the course of the year, and we expect it to be in that range over the course of the year. Yes. Thanks Will for the question. So, at the highest level, we're really pleased with the performance of Toast Capital and customer demand has been really steady and default rates are in line with our expectations to, really confident in the program overall. We did launch the 360 program last year. Now, we've lapped that. So, we're more in a steady state, I would say, in the business but still seeing healthy demand. And I would expect over this course of this year, it will grow more in line with the rest of the business. But we'll scale it prudently, as you mentioned. And then over the longer term, I think we have an opportunity to continue to evolve and offer more fintech solutions to our customers. But for now, we're going to focus on optimizing this program. It's working well. I'll cover the first question. I didn't hear clearly the second question so we may ask you to repeat it if that's okay. On the take rate question, take rate in Q4 was 52 basis points, 10 basis points of that is related to Toast Capital. Our core take rate was 42 basis points. And so that -- and that was -- there were some customer credits in that take rate. Nothing structural to consider over the long-term. As we think about take rate over the next year, have that same seasonal pattern we do in Q1 where because of debit, it's higher. But as the year progresses, we should see it improve mostly because we're going to continue our cost optimization efforts, we'll have some surgical pricing that's planned in the latter half of the year. And then longer term, of course, as I will talk about, we always continue to optimize our take rate and drive it up steadily over time. And then your second question, do you mind repeating it? Yes, it's a good question. We are -- for the moment, we're really focused on the markets that we're in. We're still early in the early days there, and we've got -- we've been focusing on the go-to-market motion and honing that and building out the platform. So, we want to continue to focus there, but we'll update you should not change. But for the near-term, we're focused on the contributions that we've talked about, which is the UK, Canada, and Dublin. Yes, I mean I'd point you to our guidance. We're really confident in the guidance that we have, Dave, and it's reflecting if you think about the long-term guidance we've given out a few quarters ago, that's -- we have ambition to get to 30% to 35% long-term recurring gross profit growth. That was something we talked about over the long-term -- sorry, EBITDA margin. And so just keep that in mind, that continues to be our focus. And you see us tracking towards that based on the leverage you've seen in the business over the last several quarters and the guidance that we said today. So, our ambitions on EBITDA guidance haven't changed over the long-term. Yes, Q1 definitely is typically because of -- you'll see a higher impact. And then as the year progresses, it's not just we have a marginal in for some surgical putting in the second half of the year. But you'll continue to see us optimize cost, and that's just part of our normal mode of operating is really trying to optimize our cost structure over time. So both will play a role in the second half of the year. Yes. Thanks Samad for the question. So, first of all, as Aman said, we're really pleased with what we're seeing internationally. And we've really focused on the go-to-market motion. We've -- with our core platform, so we expect to add more elements to the platform. So, as a result of starting with the just the core elements of the platform. The ARPU is obviously lower. But as we add more to the platform, we should see it get closer to -- in the US. So, that's an opportunity for us. And even with platform we have, we've had a lot of great success. So we expect to add more of the platform in 2024. We'll see that play out over the next, obviously, several years in terms of the impact on ARPU. And in terms of the profile of customers, they don't look that different in the US. We terminated a lease. But just in general, when you zoom out, Samad, I want to make this very clear, like the restructuring is one of many efforts that we've -- have been working toward efficiency for several quarters, right? We delivered over $175 million of leverage this year. And we're going to continue on across the company to operate in a very disciplined fashion. So you shouldn't see this as a onetime effort on efficiency, but just how we run our business. Thanks everyone."

And with that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Comparato : Thank you, Michael. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. Our focus has been on delivering durable and efficient growth and our third results reflects execution on that objective. We added over 6,500 net locations in the quarter and ARR grew 40% year-over-year. We continue to balance top line growth with driving efficiencies, as we scale the business and adjusted EBITDA totaled $35 million in the quarter. The execution against our focused strategy to drive location growth serve all segments of the restaurant industry and bold product innovation to better serve our customers and open up new segments of the market is both driving strong results and has us well positioned to sustain this momentum going forward. As we announced in September, Aman will take over as the CEO at the start of 2024. Looking back over my nine years as CEO, I am incredibly proud of the accomplishments of the Toast team. Together, we have scale to serve nearly 100,000 restaurant locations with over 1.2 billion ARR. We've built a company culture with strong values and an employee base that embraces our customer-centric mission to be the trusted restaurant technology partner. At the same time, we've built a scalable, durable business, that's generating sustainable positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Our innovation mindset and our products have also expanded significantly over that time period, as we deliver on our mission. We've the brought in the types of restaurants that we serve and have made inroad across the entire US restaurant TAM. We have also evolved into a multiproduct platform company with solutions to help restaurants drive growth, build deeper connections and experiences with their guests and improve operations and manage their costs. Toast has been on this journey for over a decade and we proudly serve an industry that has navigated many ups and downs. There's no better example than over the last few years. Restaurant operators respond to unprecedented changes quickly expanding their service models to meet evolving consumer demands. Through it all, restaurants remain a central part of consumers' daily lives. More recently we've seen consumer spend moderate and I'm confident restaurants will navigate the uncertain macro environment with the same resiliency and tenacity they always do and this battle-tested industry will continue to thrive well into the future. Toast is side-by-side with our customers every step of the way and is often one step ahead helping restaurants adapt and thrive no matter the circumstance and we're just getting started. The SMB TAM remains a large opportunity for us. Enterprise restaurant groups are in the early days of adopting cloud technologies and a big international opportunity lies ahead. We are better positioned than ever before to expand and continue to build adjacent growth opportunities, as we capitalize on the generational opportunity to be the technology platform for restaurants and transform the industry. I've known Aman for 17 years having worked with him before I joined Toast. First and foremost as a co-founder of Toast, he brings a strong founder's mentality to the CEO seat where he will continue to raise the bar on execution and innovation. He intimately knows our customer base and has shaped much of the company through his many roles across the organization from open seeing product, to sales and customer success. So I'm confident that as Aman steps into the CEO role. He'll lead Toast to new successes and he is surrounded by the most talented leadership team that I've had the opportunity to work with across my career. To wrap up my last quarterly earnings call thank you to our Toasters and to our customers. We've accomplished a lot as a team the enthusiasm you bring to our mission sustains our momentum and I'm excited for what lies ahead. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aman.\nAman Narang: Thank you, Chris. Toast wouldn't be what it is today without your leadership and passion for the business our customers and of course our team. I think I speak for all Toasters in saying you'll be missed. And your friendship and support over the past 17 years that we've known each other has meant a lot to me personally. As Chris mentioned, we are excited about the opportunity ahead of us to grow the business and continue to be a great partner to the restaurant community. With just over 10% for the US market on Toast we have significant runway ahead of us. Our passion for this industry a strong focus on innovation to help restaurants drive and a world-class go-to-market and customer success team gives us confidence in our ability to drive sustained error growth while planning the seeds for future growth initiatives. We're incredibly happy with our performance in ARR. And the results represent strong momentum across our business. ARR was up 40% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, driven by strong execution across location acquisition and ARPU expansion. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow ARR across both these dimensions over the long term. Revenue increased 37% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA increased to a record $35 million in Q3. Toast had its sixth consecutive quarter exceeding the Rule of 40 measuring fintech and subscription gross profit growth our recurring revenue streams plus adjusted EBITDA margin. This consistent execution is a testament to our team, who have prioritized both revenue growth and operating leverage as the business has scaled. We added over 6,500 net locations in the quarter approximately 20% more than Q3 last year. Our local go-to-market approach continues to help drive strong momentum in our SMB business as we increase number of markets with high customer density and market tenant. While the SMB business is still the primary driver of location growth or making progress across the broader market opportunity as well. Let me share a few customer stories from the quarter that speak to this. The Mariana Restaurant Group switched its four full-serve restaurants in Massachusetts and New Hampshire to Toast and three of them are already live in Q3. They purchased nine products to help streamline their business across both front of house and back of house and noted the simplicity and ease of use of an integrated all-in-one solution. In addition to our core offerings they're also leveraging our newer platform capabilities including Toast Tables and catering and events. With Toast Tables they can more easily estimate guest wait times give visibility into -- how far a long the table is in its service help with seating guests evenly across service areas to help in the workloads keep them balanced. In addition the integration between Toast Tables and our employee scheduling product helps managers better staff throughout the week. Using our Catering & Events product they've also been able to streamline a manual pay dependent process with a digital-first approach. We're excited to work with Mariana Restaurant Group and support their growth plans over the coming years. In mid-market, we expanded our relationship with credit worthy brands and are excited to partner with them as they grow. We signed 50 locations across their multi-concept fast casual QSR portfolio for a total of 93 locations on Toast. And in enterprise we're thrilled to extend our relationship with Nothing Bundt Cakes. They became a customer in 2019 and currently have over 500 locations live on Toast. We've been working with them to increase productivity drive higher digital conversion and streamline processes for their corporate team. To support their expansion plans and franchisee count, we have signed an additional 300 location across Nothing Bundt Cakes and expanded the set of products available to their franchisee community, including employee scheduling payroll and catering. This expansion creates an opportunity to double the Nothing Bundt Cakes associate ARR over time and we're excited to partner and support their growth plans. Shifting gears to products. We're focused on building products both to help our customers thrive and run a great business. Our vertical focus on restaurant continues to be an advantage as we open up deeper parts of the TAM and expand ARPU by building differentiated products for the industry. Product innovation has always been foundational in Toast DNA and you should expect us to maintain that focus moving forward. Last week, we announced Toast Now app for restaurant operators that provide bill time insight into performance data allows operators to manage the kitchen volume adjust menus and communicate with staff on the go on their mobile device. This is something our customers have been asking for and allows building deep and deeper connections from operators. We are pleased with the early adoption levels with approximately 20% of locations already on Toast Now a week after its launch. In addition we recently announced Toast for Cafes & Bakeries similar to Toast for Hotel restaurants and Toast for Quick Service. We're building solutions for different restaurant types that better serve deeper parts of the TAM. Toast for Cafe & Bakeries brings together product capabilities geared to help coffee shops and bakeries grow revenue speed up service and create more repeat guests. Cafes & bakeries serve a variety of customer needs, from a regular morning coffee to launch catering or an on-the-go snack. It is a segment of the market that we're excited about and represents a meaningful growth opportunity for Toast. As part of the Cafe & Bakery launch, we also announced restaurant retail which provides unified restaurant and retail POS systems to manage retail SKUs. Things like wine selections or packaged coffee and more, directly within Toast providing a one-stop shop for customers to manage food service and retail together. We've seen rest embrace more service models especially during and post pandemic. And this is yet another example of our continuous focus on meeting the evolving needs of our customers. This is a good example, for how our product innovation can help serve deeper parts of the TAM drive incremental GPV through Toast and support ARPU growth. One customer I'd like to highlight is, 320 Market Caf\u00e9, a family owned gourmet market with two locations in Pennsylvania that includes the Pizzeria, a caf\u00e9, a retail area offering prepared foods craft beer and wine as well as the catering business. Before they joined Toast 320 took catering orders through e-mail and orders on paper which often got lost in the kitchen. And on the retail side, the process of adding a new retail SKU took over 20 minutes. This slowed down their ability to serve guests and generate revenue. Now with Toast, 320 Market Caf\u00e9, of course a growing business with quicker inventory management, faster checkouts and a way to take catering orders digitally all in a single integrated platform. They can now tag a new product and have it on the retail for minutes to track sales data in real time, and take down their corporate of paper catering orders in a digital system -- in place of a digital system and manage them from anywhere. With catering, retail, online ordering, gift cards and more, 320 Market Caf\u00e9 has up-leveled their business with Toast and saved their employees about eight hours per week of manual work equivalent to a whole shift. As we continue to broaden our products for our go-to-market team to serve a variety of customers types and pinpoints. Our upsell team becomes increasingly important to drive growth for the adoption of our platform across our customer base. As we approach 100,000 locations and beyond our upsell teams can get bigger, and we continue to see this as a big opportunity for growth in our business over time. To wrap up as Chris mentioned, we're excited about the opportunity in front of us. We are focused on being a strong partner to our restaurant community and we are well positioned to drive sustained area of growth in the future while building an efficient and durable business that can generate long-term value for customers and shareholders. As I think about the opportunity ahead of us, I'm energized and motivated by the momentum we have. It goes about saying, that none of this will be possible without the tireless efforts of our employees. A special thank you to all Toasters. I'm excited to lead this group of talented individuals as we transform the restaurant industry. And with that thank you and I'll pass it off to Elena.\nElena Gomez: Thanks, Aman and thank you, everyone for joining. I also want to thank our incredible employees for another quarter of great work. Our team continues to execute at a high level, driving 40% growth at over $1 billion in ARR and delivering significant margin expansion. With a differentiated business model, scalable go-to-market engine and innovative all-in-one platform, we're well positioned to continue driving efficient growth at scale going forward. The 40% increase in ARR was on the back of strong location growth and continuing ARPU expansion translating to 37% year-over-year revenue growth. Our recurring gross profit streams fintech and subscription totaled $280 million, up 39% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $35 million, representing a margin of 13% on our recurring gross profit streams with over 22 percentage points of margin improvement year-over-year. Growth in our recurring gross profit streams and adjusted EBITDA margin are the basis for how we calculate Rule of 40 and this marks the sixth consecutive quarter we exceeded the Rule of 40. We sustained our go-to-market momentum in Q3, adding over 6,500 net locations. That was primarily driven by the flywheel effect from our localized go-to-market motion. As rep tenure and local market share increase, so has rep productivity, contributing to a solid year-over-year increase in SMB restaurant location adds. Our goal has always been to serve the entire restaurant TAM over time. We are increasingly making progress across supplementing our momentum in SMB with incremental growth both up and down market and internationally resulting in sustained location growth of over 30%, even as we approach 100,000 locations. Our primary focus remains on the core SMB segment. As we broadened and deepened penetration across the TAM including smaller SMB customers, enterprise customers and expanding internationally, our customer mix will evolve and have different SaaS and GPV dynamics. Our focus is to maximize ARR growth, which is our North Star metric, while maintaining the same healthy unit economics overall all. We plan to manage the portfolio to the same payout in the mid-teens, number of months, ensuring that growth is efficient as we expand and drive incremental profit. In the third quarter, SaaS ARR grew 47% year-over-year, driven by strong location growth and a 9% increase in SaaS ARPU. We're capitalizing on the location acquisition momentum we have while continuing to balance ARPU growth. We plan to exit Q4 with SaaS ARPU growth in the mid- to high single digits reflecting lower ARPU for new go-live cohorts, as we continue to optimize our upfront sales to balance sustained location growth velocity, as well as some impact from mix shift. Our long-term growth algorithm remains the same. We have a long runway to increase ARR through both locations and ARPU with just over 10% of US restaurant locations on the platform, a proven differentiated SMB go-to-market motion and growing traction across the full breadth of restaurant segments, as well as green shoots internationally, we're well positioned stained healthy growth location for years to come. Similarly as we scale customer count, we have conviction in our ability to drive healthy SaaS ARPU growth over the long-term through pricing and packaging, scaling and refining our upsell motion and delivering ongoing product innovation to enhance the customer value proposition. Moving to FinTech Solutions, on a year-over-year basis third quarter revenue and gross profit both grew 36% to $856 million and $182 million, respectively. GPV increased 4% to $33.7 billion, an average annualized GPV per processing location was down slightly year-over-year. Similar to Q2, the year-over-year change in GPV per processing location was impacted as we lap the inflation tailwind and from a slight mix shift as we extended to more segments of the TAM. In addition in the back half of the third quarter, we saw a modest slowdown in same-store transaction volume which resulted in a decline in GPV per-processing location in the quarter. Trends have remained stable since then. Given the broader macro environment remains mixed, we finance for GPV trends to remain at current levels in the near-term and for GPV per processing locations decline year-over-year in Q4. On non-payment FinTech solutions led by Toast Capital, contributed $34 million in gross profit in the quarter as demand for the offering remains healthy and default rates remain steady. We continue to take a balanced approach to growing Toast Capital and our unique position with real-time access to POS data allows us to monitor the health of restaurants and prudently balance risk, while helping our customers grow with fast, flexible access to capital. Net take rate was 54 basis points. Core net take rate was 44 basis points with other FinTech products contributing 10 basis points. This quarter included a one-time cost accrual true-up while the prior year benefited from a credit. Absent those onetime impacts, core take rate was approximately flat year-over-year. In Q4 we anticipate core and total net take rate to be in a similar range on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Turning to customer acquisition costs, Hardware revenue increased year-over-year due to both location ads and existing customers adding more hardware. Hardware margins improved year-over-year, primarily due to lower shipping costs. On the sales and marketing side expenses grew 17% year-over-year. We're making targeted investments in our go-to-market team and continuing to grow our upsell team, while staying focused on maintaining healthy unit economics and driving operating leverage. We manage our customer acquisition costs using a dollar-based payback period which takes into account the incremental recurring gross profit across both new business and upsell. Payback periods remain within our targeted level of mid-teen months for the portfolio. Shifting to R&D, our Toast for Cafes & Bakeries launch including the restaurant retail offering is another example of leveraging product investments to drive deeper location penetration by super serving the unique needs of our different customers. It also highlights how our product innovation locks more revenue streams for customers and drives incremental transaction volume for Toast -- through Toast. G&A grew 12% year-over-year in the third quarter. Excluding $19 million of bad debt and credit-related expenses in the quarter, primarily related to reserves Toast capital G&A was flat year-over-year. We've seen meaningful leverage in G&A, as a result of our focus on efficiency and disciplined head count management. Excluding bad debt and credit-related expenses G&A as a percentage of our recurring gross profit streams was 16% in the quarter a 600 basis point improvement year-over-year and we expect to continue driving operating leverage on our overhead cost going forward. In total, adjusted EBITDA was $35 million in Q3 and margin as a percentage of our recurring gross profit streams increased to 13%, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. That's a result of our healthy top line growth and diligence in efficiently scaling the business. Overall, we expect to continue building operating leverage as we march towards the long-term target margins we previously laid out. Free cash flow was $37 million in Q3, roughly in line with our adjusted EBITDA. As a reminder, working capital will fluctuate based on GPV and timing of payments. But over time free cash flow should largely follow a similar trajectory as adjusted EBITDA trends. Now let me turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.03 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $5 million to $15 million. In addition to the seasonally lower GPV per location in Q4, the sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter also reflects our expectation for slower year-over-year GPV growth and investments we're making to strengthen our position heading into 2024. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue to grow 41% at the midpoint of our guidance and now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $38 million to $48 million, representing an approximately $160 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA versus last year at the midpoint. To wrap up, we are extremely proud of the work that the Toast has accomplished thus far in 2023. We're scaling the business in a durable manner as we capitalize on the opportunity ahead of us to build a generate business that delivers significant value to our customers and shareholders. And we are well-positioned to continue delivering long-term growth while driving operating leverage throughout the business and executing on this long-term opportunity that remains ahead of us. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tim Chiodo with UBS. Your line is now open.\nTim Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. I want to touch on your thoughts on your ability or potential to take pricing within the core subscription portion of the business. So with a few competitors that have taken pricing in different ways over the past year or so Square, Clover, Shopify and others. I was hoping you could give us an update on where you think you stand in terms of that potential? Thank you.\nAman Narang: Thanks for the question Tim. I'll start by saying customers as we said in previous calls, our customers understand that product innovation requires investment and that prices will increase over time. We'll see it as our new customers that are coming at Toast are coming out at higher pricing. And we've also looked at the distribution curve across our customer base in terms of what they're paying across both SaaS and payments, and see opportunity there. And so we're confident that we can drive and increased pricing over time. We also see opportunity in terms of how we package our products across both software and fintech and see that as an important lever as well to drive ARPU and price. We're also aware that we're -- if you look at the opportunity in front of us to gain market share at both locations and target at rates, we want to make sure that we're offering transparent value-based pricing to our customers. So I think in the long-term we're confident in our ability to increase prices and we're working through it.\nTim Chiodo: Great. Thank you. And the brief follow-up is just more of a numbers question around fintech take rate. So I believe that the gross take rate ex-capital would have been up slightly maybe one basis point year-over-year. And you mentioned that some of the accruals and what not that if we would normalize it the net take rate was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. Could just talk about looking forward the potential to see a little bit more of leverage on the fintech COGS line maybe whether it be with payment processors or some of the other non-payments-related items in there whether it be support or data center or other costs that are in the fintech COGS line? Thank you.\nElena Gomez: Yes. Thanks, Tim. It's a fair question. Look I think over the long-term we have an opportunity to gradually increase our core take rate either through investing in our payments infrastructure and just driving operational excellence as we're trying to drive down cost per transaction. And that's both working with our partners and negotiating. And then there's \u2013 obviously, we can impact the price of course that's also at our disposal. And then just leveraging our scale as we get bigger I think we'll have -- we'll be in a position to negotiate even further. So I think there's an opportunity both on the pricing side of things but also as we optimize our cost start over time.\nTim Chiodo: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Your line is now open. \nStephen Sheldon: Hi. Thanks. And first congrats on all of you accomplished it to help Chris and congrats to Aman as well on taking over as CEO. Just on the guidance it seems a slight sequential step down in revenue in the fourth quarter versus the number you just put up in the third quarter. And I think you said that's mainly GPV per location that's expected to be down some. So can you just talk about how much of that may be normal seasonality in restaurant revenue versus weakening consumer spending if you have any visibility into that?\nElena Gomez: Yes, sure. So most of it Stephen -- it's a fair question. So the GPV pre location which I commented in the script is really something we saw late in September and continuing into October. So that was the primary calculus. But also remember seasonally GPV is GPV per location is lower in Q4. So both of those factors played a role, but the reason -- the primary reason is the trends we're seeing most recently in same-store sales.\nStephen Sheldon: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the sales force investments you're making. I guess do you need to keep adding significantly to the sales force to keep location growth when you think about sequential additions of last quarters you have to keep adding sales headcount to keep location growth or in recent quarters? And maybe talk about the mix of investments you're making there between new location wins and maybe the upside.\nAman Narang: Yes. Good question, Stephen. Look I think if you look year-over-year our net location adds are up 20%. And so a lot of our investment in sales and marketing are cold with that. And back to what Elena mentioned in terms of making sure that we're tracking towards the vectors. I think we're trying to be strategic in terms of where we see opportunity to invest whether it's on new business or it's an upsell to continue to gain market share and continue to grow the business. But we're always trying to be balanced in terms of making sure that we're managing to economics across the board. There are some new areas we're investing in. We've talked about before whether it's upmarket in enterprise international right where we are still earlier. But overall I think the bulk of the growth in the business is coming through our core assets.\nElena Gomez: Yes, I would just add we're set up to have a strong Q4 and on track to our expectations. And to just build on what Aman said that consistent execution thanks to our sales team is really showing through and we've got a healthy pipeline as well. So, when you put that all together, I think we're going to continue that acquisition momentum into 2024 which will be a big driver of our ARR growth.\nStephen Sheldon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nWill Nance: I also wanted to ask a question on the subscription side or on the ARPU side. You made some comments related to the TPV per location maybe putting the macro stuff aside sounds like there's a little bit of mix shift going on. And if I'm interpreting that right it's kind of smaller locations coming on weighing down on GPV per location. Is there a similar trend playing out on the software ARPU per location i.e. like smaller location using less software? And I guess maybe in prior quarters you provided some color on sort of what front book ARPUs are looking like. Any color on where that's trending now? And then just your thoughts on how that progresses from here?\nElena Gomez: Yes, fair question. So, look our SMB remains our core at the highest level and our success in SMB is hopefully actually frankly more opportunities across the entire TAM. So, as we're leveraging our product innovation we're going after those opportunities. And we're seeing really good progress in segments like e-com or international, right? And so as we get into the segments and extended that TAM, we're going to see both different GPV and ARPU dynamics. But at the highest level, just kind of zooming out, ARR continues to be earnout from a trick. And we'll always see balancing location ARPU growth on an ongoing basis. And right now is a great example of us capitalizing on that location acquisition momentum. So, delivering $200 million in SaaS ARR year-over-year balancing those -- I think 2023 is a great example. To your question on the front book I'd actually reframe you back to ARR because as we're trying to optimize our land and expand motion and we've talked a lot about the upsell team. And as we're extending it to different parts of the TAM like I mentioned international e-com. The mix is less comparable than what we are a couple of quarters ago. So, for us our North Star and how we operate the business is really on ARR basically. And that's through and through. So -- and it's also just reflect our financial performance but also how the reps are comped rep goals are all around ARR goals. Our company bonus program is on ARR growth. So it's truly how we manage the business as well.\nWill Nance: Got it. That makes total sense. And then I guess just on the macro point. As we think about softening same-store sales which broadly consistent with other companies in the space. So, I kind of get that how are you thinking about the reaction function from merchants? I guess particularly on the go-to-market side as you have conversations with prospects. Is there -- how are you thinking about like the potential for some business to say hey we're going to take two handhelds instead of three maybe buy a little bit less hardware upfront things of that nature. I mean do you expect sort of like the initial sale to get more difficult in an environment where same-store sales are softening and any strategies you have to combat that?\nAman Narang: Well, we haven't seen that in our core SMB business. And as we mentioned in our guidance we talked about Q4 net location as being in 6,500 range and we continue to be confident in -- and if you look at on the top of funnel and our win rates we haven't seen anything materially different. And we continue to believe that our growth is really tied to our execution and getting more in our core SMB business into flywheel status, which is really just growing customer density growing the rep tenure in these markets. And so we haven't seen anything in our pipeline to suggest that customers are less receptive to purchasing Toast or looking to buy less of the platform.\nWill Nance: Got it. Super helpful. Appreciate you taking the questions.\nAman Narang: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you and all the best of Chris here. A follow-up to Will's question just on the Toast Capital side, if you haven't seen any customers changing their behavior here, are you changing maybe your appetite to extend credit given what you're seeing on the consumer moderation side?\nElena Gomez: Yes, it's a fair question Tien-Tsin. Thank you for the question. Our default rates have been in line with our expectations. And so -- and we're seeing healthy demand from our customers. So -- we don't have plans to change our program at the moment. It's a very healthy program and we're managing the risk very well and have a lot of controls in place around the program. That said, if the macro were to turn we also are confident in our ability to quickly move and throttle the originations if we needed to. But overall, the program is very healthy and meeting our expectations all the way around.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Great to hear. And if you don\u2019t mind, the competition question. It doesn't sound like it but -- we get a lot of questions around some of your competitors changing their strategies really to look a little bit more like those whether it's verticalizing or forcing payment monetization that kind of thing. Are you seeing any change in competitiveness at all on the ground?\nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Look, we've had -- we've built up a strong competitive program within the business as we track a lot of this data carefully. And I'll just go back to like this has always been a competitive market. And to what I just said earlier, we really do believe our growth is more tied to our own execution more than anything else. And we're tracking the pipeline every day. That being said, we're tracking pipeline the top of funnel win rates the activity of our team by competitor. And I think if you go back and just look at our confidence in terms of net adds in Q4. And it really just speaks to the performance of our go-to-market team and just the -- our own execution as a business.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Understood. That\u2019s fair. Thank you so much.\nAman Narang: Thanks, Tien-Tsin.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey. Thanks guys. So just on revenue, obviously, the growth rate here is still robust but we didn't see the kind of upside if you will that we've been accustomed to seeing on revenue from Toast. And you talked about some slower ARPU. You talked about some slowdown in same-store sales I mean maybe latter point. Can you quantify how much the same-store sales slowed down late in Q3? And just any other call-outs that you might have seen in the quarter parts of the business that perhaps weren't quite as strong as you might have envisioned?\nElena Gomez : Yes. So let me take your question sort of in the \u2013 there's lots in your question but \u2013 at the highest level, the guidance that you're seeing for the balance of the year really reflects the macro that we talked about so GPV per location coming down. In September, in particular, as we start to see that trend it's continuing into October. And so our guidance reflects the macro playing a role. But just zooming out the momentum in the business that we have exiting the year into Q4 still remains healthy regardless of the macro. So as we think about the next year, just give some color on that, we're growing healthy. We've got a great operating leverage story. So as we enter into 2024, we're going to go in with the same discipline, focus on growth and as well on cost discipline. And we've delivered healthy growth alongside driving this operating leverage over $160 million in a year. So really proud of that. So despite the macro of course we're paying attention to it but that doesn't change the sentiment of this management team about the opportunity ahead of us. I think the one thing I'll say is we're going to continue to invest obviously in the core business but we've got some investments in some of our emerging businesses as well, which will help us really position us for long-term growth.\nJason Kupferberg: Right. Right. That makes sense. And then just coming back to the upsell team I think you mentioned, they're going to become an even more critical, part of the growth story going forward. Anything you can share just in terms of the size of that team now? And what sort of productivity gains you've perhaps seen there? And to the extent you still see headroom in their productivity.\nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks, Jason. Good question. Look I think as we mentioned in the previous calls, the team that's going after new business, new locations is a lot more mature. It's been around for 10 years plus. And the upsell team is newer and we continue to refine and build it out. We do see it as an opportunity for us. We think there's headroom in the terms of everything from growing that team to continue to optimize the motion and how we partner between the new business team of lending restaurants, how we expand ARPU over time. And as I mentioned in the script in the long-term, we see this as an important part of our growth story over time.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you.\nAman Narang: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you, Jason. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJosh Baer: Thank you for the question. I was hoping you could double-click on the GPV per location commentary. If you could provide any data or insights into what seeing as far as the number of items on the ticket or trading down other consumer behaviors just as it relates to restaurant sales.\nElena Gomez : Yes I'll take that and feel free to jump in Aman. So average ticket has actually held pretty steady over the last several quarters. So that's not as much a factor. I think it's really same-store sales. And really I would say towards the end of the quarter is when we saw that into October. So there's \u2013 and we haven't yet seen trade downs either as we're looking at the data. Obviously, we're paying attention to that. And maybe in past recessions that's been a factor but we're not seeing that yet in our data.\nJosh Baer: Great. And then a follow-up sticking to GPV, just given your position in the industry and your expertise, I wanted to ask you about GLP-1s and your view on the near-term longer-term impacts? Thank you.\nChris Comparato: Yeah. Hey, Josh. This is Chris. Good question. We're not seeing anything that indicates a change in consumer behavior due to GLP-1 or Ozempic. We don't expect it to have a significant impact and we remain laser-focused on giving the industry the best technology platform to manage their business. So we're confident dining at restaurants will remain a cornerstone activity for consumers and again, not seeing anything related to it.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question is from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is now open.\nDave Koning: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks so much. To follow up a little on Tien-Tsin's question about Toast Capital. You had tremendous success. You've grown probably two to four times over the last handful of quarters, but this quarter was a little slower sequentially. And I guess I'm wondering do you expect that to grow a little closer to the core business going forward instead of kind of the massive growth going forward?\nElena Gomez : Yeah. I just want to remind you that over the last year, we added a 360-day loan product. So it was be mindful of that in your comparisons. But I would say in the near term, I would expect post capital stay in a similar range as a percentage of GPV is probably a good proxy to the way to think about it. But the demand is healthy. We're seeing a lot of customers come back and renew their loans. And so we're not seeing any concern about the growth of the program at all.\nDave Koning: Got you. Okay. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up, I just want to make sure I understood right. Did you say subscription ARPU going forward in the mid single-digit to high single-digit year-over-year growth? And if so what you expect in Q4 as well?\nElena Gomez: Yeah. My commentary was actually around Q4 to be in the high ARPU up to the mid- to high single-digits. And that was really just to zoom out to give you some texture on that. As we optimize what we land with customers upfront and some of the impact from customer mix, we expect that to be gradual. But overall, we're optimizing for ARR which I commented on earlier. And as we're getting to 100,000 locations, we want to continue that momentum. So that's how I'd characterize that.\nDave Koning: Great. Thanks so much.\nElena Gomez: One thing I would add to that as I'm thinking about your question. It's just thinking about ARPU over the long-term. As we think about it what is the terminal value of ARPU or what's that level going to look like? There's a couple of things we think about which may help frame for the group. Today, we have more than 10% of our customers paying us over 10,000 in ARPU and we see that growing steadily. But then just zooming out and you think about all the opportunity we have to grow ARPU, whether that's continued innovation which Aman talked about in his script, whether that's our upsell team which is very early, whether it's pricing and packaging just there are several levers that we can put together over the next several years to drive that ARPU expansion. And so we're very confident as we exit 2023 that we're going to continue to grow ARPU and have healthy SaaS ARR growth over time.\nDave Koning: Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions, so I'll pass the call back to the management team for any closing remarks.\nChris Comparato: Thank you, and thank you all for your thoughtful questions. I appreciate your well wishes. Thank you to our Toasters and more importantly to our customer base. And my last point is you're in strong hands with Aman and Elena moving forward and have a great day. Thank you.\nElena Gomez: Thank you, Chris.\nAman Narang: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Toast wouldn't be what it is today without your leadership and passion for the business our customers and of course our team. I think I speak for all Toasters in saying you'll be missed. And your friendship and support over the past 17 years that we've known each other has meant a lot to me personally. As Chris mentioned, we are excited about the opportunity ahead of us to grow the business and continue to be a great partner to the restaurant community. With just over 10% for the US market on Toast we have significant runway ahead of us. Our passion for this industry a strong focus on innovation to help restaurants drive and a world-class go-to-market and customer success team gives us confidence in our ability to drive sustained error growth while planning the seeds for future growth initiatives. We're incredibly happy with our performance in ARR. And the results represent strong momentum across our business. ARR was up 40% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, driven by strong execution across location acquisition and ARPU expansion. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow ARR across both these dimensions over the long term. Revenue increased 37% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA increased to a record $35 million in Q3. Toast had its sixth consecutive quarter exceeding the Rule of 40 measuring fintech and subscription gross profit growth our recurring revenue streams plus adjusted EBITDA margin. This consistent execution is a testament to our team, who have prioritized both revenue growth and operating leverage as the business has scaled. We added over 6,500 net locations in the quarter approximately 20% more than Q3 last year. Our local go-to-market approach continues to help drive strong momentum in our SMB business as we increase number of markets with high customer density and market tenant. While the SMB business is still the primary driver of location growth or making progress across the broader market opportunity as well. Let me share a few customer stories from the quarter that speak to this. The Mariana Restaurant Group switched its four full-serve restaurants in Massachusetts and New Hampshire to Toast and three of them are already live in Q3. They purchased nine products to help streamline their business across both front of house and back of house and noted the simplicity and ease of use of an integrated all-in-one solution. In addition to our core offerings they're also leveraging our newer platform capabilities including Toast Tables and catering and events. With Toast Tables they can more easily estimate guest wait times give visibility into -- how far a long the table is in its service help with seating guests evenly across service areas to help in the workloads keep them balanced. In addition the integration between Toast Tables and our employee scheduling product helps managers better staff throughout the week. Using our Catering & Events product they've also been able to streamline a manual pay dependent process with a digital-first approach. We're excited to work with Mariana Restaurant Group and support their growth plans over the coming years. In mid-market, we expanded our relationship with credit worthy brands and are excited to partner with them as they grow. We signed 50 locations across their multi-concept fast casual QSR portfolio for a total of 93 locations on Toast. And in enterprise we're thrilled to extend our relationship with Nothing Bundt Cakes. They became a customer in 2019 and currently have over 500 locations live on Toast. We've been working with them to increase productivity drive higher digital conversion and streamline processes for their corporate team. To support their expansion plans and franchisee count, we have signed an additional 300 location across Nothing Bundt Cakes and expanded the set of products available to their franchisee community, including employee scheduling payroll and catering. This expansion creates an opportunity to double the Nothing Bundt Cakes associate ARR over time and we're excited to partner and support their growth plans. Shifting gears to products. We're focused on building products both to help our customers thrive and run a great business. Our vertical focus on restaurant continues to be an advantage as we open up deeper parts of the TAM and expand ARPU by building differentiated products for the industry. Product innovation has always been foundational in Toast DNA and you should expect us to maintain that focus moving forward. Last week, we announced Toast Now app for restaurant operators that provide bill time insight into performance data allows operators to manage the kitchen volume adjust menus and communicate with staff on the go on their mobile device. This is something our customers have been asking for and allows building deep and deeper connections from operators. We are pleased with the early adoption levels with approximately 20% of locations already on Toast Now a week after its launch. In addition we recently announced Toast for Cafes & Bakeries similar to Toast for Hotel restaurants and Toast for Quick Service. We're building solutions for different restaurant types that better serve deeper parts of the TAM. Toast for Cafe & Bakeries brings together product capabilities geared to help coffee shops and bakeries grow revenue speed up service and create more repeat guests. Cafes & bakeries serve a variety of customer needs, from a regular morning coffee to launch catering or an on-the-go snack. It is a segment of the market that we're excited about and represents a meaningful growth opportunity for Toast. As part of the Cafe & Bakery launch, we also announced restaurant retail which provides unified restaurant and retail POS systems to manage retail SKUs. Things like wine selections or packaged coffee and more, directly within Toast providing a one-stop shop for customers to manage food service and retail together. We've seen rest embrace more service models especially during and post pandemic. And this is yet another example of our continuous focus on meeting the evolving needs of our customers. This is a good example, for how our product innovation can help serve deeper parts of the TAM drive incremental GPV through Toast and support ARPU growth. One customer I'd like to highlight is, 320 Market Cafe\u0301, a family owned gourmet market with two locations in Pennsylvania that includes the Pizzeria, a cafe\u0301, a retail area offering prepared foods craft beer and wine as well as the catering business. Before they joined Toast 320 took catering orders through e-mail and orders on paper which often got lost in the kitchen. And on the retail side, the process of adding a new retail SKU took over 20 minutes. This slowed down their ability to serve guests and generate revenue. Now with Toast, 320 Market Cafe\u0301, of course a growing business with quicker inventory management, faster checkouts and a way to take catering orders digitally all in a single integrated platform. They can now tag a new product and have it on the retail for minutes to track sales data in real time, and take down their corporate of paper catering orders in a digital system -- in place of a digital system and manage them from anywhere. With catering, retail, online ordering, gift cards and more, 320 Market Cafe\u0301 has up-leveled their business with Toast and saved their employees about eight hours per week of manual work equivalent to a whole shift. As we continue to broaden our products for our go-to-market team to serve a variety of customers types and pinpoints. Our upsell team becomes increasingly important to drive growth for the adoption of our platform across our customer base. As we approach 100,000 locations and beyond our upsell teams can get bigger, and we continue to see this as a big opportunity for growth in our business over time. To wrap up as Chris mentioned, we're excited about the opportunity in front of us. We are focused on being a strong partner to our restaurant community and we are well positioned to drive sustained area of growth in the future while building an efficient and durable business that can generate long-term value for customers and shareholders. As I think about the opportunity ahead of us, I'm energized and motivated by the momentum we have. It goes about saying, that none of this will be possible without the tireless efforts of our employees. A special thank you to all Toasters. I'm excited to lead this group of talented individuals as we transform the restaurant industry. And with that thank you and I'll pass it off to Elena. Thanks for the question Tim. I'll start by saying customers as we said in previous calls, our customers understand that product innovation requires investment and that prices will increase over time. We'll see it as our new customers that are coming at Toast are coming out at higher pricing. And we've also looked at the distribution curve across our customer base in terms of what they're paying across both SaaS and payments, and see opportunity there. And so we're confident that we can drive and increased pricing over time. We also see opportunity in terms of how we package our products across both software and fintech and see that as an important lever as well to drive ARPU and price. We're also aware that we're -- if you look at the opportunity in front of us to gain market share at both locations and target at rates, we want to make sure that we're offering transparent value-based pricing to our customers. So I think in the long-term we're confident in our ability to increase prices and we're working through it. Yes. Good question, Stephen. Look I think if you look year-over-year our net location adds are up 20%. And so a lot of our investment in sales and marketing are cold with that. And back to what Elena mentioned in terms of making sure that we're tracking towards the vectors. I think we're trying to be strategic in terms of where we see opportunity to invest whether it's on new business or it's an upsell to continue to gain market share and continue to grow the business. But we're always trying to be balanced in terms of making sure that we're managing to economics across the board. There are some new areas we're investing in. We've talked about before whether it's upmarket in enterprise international right where we are still earlier. But overall I think the bulk of the growth in the business is coming through our core assets. Well, we haven't seen that in our core SMB business. And as we mentioned in our guidance we talked about Q4 net location as being in 6,500 range and we continue to be confident in -- and if you look at on the top of funnel and our win rates we haven't seen anything materially different. And we continue to believe that our growth is really tied to our execution and getting more in our core SMB business into flywheel status, which is really just growing customer density growing the rep tenure in these markets. And so we haven't seen anything in our pipeline to suggest that customers are less receptive to purchasing Toast or looking to buy less of the platform. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Look, we've had -- we've built up a strong competitive program within the business as we track a lot of this data carefully. And I'll just go back to like this has always been a competitive market. And to what I just said earlier, we really do believe our growth is more tied to our own execution more than anything else. And we're tracking the pipeline every day. That being said, we're tracking pipeline the top of funnel win rates the activity of our team by competitor. And I think if you go back and just look at our confidence in terms of net adds in Q4. And it really just speaks to the performance of our go-to-market team and just the -- our own execution as a business. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Yes. Thanks, Jason. Good question. Look I think as we mentioned in the previous calls, the team that's going after new business, new locations is a lot more mature. It's been around for 10 years plus. And the upsell team is newer and we continue to refine and build it out. We do see it as an opportunity for us. We think there's headroom in the terms of everything from growing that team to continue to optimize the motion and how we partner between the new business team of lending restaurants, how we expand ARPU over time. And as I mentioned in the script in the long-term, we see this as an important part of our growth story over time. Thanks, Jason. Thanks, Chris."

            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "Thanks, Aman and thank you, everyone for joining. I also want to thank our incredible employees for another quarter of great work. Our team continues to execute at a high level, driving 40% growth at over $1 billion in ARR and delivering significant margin expansion. With a differentiated business model, scalable go-to-market engine and innovative all-in-one platform, we're well positioned to continue driving efficient growth at scale going forward. The 40% increase in ARR was on the back of strong location growth and continuing ARPU expansion translating to 37% year-over-year revenue growth. Our recurring gross profit streams fintech and subscription totaled $280 million, up 39% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $35 million, representing a margin of 13% on our recurring gross profit streams with over 22 percentage points of margin improvement year-over-year. Growth in our recurring gross profit streams and adjusted EBITDA margin are the basis for how we calculate Rule of 40 and this marks the sixth consecutive quarter we exceeded the Rule of 40. We sustained our go-to-market momentum in Q3, adding over 6,500 net locations. That was primarily driven by the flywheel effect from our localized go-to-market motion. As rep tenure and local market share increase, so has rep productivity, contributing to a solid year-over-year increase in SMB restaurant location adds. Our goal has always been to serve the entire restaurant TAM over time. We are increasingly making progress across supplementing our momentum in SMB with incremental growth both up and down market and internationally resulting in sustained location growth of over 30%, even as we approach 100,000 locations. Our primary focus remains on the core SMB segment. As we broadened and deepened penetration across the TAM including smaller SMB customers, enterprise customers and expanding internationally, our customer mix will evolve and have different SaaS and GPV dynamics. Our focus is to maximize ARR growth, which is our North Star metric, while maintaining the same healthy unit economics overall all. We plan to manage the portfolio to the same payout in the mid-teens, number of months, ensuring that growth is efficient as we expand and drive incremental profit. In the third quarter, SaaS ARR grew 47% year-over-year, driven by strong location growth and a 9% increase in SaaS ARPU. We're capitalizing on the location acquisition momentum we have while continuing to balance ARPU growth. We plan to exit Q4 with SaaS ARPU growth in the mid- to high single digits reflecting lower ARPU for new go-live cohorts, as we continue to optimize our upfront sales to balance sustained location growth velocity, as well as some impact from mix shift. Our long-term growth algorithm remains the same. We have a long runway to increase ARR through both locations and ARPU with just over 10% of US restaurant locations on the platform, a proven differentiated SMB go-to-market motion and growing traction across the full breadth of restaurant segments, as well as green shoots internationally, we're well positioned stained healthy growth location for years to come. Similarly as we scale customer count, we have conviction in our ability to drive healthy SaaS ARPU growth over the long-term through pricing and packaging, scaling and refining our upsell motion and delivering ongoing product innovation to enhance the customer value proposition. Moving to FinTech Solutions, on a year-over-year basis third quarter revenue and gross profit both grew 36% to $856 million and $182 million, respectively. GPV increased 4% to $33.7 billion, an average annualized GPV per processing location was down slightly year-over-year. Similar to Q2, the year-over-year change in GPV per processing location was impacted as we lap the inflation tailwind and from a slight mix shift as we extended to more segments of the TAM. In addition in the back half of the third quarter, we saw a modest slowdown in same-store transaction volume which resulted in a decline in GPV per-processing location in the quarter. Trends have remained stable since then. Given the broader macro environment remains mixed, we finance for GPV trends to remain at current levels in the near-term and for GPV per processing locations decline year-over-year in Q4. On non-payment FinTech solutions led by Toast Capital, contributed $34 million in gross profit in the quarter as demand for the offering remains healthy and default rates remain steady. We continue to take a balanced approach to growing Toast Capital and our unique position with real-time access to POS data allows us to monitor the health of restaurants and prudently balance risk, while helping our customers grow with fast, flexible access to capital. Net take rate was 54 basis points. Core net take rate was 44 basis points with other FinTech products contributing 10 basis points. This quarter included a one-time cost accrual true-up while the prior year benefited from a credit. Absent those onetime impacts, core take rate was approximately flat year-over-year. In Q4 we anticipate core and total net take rate to be in a similar range on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Turning to customer acquisition costs, Hardware revenue increased year-over-year due to both location ads and existing customers adding more hardware. Hardware margins improved year-over-year, primarily due to lower shipping costs. On the sales and marketing side expenses grew 17% year-over-year. We're making targeted investments in our go-to-market team and continuing to grow our upsell team, while staying focused on maintaining healthy unit economics and driving operating leverage. We manage our customer acquisition costs using a dollar-based payback period which takes into account the incremental recurring gross profit across both new business and upsell. Payback periods remain within our targeted level of mid-teen months for the portfolio. Shifting to R&D, our Toast for Cafes & Bakeries launch including the restaurant retail offering is another example of leveraging product investments to drive deeper location penetration by super serving the unique needs of our different customers. It also highlights how our product innovation locks more revenue streams for customers and drives incremental transaction volume for Toast -- through Toast. G&A grew 12% year-over-year in the third quarter. Excluding $19 million of bad debt and credit-related expenses in the quarter, primarily related to reserves Toast capital G&A was flat year-over-year. We've seen meaningful leverage in G&A, as a result of our focus on efficiency and disciplined head count management. Excluding bad debt and credit-related expenses G&A as a percentage of our recurring gross profit streams was 16% in the quarter a 600 basis point improvement year-over-year and we expect to continue driving operating leverage on our overhead cost going forward. In total, adjusted EBITDA was $35 million in Q3 and margin as a percentage of our recurring gross profit streams increased to 13%, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. That's a result of our healthy top line growth and diligence in efficiently scaling the business. Overall, we expect to continue building operating leverage as we march towards the long-term target margins we previously laid out. Free cash flow was $37 million in Q3, roughly in line with our adjusted EBITDA. As a reminder, working capital will fluctuate based on GPV and timing of payments. But over time free cash flow should largely follow a similar trajectory as adjusted EBITDA trends. Now let me turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.03 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $5 million to $15 million. In addition to the seasonally lower GPV per location in Q4, the sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter also reflects our expectation for slower year-over-year GPV growth and investments we're making to strengthen our position heading into 2024. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue to grow 41% at the midpoint of our guidance and now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $38 million to $48 million, representing an approximately $160 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA versus last year at the midpoint. To wrap up, we are extremely proud of the work that the Toast has accomplished thus far in 2023. We're scaling the business in a durable manner as we capitalize on the opportunity ahead of us to build a generate business that delivers significant value to our customers and shareholders. And we are well-positioned to continue delivering long-term growth while driving operating leverage throughout the business and executing on this long-term opportunity that remains ahead of us. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Tim. It's a fair question. Look I think over the long-term we have an opportunity to gradually increase our core take rate either through investing in our payments infrastructure and just driving operational excellence as we're trying to drive down cost per transaction. And that's both working with our partners and negotiating. And then there's \u2013 obviously, we can impact the price of course that's also at our disposal. And then just leveraging our scale as we get bigger I think we'll have -- we'll be in a position to negotiate even further. So I think there's an opportunity both on the pricing side of things but also as we optimize our cost start over time. Yes, sure. So most of it Stephen -- it's a fair question. So the GPV pre location which I commented in the script is really something we saw late in September and continuing into October. So that was the primary calculus. But also remember seasonally GPV is GPV per location is lower in Q4. So both of those factors played a role, but the reason -- the primary reason is the trends we're seeing most recently in same-store sales. Yes, I would just add we're set up to have a strong Q4 and on track to our expectations. And to just build on what Aman said that consistent execution thanks to our sales team is really showing through and we've got a healthy pipeline as well. So, when you put that all together, I think we're going to continue that acquisition momentum into 2024 which will be a big driver of our ARR growth. Yes, fair question. So, look our SMB remains our core at the highest level and our success in SMB is hopefully actually frankly more opportunities across the entire TAM. So, as we're leveraging our product innovation we're going after those opportunities. And we're seeing really good progress in segments like e-com or international, right? And so as we get into the segments and extended that TAM, we're going to see both different GPV and ARPU dynamics. But at the highest level, just kind of zooming out, ARR continues to be earnout from a trick. And we'll always see balancing location ARPU growth on an ongoing basis. And right now is a great example of us capitalizing on that location acquisition momentum. So, delivering $200 million in SaaS ARR year-over-year balancing those -- I think 2023 is a great example. To your question on the front book I'd actually reframe you back to ARR because as we're trying to optimize our land and expand motion and we've talked a lot about the upsell team. And as we're extending it to different parts of the TAM like I mentioned international e-com. The mix is less comparable than what we are a couple of quarters ago. So, for us our North Star and how we operate the business is really on ARR basically. And that's through and through. So -- and it's also just reflect our financial performance but also how the reps are comped rep goals are all around ARR goals. Our company bonus program is on ARR growth. So it's truly how we manage the business as well. Yes, it's a fair question Tien-Tsin. Thank you for the question. Our default rates have been in line with our expectations. And so -- and we're seeing healthy demand from our customers. So -- we don't have plans to change our program at the moment. It's a very healthy program and we're managing the risk very well and have a lot of controls in place around the program. That said, if the macro were to turn we also are confident in our ability to quickly move and throttle the originations if we needed to. But overall, the program is very healthy and meeting our expectations all the way around. Yes. So let me take your question sort of in the \u2013 there's lots in your question but \u2013 at the highest level, the guidance that you're seeing for the balance of the year really reflects the macro that we talked about so GPV per location coming down. In September, in particular, as we start to see that trend it's continuing into October. And so our guidance reflects the macro playing a role. But just zooming out the momentum in the business that we have exiting the year into Q4 still remains healthy regardless of the macro. So as we think about the next year, just give some color on that, we're growing healthy. We've got a great operating leverage story. So as we enter into 2024, we're going to go in with the same discipline, focus on growth and as well on cost discipline. And we've delivered healthy growth alongside driving this operating leverage over $160 million in a year. So really proud of that. So despite the macro of course we're paying attention to it but that doesn't change the sentiment of this management team about the opportunity ahead of us. I think the one thing I'll say is we're going to continue to invest obviously in the core business but we've got some investments in some of our emerging businesses as well, which will help us really position us for long-term growth. Yes I'll take that and feel free to jump in Aman. So average ticket has actually held pretty steady over the last several quarters. So that's not as much a factor. I think it's really same-store sales. And really I would say towards the end of the quarter is when we saw that into October. So there's \u2013 and we haven't yet seen trade downs either as we're looking at the data. Obviously, we're paying attention to that. And maybe in past recessions that's been a factor but we're not seeing that yet in our data. Yeah. I just want to remind you that over the last year, we added a 360-day loan product. So it was be mindful of that in your comparisons. But I would say in the near term, I would expect post capital stay in a similar range as a percentage of GPV is probably a good proxy to the way to think about it. But the demand is healthy. We're seeing a lot of customers come back and renew their loans. And so we're not seeing any concern about the growth of the program at all. Yeah. My commentary was actually around Q4 to be in the high ARPU up to the mid- to high single-digits. And that was really just to zoom out to give you some texture on that. As we optimize what we land with customers upfront and some of the impact from customer mix, we expect that to be gradual. But overall, we're optimizing for ARR which I commented on earlier. And as we're getting to 100,000 locations, we want to continue that momentum. So that's how I'd characterize that. One thing I would add to that as I'm thinking about your question. It's just thinking about ARPU over the long-term. As we think about it what is the terminal value of ARPU or what's that level going to look like? There's a couple of things we think about which may help frame for the group. Today, we have more than 10% of our customers paying us over 10,000 in ARPU and we see that growing steadily. But then just zooming out and you think about all the opportunity we have to grow ARPU, whether that's continued innovation which Aman talked about in his script, whether that's our upsell team which is very early, whether it's pricing and packaging just there are several levers that we can put together over the next several years to drive that ARPU expansion. And so we're very confident as we exit 2023 that we're going to continue to grow ARPU and have healthy SaaS ARR growth over time. Thank you, Chris."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. Our focus has been on delivering durable and efficient growth and our third results reflects execution on that objective. We added over 6,500 net locations in the quarter and ARR grew 40% year-over-year. We continue to balance top line growth with driving efficiencies, as we scale the business and adjusted EBITDA totaled $35 million in the quarter. The execution against our focused strategy to drive location growth serve all segments of the restaurant industry and bold product innovation to better serve our customers and open up new segments of the market is both driving strong results and has us well positioned to sustain this momentum going forward. As we announced in September, Aman will take over as the CEO at the start of 2024. Looking back over my nine years as CEO, I am incredibly proud of the accomplishments of the Toast team. Together, we have scale to serve nearly 100,000 restaurant locations with over 1.2 billion ARR. We've built a company culture with strong values and an employee base that embraces our customer-centric mission to be the trusted restaurant technology partner. At the same time, we've built a scalable, durable business, that's generating sustainable positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Our innovation mindset and our products have also expanded significantly over that time period, as we deliver on our mission. We've the brought in the types of restaurants that we serve and have made inroad across the entire US restaurant TAM. We have also evolved into a multiproduct platform company with solutions to help restaurants drive growth, build deeper connections and experiences with their guests and improve operations and manage their costs. Toast has been on this journey for over a decade and we proudly serve an industry that has navigated many ups and downs. There's no better example than over the last few years. Restaurant operators respond to unprecedented changes quickly expanding their service models to meet evolving consumer demands. Through it all, restaurants remain a central part of consumers' daily lives. More recently we've seen consumer spend moderate and I'm confident restaurants will navigate the uncertain macro environment with the same resiliency and tenacity they always do and this battle-tested industry will continue to thrive well into the future. Toast is side-by-side with our customers every step of the way and is often one step ahead helping restaurants adapt and thrive no matter the circumstance and we're just getting started. The SMB TAM remains a large opportunity for us. Enterprise restaurant groups are in the early days of adopting cloud technologies and a big international opportunity lies ahead. We are better positioned than ever before to expand and continue to build adjacent growth opportunities, as we capitalize on the generational opportunity to be the technology platform for restaurants and transform the industry. I've known Aman for 17 years having worked with him before I joined Toast. First and foremost as a co-founder of Toast, he brings a strong founder's mentality to the CEO seat where he will continue to raise the bar on execution and innovation. He intimately knows our customer base and has shaped much of the company through his many roles across the organization from open seeing product, to sales and customer success. So I'm confident that as Aman steps into the CEO role. He'll lead Toast to new successes and he is surrounded by the most talented leadership team that I've had the opportunity to work with across my career. To wrap up my last quarterly earnings call thank you to our Toasters and to our customers. We've accomplished a lot as a team the enthusiasm you bring to our mission sustains our momentum and I'm excited for what lies ahead. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aman. Yeah. Hey, Josh. This is Chris. Good question. We're not seeing anything that indicates a change in consumer behavior due to GLP-1 or Ozempic. We don't expect it to have a significant impact and we remain laser-focused on giving the industry the best technology platform to manage their business. So we're confident dining at restaurants will remain a cornerstone activity for consumers and again, not seeing anything related to it. Thank you, and thank you all for your thoughtful questions. I appreciate your well wishes. Thank you to our Toasters and more importantly to our customer base. And my last point is you're in strong hands with Aman and Elena moving forward and have a great day. Thank you."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Comparato: Thank you, Michael, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. We sustained our operating momentum in Q2, posting strong results across the board, further evidence of Toast's unique positioning to help lead the digital transformation of the restaurant industry and empower the restaurant community to do what they love and thrive.  We achieved notable milestones this quarter, surpassing $1 billion in ARR and posting positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the first time as a public company, which speaks to the consistent execution of our strategy.  First we're focused on driving location growth and in Q2 we set a record for quarterly net new location additions with over 7,500 and ended the quarter with approximately 93,000 locations.  Second, we're working to serve all segments of the restaurant industry. In June we announced a deal naming Toast as an approved vendor for Marriott Select Service Hotels, a clear proof point that we can push deeper into the restaurant TAM and unlock the restaurant space or the enterprise space.  And lastly, we are focused on continued product innovation to open up more segments of the TAM and better serve our customers. The Toast for Hotel Restaurants offering and newer offerings like Toast Tables and the recently announced Catering & Events product are all examples of the product advancements we're making.  These efforts are translating into strong results. In the second quarter, on a year-over-year basis, total revenue increased 45% to $978 million and GPV was up 38% to $32.1 billion. ARR finished up $1.1 billion, up 45% from last year and more than double from two years ago, evidence of our ability to scale the business through both increased penetration across the TAM and healthy ARPU growth.  Coupled with our strong top line and operational performance, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of positive $15 million in Q2 compared to a $33 million loss in the prior year, reflecting an over 600 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. The combination of durable top line growth and consistent margin improvement, is the result of our dedication to balancing investments in key growth areas with efficiency and cost discipline as we scale the business.  On the back of our healthy first half results and operating momentum, we raised full year revenue guidance to 41% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and increased our adjusted EBITDA guide to a range of $15 million to $35 million. We remain focused on driving efficient, durable growth and expect continued margin expansion as we march towards the long-term target margins that we previously shared with you.  A core tenant of our product strategy is to position our platform to expand deeper into the TAM. Toast for Hotel Restaurants and our expanding enterprise capabilities were key in unlocking the Marriott opportunity. The deal we announced enables our team to sell the Toast platform to Marriott Select Service Hotels in the U.S. and Canada.  There's a range of food and beverage service models across Marriott Select Service properties, from full-service dining to quick service, to poolside ordering. The flexibility of our platform to meet the unique needs of different restaurant sizes and formats in the select service level was another important differentiator for Marriott.  While it's still early, we've taken a small number of Marriott locations live already and we look forward to bringing the power of our platform to more Marriott properties moving forward and continuing to go deeper in the enterprise segment.  Another way our product is unlocking the ability to go deeper into the TAM and better serve all restaurant stakeholders is by expanding support to the numerous restaurant service models. In our last Voice of the Restaurant Industry survey, restaurants reported they are managing seven service models on average, including catering. And last week, we announced the launch of Toast Catering & Events, a new product fully integrated with the Toast point of sale to help restaurants seamlessly manage large catering orders and event planning.  It incorporates order tracking, initial quotes, and helps with contracts. And once booked, events get integrated to calendars and orders are fed directly to the kitchen at the right time. The product also creates invoices and allows for direct digital payment through Toast. This builds on the invoicing product that we announced last October and bolsters our ability to more deeply serve parts of the TAM as we estimate over 60% of SMB restaurants offer catering, in addition to their on-premise business.  Other product enhancements we've recently made includes the launch of our next generation digital ordering suite. Since we first introduced online ordering in 2014, we facilitated more than 250 million commission free orders for our customers. Based on customer input, our enhanced digital ordering suite offers a mobile optimize design, search engine optimized menus, and website customization capabilities.  In addition, we've updated the checkout experience to improve conversion. These efforts are targeted to help customers increase sales and build and maintain direct relationships with their guests. However, we made a mistake in how we approach monetizing the value of this suite. Listening to our customers is a core ethos for how we operate, and our day-to-day efforts are guided by a relentless focus on being the restaurant community's trusted partner. It was on this basis and after extensive constructive discussions with our customers that we decided to remove the $0.99 consumer-facing feed from Toast Digital Ordering Channels.  As we continue to innovate with new products and further strengthen the value we provide customers, we are well-positioned to monetize our offering, commensurate with that value. We will be more thoughtful on how we address pricing, going forward, and we recognize the importance of considering the impact to all stakeholders as we do that. We remain committed to the same high level of transparency and partnership with customers that we've always delivered.  To wrap up, I want to thank our customers and employees. Our mission to empower the restaurant community to delight their guests, do what they love and thrive, guides our efforts and underpins our strategy. We raise the bar in the first half of the year, driving record-location additions, launching new products and service models to move deeper into all aspects of the TAM, and delivering on our goal of adjusted EBITDA profitability.  In short, the Toast platform is resonating with customers. We have momentum across all segments, and we're still in the early stages of tapping the massive opportunity to be the restaurant industries trusted technology partner. We're confident that continuing to execute on our strategy and mission will generate significant long-term value for our customers, our community and our shareholders.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Aman, to discuss our go-to-market performance. \nAman Narang: Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon everyone. First off, I'm really proud of the team's performance in the quarter. We added 7,500 net-restaurant locations, exceeding our prior quarterly record by over 1,000 locations. Our local go-to-market approach continues to drive sustained momentum in our SMB segment, which as many of you know is core to our growth.  As we're in the markets longer and the average tenure of our accounting executive team growth, we benefit from higher inbound volume, increased wind rates, and higher rep productivity, which drives market penetration.  This important trend continues to hold in our SMB business as we gain share and acts as a flywheel to drive efficient growth. We're also excited about our progress up market, the strong quarter in our mid-market segment, and as Chris mentioned, the recent announcement of Marriott to help us break into enterprise.  As I look back at the quarter, we're really pleased with where our go-to-market funnel and book location stand, as well as the team's focus to continuously improve our onboarding processes to both bring customers live faster and set them up for success. Let me spend a few minutes highlighting a couple of customer wins from the quarter that speak to our progress. In our SMB segment, Tempo Urban Bistro is a full service restaurant outside of Phoenix that will leverage the breath of our platform, implementing nine different modules across all of our product pillars.  This includes our Toast Go handhelds in their Dining Rooms, Kitchen Displaces System to streamline kitchen operations, Toast Tables to manage reservations, Mobile Order and Pay to streamline front-of-house service, and loyalty gift cards and email marketing to turn guests into regulars. In addition, Tempo will use Toast Payroll and xtraCHEF to optimize back-of-house operations. Tempo has planned to open three or four more restaurants and is excited to grow with toast.  Switching to mid-market, the Ninety Nine Restaurant & Pub in partnership with its service provider, Restaurant Growth Services, will implement Toast across more than 90 locations in the Northeast. Serving more than 20 million guests annually, the Ninety Nine was attracted to toast because they saw the opportunity to more efficiently manage both front-of-house and back-of-house operations with our platform. Across the brand, they plan to use Toast Go handheld devices, Kitchen Display Systems, and POS terminals to enhance the guest and staff experience. Additionally, their back-office team will use their API integrations and multi-location management module to better centralize menu updates and visibility into their operations.  Moving to our international markets, Canada, Ireland, and the UK, we are very encouraged by the early customer feedback. Customers love the core capabilities that help streamline restaurant operations, and our R&D team is hard at work listening to our customers and making more of our platform capabilities available to them.  One great example is our partnership with Arcade in the U.K. After successfully implementing Toast at its first location in Centre Point in London, Arcade is adding Toast to its new Battersea location and two food trucks. With 13 cuisines under one roof under the iconic power station, Arcade Battersea will follow the same model as the first location and implement the Toast platform across the entire food hall operation and use our kitchen display system in all the kitchens.  In addition to our POS terminals, servers will use handhelds to help facilitate more orders and drive additional revenue and a better guest experience. Arcade is also leveraging our API integrations across several key partners. As we scale the number of restaurant locations, our upsell team has more opportunity to help our customers expand their relationship with Toast. For perspective, among locations with more than 10,000 in SaaS ARPUs, about half of them exceed that threshold of 10K after adding products to our upsell team in Toast Shop, which is our e-commerce platform for existing customers. This dual upsell motion with both a sales team and a self-service e-commerce channel, provide a holistic offering for customers depending on their needs.  Let me highlight one customer story that illustrates how our upsell team partners with customers to expand how they leverage Toast. Slab BBQ & Beer, a multi-location barbecue joint in Austin, Texas, joined Toast in 2019. Slab initially started with our POS and online ordering to boost sales through COVID.  Since 2019, Slab has expanded to four locations and added Sling and Toast Parallel and Team Management to our upsell team. They credit Toast with streamlining operations and time savings thanks to centralized reporting and our back-office capabilities to manage menus, sales, and employees. On the heels of Slab BBQ's growth with Toast, its SaaS ARR across all locations has grown by more than 10x since becoming a customer. This is a great example that shows when our customers grow, we grow.  To wrap, as I mentioned at the start, I'm incredibly proud of our team's performance in this quarter. As we scale and grow market share and continue to invest in our restaurant platform, we are well-positioned to drive durable ARR growth, both through locations and ARPU over time.  Thanks. I'm now hand it off to Elena next to go through our quarter in more detail. \nElena Gomez : Thanks, Aman, and thank you everyone for joining. I also want to give a special thank you to the entire Toast team. Your dedication and your continued execution resulted in another great quarter with results above expectations.  We delivered strong top-line growth in Q2 and passed the $1 billion mark in ARR, while at the same time demonstrating our ability to consistently drive efficiency across our business. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement and led to our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in two years.  The top-line momentum is a testament to the value proposition of our industry-leading software and payments platform. We're still at the early stages of this significant opportunity to lead the restaurant industry's digital transformation, and you'll see us continue to balance growth and efficiency as we scale to drive durable top and bottom-line growth.  Our go-to-market teams are continuing to execute quarter after quarter. Q2 was a record for net location growth with more than 7,500 net ads ahead of our expectations. As a reminder, Q2 is our seasonally strongest quarter of the year, and we typically see lower quarterly net ads in the second half each year.  Given our strong pipeline, continued momentum penetrating segments, and go-to-market execution, we are raising our expectations for quarterly net ads to be about 6,500 in the second half of the year.  While we've taken a handful of Marriott locations live, it's still early. It was not a meaningful contributor in Q2, and is not a major factor in our increased expectations for the remainder of the year as we expect to book and take Marriott locations live over time.  Moving to financial results. Total revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $978 million in the second quarter. ARR, which is our core operational metric increased 45% year-over-year due to growth in both locations and ARPU, as the power of our integrated solution resonates with our customers. Total ARPU, which as a reminder, we look at on an ARR basis, was over 12K in the quarter, driven by double digit year-over-year gains in SaaS ARPU.  As Chris discussed, we recently rolled back the consumer fee for our digital ordering channels. Our platform provides customer significant value and we're committed to continue to innovate to further strengthen that value proposition. We're confident we can monetize a value we provide and expect measured pricing adjustments to contribute to ARPU growth over time.  Moving to FinTech Solutions, on a year-over-year basis, second quarter revenue grew 44% to $808 million, gross profit was up 55% to $177 million and GPV increased 38% to $32.1 billion. Average annualized GPV per-processing location was up 1% year-over-year and 7% sequentially.  GPV trends remain stable and in line with our seasonal expectations and looking ahead, we anticipate GPV growth to moderate given the seasonality of GPV and the moderating tailwind from inflation.  Our nonpayment FinTech products led by Toast Capital contributed approximately $32 million of gross profit in Q2 as we continue to see healthy demand. Defaults for Toast Capital came in slightly below expectations, contributing to bad debt associated with Toast Capital, which we recognize within G&A expense declining relative to the first quarter. As a reminder, our unique position with both historical and real-time access to POS data allows us to monitor the health of restaurants and prudently balance risk, while helping our customers grow with fast, flexible access to capital.  Net take rate was 55 basis points, core payments net take rate was flat year-of-year and other FinTech products contributed 10 basis points. Looking ahead, consistent with prior years, we expect the mix of credit to seasonally increase, which will weigh on the core net take rate as a year of progresses.  In Q2, total gross profit grew 80% year-of-year to $225 million, resulting in a gross margin of 23%. Looking at our recurring stream, subscription and FentTech gross profit total $267 million in the second quarter up 58% year-of-over year.  Turning to our customer acquisitions costs, hardware revenue increased year-of-year due to both strong location ads and existing customers adding more hardware ahead of peak season. Hardware margins improved, primarily benefiting from lower shipping costs on a year-over-year basis. On the sales and marketing side, expenses increased 33% year-of-year as we lapped the investments made to scale the sales team. We continue to grow both in our new business and upsell sales team in a targeted manner, while remaining focused on scaling unit economics and supporting sustained go-to-market momentum.  Shifting R&D, our disciplined investment approach is delivering continued product innovation, including our recent launch of Toast Catering & Events. This offering builds off of our influencing product and is a good example of how our products and help customers simplify their workflows, improved guest interactions and drive additional transaction volume through Toast.  In Q2, G&A expenses increased 33% year-over-year. Bad debt and credit related expenses totaled to $15 million in Q2, with the reserves related to Toast Capital representing the majority of the expense. Excluding bad debt and credit related expenses, G&A grew 10% year-over-year and we expect to see continued leverage as we remain focused on efficiencies and managing headcount.  Told Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $15 million and margin was 1.5%, delivering on our goal of adjusted EBITDA profitability. This performance was a function of our sustained top line growth and cost discipline as we scale the business.  As I mentioned earlier, gross profit from our recurring streams, FinTech and Subscription grew 58% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin relative to our recurring streams was 5.6%. As a reminder, these two metrics are the basis for how we calculate Rule of 40, and the combination of the two was 64%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter we exceeded the Rule of 40.  Free cash flow was $39 million in the quarter, marking the first time we had positive quarterly free cash flow since becoming a public company. This was a result of positive adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and a benefit from working capital, primarily related to the growth in GPV.  Looking ahead, we expect some seasonality in working capital quarter-to-quarter tied to GPV trends and the timing of certain payments, but over time, we anticipate free cash flow should largely follow a similar trajectory as adjusted EBITDA trends.  Now, let me turn to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.04 billion, representing 36% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million, representing approximately 50 basis points of sequential margin improvement at the midpoint.  Following our solid first-half performance, we are increasing our full-year guidance and now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $3.81 billion to $3.87 billion, a 41% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Our updated full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance range is $15 million to $35 million, as we now expect to be profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the full year.  In closing, we finished the first half of 2023 with tremendous momentum, driving record location growth and adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow in Q2. We are well-positioned to sustain that momentum and capitalize on the massive market opportunity ahead, as the restaurant community's trusted partner while driving durable ARR growth and creating long-term shareholder value.  Thanks again to our customer base for your trust, and thanks to the Toast team for another quarter of strong execution. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. \nTien-tsin Huang: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon to all of you. So, thanks for going through everything. Growth seems great here. I'd love to just ask if you don't mind, on the $0.99 fee and the lessons learned, I guess is really the question that I have from implementing that and the withdrawal. I'm sure you spoke to a lot of your clients, and Chris, you mentioned stakeholders and meeting those expectations as well. So can you comment on lessons learned? \nChris Comparato: Yes, thanks, Tien-tsin. It's a good question. I'm going to actually give a bit of background on this, because some of you may also have similar questions. So for background, we had made significant upgrades as I mentioned in my script, to our online ordering products, which actually allowed for increased guest conversion and better consumer discovery. We had actually communicated and tested multiple packaging and pricing approaches over the course of the past year, some which were similar to the fees that several of our competitors employ.  As we expanded the rollout more broadly, several customers voiced pretty constructive feedback. One thing I love about our customer base is that they tell us exactly how they feel about everything; the good, the bad, and the ugly. And upon that feedback, we quickly recognized that we made a mistake, mainly about how we approached the price change, basically the pricing structure change, and the impact to their guests.  At the end of the day, while this is what I'd call somewhat of a foot-fault on one module, this does not have an impact on our ability to leverage packaging and pricing over time. Our customers understand that the products and innovation require investment, and they consistently tell us that they are willing to pay for value.  So from a lesson learned standpoint, we learned a lot from this. And there's more questions we're going to ask ourselves internally when we execute these types of pricing changes or structural changes moving forward.  For example, what is the impact on every stakeholder? Often, we talked about the flywheel between happy employees, happy guests and happy restaurants. So just asking the right questions on how it affects our key stakeholders is core to our mission, and our mission is rooted in being the trusted partner to the restaurant community.  So we've learned quite a bit. I actually think it's going to make us stronger in the future as we leverage packaging and pricing. But quite a few lessons learned, but pretty confident in our stance to leverage things moving forward, but good question. \nTien-tsin : Yes, that's a tough answer, and learning through adversity is a good thing. If you don't mind, just a quick follow-up. It sounds like your location expectation is still quite upbeat for the second half. So it sounds like you feel still, this is good. You did 90 days ago around a location growth. I just wanted to make sure I caught that correctly. Thank you. \nAman Narang: That\u2019s right Tien-tsin. Look, I think as I mentioned my script, really proud of the team's execution. Really feel good about our pipeline or our bookings. As I've talked about in previous calls, one of the biggest drivers for growth for Toast is market density, the number of customers in the market, as well as the tenure of our reps. it\u2019s really a tailwind for growth and it\u2019s something we control. The more restaurants we get in the market, it acts as a flywheel for us in terms of everything from top of funnel, to win rates to productivity and we feel really good about our outlook for the second half of the year. \nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is now open. \nJason Kupferberg: Thank you, guys. Yes, nice numbers here. I wanted to stay on the net adds topic for a minute. You raised the outlook there for the second half. And just wondering, any particular region or any part of the customer base driving that. It doesn't sound like you put much in there for Marriott. So just any additional color on what's driving the higher outlook. Thanks. \nAman Narang: Yes, so great question. As I mentioned, I think this is really a story of just our core business in SMB outperforming. I think the team executed really well in the first half, and let's say the pipeline booking that I just mentioned is a great shape.  I think we're all starting to \u2013 some of the work we've done just after that, broadening our TAM, getting into QSRs, getting into hotels has been helpful as well for the team. I think a lot of this also goes back to our vertical focus on restaurants as being a key differentiator. As you pointed out, like it's not about, we\u2019re really thrilled about the Marriott partnership. That is not what is driving the outlook in the second half of the year. \nJason Kupferberg: For sure, for sure. So speaking of Marriott, can you just talk a little bit about that the go-to-market motion there, the way you're going to address that opportunity, what kind of sales cycles and kind of competitive dynamics are you expecting there. And I think you're going to market with FreedomPay, the payment side. If you can just talk through all that. Thanks. \nChris Comparato: Sure. Yes, no great question. So let me zoom out just a little bit. So over the past few years, as we've talked about on these calls, we've made incremental investments in our enterprise platform, and this work really underscores our ability to open up the new opportunities and expand our TAM. Not just for Marriott, but for mid-market and enterprise in general.  Some of the work including our work on hotel APIs, our work on integrations in general, and our work on above-store configuration and reporting has given us a more confident stance in going after the enterprise segment.  In terms of the type of go-to market, it's a different structure than SMB. These are longer sales cycles. These are a little bit more targeted deals. We're often in a pilot and in a lab and then in terms of the competition, we think it's relatively Greenfield in terms of the enterprise opportunity. There's still quite a bit of legacy upmarket and we started to record certain wins. I mean, certainly we've announced Marriott and this allows us to be an approved vendor at Marriott. It's still very early days at Marriott, but when we think about some of the other wins across enterprise, Aman mentioned Ninety Nine Restaurant, we had also won Wetzel's Pretzels, which is 300-plus locations. I had already announced last quarter Golden Krust, which is north of 100 locations. And then we also won Philly Pretzel, which is 170 locations.  So our team is picking up momentum. They are more confident in their stance to go after the enterprise market. It's a relatively small team, but they're doing really good work to execute on this TAM expansion.  With regard to FreedomPay, you had mentioned that in your question. Listen, like I said, it's still early with Marriott, but the FreedomPay partnership really gives us a lot of flexibility to work with a certain segment of enterprise customers upmarket and further opens up the enterprise TAM.  You know, there's really two important things to leave you with on FreedomPay. Number one, it allows us to flexibly work with these enterprise customers who often have unique payment requirements. They are looking to solve payments across spa, hotel, restaurants, across these diverse businesses. So number one, it opens up some TAM and gives us some flexibility to work with these larger customers.  And then number two, often these large enterprise customers are locked into long-term contracts for both POS as well as payments. This allows us to have flexibility to go after them for POS and software, and we can partner with FreedomPay on those deals. And it just puts us in a stronger position of flexibility for the largest section of enterprise customers.  That being said, you're probably going to ask the question, well, what does this do for our core business? And listen, in our core business, both SMB, as well as regional and mid-market, this doesn't change our integrated platform between POS and payments. We continue to go to market quite well on the combined platform, and Toast Payments will always be an option. So I'll leave it there. \nJason Kupferberg: Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. \nJosh Baer : Great. Thanks for the question, and congrats on a strong quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about visibility as far as location additions. We're now talking about 13,000 to add in the back half of the year. I guess, like any context for how to think about how much you have to go out and win and go live in the next five months versus what's either already won or already in implementation or going live from previous wins? \nChris Comparato: Yes. Hey, Josh. Look, I think we don't guide to the booked location specifically, but I think the trends we're seeing, as I mentioned in terms of bookings and pipeline are consistent with what we've seen in the past, and the team's got a lot of confidence in their ability to continue to execute as they have been.  And I think, the strength that we saw in the first half of the year really is consistent with the strength that we've seen really over the past couple of years in our core SMB business, where as we get into markets deeper, we've talked about this in the past, we get more customer density, our rep tenure is increasing. Those are the things that are driving our productivity.  I think one other thing that the team is thinking about, just to give some color on that, is we're trying to balance, and we talked about this last quarter, what the team lands with an initial sales versus how they expand. And so the team is really trying to maximize the number of locations on the platform, while also booking as much of the platform up front. And that\u2019s a balance where we're trying to maximize win rate and location ads, right, with the ARPU on these deals that we're booking.  And so overall, I think, look at the highest level. We feel really good about the outlook for the second half of the year. \nJosh Baer : Okay, great. And then just one more on locations. I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on international and how that's either contributed in the quarter or in the outlook for the back half. Thank you. \nElena Gomez: Yes, I'll take that Josh. So we're really pleased, and Aman mentioned this on his script, we're really pleased with the signal we're seeing internationally. The customer feedback is really positive. And just for everyone's knowledge, we're taking customers live in Dublin, U.K., and Canada. And so far, even though we're in the early days, it's not impacting our location adds materially this year, so you should know that. But like I said, the progress is really strong. And what we've been focused on is really building out the go-to-market team.  We're starting to see very similar patterns in the early days of Toast in the U.S., and so that's a good signal for us. We know that playbook. And as Aman mentioned, we're focused on expanding the platform so we can get more of it in the hands of our international customers.  But in the end, if we zoom out, just think about what we're \u2013 our ambition around international is really to drive the same loyalty, the same flywheel markets, and replicate that internationally, which is why we're so encouraged by that. So overall, really good progress, but it's not going to be a material contributor to our results this year and to the location growth that we're talking about.\nJosh Baer : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. \nWill Nance: Hey, guys. I appreciate you taking the question. Elena, I was hoping to follow up on the subscription ARPU guidance that you gave a couple quarters ago. If I look at ARR per location, I think it was up somewhere at 13%, 14% year-over-year this quarter, so it does seem like you're on that glide path to the 10% year-over-year for some amounts that you guided too. But I guess the base of locations is going to end up being a lot higher than what we thought was when you gave the initial guidance.  I am wondering if you could talk about the interplay between the accelerated location growth and the ARR per location guidance. And I guess you mentioned doing a little bit less on the upfront sale, and more on the upsell motion. Is there some interplay between some of the slowdown we\u2019ve seen in ARR per location growth and the acceleration in net adds? And I guess as we get all of these locations up and running, would you expect that something like an upsell motion could lead to a re-acceleration in software ARR per location growth in maybe the years ahead? \nElena Gomez: Yes, thanks. There's a lot in that question. So let me start by saying, we're really pleased with the ARR growth at 55% in the quarter, and you're exactly right in that. We're balancing and Aman sort of mentioned this already, we're balancing our location growth with SaaS, ARPU up front.  Our SaaS ARPU grew 14% year-over-year, but the fundamentals, underlying fundamentals on SaaS ARPU and to your question, are we still thriving to that 10% ARPU on an ARR basis? Yes, that's our goal. The fundamentals are strong as we've mentioned.  We had a step up in ARPU over the last couple of years, hence the moderation this year, so just keep that in mind. And we're going to continue to build on this upsell motion and on this land and expand motion that we keep talking about. But to the point, our North Star is really ARR growth and that was a healthy 55% this quarter. \nWill Nance : Got it, I appreciate you taking my question. And on the Marriott, I'm just wondering if you could talk through kind of ARPU dynamics as you move up market. For instance, I know you\u2019re partnering with FreedomPay on some of these deals. As those come in, do you see a higher contribution of software and is there more potential for software ARPU to kind of balance out the lack of payments in these deals or any kind of payments revenue stream, kind of ancillary coming from Freedom. Just any color, how you think about ARPU dynamics on markets? \nElena Gomez: Yes, that\u2019s a fair question. So we're really looking at \u2013 first of all I would just start with, we always think about our ARPU and payback periods, always play a role regardless of the segment that we're in. But just by the nature of them being enterprise customers, the ARR will be larger over time. But then we're going to come back to, even if we don't have the payment dynamics in this deal, we're going to focus back on payback periods and unit economics, and we have an opportunity to continue to grow that ARPU over time on the SaaS side. But we're really encouraged by what we're saying, and it's early days to really have an exact precision on that ARPU, but we anticipate that it will follow the same unit economics that we do for our entire business. \nWill Nance : Got it. I appreciate you taking the questions and nice job on the customer acquisition acceleration. \nChris Comparato: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nDan Dolev : Hey guys, really strong results, congrats. Just, my question is on the $0.99 fee. I know your competitors are very aggressive, obviously following that issue, and we've seen them advertise different promotions to try to get customers. Has there been any \u2013 you know obviously results, strong results speak for themselves, and net adds are super strong. But has there been any kind of conversations with merchants that you didn't have before regarding some sort of an attrition following the $0.99 fee. Thank you. \nChris Comparato: Yes Dan, good question. No, the answer is no. I mean, as you know it's always been a hybrid competitive space for the past decade. Competition is always throwing campaigns and targets against Toast. But with regard to the $0.99 fee, there's been no churn or impact to location adds and we're in execution mode in our core business and the competitive dynamics in our opinion remain the same. Our win rates look good and we're just plowing forward on execution. \nDan Dolev : Got it, thank you. A quick follow-up and sorry if it was already addressed, I was in a different call. But can you give us a sense for SaaS ARPU for the second half, and I apologize if it's already been addressed. Thank you. \nElena Gomez : So it has been, but I'm happy to repeat for you, Dan. So you know Q2 SaaS ARR grew 55%. I say that every time, because that's really our North Star metric and in Q2 it grew 14%, but overall we're still driving to the 10% ARPU as we exit 2023 and that's on an ARR basis just as a reminder.  But the fundamentals are strong, our underlying trends are strong. And as we \u2013 as a reminder, what I mentioned is, we mentioned that the last two years we've seen a step up in ARPU and we anticipated that it would moderate as the year progresses. So we're still driving towards that 10% ARPU on our ARR basis at the exit of the year. \nDan Dolev : Great. Thank you and apologies for being redundant. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Your line is now open. \nStephen Sheldon : Hey, thanks for taking my questions and nice results here. I wanted to ask about the catering expansion, well it\u2019s really good to see, and just kind of what that could mean in terms of additional monetization. Would this be kind of another SaaS subscription revenue opportunity to think about adding on ordering, invoicing, or is it more about just supporting more throughput and for the monetization to really come from facilitating additional GPV on the payments side. I guess how should we be thinking about catering monetization? \nChris Comparato: Hey Stephen, two things. Number one, it does come with healthy ARPU. So it does add another lever to drive ARPU growth over time similar to what Elena talked about. But then on the invoicing front, certainly is going to run on our rails and that's the second component, but it's healthy on both fronts.  I think the one thing I love about our customer base as I mentioned is, they tell us what they like and what they are missing. And for this one, it's another good example of going deeper into the TAM. And specifically for our core business or core SMB business, when 60% of SMB restaurants are offering catering, they are often doing it through manual processes or point solutions, and they tell us that an integrated platform is just better.  So it's still early. We're very much early in the life cycle of this product, but we're excited about the long-term opportunity for this product, because it's going to make the customer's life a lot easier, and then it's going to help us on the ARPU front? \nStephen Sheldon : Got it. That's very helpful. And then a follow-up and to a more high level. Great to see the kind of profitability inflexion point. So how do you think about letting profitability ramp here versus reinvesting back into the variety of strategic initiatives you have underway, especially with given some of the momentum you have right now. How are you thinking about it? \nElena Gomez: Yes, it's a great question. It's going to be quite balanced. I think that obviously running lean and efficient is how we work and how we make decisions every day. But as we, as I said on my script, we've got a massive opportunity ahead and we're early in our TAM and have a ton of opportunity to upsell as we grow and innovate more and so we have to have that balancing act.  I would point to our guidance for the near term and then point you to our long term guidance that we give a couple of quarters ago, and that's on a recurring FinTech and gross profit. So we'll be balancing both growth and profitability over time. But we certainly want to lean into this momentum we have, especially as we exit 2023. \nStephen Sheldon : Great, thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. \nTimothy Chiodo: Great, thank you. I wanted to talk a little bit about the mix of your growth adds. You mentioned a few of the larger chains, 100 units, etc., Philly Pretzel and others. Has that created any \u2013 a little bit of a mix shift towards competitive takeaways relative to brand new formed locations within your overall growth adds? And then I have a brief follow-up on payments rev share.\nChris Comparato: Hey Tim, yes. Just look I think at the highest level, the mix that we see between the opening and existing restaurants has largely remained consistent. We certainly do well when the new restaurants are opening up. But we also do \u2013 our team is able to get existing restaurants tours that are using a current system where there's legacy or cloud to switch over to Toast.  I think that there's to your question about as the \u2013 have seen more success of market in mid-market, that has been fundamentally changed I\u2019d say, the mix of new opening versus existing restaurants. \nTimothy Chiodo: Okay, thank you. I appreciate that. And the follow-up relates to the potential for revenue share. So clearly you have the FreedomPay integration and some of the enterprise customers, either currently or in the future, will have the decoupled payments through a third-party provider.  I'm sure in many cases as you mentioned, there's already an existing relationship there, but is there any economics at all that Toast might be earning either via FreedomPay or the other processor or any other payments revenue share that we should think of? That\u2019s potentially\u2026 \nElena Gomez: Yes, so I won't get into the specifics of our FreedomPay deal, but it's not meaningful. I would think of it as a SaaS ARPU play for that specific Marriott deal. To Chris's point earlier, though, he did mention there will be times, and we already have this for enterprise customers, do want to leverage us for both. So I wouldn't take FreedomPay and extrapolate it to our entire enterprise book, because that's not where we are today. \nTimothy Chiodo: Okay, great. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is now open. \nSamad Samana : Hi, good afternoon and congrats on the strong quarter. Maybe first Elena, one for you. Just as I think about both the inflection and EBITDA margin this quarter and the change in OpEx, it's actually quite modest in terms of dollar OpEx growth, despite the upside of the top line. So I'm just curious, should we think about that as a good proxy for how sales and marketing R&D dollars should maybe grow for the next couple of quarters going forward. And is that what's allowing the leverage? Just that and I have a follow up question as well. \nElena Gomez: Yes, I think the leverage we are going to see Samad is really across the business and we've shown leverage across all of the OpEx lines for the last several quarters. So I would point you to our guidance for the \u2013 obviously without me getting into specifics on the quarter. And I would also point you to the fact that in Q4 there is a little bit of seasonality at play in our payment side of the business. So that'll have a different complexion, say than in Q3. But we expect to continue to drive leverage across all of the OpEx lines for the balance of the year. \nSamad Samana : Okay, great. And then maybe just a follow-up on pricing. It's been mentioned a couple of times about the $0.99 fee, and maybe how the company will think about its philosophy on that. I just want some clarification. There's no assumption on a price increase based into at least the outlook for the rest of the year, right? And I guess when we think about price increase, should we think about that based on the comments that you've given? Should we anticipate one at some point in the near future? \nElena Gomez: Yes, let me zoom out a little bit. So first of all, obviously our guidance reflects the change to the EP [ph] that was not included, you know it's no longer in our 2023. But just zooming out, definitely pricing is a core element of our strategy over time. As we think about the next several years, we think about two dimensions, right, one is growth and one is profitability.  When we consider growth, we have the two axis we always talk about, which is location growth, we're early in the TAM. We have ARPU, our ability to cross-sell and up-sell, which we have proof points so we're continuing to hone that land and expand motion. On top of that we have pricing, which is a key tenet of our strategy over time. So that's really what's driving how we think about the growth in our business. I wouldn't over-rotate the pricing, but it is a key element of our strategy that we're contemplating. \nSamad Samana : Great. Thanks Elena. Good to be working with you again. \nElena Gomez: Thanks, Samad. \nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with DA Davidson. Your line is now open. \nPeter Heckmann: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Could you go over a little bit more on Toast Capital and your aspirations for that business? First, if you could just get some of the data you typically give on a quarterly basis, like funding, and if you go through some of the reserve data again. But as you think about that business, I mean I think it's generating something like 15% of gross profit today. I guess, do you feel it's appropriate to limit the contribution of that business given that in a different macroeconomic environment you might have to pull back on that? \nElena Gomez: Yes, I mean let me start. Let me zoom out and just start with the premise of why Toast Capital. And then, we did have great performance this quarter on Toast Capital. It contributed about 10 basis points to our overall take rate. But at the core, we know our restaurants are under-banked and we want to give them an opportunity to have access to capital in a fast and flexible way.  And the proof points we have is not only do we continue to see demand from new customers, but we're also seeing demand from existing customers coming back and renewing their loans. And our default rates have been, for the most part, in line and are better than we expected. So in terms of how we think about, are we going to grow this program? For the near term, I think we're going to continue to stay kind of in the zone that we've been in. But it's really important to remember how we manage the risk, because that is what's giving us the confidence to continue to extend loans.  One is we look at internal and external. We sort of look at it holistically. What are the internal factors we're seeing? What are some of the external factors we're seeing? And as a reminder, we have access to the payment data, which gives us a lot of confidence in the credit worthiness of the customer.  And then we partner with a bank to offer the loan. So the loans are coming off of their balance sheet. So it's balance sheet light for us. And our liability is really capped at 15% of the origination. And then we make the collections based on the payment volume daily. So we have a lot of confidence in visibility into the collection. And to your point, if the macro were to change or the environment were to change, then we\u2019ll have levers to sort of manage that. We could tighten our lending parameters. We can reduce duration, which has an impact on bad debt.  So there's a few different levers that we can play with should we need to kind of scale back on the program. And actually, we did scale back on the program during COVID, in the early days where we said this might not be the time and we were able to successfully manage the bad debt during that time. And now we've seen demand come back and as we've relaunched the program and relaunched different loan sizes, etc., we've seen a healthy demand. So I feel very confident we've got a great team managing the risk of this business. And more importantly, we're helping our customers scale and grow.\nPeter Heckmann : All right. That's helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your line. \nChris Comparato : All right. Thank you.",

            "name": "Aman Narang",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon everyone. First off, I'm really proud of the team's performance in the quarter. We added 7,500 net-restaurant locations, exceeding our prior quarterly record by over 1,000 locations. Our local go-to-market approach continues to drive sustained momentum in our SMB segment, which as many of you know is core to our growth.  As we're in the markets longer and the average tenure of our accounting executive team growth, we benefit from higher inbound volume, increased wind rates, and higher rep productivity, which drives market penetration.  This important trend continues to hold in our SMB business as we gain share and acts as a flywheel to drive efficient growth. We're also excited about our progress up market, the strong quarter in our mid-market segment, and as Chris mentioned, the recent announcement of Marriott to help us break into enterprise.  As I look back at the quarter, we're really pleased with where our go-to-market funnel and book location stand, as well as the team's focus to continuously improve our onboarding processes to both bring customers live faster and set them up for success. Let me spend a few minutes highlighting a couple of customer wins from the quarter that speak to our progress. In our SMB segment, Tempo Urban Bistro is a full service restaurant outside of Phoenix that will leverage the breath of our platform, implementing nine different modules across all of our product pillars.  This includes our Toast Go handhelds in their Dining Rooms, Kitchen Displaces System to streamline kitchen operations, Toast Tables to manage reservations, Mobile Order and Pay to streamline front-of-house service, and loyalty gift cards and email marketing to turn guests into regulars. In addition, Tempo will use Toast Payroll and xtraCHEF to optimize back-of-house operations. Tempo has planned to open three or four more restaurants and is excited to grow with toast.  Switching to mid-market, the Ninety Nine Restaurant & Pub in partnership with its service provider, Restaurant Growth Services, will implement Toast across more than 90 locations in the Northeast. Serving more than 20 million guests annually, the Ninety Nine was attracted to toast because they saw the opportunity to more efficiently manage both front-of-house and back-of-house operations with our platform. Across the brand, they plan to use Toast Go handheld devices, Kitchen Display Systems, and POS terminals to enhance the guest and staff experience. Additionally, their back-office team will use their API integrations and multi-location management module to better centralize menu updates and visibility into their operations.  Moving to our international markets, Canada, Ireland, and the UK, we are very encouraged by the early customer feedback. Customers love the core capabilities that help streamline restaurant operations, and our R&D team is hard at work listening to our customers and making more of our platform capabilities available to them.  One great example is our partnership with Arcade in the U.K. After successfully implementing Toast at its first location in Centre Point in London, Arcade is adding Toast to its new Battersea location and two food trucks. With 13 cuisines under one roof under the iconic power station, Arcade Battersea will follow the same model as the first location and implement the Toast platform across the entire food hall operation and use our kitchen display system in all the kitchens.  In addition to our POS terminals, servers will use handhelds to help facilitate more orders and drive additional revenue and a better guest experience. Arcade is also leveraging our API integrations across several key partners. As we scale the number of restaurant locations, our upsell team has more opportunity to help our customers expand their relationship with Toast. For perspective, among locations with more than 10,000 in SaaS ARPUs, about half of them exceed that threshold of 10K after adding products to our upsell team in Toast Shop, which is our e-commerce platform for existing customers. This dual upsell motion with both a sales team and a self-service e-commerce channel, provide a holistic offering for customers depending on their needs.  Let me highlight one customer story that illustrates how our upsell team partners with customers to expand how they leverage Toast. Slab BBQ & Beer, a multi-location barbecue joint in Austin, Texas, joined Toast in 2019. Slab initially started with our POS and online ordering to boost sales through COVID.  Since 2019, Slab has expanded to four locations and added Sling and Toast Parallel and Team Management to our upsell team. They credit Toast with streamlining operations and time savings thanks to centralized reporting and our back-office capabilities to manage menus, sales, and employees. On the heels of Slab BBQ's growth with Toast, its SaaS ARR across all locations has grown by more than 10x since becoming a customer. This is a great example that shows when our customers grow, we grow.  To wrap, as I mentioned at the start, I'm incredibly proud of our team's performance in this quarter. As we scale and grow market share and continue to invest in our restaurant platform, we are well-positioned to drive durable ARR growth, both through locations and ARPU over time.  Thanks. I'm now hand it off to Elena next to go through our quarter in more detail. That's right Tien-tsin. Look, I think as I mentioned my script, really proud of the team's execution. Really feel good about our pipeline or our bookings. As I've talked about in previous calls, one of the biggest drivers for growth for Toast is market density, the number of customers in the market, as well as the tenure of our reps. it's really a tailwind for growth and it's something we control. The more restaurants we get in the market, it acts as a flywheel for us in terms of everything from top of funnel, to win rates to productivity and we feel really good about our outlook for the second half of the year. Yes, so great question. As I mentioned, I think this is really a story of just our core business in SMB outperforming. I think the team executed really well in the first half, and let's say the pipeline booking that I just mentioned is a great shape.  I think we're all starting to \u2013 some of the work we've done just after that, broadening our TAM, getting into QSRs, getting into hotels has been helpful as well for the team. I think a lot of this also goes back to our vertical focus on restaurants as being a key differentiator. As you pointed out, like it's not about, we're really thrilled about the Marriott partnership. That is not what is driving the outlook in the second half of the year."

            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "Thanks, Aman, and thank you everyone for joining. I also want to give a special thank you to the entire Toast team. Your dedication and your continued execution resulted in another great quarter with results above expectations.  We delivered strong top-line growth in Q2 and passed the $1 billion mark in ARR, while at the same time demonstrating our ability to consistently drive efficiency across our business. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement and led to our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in two years.  The top-line momentum is a testament to the value proposition of our industry-leading software and payments platform. We're still at the early stages of this significant opportunity to lead the restaurant industry's digital transformation, and you'll see us continue to balance growth and efficiency as we scale to drive durable top and bottom-line growth.  Our go-to-market teams are continuing to execute quarter after quarter. Q2 was a record for net location growth with more than 7,500 net ads ahead of our expectations. As a reminder, Q2 is our seasonally strongest quarter of the year, and we typically see lower quarterly net ads in the second half each year.  Given our strong pipeline, continued momentum penetrating segments, and go-to-market execution, we are raising our expectations for quarterly net ads to be about 6,500 in the second half of the year.  While we've taken a handful of Marriott locations live, it's still early. It was not a meaningful contributor in Q2, and is not a major factor in our increased expectations for the remainder of the year as we expect to book and take Marriott locations live over time.  Moving to financial results. Total revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $978 million in the second quarter. ARR, which is our core operational metric increased 45% year-over-year due to growth in both locations and ARPU, as the power of our integrated solution resonates with our customers. Total ARPU, which as a reminder, we look at on an ARR basis, was over 12K in the quarter, driven by double digit year-over-year gains in SaaS ARPU.  As Chris discussed, we recently rolled back the consumer fee for our digital ordering channels. Our platform provides customer significant value and we're committed to continue to innovate to further strengthen that value proposition. We're confident we can monetize a value we provide and expect measured pricing adjustments to contribute to ARPU growth over time.  Moving to FinTech Solutions, on a year-over-year basis, second quarter revenue grew 44% to $808 million, gross profit was up 55% to $177 million and GPV increased 38% to $32.1 billion. Average annualized GPV per-processing location was up 1% year-over-year and 7% sequentially.  GPV trends remain stable and in line with our seasonal expectations and looking ahead, we anticipate GPV growth to moderate given the seasonality of GPV and the moderating tailwind from inflation.  Our nonpayment FinTech products led by Toast Capital contributed approximately $32 million of gross profit in Q2 as we continue to see healthy demand. Defaults for Toast Capital came in slightly below expectations, contributing to bad debt associated with Toast Capital, which we recognize within G&A expense declining relative to the first quarter. As a reminder, our unique position with both historical and real-time access to POS data allows us to monitor the health of restaurants and prudently balance risk, while helping our customers grow with fast, flexible access to capital.  Net take rate was 55 basis points, core payments net take rate was flat year-of-year and other FinTech products contributed 10 basis points. Looking ahead, consistent with prior years, we expect the mix of credit to seasonally increase, which will weigh on the core net take rate as a year of progresses.  In Q2, total gross profit grew 80% year-of-year to $225 million, resulting in a gross margin of 23%. Looking at our recurring stream, subscription and FentTech gross profit total $267 million in the second quarter up 58% year-of-over year.  Turning to our customer acquisitions costs, hardware revenue increased year-of-year due to both strong location ads and existing customers adding more hardware ahead of peak season. Hardware margins improved, primarily benefiting from lower shipping costs on a year-over-year basis. On the sales and marketing side, expenses increased 33% year-of-year as we lapped the investments made to scale the sales team. We continue to grow both in our new business and upsell sales team in a targeted manner, while remaining focused on scaling unit economics and supporting sustained go-to-market momentum.  Shifting R&D, our disciplined investment approach is delivering continued product innovation, including our recent launch of Toast Catering & Events. This offering builds off of our influencing product and is a good example of how our products and help customers simplify their workflows, improved guest interactions and drive additional transaction volume through Toast.  In Q2, G&A expenses increased 33% year-over-year. Bad debt and credit related expenses totaled to $15 million in Q2, with the reserves related to Toast Capital representing the majority of the expense. Excluding bad debt and credit related expenses, G&A grew 10% year-over-year and we expect to see continued leverage as we remain focused on efficiencies and managing headcount.  Told Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $15 million and margin was 1.5%, delivering on our goal of adjusted EBITDA profitability. This performance was a function of our sustained top line growth and cost discipline as we scale the business.  As I mentioned earlier, gross profit from our recurring streams, FinTech and Subscription grew 58% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin relative to our recurring streams was 5.6%. As a reminder, these two metrics are the basis for how we calculate Rule of 40, and the combination of the two was 64%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter we exceeded the Rule of 40.  Free cash flow was $39 million in the quarter, marking the first time we had positive quarterly free cash flow since becoming a public company. This was a result of positive adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and a benefit from working capital, primarily related to the growth in GPV.  Looking ahead, we expect some seasonality in working capital quarter-to-quarter tied to GPV trends and the timing of certain payments, but over time, we anticipate free cash flow should largely follow a similar trajectory as adjusted EBITDA trends.  Now, let me turn to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.04 billion, representing 36% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million, representing approximately 50 basis points of sequential margin improvement at the midpoint.  Following our solid first-half performance, we are increasing our full-year guidance and now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $3.81 billion to $3.87 billion, a 41% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Our updated full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance range is $15 million to $35 million, as we now expect to be profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the full year.  In closing, we finished the first half of 2023 with tremendous momentum, driving record location growth and adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow in Q2. We are well-positioned to sustain that momentum and capitalize on the massive market opportunity ahead, as the restaurant community's trusted partner while driving durable ARR growth and creating long-term shareholder value.  Thanks again to our customer base for your trust, and thanks to the Toast team for another quarter of strong execution. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A. Yes, I'll take that Josh. So we're really pleased, and Aman mentioned this on his script, we're really pleased with the signal we're seeing internationally. The customer feedback is really positive. And just for everyone's knowledge, we're taking customers live in Dublin, U.K., and Canada. And so far, even though we're in the early days, it's not impacting our location adds materially this year, so you should know that. But like I said, the progress is really strong. And what we've been focused on is really building out the go-to-market team.  We're starting to see very similar patterns in the early days of Toast in the U.S., and so that's a good signal for us. We know that playbook. And as Aman mentioned, we're focused on expanding the platform so we can get more of it in the hands of our international customers.  But in the end, if we zoom out, just think about what we're \u2013 our ambition around international is really to drive the same loyalty, the same flywheel markets, and replicate that internationally, which is why we're so encouraged by that. So overall, really good progress, but it's not going to be a material contributor to our results this year and to the location growth that we're talking about. Yes, thanks. There's a lot in that question. So let me start by saying, we're really pleased with the ARR growth at 55% in the quarter, and you're exactly right in that. We're balancing and Aman sort of mentioned this already, we're balancing our location growth with SaaS, ARPU up front.  Our SaaS ARPU grew 14% year-over-year, but the fundamentals, underlying fundamentals on SaaS ARPU and to your question, are we still thriving to that 10% ARPU on an ARR basis? Yes, that's our goal. The fundamentals are strong as we've mentioned.  We had a step up in ARPU over the last couple of years, hence the moderation this year, so just keep that in mind. And we're going to continue to build on this upsell motion and on this land and expand motion that we keep talking about. But to the point, our North Star is really ARR growth and that was a healthy 55% this quarter. Yes, that's a fair question. So we're really looking at \u2013 first of all I would just start with, we always think about our ARPU and payback periods, always play a role regardless of the segment that we're in. But just by the nature of them being enterprise customers, the ARR will be larger over time. But then we're going to come back to, even if we don't have the payment dynamics in this deal, we're going to focus back on payback periods and unit economics, and we have an opportunity to continue to grow that ARPU over time on the SaaS side. But we're really encouraged by what we're saying, and it's early days to really have an exact precision on that ARPU, but we anticipate that it will follow the same unit economics that we do for our entire business. So it has been, but I'm happy to repeat for you, Dan. So you know Q2 SaaS ARR grew 55%. I say that every time, because that's really our North Star metric and in Q2 it grew 14%, but overall we're still driving to the 10% ARPU as we exit 2023 and that's on an ARR basis just as a reminder.  But the fundamentals are strong, our underlying trends are strong. And as we \u2013 as a reminder, what I mentioned is, we mentioned that the last two years we've seen a step up in ARPU and we anticipated that it would moderate as the year progresses. So we're still driving towards that 10% ARPU on our ARR basis at the exit of the year. Yes, it's a great question. It's going to be quite balanced. I think that obviously running lean and efficient is how we work and how we make decisions every day. But as we, as I said on my script, we've got a massive opportunity ahead and we're early in our TAM and have a ton of opportunity to upsell as we grow and innovate more and so we have to have that balancing act.  I would point to our guidance for the near term and then point you to our long term guidance that we give a couple of quarters ago, and that's on a recurring FinTech and gross profit. So we'll be balancing both growth and profitability over time. But we certainly want to lean into this momentum we have, especially as we exit 2023. Yes, so I won't get into the specifics of our FreedomPay deal, but it's not meaningful. I would think of it as a SaaS ARPU play for that specific Marriott deal. To Chris's point earlier, though, he did mention there will be times, and we already have this for enterprise customers, do want to leverage us for both. So I wouldn't take FreedomPay and extrapolate it to our entire enterprise book, because that's not where we are today. Yes, I think the leverage we are going to see Samad is really across the business and we've shown leverage across all of the OpEx lines for the last several quarters. So I would point you to our guidance for the \u2013 obviously without me getting into specifics on the quarter. And I would also point you to the fact that in Q4 there is a little bit of seasonality at play in our payment side of the business. So that'll have a different complexion, say than in Q3. But we expect to continue to drive leverage across all of the OpEx lines for the balance of the year. Yes, let me zoom out a little bit. So first of all, obviously our guidance reflects the change to the EP [ph] that was not included, you know it's no longer in our 2023. But just zooming out, definitely pricing is a core element of our strategy over time. As we think about the next several years, we think about two dimensions, right, one is growth and one is profitability.  When we consider growth, we have the two axis we always talk about, which is location growth, we're early in the TAM. We have ARPU, our ability to cross-sell and up-sell, which we have proof points so we're continuing to hone that land and expand motion. On top of that we have pricing, which is a key tenet of our strategy over time. So that's really what's driving how we think about the growth in our business. I wouldn't over-rotate the pricing, but it is a key element of our strategy that we're contemplating. Thanks, Samad. Yes, I mean let me start. Let me zoom out and just start with the premise of why Toast Capital. And then, we did have great performance this quarter on Toast Capital. It contributed about 10 basis points to our overall take rate. But at the core, we know our restaurants are under-banked and we want to give them an opportunity to have access to capital in a fast and flexible way.  And the proof points we have is not only do we continue to see demand from new customers, but we're also seeing demand from existing customers coming back and renewing their loans. And our default rates have been, for the most part, in line and are better than we expected. So in terms of how we think about, are we going to grow this program? For the near term, I think we're going to continue to stay kind of in the zone that we've been in. But it's really important to remember how we manage the risk, because that is what's giving us the confidence to continue to extend loans.  One is we look at internal and external. We sort of look at it holistically. What are the internal factors we're seeing? What are some of the external factors we're seeing? And as a reminder, we have access to the payment data, which gives us a lot of confidence in the credit worthiness of the customer.  And then we partner with a bank to offer the loan. So the loans are coming off of their balance sheet. So it's balance sheet light for us. And our liability is really capped at 15% of the origination. And then we make the collections based on the payment volume daily. So we have a lot of confidence in visibility into the collection. And to your point, if the macro were to change or the environment were to change, then we'll have levers to sort of manage that. We could tighten our lending parameters. We can reduce duration, which has an impact on bad debt.  So there's a few different levers that we can play with should we need to kind of scale back on the program. And actually, we did scale back on the program during COVID, in the early days where we said this might not be the time and we were able to successfully manage the bad debt during that time. And now we've seen demand come back and as we've relaunched the program and relaunched different loan sizes, etc., we've seen a healthy demand. So I feel very confident we've got a great team managing the risk of this business. And more importantly, we're helping our customers scale and grow."

            "name": "Chris Comparato",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. We sustained our operating momentum in Q2, posting strong results across the board, further evidence of Toast's unique positioning to help lead the digital transformation of the restaurant industry and empower the restaurant community to do what they love and thrive.  We achieved notable milestones this quarter, surpassing $1 billion in ARR and posting positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the first time as a public company, which speaks to the consistent execution of our strategy.  First we're focused on driving location growth and in Q2 we set a record for quarterly net new location additions with over 7,500 and ended the quarter with approximately 93,000 locations.  Second, we're working to serve all segments of the restaurant industry. In June we announced a deal naming Toast as an approved vendor for Marriott Select Service Hotels, a clear proof point that we can push deeper into the restaurant TAM and unlock the restaurant space or the enterprise space.  And lastly, we are focused on continued product innovation to open up more segments of the TAM and better serve our customers. The Toast for Hotel Restaurants offering and newer offerings like Toast Tables and the recently announced Catering & Events product are all examples of the product advancements we're making.  These efforts are translating into strong results. In the second quarter, on a year-over-year basis, total revenue increased 45% to $978 million and GPV was up 38% to $32.1 billion. ARR finished up $1.1 billion, up 45% from last year and more than double from two years ago, evidence of our ability to scale the business through both increased penetration across the TAM and healthy ARPU growth.  Coupled with our strong top line and operational performance, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of positive $15 million in Q2 compared to a $33 million loss in the prior year, reflecting an over 600 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. The combination of durable top line growth and consistent margin improvement, is the result of our dedication to balancing investments in key growth areas with efficiency and cost discipline as we scale the business.  On the back of our healthy first half results and operating momentum, we raised full year revenue guidance to 41% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and increased our adjusted EBITDA guide to a range of $15 million to $35 million. We remain focused on driving efficient, durable growth and expect continued margin expansion as we march towards the long-term target margins that we previously shared with you.  A core tenant of our product strategy is to position our platform to expand deeper into the TAM. Toast for Hotel Restaurants and our expanding enterprise capabilities were key in unlocking the Marriott opportunity. The deal we announced enables our team to sell the Toast platform to Marriott Select Service Hotels in the U.S. and Canada.  There's a range of food and beverage service models across Marriott Select Service properties, from full-service dining to quick service, to poolside ordering. The flexibility of our platform to meet the unique needs of different restaurant sizes and formats in the select service level was another important differentiator for Marriott.  While it's still early, we've taken a small number of Marriott locations live already and we look forward to bringing the power of our platform to more Marriott properties moving forward and continuing to go deeper in the enterprise segment.  Another way our product is unlocking the ability to go deeper into the TAM and better serve all restaurant stakeholders is by expanding support to the numerous restaurant service models. In our last Voice of the Restaurant Industry survey, restaurants reported they are managing seven service models on average, including catering. And last week, we announced the launch of Toast Catering & Events, a new product fully integrated with the Toast point of sale to help restaurants seamlessly manage large catering orders and event planning.  It incorporates order tracking, initial quotes, and helps with contracts. And once booked, events get integrated to calendars and orders are fed directly to the kitchen at the right time. The product also creates invoices and allows for direct digital payment through Toast. This builds on the invoicing product that we announced last October and bolsters our ability to more deeply serve parts of the TAM as we estimate over 60% of SMB restaurants offer catering, in addition to their on-premise business.  Other product enhancements we've recently made includes the launch of our next generation digital ordering suite. Since we first introduced online ordering in 2014, we facilitated more than 250 million commission free orders for our customers. Based on customer input, our enhanced digital ordering suite offers a mobile optimize design, search engine optimized menus, and website customization capabilities.  In addition, we've updated the checkout experience to improve conversion. These efforts are targeted to help customers increase sales and build and maintain direct relationships with their guests. However, we made a mistake in how we approach monetizing the value of this suite. Listening to our customers is a core ethos for how we operate, and our day-to-day efforts are guided by a relentless focus on being the restaurant community's trusted partner. It was on this basis and after extensive constructive discussions with our customers that we decided to remove the $0.99 consumer-facing feed from Toast Digital Ordering Channels.  As we continue to innovate with new products and further strengthen the value we provide customers, we are well-positioned to monetize our offering, commensurate with that value. We will be more thoughtful on how we address pricing, going forward, and we recognize the importance of considering the impact to all stakeholders as we do that. We remain committed to the same high level of transparency and partnership with customers that we've always delivered.  To wrap up, I want to thank our customers and employees. Our mission to empower the restaurant community to delight their guests, do what they love and thrive, guides our efforts and underpins our strategy. We raise the bar in the first half of the year, driving record-location additions, launching new products and service models to move deeper into all aspects of the TAM, and delivering on our goal of adjusted EBITDA profitability.  In short, the Toast platform is resonating with customers. We have momentum across all segments, and we're still in the early stages of tapping the massive opportunity to be the restaurant industries trusted technology partner. We're confident that continuing to execute on our strategy and mission will generate significant long-term value for our customers, our community and our shareholders.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Aman, to discuss our go-to-market performance. Yes, thanks, Tien-tsin. It's a good question. I'm going to actually give a bit of background on this, because some of you may also have similar questions. So for background, we had made significant upgrades as I mentioned in my script, to our online ordering products, which actually allowed for increased guest conversion and better consumer discovery. We had actually communicated and tested multiple packaging and pricing approaches over the course of the past year, some which were similar to the fees that several of our competitors employ.  As we expanded the rollout more broadly, several customers voiced pretty constructive feedback. One thing I love about our customer base is that they tell us exactly how they feel about everything; the good, the bad, and the ugly. And upon that feedback, we quickly recognized that we made a mistake, mainly about how we approached the price change, basically the pricing structure change, and the impact to their guests.  At the end of the day, while this is what I'd call somewhat of a foot-fault on one module, this does not have an impact on our ability to leverage packaging and pricing over time. Our customers understand that the products and innovation require investment, and they consistently tell us that they are willing to pay for value.  So from a lesson learned standpoint, we learned a lot from this. And there's more questions we're going to ask ourselves internally when we execute these types of pricing changes or structural changes moving forward.  For example, what is the impact on every stakeholder? Often, we talked about the flywheel between happy employees, happy guests and happy restaurants. So just asking the right questions on how it affects our key stakeholders is core to our mission, and our mission is rooted in being the trusted partner to the restaurant community.  So we've learned quite a bit. I actually think it's going to make us stronger in the future as we leverage packaging and pricing. But quite a few lessons learned, but pretty confident in our stance to leverage things moving forward, but good question. Sure. Yes, no great question. So let me zoom out just a little bit. So over the past few years, as we've talked about on these calls, we've made incremental investments in our enterprise platform, and this work really underscores our ability to open up the new opportunities and expand our TAM. Not just for Marriott, but for mid-market and enterprise in general.  Some of the work including our work on hotel APIs, our work on integrations in general, and our work on above-store configuration and reporting has given us a more confident stance in going after the enterprise segment.  In terms of the type of go-to market, it's a different structure than SMB. These are longer sales cycles. These are a little bit more targeted deals. We're often in a pilot and in a lab and then in terms of the competition, we think it's relatively Greenfield in terms of the enterprise opportunity. There's still quite a bit of legacy upmarket and we started to record certain wins. I mean, certainly we've announced Marriott and this allows us to be an approved vendor at Marriott. It's still very early days at Marriott, but when we think about some of the other wins across enterprise, Aman mentioned Ninety Nine Restaurant, we had also won Wetzel's Pretzels, which is 300-plus locations. I had already announced last quarter Golden Krust, which is north of 100 locations. And then we also won Philly Pretzel, which is 170 locations.  So our team is picking up momentum. They are more confident in their stance to go after the enterprise market. It's a relatively small team, but they're doing really good work to execute on this TAM expansion.  With regard to FreedomPay, you had mentioned that in your question. Listen, like I said, it's still early with Marriott, but the FreedomPay partnership really gives us a lot of flexibility to work with a certain segment of enterprise customers upmarket and further opens up the enterprise TAM.  You know, there's really two important things to leave you with on FreedomPay. Number one, it allows us to flexibly work with these enterprise customers who often have unique payment requirements. They are looking to solve payments across spa, hotel, restaurants, across these diverse businesses. So number one, it opens up some TAM and gives us some flexibility to work with these larger customers.  And then number two, often these large enterprise customers are locked into long-term contracts for both POS as well as payments. This allows us to have flexibility to go after them for POS and software, and we can partner with FreedomPay on those deals. And it just puts us in a stronger position of flexibility for the largest section of enterprise customers.  That being said, you're probably going to ask the question, well, what does this do for our core business? And listen, in our core business, both SMB, as well as regional and mid-market, this doesn't change our integrated platform between POS and payments. We continue to go to market quite well on the combined platform, and Toast Payments will always be an option. So I'll leave it there. Yes. Hey, Josh. Look, I think we don't guide to the booked location specifically, but I think the trends we're seeing, as I mentioned in terms of bookings and pipeline are consistent with what we've seen in the past, and the team's got a lot of confidence in their ability to continue to execute as they have been.  And I think, the strength that we saw in the first half of the year really is consistent with the strength that we've seen really over the past couple of years in our core SMB business, where as we get into markets deeper, we've talked about this in the past, we get more customer density, our rep tenure is increasing. Those are the things that are driving our productivity.  I think one other thing that the team is thinking about, just to give some color on that, is we're trying to balance, and we talked about this last quarter, what the team lands with an initial sales versus how they expand. And so the team is really trying to maximize the number of locations on the platform, while also booking as much of the platform up front. And that's a balance where we're trying to maximize win rate and location ads, right, with the ARPU on these deals that we're booking.  And so overall, I think, look at the highest level. We feel really good about the outlook for the second half of the year. Thank you. Yes Dan, good question. No, the answer is no. I mean, as you know it's always been a hybrid competitive space for the past decade. Competition is always throwing campaigns and targets against Toast. But with regard to the $0.99 fee, there's been no churn or impact to location adds and we're in execution mode in our core business and the competitive dynamics in our opinion remain the same. Our win rates look good and we're just plowing forward on execution. Hey Stephen, two things. Number one, it does come with healthy ARPU. So it does add another lever to drive ARPU growth over time similar to what Elena talked about. But then on the invoicing front, certainly is going to run on our rails and that's the second component, but it's healthy on both fronts.  I think the one thing I love about our customer base as I mentioned is, they tell us what they like and what they are missing. And for this one, it's another good example of going deeper into the TAM. And specifically for our core business or core SMB business, when 60% of SMB restaurants are offering catering, they are often doing it through manual processes or point solutions, and they tell us that an integrated platform is just better.  So it's still early. We're very much early in the life cycle of this product, but we're excited about the long-term opportunity for this product, because it's going to make the customer's life a lot easier, and then it's going to help us on the ARPU front? Hey Tim, yes. Just look I think at the highest level, the mix that we see between the opening and existing restaurants has largely remained consistent. We certainly do well when the new restaurants are opening up. But we also do \u2013 our team is able to get existing restaurants tours that are using a current system where there's legacy or cloud to switch over to Toast.  I think that there's to your question about as the \u2013 have seen more success of market in mid-market, that has been fundamentally changed I'd say, the mix of new opening versus existing restaurants. All right. Thank you."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Comparato: Thank you, Michael, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. First quarter results marked a strong start to the year, coming in ahead of expectations across the board. Our consistent execution delivered solid top line growth of over 50% and significant year-over-year margin improvement and is a function of our continued focus on our core strategy, driving location growth, more deeply serving all segments of the restaurant industry, and pushing the industry forward through continued product innovation. The restaurant industry is undergoing a generational shift to cloud-based technology and Toast is at the forefront of that change. We are uniquely positioned to help restaurants of all sizes and types, start, manage, grow and expand their businesses. While there remains some uncertainty in the broader macro environment, consumer spending at our restaurants remains healthy. The restaurant industry has proven its durability over time, and we believe it will continue to navigate challenges as they have many times in the past. Now turning to our Q1 results. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue grew 53% to $819 million. ARR increased 55% to $987 million and GPV was up 50% to $26.7 billion. At the same time, Q1 adjusted EBITDA improved to a $17 million loss compared to a $45 million loss in the previous year, driving an over 600 basis points improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. Our ability to deliver sustained top line momentum, while rapidly moving towards profitability, is a testament to our commitment to balancing investments in key growth areas with efficiency and cost discipline as we scale the business. On the back of our strong Q1, we raised full year revenue guidance 4% at the midpoint, which implies 37% year-over-year growth and increased our adjusted EBITDA guide with the midpoint of the range at breakeven. That increase is a result of the momentum we're seeing in the business and our commitment to the efficiency and cost discipline I just mentioned. Elena will provide more details about our outlook shortly. We continue to see healthy location growth, adding over 5,500 net new locations in Q1 and ending the quarter with approximately 85,000 total live locations. Our go-to-market strategy continues to efficiently drive strong ARR growth through both increased penetration with traction across the TAM and healthy ARPU growth. In the SMB space, our differentiated localized sales efforts continue to scale. We see that, as we're in markets longer and rep tenure increases, we can move markets into flywheel status, meaning higher inbound volume, higher win rates and greater penetration. In 1 mid-Atlantic City, where the rep tenure is above average at 2-plus years, the market tipped into a rapid growth stage and increased the number of locations by over 60% in 2 years to reach over 20% penetration amongst SMB restaurants. When it hit flywheel status, we saw lead volume increase, and it has remained elevated versus prior levels. This is 1 example of the growing number of flywheel markets and with only a small fraction of the SMB TAM in flywheel markets today, there's still tremendous opportunity ahead. As rep tenure and time in market increases, we expect more markets to benefit from the flywheel effect, our go-to-market approach creates enabling us to scale efficiently. So let me highlight some of our recent customer wins from across the TAM. In SMB, as Wisconsin Dell's based Buffalo Fills planned for this year's busy season and with positive referrals from other local restaurants, they shifted to Toast adopting 13 modules that span every pillar of the Toast offering. In the front of the house, Buffalo Fills will use Toast Go handhelds to work their multilevel dining space in banquet hall, mobile order and pay for additional table efficiency, and Toast Tables for managing their active wait list as well as several other modules to provide an enhanced guest experience. Back of house, our payroll and team management solution will streamline onboarding and scheduling with their sizable seasonal employee base. And our kitchen display systems will power smoother kitchen operations. They'll also use xtraCHEF to provide better invoice visibility and help ensure too much inventory isn't left over as the busy season wanes. While the SMB market is an obvious sweet spot for us, we're making good progress across different parts of the TAM and across restaurant types. Down market in the small SMB space, we're optimizing pricing and packaging to meet the needs of that customer segment and leveraging an e-commerce sales motion and self-service onboarding to efficiently grow in this segment. In the regional mid-market space, Toast recently added 8 more locations to Denver-based TAG Restaurant group bringing the group's full footprint of more than a dozen locations on to Toast. Toast was initially serving the fast casual side of TAG's portfolio and then expand it to higher-end FSR locations to allow TAG to have a single technology platform across its portfolio. TAG saw the benefits of a partner, who could seamlessly support all operations across its various restaurant types and is adding modules including third-party delivery, API integrations for our partner network, multi-location management for easy menu updates, invoicing and Toast Go handheld devices for its full-service locations. Moving further up market. In the first quarter, we signed a 300-plus location national QSR chain that wanted a more innovative technology partner with top-notch integration functionality, ease of use and better overall reporting visibility across its entire operating ecosystem. The breadth of these customer wins are clear examples of the power of our restaurant-specific integrated POS and software strategy and the range of customer sizes and types that we can serve. And that only 10% market share for U.S. restaurant locations, we're still very early in penetrating the domestic TAM. We expect to continue adding locations at a healthy clip, are investing to most effectively serve each segment of the TAM, and we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the big opportunity ahead of us. Our focus on the restaurant industry is a key differentiator and tenet of our product strategy. We are building the specific features and capabilities to meet the unique needs of different segments and types of restaurants, enabling us to deeply penetrate the entire TAM. Our Toast for hotels product, which integrates seamlessly into hotel's property management systems is a clear example of this motion in action. This product has opened up our ability to better serve hotel restaurants and we're seeing great momentum. In the first quarter, we signed family-owned Pacific Northwest Cornerstone McMenaman, which selected Toast for its entire portfolio of 57 pubs and breweries, many of which are located on McMenaman's hotel properties. McMenaman was attracted to Toast to help streamline operations and to leverage our powerful partner integrations. They look forward to implementing our all-in-one solution and using products including PMS integration, Toast Go handhelds, and Mobile Order & Pay to provide food and beverage access in more areas of their unique properties, from room service to garden picnics. McMenaman will also use xtraCHEF to modernize their approach to inventory management and Toast Online ordering in our kitchen display systems for additional efficiency. We are truly excited about the opportunities to transform guest hospitality experiences. Another example of where we're investing to further our abilities to more deeply serve each part of the TAM is in enterprise. We're adding enhanced reporting APIs, specific features for QSRs like POS screens designed to help staff enter orders faster, and improved multi-location management functionality aimed at making menu changes across hundreds or thousands of locations easier and faster. Additionally, Toast now has a P2PE listed payment solution, which when deployed, will meet the unique payment security requirements of this segment, and we believe the progress we're making to better serve this customer segment will enable us to further penetrate enterprise. In addition to investing in areas that can serve different parts of the TAM, our product strategy is anchored around building out a suite of solutions tailored for each of our restaurant stakeholders, restaurant operators, guests, employees and suppliers. An example of this is the recent launch of Toast Tables, our reservation and waitlist management solution. Tables broadens our ability to engage guests and provides our restaurant customers with more nimble ways to manage their operations through a single platform solution. This differentiated offering is seamlessly integrated with the rest of the Toast platform and allows restaurants to manage operations with 1 vendor at an affordable monthly price. Toast Tables is off to a fantastic start. In March alone, Toast Tables powered over 450,000 unique bookings. And since going beta, just a year ago, has reached thousands of restaurant locations, a feat that took other reservation providers many years to achieve. Toast Tables is emblematic of our ability to quickly innovate on evolving customer needs. Over a short period, a small team was able to build a solution, get it in the hands of several customers for testing, and feedback before going beta and going live. Our vertical focus provides us the room to innovate and tailor features to the specific needs of restaurants, while our go-to-market engine and large customer base provide us a rapid feedback loop and the ability to scale new products quickly and efficiently. As we've expanded our product and grown our customer base, we've become smarter about the varying rates customers will adopt our products. This is especially true with the growth and development of our upsell team. This team has grown significantly over the last year and it has allowed us to better balance both customer growth and product adoption. We're able to be more strategic about what products do best as part of the upfront sales motion versus at varying times in a customer's journey on Toast. With our consistent innovation engine, differentiated distribution motion and growth of our upsell team, we will continuously evaluate and refine this land-and-expand approach. So our teams are operating at full steam, and the progress we've had to start the year is proof that our focused strategy to grow locations and be the trusted platform to the restaurant industry, continue to innovate and invest to more deeply serve all segments of the restaurant industry, including building out enterprise and international is paying off. We recently had our brand launches in Canada Ireland and the U.K., marking another early step to unlock the significant opportunity outside of the U.S. As we execute on this growth strategy, we also remain focused on efficiency and cost discipline, putting us on track to sustain healthy growth and deliver adjusted EBITDA profit as the year progresses. Before closing, I want to thank our customers and our employees. We're off to a great start this year. The team is executing in all the right places to go after the large opportunity ahead of us while operating with efficiency as a north star. Now I'll turn the call over to Elena.\nElena Gomez : Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining. I want to start by thanking the entire Toast team for your hard work and steady execution. Our consistent momentum drove another solid quarter with both revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges. We continue to balance strong top line growth with disciplined investments evidenced by our fifth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. We remain in the early stages of an incredible opportunity to be the trusted technology partner of the restaurant industry. With our leading software and payment platform, differentiated go-to-market strategy and focused execution, we believe we have a long runway of sustained top line growth and margin expansion ahead. In Q1, we added over 5,500 net new locations, increasing the total number of live locations on our platform to approximately 85,000. Our go-to-market engine is executing at a high level and seeing success across the full breadth of the restaurant TAM, leading to the continued market share gains. In addition to the strength in SMB, as Chris discussed, we're also gaining momentum upmarket with key wins in the middle market segment, picking up traction in hotels and leveraging our e-commerce motion to gain share down market. Q2 is typically a seasonally strong quarter for location growth and combined with a strong pipeline and consistent go-to-market execution, we anticipate net new location adds in Q2 to be north of 6,500. Looking further ahead with the combination of consistent sales rep productivity, growth of flywheel markets, and traction across more parts of the TAM, we expect quarterly net location adds to be closer to the 6,000 range in the second half of the year compared to the 5,500 quarterly adds we saw in last year's second half. Total revenue grew 53% year-over-year to $819 million in the first quarter. ARR, which is our core operational metric, ended Q1 at $987 million, up 55% year-over-year. Subscription Services revenue grew 70% year-over-year in the first quarter, benefiting from healthy location growth and higher ARPU. SaaS ARPU on an ARR basis increased 16% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. I want to provide some context on ARPU growth going forward. Overall, we continue to focus on driving total ARR growth through a combination of both locations and sustainable ARPU expansion over the long term. Over the last 2 years, we drove a step function change in SaaS ARPU and doubled our location count, and this provided a tailwind of SaaS ARPU and revenue growth. Looking specifically at SaaS ARPU, it increased nearly 60% since the end of 2020, as we expanded from a point-of-sale offering to an integrated platform and shifted to selling the product on a platform basis. At the same time, we ramped several key new products, all of which led to landing much higher ARPU at bookings. In addition, as Chris discussed, as we develop our upsell motion, we have become more sophisticated about optimizing the mix of products with land booking. Our upsell team allows us to be more nimble about what we sell upfront and how we grow with customers over time, ensuring we phase in products at the right time for different customers. The investments we're making to expand across the TAM, coupled with adding products and features that are unique to restaurants underpin our 2 strategic growth vectors, locations and ARPU. The combination of these 2 are key to driving total ARR as we further penetrate the $55 billion market opportunity. We expect there will be a balance between the 2 of these in any given year and as we comp against the step-up in ARPU growth, we anticipate more moderate ARPU growth in 2023. We remain incredibly confident in the large and growing long-term SaaS ARPU opportunity as we continuously refine both our new business and upsell motions and further differentiate ourselves through ongoing product innovation. At over 2,000 of ARPU for the full featured product, Toast Tables is a great example of our ability to expand the ARPU opportunity and address more of the restaurants tech spend. Our long-term confidence is underpinned by the fact that we have a growing base of customers generating high SaaS ARPU. A great example of this is the Midwest brewery offering craft beer and food generates about average annual GPV and over 20,000 in SaaS ARPU. This customer is using a total of 9 modules, including online ordering, Mobile Order & Pay and Toast Tables. In addition, the customer is leveraging multiple Toast Go handhelds and a number of KDS to streamline operations. As we expand the platform, there are multiple paths we can offer customers to reach high SaaS ARPU. Approximately 10% of our locations have SaaS ARPU above $10,000. That's nearly double the percentage from the previous year. And at the end of Q1, 42% of locations were taking 6 plus modules, which is up from 36% in the previous year. Moving to FinTech Solutions. First quarter revenue grew 54% to $673 million, and gross profit was up 65% year-over-year to $150 million. GPV growth remains healthy and increased 50% year-over-year to $26.7 billion in Q1. Average annualized GPV per processing location was approximately $1.4 million, up 11% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Q1 year-over-year revenue growth benefited from the comparison to Omicron in 2022. We expect GPV growth to moderate for the balance of the year. Our nonpayment FinTech products led by Toast Capital drove approximately $26 million of gross profit in Q1. Demand for our Toast Capital offering remained strong in the quarter as we continue to provide eligible customers fast, flexible access to capital. In the quarter, Toast Capital originations totaled approximately $175 million or 70 basis points of GPV.  We remain uniquely positioned to manage the risk profile of the portfolio, thanks to our restaurant POS and payment processing data. That enables us to assess and monitor the health of a restaurant to inform our underwriting process and pricing and prudently balance risk while growing the product to help our customers grow. For example, Deadly Sport and Al, a sports bar on rooftop in Northern Virginia, used a portion of funding received through a Toast Capital loan to build a new pergola on the roof, adding 16 tables to the rooftop. The Pergola paid for itself for the span of 3.5 weeks and has contributed to a daily sales volume increase of over 10% month-over-month so far. This is a great example of our unique ability to provide our customers access to capital, which in turn benefits our business as customers leverage those loans to increase sales and drive growth, in short when our customer sales grow, we grow. Net take rate increased to 56 basis points with other fintech products contributing about 10 basis points, which was similar to Q4. Looking ahead, we anticipate Toast Capital will grow slower than the sequential GPV growth as Q2 is a seasonally strong for GPV. And keep in mind, Q1 benefits from higher debit mix while the mix of credit should increase through the course of the year. Overall, we continue to expect net take rate to be in the low 50 basis points range in the near term. In Q1, total gross profit grew nearly 87% year-over-year and was up 10% quarter-over-quarter to $189 million, resulting in a total gross margin of 23%. Looking at our recurring stream, subscription and fintech gross profit totaled $229 million in the first quarter, up 71% year-over-year. Turning to customer acquisition costs. Hardware revenue increased year-over-year due to both strong new bookings and upsells to existing customers as restaurants prepare for peak season. Hardware margins were slightly -- were down slightly versus the prior year. On the sales and marketing side, expenses were up 46% in the first quarter due to growth in the sales team over the past year as well as the timing of certain expenses like payroll tax, which we set in Q1 each year. We expect growth in sales and marketing to slow through the rest of the year as we lap investments we made to scale the sales team over the past year. As Chris mentioned, the launch of Toast Tables is the latest example of how R&D investments are driving product innovation that is further intensing the Toast platform and expanding our ARPU potential. We're also investing to support our expansion upmarket into the mid-market and enterprise segments. These investments will further differentiate our platform and unlock deeper penetration across the restaurant TAM, as proven by the progress we've made in the hotel segment with Toast for hotel restaurants and in our ability to offer a tailored set of products and services. Overall, we remain excited about our product pipeline and ability to drive sustained ARPU and location growth over the long term. In Q1, total general and administrative expenses increased 45% year-over-year. Excluding bad debt and credit-related expenses, G&A expenses grew 18% year-over-year, and we expect growth to moderate as the year progresses as we remain focused on driving efficiencies and managing headcount. Bad debt and credit-related expenses totaled $15 million in Q1, and the majority of this is due to the reserves related to Toast Capital. Total Q1 adjusted EBITDA was negative $17 million, and margin was negative 2.1%, an over 600 basis point improvement from prior year. Excluding bad debt and credit-related expenses, total OpEx growth slowed to 35% year-over-year, and we expect that growth to moderate as the year progresses as we focus on containing headcount growth to our most critical growth areas and driving efficiency across the business. Now let me turn to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $920 million to $950 million, representing 39% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of negative $10 million to 0, representing over 150 basis points of sequential margin improvement at the midpoint. Based on our strong Q1 performance and Q2 guidance, we increased our full year 2023 revenue expectations by 4% at the midpoint. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $3.71 billion to $3.8 billion, a 37% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Our updated full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range is negative $10 million to positive $10 million. At the midpoint, this implies we will be breakeven for the full year and profitable for the second half of the year. We also expect free cash flow to turn positive as the year progresses. The increase in our adjusted EBITDA guidance is a function of both the momentum we're seeing in the business and our relentless focus on a scalable, lean cost structure. Across the business, we are balancing investments in the massive opportunities through the technology backbone of the restaurant industry, while staying laser-focused on operating efficiencies to drive share gains, durable growth and consistent margin expansion. In closing, Q1 was a great start to the year, posting strong financial results and building on the momentum coming out of 2022. We're well positioned to drive sustained ARPU and location growth and create long-term shareholder value. Lastly, I want to thank all of our employees, customers and partners for helping to support our continued success. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley.\nJosh Baer : Nice quarter. Talking about momentum both in the mid-market, upmarket as well as down market. So a couple of questions there. How are you balancing product and go-to-market investments for those different segments? But then second, how should we think about the mix shift ahead and any potential impacts on GPV per location?\nChris Comparato: I can jump in, Josh, good question. I think we're taking a real balanced approach. I mean our core engine continues to hum at the next level. So when you look at the core SMB, we continue to be quite confident in that hyper local go-to-market engine and how well it's performing. At the same time, we are encouraged about what we\u2019re seeing in mid-market and enterprise. So I think you're going to continue to see us expand our TAM, but just make sure that we're measured in how we go up market. We're seeing some good pull, but we continue to be a little bit measured in our progress upmarket, the unit economics look really good. But again, we -- our core engine's humming, upmarket, we're seeing good demand. And then I'd say down market, we want to make sure that we don't lose that section of TAM. So when you see us push out e-commerce and self-service onboarding, it's to make sure that the entirety of the restaurant TAM in the U.S. is addressable by Toast. At the end of the day, we think we're well positioned to now address the entirety of the TAM, given the expansion examples that we've shown you.\nElena Gomez : Yes. Just to build on what Chris said, Josh, as well. We're going to always keep unit economics in mind. So we're going to come back to the payback period that we talk about, which is in the mid-teens, and that's how we're balancing those investments across the segments and pay particular attention to making sure that we always come back to that in the balanced way.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rayna Kumar with UBS.\nRayna Kumar : Last quarter, you announced the acquisition of Delphi Display Systems. Can you talk about the integration and how that's progressing and if it's helping you win share of market?\nChris Comparato: Yes, I can take that. So the integration of Delphi is progressing on track. So we're excited about the team's progress. Ken and the team are doing a great job. As you'll recall, they were already a partner of Toast. So we were already collaborating quite a bit in the field. The acquisition of Delphi is part of the continued commitment that we've made to help QSRs of all sizes, drive speed of service, unlock revenue, unlock drive-through, and become more efficient operations. So we're excited about this. It adds internal and external digital menu boards with order coordination within the Toast platform. So we're very excited about it. But we are seeing opportunities to increase the lead volume from Toast to Delphi, but I think it's important that it's still early in the integration process, and we're going to make sure that strategically, we make all the right moves early, so that it becomes a foundational component for our go-to-market across the QSR and enterprise space. But overall, we're happy with where it is. And we look forward to reporting some wins to you in future quarters.\nRayna Kumar : Got it. And just a follow-up on international. Can you just give us an update on how your international expansion is going? And you've talked about investing roughly $10 million to $20 million towards that segment of the market. Do you expect investments to further ramp up this year?\nElena Gomez : Yes. We're taking a very measured approach on international, but early -- and it's early or early in our investment there. But early traction has been really solid, I would say, it's not going to contribute meaningfully to revenue this year. But now we've got the foundation in place. We've done some brand awareness, which is what you guys saw over the last couple of months. And so now we're really focused on honing the go-to-market strategy and continuing to build this awareness. And then, of course, build out the platform on the product side. So we're not going to out the investment, but it's fair to say we'll invest a little bit more, but we're going to take a very measured approach on further investment.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Really great results here. So it sounds like stronger location addition expectations relative to ARPU where you see maybe a little bit of moderation, which is not surprising. So any call out on what specifically is driving this? Is it momentum in certain geos or restaurant types and locations? Just any additional color would be great.\nAman Narang: Sure. Look, as Chris and Elena mentioned on the call, we had a strong quarter on net adds, right, and are expecting a record quarter in Q2. Really proud of the way the team is executing across the board. We fundamentally continue to see the same trend we've mentioned in previous calls, where restaurant density and rep tenure in our flywheel markets drive improved productivity. A good example of this in the IR deck is this Mid-Atlantic region where you can see as you get more density in restaurants, you see the productivity improve. Our competitive win rates are strong, right? We win the maturity of the time when we get into the decision, regardless of whether it's QSR or FSRs, new restaurant openings or existing. And really at the macro level, those trends have been largely consistent with previous quarters. And I think we're seeing strong growth in our core SMB segment, right? And while going into new segments, as Chris mentioned on the call, including on market e-commerce as well as some really great wins in mid-market as well.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Terrific. That's great to hear. Just maybe to build on that a little bit. Just -- you mentioned the growth in the upsell teams and it's driving good balance there in terms of when to promote. But are you seeing any sort of change in or surprise, maybe I should add, in terms of the types of add-ons or services that restaurants are looking to add? I don't know if it's just things that are further from the core, like, say, payroll or things that are closer to the core, if you follow my question?\nAman Narang: Yes, it's a good question. I mean, look, I think -- I'll give you 1 -- one little example. So we see that when a brand new restaurants opening up to a new location, this could be an expansion of even an existing restaurant within our -- within our customer base. We tend to see higher attach of payroll whereas a customer that's already open, we see -- we call those restaurant switchers, right, on Toast. We see lower attachments apparel upfront and then our upsell team takes over and is able to upsell more of the platform over time. And I think -- but overall, I'll just go back to -- if you look at our ARR year-over-year, it's up 60%, and both locations and ARPU are contributing. And at the highest level, we see across our key products, the employee cloud, xtraCHEF, some of our guest products like Tables, as Chris and Elena mentioned on the call, we still see lots of opportunity to continue to scale attach. And new business ARPU on booking is still in the mid 5,000 range. And of course, our upsell motion continues to become a bigger factor in terms of the composition of revenue growth, and we expect that to complement output initial booking.\nTien-Tsin Huang : No, it's really interesting. Thanks for disclosing the subscription and the payment AR. That's great to see.\nOperator: Our next question is from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs.\nWill Nance : I wanted to maybe follow up on some of the flywheel markets that you guys talked about it. I think you mentioned a greater reliance on inbound channels in these markets. I'm wondering if you could provide any color on how customer acquisition costs vary between flywheel and non-flywheel markets? And then looking forward, you mentioned e-commerce and more self-service kind of being a focus in the future. Maybe you could just talk about how you're thinking about the outlook for customer acquisition costs in more mature markets in a steady state and maybe how that differs from some of these markets when they're in more growth mode?\nAman Narang: Yes. It's a good question. I mean, look, I think back to what I just shared, we continue to see that our strongest growth in our densest markets, right? So this is what we call flywheel markets. And basically, you've got higher restaurant density, you've got higher rep tenure, you've got higher brand awareness. That's what drives greater productivity. So it's really -- and we see this, by the way, in all of our markets as we're getting more and more market share. We're not seeing any impact in terms of productivity. In fact, we're seeing strong -- our strongest productivity in those markets. And we've got a good mix, whether it's urban markets, suburban markets, Tier 1 cities, smaller cities. We're seeing good mix. of markets where we're seeing this effect. And of course, as you've got more markets where you've got stronger productivity and a lot of us also drive much stronger customer referrals, you expect to see better unit economics in those markets relative to the markets where we're investing and don't have the same level of rep productivity. And I think in terms of your question on e-commerce and mid marketing, those are markets that are still a small portion of our overall customer base and even our overall growth rate. Most of our growth is still coming from our core SMB TAM. And in those segments, I think we are learning. But I think as Elena and Chris mentioned, we're very focused on unit economics across all of our segments. So even in the lower of the market, we're looking at things like self-service on purchase, self-service onboarding to make sure the uneconomic of those customers are healthy even if the ARPU is lower.\nChris Comparato: Yes. One way to think about it, Will, is to look at the entirety of the U.S. TAM, and make sure that we're adapting our go-to-market motion, our onboarding motion, our self-service motion to support that subsegment of the U.S. TAM. And the conclusion is that, the entirety of the U.S. TAM is now becoming more readily available to Toast. That's really the strategy behind that because we don't want to look at the U.S. TAM and say, well, geez, this section is unaddressable because we can't adapt to the platform or adapt our motions. And what we're seeing is high confidence that we can adapt our motions and we can adapt the platform so that customers of all sizes and types can subscribe and onboard to Toast. So that's really where that's coming from.\nWill Nance : Got it. I appreciate the detail. And then maybe a separate question in the same vein of growing locations and expanding ARPU. On the payment side, there\u2019s been kind of a lot out there in the market on price increases just in the acquiring space overall. I think some of your competitors are putting through some fairly large price increases. I guess, can you maybe talk about the desire to kind of pull that lever and keep pace with some of the market increases versus maybe marketing against it and using it for taking market share in the restaurant space?\nAman Narang: Yes. That\u2019s a good question. Look, we\u2019re always optimizing pricing and packaging for new customers. We\u2019ve done \u2013 while we\u2019re always optimizing, we\u2019ve not done any wholesale pricing changes for our customer base. And I think 1 thing we\u2019re testing right now is a usage-based fee. This is on our digital ordering suite, and this is fairly common in the industry. We see this as a near-term opportunity for us and expect to hear \u2013 you should expect to hear more from us on this in the future. But in terms of the wholesale price increase, that\u2019s not something we\u2019ve done.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tim Chiodo with Credit Suisse.\nTim Chiodo : Strong locations guide that you gave for the next 3 quarters. I'm sure that transparency was appreciated. Can you talk a little bit about what you're expecting in terms of any changes at all or the composition across the 3 buckets of gross adds, meaning brand-new restaurants, new locations added from your existing customers and then, of course, the restaurants that are switching over to you from either a legacy or a competitor. Is there anything that you're seeing changing there? And then there's a follow-up on new business formation.\nAman Narang: Yes. Look, I think maybe I'll give you a little bit of a boring answer here, but the mix of NROs versus existing restaurants in our base is relatively even, right? There's not anything material less change here. One thing just to keep in mind is when we talk about new restaurant opening, some of that is expansion from existing customers. So as our base goes up, that can play a bigger role and contribute to our growth. And I think we're able to successfully win new restaurant formations as well as existing restaurants that already have a fewer stock come in place. And our win rate on switchers rate -- one thing I call as our win rate on switchers does go up with rep tenure, so that is a tailwind as we get into more of these fiber markets that we should expect. In terms of mix on QSRs, the mix of QSRs is up from a year ago. That's tied to our push in Qs as we announced a year ago. And it's good to see the porting focus here in that segment that's allowed us to really gain share faster in the segment. One example of this is actually Chris and Elena shared customer stories. A customer called Golden Crust out of White Plains, that started off with 30 locations. It's recently expanded to 111 locations with us. And what they really value in the platform is all of our 3P integrations in Uber and DoorDash that's built in into our platform as well as some of the improvements we've made into our enterprise menu management capability. And so I think you should expect to see the mix of QSRs continue to pick up in our mix. But overall, beyond that, nothing else to report.\nTim Chiodo : Okay. Great. And just a brief related follow-up is just around when we look at some of the macro data from the Fed, et cetera, that shows a combination in food services, just the number of new applications being put in at levels that are just way higher than they were pre-COVID. Would you say in general that you're seeing across your core markets, an uptick in new restaurant formation? Is it relatively similar? Or is it higher or lower relative to maybe what you saw back in 2018, 2019-ish period?\nAman Narang: Yes. I think we've seen an elevated level of new restaurant openings in our portfolio for a while now, right? I don't think that's been going on for a little bit post COVID. And that trend, I think, is not new at this point.\nTim Chiodo : Excellent. Yes, point was more around it persisting, so that sounds like it is.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.\nStephen Sheldon : Congrats on the quarter. In terms of market share, I guess, how much room do you see there to continue replacing legacy vendors, micro, solo, et cetera, as you think about the next few years? And on that front, have you seen any uptick in interest or conversations from restaurants on some of the legacy vendors, especially given the cybersecurity issues that 1 of them recently faced? I guess has that driven any acceleration in replacement opportunities?\nAman Narang: Sure. When we look at -- I'll go back to what I said earlier, when we get into a decision, we've been a majority of the time and really compete well both against on-premise, and cloud providers. And we continue to see the same dynamic where it is really the biggest thing that we see is when the customer density and rep tenure in our strongest markets continues to be the biggest driver of rep activity. And of course, as Chris mentioned on the call, it's driven by awareness, top funnel, referrals, stronger close rates. And so the biggest thing that the team is focused on is to get into as -- get more of our markets into this dynamic we've talked about. And I think as Elena mentioned, we had a strong quarter on net locations adds in Q1, expect a record quarter in Q2. And obviously, that speaks to just the great execution from the team across both legacy providers as well as cloud providers.\nChris Comparato: Stephen, this is Chris. Some of those examples I gave in my script, Buffalo Fills, McMenaman, the TAG restaurant group, those are all examples of displacing legacy, by the way. And so we still think there's plenty of legacy out there to go after. But now we've obviously built a strong muscle to compete against both cloud as well as legacy. But the examples that I did mention today were all legacy displacements.\nStephen Sheldon : Perfect. That's really helpful. And just as we think about adjusted EBITDA over the rest of the year, it seems like you may hit the positive inflection point potentially a little sooner than expected. So just curious if relative to what you guided to last quarter, had investment spending plans have those changed at all? Or is it really just about stronger top line trends, continued efficiency and you're still planning more or less the same amount of spend on all the different growth initiatives that you, I guess, have underway?\nElena Gomez : Yes. I mean I think it's a little bit of both, right? On the top line, you see the momentum and the strong start to the year and Aman and Chris sort of touched on not only the rep tenure and flywheel markets, and how those are progressing. We also are seeing solid GPV trends ahead of our expectations in Q1 and then in April in line with what we typically see. So when you kind of put that together and you factor in a little bit of the macro backdrop, and then you look at the expense line, look, we've continued to deliver on adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Like I said on the script, 5 quarters in a row, that discipline is going to continue for the balance of the year. And you'll see OpEx moderate as the year goes on. So we're going to lean into the investments where we have high conviction and where we feel like there's going to be a strong return and then we'll scale back investments if they don't feel -- if they do not meet the hurdles of high ROI. So we are being very cautious and targeted in our investments, and that's what you'll see throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Cantwell with Wells Fargo.\nJeff Cantwell : Can you talk some more about your international launch? It seems like that's big news. What is that actually going to look like? For example, your sales team's already there in each of those markets equally or are you putting more emphasis in 1 particular market at the outset? And then what's your thinking about how quickly you can scale in each of those markets? I'm just trying to kind of get a feel for strategy for the pacing. Any color as you think about this next leg of your growth.\nElena Gomez : Yes, it's fair. So we've started -- we set out and started with investment in English-speaking countries. And we're really focused right now on honing the go-to-market motion, understanding the landscape and getting brand awareness out there. Canada is very much like our U.S. markets, so we're seeing really great traction there. We'll continue to obviously spend time in the U.K. and Ireland. But so far, the focus is get the -- hone the go-to-market motion, build out the platform today, only our core platform -- elements of our platform are available. We seek to continue to expand the platform that's available to the market. And over time, you'll see that drive more meaningful growth, but I think that's like I said on the call, our prior question, it is not going to have a meaningful contribution in the near term. But over the long term, we think of it as a great opportunity for this business.\nJeff Cantwell : Okay. Great. Which leads to my follow-up, which is just how do you think about balancing this move internationally with your ongoing drive to improve your profitability over time? I'm curious if there's a way to grow internationally while also expanding from our margins and profitability.\nElena Gomez : Yes. I mean, I think the 1 thing is that relative to our total investment in the business, it's not material. That said, we -- like I said earlier, we're really focused on making sure before we continue to invest, we sort of see proven results. And we're early in that journey. I think towards the back half of the year, we'll have a better feel for that. But so far, we're really encouraged by what we're seeing. The demand is healthy. So we're going to continue to look at that very carefully. I think we've got to balance and understand what will that business look like at a steady state, obviously, and that's what we're thinking about and making sure that when we come back to payback periods and unit economics, we try to focus on balancing the whole picture for the company, right? And so -- but it's going to take some time. We've got to scale that business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Beck with KeyBanc.\nJosh Beck : I wanted to go back to really some of the macro commentary. It feels pretty benign from some of the comments that you've made. When I look at the GPV per location as a same-store sales proxy kind of been running in the high single-digit range. Other probably more broader consumer payments companies have indicated in March and April, they saw things maybe slow or skewed towards more nondiscretionary categories. So just curious if you've had any observations that are worth calling out at the same-store sales level as we think about building out the models here.\nChris Comparato: Josh, demand was solid. When we look at Q1 trends, demand was solid, pretty much as expected. GPV came in ahead of our expectations for the quarter, and GPV per location was up 11%. And as a reminder, Q1 last year was impacted by Omicron but we're pleased with what we saw across the quarter. Within the quarter, similar to other reports that you're mentioning, March was slightly lower, but April is consistent with our expectations. So we continue to see consumers moving more spend to services like dining out versus retail. We believe that the industry trends with restaurant sales are outperforming overall retail. So that's encouraging. And we also think that consumer spend on dining and past economic slowdowns has been pretty resilient. So those are some comments on what we're seeing. I think the other thing is it's important to note that the value of our platform to restaurants becomes even more durable during tough times, because we help restaurants drive operational efficiencies and then we help restaurants drive revenue. So we feel like we're in a pretty good spot note in the dynamic both from consumers and restaurants and both are incredibly resilient.\nElena Gomez : Yes. I mean, just to build on that April is in line with what we expected. And just a reminder, May and June, our big months for us, particularly Mother's Day and Memorial Day weekend. So keep that in mind. But so far, April is in line with what we typically see.\nJosh Beck : Very helpful. And then I found the stat on -- I believe you said about 10% of locations are greater than $10,000 in ARPU, and I believe that mix almost doubled, you said year-over-year. So how should we think about maybe what is a ceiling there? And then when you were mentioning the moderation in SaaS ARR per location, should we be thinking about the type of level that we're in now, which I think was about a 5-point decel from last quarter as a good proxy? Should we be looking maybe more like the nominal growth? Just any more context there would be appreciated.\nElena Gomez : Yes. No, that's a great question. Yes, at the highest level to answer that question just directly, we think about it on -- for the full year. And so I would expect that to moderate somewhere in the plus or minus 10% for the full year. And we think that's incredibly healthy, especially when you put it in context to the step-up that we had over the last quarter -- the last 2 years, actually. I think on my script, I said it was over 60% -- over 50% growth over 2 years. So we know that, that's not going to continue. But 10% growth on an annualized basis is still very healthy. And then when you just zoom out and think about the bigger opportunity, all the innovation we're talking about, that's why we have so much conviction about the growth in ARR. We're seeing momentum in locations. We're seeing our upsell team do really well. We're seeing our ability to go back and -- go back and sell to our installed base more consistently. So when you look at all that and then that proof point that you mentioned, that 10% of our customers are spending more than $$10,000. That's just -- that cohort of customers on my script, I had a customer that's spending $20,000 in SaaS ARPU. So we're starting to see enough proof points of customers really leveraging the breadth of the platform, and we're going to continue to hone this muscle over time. But I would point you back to our North Star continues to be growth in ARR. We've got 2 vectors of growth, whether it's locations in ARPU, we feel incredibly confident about both of those.\nOperator: Our last question will be from Dave Koning with Baird.\nDave Koning : And I guess another question on profitability. It looks like the last couple of quarters and really the guidance for the year, I think, too assumes incremental EBITDA margins, something around low double digits on revenue growth or, I guess, incremental GPV growth, maybe closer to 30% to 35%. Is -- I mean, is that kind of in the ballpark? And is that kind of now a little bit of a pattern that we should expect going forward?\nElena Gomez : What was the -- I didn't hear the first metric he said.\nDave Koning : What was the incremental EBITDA margin? Well, just on revenue growth of like low double digits.\nElena Gomez : Yes. I mean I would just point you back to our guidance is the best way to think about that. Obviously, we're going to try to continue to deliver and we see the momentum in the business. We want to be balanced with the macro as well. But yes, you should see consistent margin improvement from us in the same way you've seen for the last 5 quarters.\nDave Koning : All right. And just maybe a quick follow-up. What was -- did you give monthly trends? I know the 50% GPV growth, but did you give kind of month by month, January through March?\nElena Gomez : No, we don't give that level of detail. But overall, the quarter was strong.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters for any closing remarks.\nChris Comparato: No closing remarks. We thank you all, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Sure. Look, as Chris and Elena mentioned on the call, we had a strong quarter on net adds, right, and are expecting a record quarter in Q2. Really proud of the way the team is executing across the board. We fundamentally continue to see the same trend we've mentioned in previous calls, where restaurant density and rep tenure in our flywheel markets drive improved productivity. A good example of this in the IR deck is this Mid-Atlantic region where you can see as you get more density in restaurants, you see the productivity improve. Our competitive win rates are strong, right? We win the maturity of the time when we get into the decision, regardless of whether it's QSR or FSRs, new restaurant openings or existing. And really at the macro level, those trends have been largely consistent with previous quarters. And I think we're seeing strong growth in our core SMB segment, right? And while going into new segments, as Chris mentioned on the call, including on market e-commerce as well as some really great wins in mid-market as well. Yes, it's a good question. I mean, look, I think -- I'll give you 1 -- one little example. So we see that when a brand new restaurants opening up to a new location, this could be an expansion of even an existing restaurant within our -- within our customer base. We tend to see higher attach of payroll whereas a customer that's already open, we see -- we call those restaurant switchers, right, on Toast. We see lower attachments apparel upfront and then our upsell team takes over and is able to upsell more of the platform over time. And I think -- but overall, I'll just go back to -- if you look at our ARR year-over-year, it's up 60%, and both locations and ARPU are contributing. And at the highest level, we see across our key products, the employee cloud, xtraCHEF, some of our guest products like Tables, as Chris and Elena mentioned on the call, we still see lots of opportunity to continue to scale attach. And new business ARPU on booking is still in the mid 5,000 range. And of course, our upsell motion continues to become a bigger factor in terms of the composition of revenue growth, and we expect that to complement output initial booking. Yes. It's a good question. I mean, look, I think back to what I just shared, we continue to see that our strongest growth in our densest markets, right? So this is what we call flywheel markets. And basically, you've got higher restaurant density, you've got higher rep tenure, you've got higher brand awareness. That's what drives greater productivity. So it's really -- and we see this, by the way, in all of our markets as we're getting more and more market share. We're not seeing any impact in terms of productivity. In fact, we're seeing strong -- our strongest productivity in those markets. And we've got a good mix, whether it's urban markets, suburban markets, Tier 1 cities, smaller cities. We're seeing good mix. of markets where we're seeing this effect. And of course, as you've got more markets where you've got stronger productivity and a lot of us also drive much stronger customer referrals, you expect to see better unit economics in those markets relative to the markets where we're investing and don't have the same level of rep productivity. And I think in terms of your question on e-commerce and mid marketing, those are markets that are still a small portion of our overall customer base and even our overall growth rate. Most of our growth is still coming from our core SMB TAM. And in those segments, I think we are learning. But I think as Elena and Chris mentioned, we're very focused on unit economics across all of our segments. So even in the lower of the market, we're looking at things like self-service on purchase, self-service onboarding to make sure the uneconomic of those customers are healthy even if the ARPU is lower. Yes. That's a good question. Look, we're always optimizing pricing and packaging for new customers. We've done \u2013 while we're always optimizing, we've not done any wholesale pricing changes for our customer base. And I think 1 thing we're testing right now is a usage-based fee. This is on our digital ordering suite, and this is fairly common in the industry. We see this as a near-term opportunity for us and expect to hear \u2013 you should expect to hear more from us on this in the future. But in terms of the wholesale price increase, that's not something we've done. Yes. Look, I think maybe I'll give you a little bit of a boring answer here, but the mix of NROs versus existing restaurants in our base is relatively even, right? There's not anything material less change here. One thing just to keep in mind is when we talk about new restaurant opening, some of that is expansion from existing customers. So as our base goes up, that can play a bigger role and contribute to our growth. And I think we're able to successfully win new restaurant formations as well as existing restaurants that already have a fewer stock come in place. And our win rate on switchers rate -- one thing I call as our win rate on switchers does go up with rep tenure, so that is a tailwind as we get into more of these fiber markets that we should expect. In terms of mix on QSRs, the mix of QSRs is up from a year ago. That's tied to our push in Qs as we announced a year ago. And it's good to see the porting focus here in that segment that's allowed us to really gain share faster in the segment. One example of this is actually Chris and Elena shared customer stories. A customer called Golden Crust out of White Plains, that started off with 30 locations. It's recently expanded to 111 locations with us. And what they really value in the platform is all of our 3P integrations in Uber and DoorDash that's built in into our platform as well as some of the improvements we've made into our enterprise menu management capability. And so I think you should expect to see the mix of QSRs continue to pick up in our mix. But overall, beyond that, nothing else to report. Yes. I think we've seen an elevated level of new restaurant openings in our portfolio for a while now, right? I don't think that's been going on for a little bit post COVID. And that trend, I think, is not new at this point. Sure. When we look at -- I'll go back to what I said earlier, when we get into a decision, we've been a majority of the time and really compete well both against on-premise, and cloud providers. And we continue to see the same dynamic where it is really the biggest thing that we see is when the customer density and rep tenure in our strongest markets continues to be the biggest driver of rep activity. And of course, as Chris mentioned on the call, it's driven by awareness, top funnel, referrals, stronger close rates. And so the biggest thing that the team is focused on is to get into as -- get more of our markets into this dynamic we've talked about. And I think as Elena mentioned, we had a strong quarter on net locations adds in Q1, expect a record quarter in Q2. And obviously, that speaks to just the great execution from the team across both legacy providers as well as cloud providers."

            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining. I want to start by thanking the entire Toast team for your hard work and steady execution. Our consistent momentum drove another solid quarter with both revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges. We continue to balance strong top line growth with disciplined investments evidenced by our fifth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. We remain in the early stages of an incredible opportunity to be the trusted technology partner of the restaurant industry. With our leading software and payment platform, differentiated go-to-market strategy and focused execution, we believe we have a long runway of sustained top line growth and margin expansion ahead. In Q1, we added over 5,500 net new locations, increasing the total number of live locations on our platform to approximately 85,000. Our go-to-market engine is executing at a high level and seeing success across the full breadth of the restaurant TAM, leading to the continued market share gains. In addition to the strength in SMB, as Chris discussed, we're also gaining momentum upmarket with key wins in the middle market segment, picking up traction in hotels and leveraging our e-commerce motion to gain share down market. Q2 is typically a seasonally strong quarter for location growth and combined with a strong pipeline and consistent go-to-market execution, we anticipate net new location adds in Q2 to be north of 6,500. Looking further ahead with the combination of consistent sales rep productivity, growth of flywheel markets, and traction across more parts of the TAM, we expect quarterly net location adds to be closer to the 6,000 range in the second half of the year compared to the 5,500 quarterly adds we saw in last year's second half. Total revenue grew 53% year-over-year to $819 million in the first quarter. ARR, which is our core operational metric, ended Q1 at $987 million, up 55% year-over-year. Subscription Services revenue grew 70% year-over-year in the first quarter, benefiting from healthy location growth and higher ARPU. SaaS ARPU on an ARR basis increased 16% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. I want to provide some context on ARPU growth going forward. Overall, we continue to focus on driving total ARR growth through a combination of both locations and sustainable ARPU expansion over the long term. Over the last 2 years, we drove a step function change in SaaS ARPU and doubled our location count, and this provided a tailwind of SaaS ARPU and revenue growth. Looking specifically at SaaS ARPU, it increased nearly 60% since the end of 2020, as we expanded from a point-of-sale offering to an integrated platform and shifted to selling the product on a platform basis. At the same time, we ramped several key new products, all of which led to landing much higher ARPU at bookings. In addition, as Chris discussed, as we develop our upsell motion, we have become more sophisticated about optimizing the mix of products with land booking. Our upsell team allows us to be more nimble about what we sell upfront and how we grow with customers over time, ensuring we phase in products at the right time for different customers. The investments we're making to expand across the TAM, coupled with adding products and features that are unique to restaurants underpin our 2 strategic growth vectors, locations and ARPU. The combination of these 2 are key to driving total ARR as we further penetrate the $55 billion market opportunity. We expect there will be a balance between the 2 of these in any given year and as we comp against the step-up in ARPU growth, we anticipate more moderate ARPU growth in 2023. We remain incredibly confident in the large and growing long-term SaaS ARPU opportunity as we continuously refine both our new business and upsell motions and further differentiate ourselves through ongoing product innovation. At over 2,000 of ARPU for the full featured product, Toast Tables is a great example of our ability to expand the ARPU opportunity and address more of the restaurants tech spend. Our long-term confidence is underpinned by the fact that we have a growing base of customers generating high SaaS ARPU. A great example of this is the Midwest brewery offering craft beer and food generates about average annual GPV and over 20,000 in SaaS ARPU. This customer is using a total of 9 modules, including online ordering, Mobile Order & Pay and Toast Tables. In addition, the customer is leveraging multiple Toast Go handhelds and a number of KDS to streamline operations. As we expand the platform, there are multiple paths we can offer customers to reach high SaaS ARPU. Approximately 10% of our locations have SaaS ARPU above $10,000. That's nearly double the percentage from the previous year. And at the end of Q1, 42% of locations were taking 6 plus modules, which is up from 36% in the previous year. Moving to FinTech Solutions. First quarter revenue grew 54% to $673 million, and gross profit was up 65% year-over-year to $150 million. GPV growth remains healthy and increased 50% year-over-year to $26.7 billion in Q1. Average annualized GPV per processing location was approximately $1.4 million, up 11% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Q1 year-over-year revenue growth benefited from the comparison to Omicron in 2022. We expect GPV growth to moderate for the balance of the year. Our nonpayment FinTech products led by Toast Capital drove approximately $26 million of gross profit in Q1. Demand for our Toast Capital offering remained strong in the quarter as we continue to provide eligible customers fast, flexible access to capital. In the quarter, Toast Capital originations totaled approximately $175 million or 70 basis points of GPV.  We remain uniquely positioned to manage the risk profile of the portfolio, thanks to our restaurant POS and payment processing data. That enables us to assess and monitor the health of a restaurant to inform our underwriting process and pricing and prudently balance risk while growing the product to help our customers grow. For example, Deadly Sport and Al, a sports bar on rooftop in Northern Virginia, used a portion of funding received through a Toast Capital loan to build a new pergola on the roof, adding 16 tables to the rooftop. The Pergola paid for itself for the span of 3.5 weeks and has contributed to a daily sales volume increase of over 10% month-over-month so far. This is a great example of our unique ability to provide our customers access to capital, which in turn benefits our business as customers leverage those loans to increase sales and drive growth, in short when our customer sales grow, we grow. Net take rate increased to 56 basis points with other fintech products contributing about 10 basis points, which was similar to Q4. Looking ahead, we anticipate Toast Capital will grow slower than the sequential GPV growth as Q2 is a seasonally strong for GPV. And keep in mind, Q1 benefits from higher debit mix while the mix of credit should increase through the course of the year. Overall, we continue to expect net take rate to be in the low 50 basis points range in the near term. In Q1, total gross profit grew nearly 87% year-over-year and was up 10% quarter-over-quarter to $189 million, resulting in a total gross margin of 23%. Looking at our recurring stream, subscription and fintech gross profit totaled $229 million in the first quarter, up 71% year-over-year. Turning to customer acquisition costs. Hardware revenue increased year-over-year due to both strong new bookings and upsells to existing customers as restaurants prepare for peak season. Hardware margins were slightly -- were down slightly versus the prior year. On the sales and marketing side, expenses were up 46% in the first quarter due to growth in the sales team over the past year as well as the timing of certain expenses like payroll tax, which we set in Q1 each year. We expect growth in sales and marketing to slow through the rest of the year as we lap investments we made to scale the sales team over the past year. As Chris mentioned, the launch of Toast Tables is the latest example of how R&D investments are driving product innovation that is further intensing the Toast platform and expanding our ARPU potential. We're also investing to support our expansion upmarket into the mid-market and enterprise segments. These investments will further differentiate our platform and unlock deeper penetration across the restaurant TAM, as proven by the progress we've made in the hotel segment with Toast for hotel restaurants and in our ability to offer a tailored set of products and services. Overall, we remain excited about our product pipeline and ability to drive sustained ARPU and location growth over the long term. In Q1, total general and administrative expenses increased 45% year-over-year. Excluding bad debt and credit-related expenses, G&A expenses grew 18% year-over-year, and we expect growth to moderate as the year progresses as we remain focused on driving efficiencies and managing headcount. Bad debt and credit-related expenses totaled $15 million in Q1, and the majority of this is due to the reserves related to Toast Capital. Total Q1 adjusted EBITDA was negative $17 million, and margin was negative 2.1%, an over 600 basis point improvement from prior year. Excluding bad debt and credit-related expenses, total OpEx growth slowed to 35% year-over-year, and we expect that growth to moderate as the year progresses as we focus on containing headcount growth to our most critical growth areas and driving efficiency across the business. Now let me turn to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $920 million to $950 million, representing 39% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of negative $10 million to 0, representing over 150 basis points of sequential margin improvement at the midpoint. Based on our strong Q1 performance and Q2 guidance, we increased our full year 2023 revenue expectations by 4% at the midpoint. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $3.71 billion to $3.8 billion, a 37% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Our updated full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range is negative $10 million to positive $10 million. At the midpoint, this implies we will be breakeven for the full year and profitable for the second half of the year. We also expect free cash flow to turn positive as the year progresses. The increase in our adjusted EBITDA guidance is a function of both the momentum we're seeing in the business and our relentless focus on a scalable, lean cost structure. Across the business, we are balancing investments in the massive opportunities through the technology backbone of the restaurant industry, while staying laser-focused on operating efficiencies to drive share gains, durable growth and consistent margin expansion. In closing, Q1 was a great start to the year, posting strong financial results and building on the momentum coming out of 2022. We're well positioned to drive sustained ARPU and location growth and create long-term shareholder value. Lastly, I want to thank all of our employees, customers and partners for helping to support our continued success. Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A. Yes. Just to build on what Chris said, Josh, as well. We're going to always keep unit economics in mind. So we're going to come back to the payback period that we talk about, which is in the mid-teens, and that's how we're balancing those investments across the segments and pay particular attention to making sure that we always come back to that in the balanced way. Yes. We're taking a very measured approach on international, but early -- and it's early or early in our investment there. But early traction has been really solid, I would say, it's not going to contribute meaningfully to revenue this year. But now we've got the foundation in place. We've done some brand awareness, which is what you guys saw over the last couple of months. And so now we're really focused on honing the go-to-market strategy and continuing to build this awareness. And then, of course, build out the platform on the product side. So we're not going to out the investment, but it's fair to say we'll invest a little bit more, but we're going to take a very measured approach on further investment. Yes. I mean I think it's a little bit of both, right? On the top line, you see the momentum and the strong start to the year and Aman and Chris sort of touched on not only the rep tenure and flywheel markets, and how those are progressing. We also are seeing solid GPV trends ahead of our expectations in Q1 and then in April in line with what we typically see. So when you kind of put that together and you factor in a little bit of the macro backdrop, and then you look at the expense line, look, we've continued to deliver on adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Like I said on the script, 5 quarters in a row, that discipline is going to continue for the balance of the year. And you'll see OpEx moderate as the year goes on. So we're going to lean into the investments where we have high conviction and where we feel like there's going to be a strong return and then we'll scale back investments if they don't feel -- if they do not meet the hurdles of high ROI. So we are being very cautious and targeted in our investments, and that's what you'll see throughout the year. Yes, it's fair. So we've started -- we set out and started with investment in English-speaking countries. And we're really focused right now on honing the go-to-market motion, understanding the landscape and getting brand awareness out there. Canada is very much like our U.S. markets, so we're seeing really great traction there. We'll continue to obviously spend time in the U.K. and Ireland. But so far, the focus is get the -- hone the go-to-market motion, build out the platform today, only our core platform -- elements of our platform are available. We seek to continue to expand the platform that's available to the market. And over time, you'll see that drive more meaningful growth, but I think that's like I said on the call, our prior question, it is not going to have a meaningful contribution in the near term. But over the long term, we think of it as a great opportunity for this business. Yes. I mean, I think the 1 thing is that relative to our total investment in the business, it's not material. That said, we -- like I said earlier, we're really focused on making sure before we continue to invest, we sort of see proven results. And we're early in that journey. I think towards the back half of the year, we'll have a better feel for that. But so far, we're really encouraged by what we're seeing. The demand is healthy. So we're going to continue to look at that very carefully. I think we've got to balance and understand what will that business look like at a steady state, obviously, and that's what we're thinking about and making sure that when we come back to payback periods and unit economics, we try to focus on balancing the whole picture for the company, right? And so -- but it's going to take some time. We've got to scale that business. Yes. I mean, just to build on that April is in line with what we expected. And just a reminder, May and June, our big months for us, particularly Mother's Day and Memorial Day weekend. So keep that in mind. But so far, April is in line with what we typically see. Yes. No, that's a great question. Yes, at the highest level to answer that question just directly, we think about it on -- for the full year. And so I would expect that to moderate somewhere in the plus or minus 10% for the full year. And we think that's incredibly healthy, especially when you put it in context to the step-up that we had over the last quarter -- the last 2 years, actually. I think on my script, I said it was over 60% -- over 50% growth over 2 years. So we know that, that's not going to continue. But 10% growth on an annualized basis is still very healthy. And then when you just zoom out and think about the bigger opportunity, all the innovation we're talking about, that's why we have so much conviction about the growth in ARR. We're seeing momentum in locations. We're seeing our upsell team do really well. We're seeing our ability to go back and -- go back and sell to our installed base more consistently. So when you look at all that and then that proof point that you mentioned, that 10% of our customers are spending more than $$10,000. That's just -- that cohort of customers on my script, I had a customer that's spending $20,000 in SaaS ARPU. So we're starting to see enough proof points of customers really leveraging the breadth of the platform, and we're going to continue to hone this muscle over time. But I would point you back to our North Star continues to be growth in ARR. We've got 2 vectors of growth, whether it's locations in ARPU, we feel incredibly confident about both of those. What was the -- I didn't hear the first metric he said. Yes. I mean I would just point you back to our guidance is the best way to think about that. Obviously, we're going to try to continue to deliver and we see the momentum in the business. We want to be balanced with the macro as well. But yes, you should see consistent margin improvement from us in the same way you've seen for the last 5 quarters. No, we don't give that level of detail. But overall, the quarter was strong."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. First quarter results marked a strong start to the year, coming in ahead of expectations across the board. Our consistent execution delivered solid top line growth of over 50% and significant year-over-year margin improvement and is a function of our continued focus on our core strategy, driving location growth, more deeply serving all segments of the restaurant industry, and pushing the industry forward through continued product innovation. The restaurant industry is undergoing a generational shift to cloud-based technology and Toast is at the forefront of that change. We are uniquely positioned to help restaurants of all sizes and types, start, manage, grow and expand their businesses. While there remains some uncertainty in the broader macro environment, consumer spending at our restaurants remains healthy. The restaurant industry has proven its durability over time, and we believe it will continue to navigate challenges as they have many times in the past. Now turning to our Q1 results. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue grew 53% to $819 million. ARR increased 55% to $987 million and GPV was up 50% to $26.7 billion. At the same time, Q1 adjusted EBITDA improved to a $17 million loss compared to a $45 million loss in the previous year, driving an over 600 basis points improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. Our ability to deliver sustained top line momentum, while rapidly moving towards profitability, is a testament to our commitment to balancing investments in key growth areas with efficiency and cost discipline as we scale the business. On the back of our strong Q1, we raised full year revenue guidance 4% at the midpoint, which implies 37% year-over-year growth and increased our adjusted EBITDA guide with the midpoint of the range at breakeven. That increase is a result of the momentum we're seeing in the business and our commitment to the efficiency and cost discipline I just mentioned. Elena will provide more details about our outlook shortly. We continue to see healthy location growth, adding over 5,500 net new locations in Q1 and ending the quarter with approximately 85,000 total live locations. Our go-to-market strategy continues to efficiently drive strong ARR growth through both increased penetration with traction across the TAM and healthy ARPU growth. In the SMB space, our differentiated localized sales efforts continue to scale. We see that, as we're in markets longer and rep tenure increases, we can move markets into flywheel status, meaning higher inbound volume, higher win rates and greater penetration. In 1 mid-Atlantic City, where the rep tenure is above average at 2-plus years, the market tipped into a rapid growth stage and increased the number of locations by over 60% in 2 years to reach over 20% penetration amongst SMB restaurants. When it hit flywheel status, we saw lead volume increase, and it has remained elevated versus prior levels. This is 1 example of the growing number of flywheel markets and with only a small fraction of the SMB TAM in flywheel markets today, there's still tremendous opportunity ahead. As rep tenure and time in market increases, we expect more markets to benefit from the flywheel effect, our go-to-market approach creates enabling us to scale efficiently. So let me highlight some of our recent customer wins from across the TAM. In SMB, as Wisconsin Dell's based Buffalo Fills planned for this year's busy season and with positive referrals from other local restaurants, they shifted to Toast adopting 13 modules that span every pillar of the Toast offering. In the front of the house, Buffalo Fills will use Toast Go handhelds to work their multilevel dining space in banquet hall, mobile order and pay for additional table efficiency, and Toast Tables for managing their active wait list as well as several other modules to provide an enhanced guest experience. Back of house, our payroll and team management solution will streamline onboarding and scheduling with their sizable seasonal employee base. And our kitchen display systems will power smoother kitchen operations. They'll also use xtraCHEF to provide better invoice visibility and help ensure too much inventory isn't left over as the busy season wanes. While the SMB market is an obvious sweet spot for us, we're making good progress across different parts of the TAM and across restaurant types. Down market in the small SMB space, we're optimizing pricing and packaging to meet the needs of that customer segment and leveraging an e-commerce sales motion and self-service onboarding to efficiently grow in this segment. In the regional mid-market space, Toast recently added 8 more locations to Denver-based TAG Restaurant group bringing the group's full footprint of more than a dozen locations on to Toast. Toast was initially serving the fast casual side of TAG's portfolio and then expand it to higher-end FSR locations to allow TAG to have a single technology platform across its portfolio. TAG saw the benefits of a partner, who could seamlessly support all operations across its various restaurant types and is adding modules including third-party delivery, API integrations for our partner network, multi-location management for easy menu updates, invoicing and Toast Go handheld devices for its full-service locations. Moving further up market. In the first quarter, we signed a 300-plus location national QSR chain that wanted a more innovative technology partner with top-notch integration functionality, ease of use and better overall reporting visibility across its entire operating ecosystem. The breadth of these customer wins are clear examples of the power of our restaurant-specific integrated POS and software strategy and the range of customer sizes and types that we can serve. And that only 10% market share for U.S. restaurant locations, we're still very early in penetrating the domestic TAM. We expect to continue adding locations at a healthy clip, are investing to most effectively serve each segment of the TAM, and we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the big opportunity ahead of us. Our focus on the restaurant industry is a key differentiator and tenet of our product strategy. We are building the specific features and capabilities to meet the unique needs of different segments and types of restaurants, enabling us to deeply penetrate the entire TAM. Our Toast for hotels product, which integrates seamlessly into hotel's property management systems is a clear example of this motion in action. This product has opened up our ability to better serve hotel restaurants and we're seeing great momentum. In the first quarter, we signed family-owned Pacific Northwest Cornerstone McMenaman, which selected Toast for its entire portfolio of 57 pubs and breweries, many of which are located on McMenaman's hotel properties. McMenaman was attracted to Toast to help streamline operations and to leverage our powerful partner integrations. They look forward to implementing our all-in-one solution and using products including PMS integration, Toast Go handhelds, and Mobile Order & Pay to provide food and beverage access in more areas of their unique properties, from room service to garden picnics. McMenaman will also use xtraCHEF to modernize their approach to inventory management and Toast Online ordering in our kitchen display systems for additional efficiency. We are truly excited about the opportunities to transform guest hospitality experiences. Another example of where we're investing to further our abilities to more deeply serve each part of the TAM is in enterprise. We're adding enhanced reporting APIs, specific features for QSRs like POS screens designed to help staff enter orders faster, and improved multi-location management functionality aimed at making menu changes across hundreds or thousands of locations easier and faster. Additionally, Toast now has a P2PE listed payment solution, which when deployed, will meet the unique payment security requirements of this segment, and we believe the progress we're making to better serve this customer segment will enable us to further penetrate enterprise. In addition to investing in areas that can serve different parts of the TAM, our product strategy is anchored around building out a suite of solutions tailored for each of our restaurant stakeholders, restaurant operators, guests, employees and suppliers. An example of this is the recent launch of Toast Tables, our reservation and waitlist management solution. Tables broadens our ability to engage guests and provides our restaurant customers with more nimble ways to manage their operations through a single platform solution. This differentiated offering is seamlessly integrated with the rest of the Toast platform and allows restaurants to manage operations with 1 vendor at an affordable monthly price. Toast Tables is off to a fantastic start. In March alone, Toast Tables powered over 450,000 unique bookings. And since going beta, just a year ago, has reached thousands of restaurant locations, a feat that took other reservation providers many years to achieve. Toast Tables is emblematic of our ability to quickly innovate on evolving customer needs. Over a short period, a small team was able to build a solution, get it in the hands of several customers for testing, and feedback before going beta and going live. Our vertical focus provides us the room to innovate and tailor features to the specific needs of restaurants, while our go-to-market engine and large customer base provide us a rapid feedback loop and the ability to scale new products quickly and efficiently. As we've expanded our product and grown our customer base, we've become smarter about the varying rates customers will adopt our products. This is especially true with the growth and development of our upsell team. This team has grown significantly over the last year and it has allowed us to better balance both customer growth and product adoption. We're able to be more strategic about what products do best as part of the upfront sales motion versus at varying times in a customer's journey on Toast. With our consistent innovation engine, differentiated distribution motion and growth of our upsell team, we will continuously evaluate and refine this land-and-expand approach. So our teams are operating at full steam, and the progress we've had to start the year is proof that our focused strategy to grow locations and be the trusted platform to the restaurant industry, continue to innovate and invest to more deeply serve all segments of the restaurant industry, including building out enterprise and international is paying off. We recently had our brand launches in Canada Ireland and the U.K., marking another early step to unlock the significant opportunity outside of the U.S. As we execute on this growth strategy, we also remain focused on efficiency and cost discipline, putting us on track to sustain healthy growth and deliver adjusted EBITDA profit as the year progresses. Before closing, I want to thank our customers and our employees. We're off to a great start this year. The team is executing in all the right places to go after the large opportunity ahead of us while operating with efficiency as a north star. Now I'll turn the call over to Elena. I can jump in, Josh, good question. I think we're taking a real balanced approach. I mean our core engine continues to hum at the next level. So when you look at the core SMB, we continue to be quite confident in that hyper local go-to-market engine and how well it's performing. At the same time, we are encouraged about what we're seeing in mid-market and enterprise. So I think you're going to continue to see us expand our TAM, but just make sure that we're measured in how we go up market. We're seeing some good pull, but we continue to be a little bit measured in our progress upmarket, the unit economics look really good. But again, we -- our core engine's humming, upmarket, we're seeing good demand. And then I'd say down market, we want to make sure that we don't lose that section of TAM. So when you see us push out e-commerce and self-service onboarding, it's to make sure that the entirety of the restaurant TAM in the U.S. is addressable by Toast. At the end of the day, we think we're well positioned to now address the entirety of the TAM, given the expansion examples that we've shown you. Yes, I can take that. So the integration of Delphi is progressing on track. So we're excited about the team's progress. Ken and the team are doing a great job. As you'll recall, they were already a partner of Toast. So we were already collaborating quite a bit in the field. The acquisition of Delphi is part of the continued commitment that we've made to help QSRs of all sizes, drive speed of service, unlock revenue, unlock drive-through, and become more efficient operations. So we're excited about this. It adds internal and external digital menu boards with order coordination within the Toast platform. So we're very excited about it. But we are seeing opportunities to increase the lead volume from Toast to Delphi, but I think it's important that it's still early in the integration process, and we're going to make sure that strategically, we make all the right moves early, so that it becomes a foundational component for our go-to-market across the QSR and enterprise space. But overall, we're happy with where it is. And we look forward to reporting some wins to you in future quarters. Yes. One way to think about it, Will, is to look at the entirety of the U.S. TAM, and make sure that we're adapting our go-to-market motion, our onboarding motion, our self-service motion to support that subsegment of the U.S. TAM. And the conclusion is that, the entirety of the U.S. TAM is now becoming more readily available to Toast. That's really the strategy behind that because we don't want to look at the U.S. TAM and say, well, geez, this section is unaddressable because we can't adapt to the platform or adapt our motions. And what we're seeing is high confidence that we can adapt our motions and we can adapt the platform so that customers of all sizes and types can subscribe and onboard to Toast. So that's really where that's coming from. Stephen, this is Chris. Some of those examples I gave in my script, Buffalo Fills, McMenaman, the TAG restaurant group, those are all examples of displacing legacy, by the way. And so we still think there's plenty of legacy out there to go after. But now we've obviously built a strong muscle to compete against both cloud as well as legacy. But the examples that I did mention today were all legacy displacements. Josh, demand was solid. When we look at Q1 trends, demand was solid, pretty much as expected. GPV came in ahead of our expectations for the quarter, and GPV per location was up 11%. And as a reminder, Q1 last year was impacted by Omicron but we're pleased with what we saw across the quarter. Within the quarter, similar to other reports that you're mentioning, March was slightly lower, but April is consistent with our expectations. So we continue to see consumers moving more spend to services like dining out versus retail. We believe that the industry trends with restaurant sales are outperforming overall retail. So that's encouraging. And we also think that consumer spend on dining and past economic slowdowns has been pretty resilient. So those are some comments on what we're seeing. I think the other thing is it's important to note that the value of our platform to restaurants becomes even more durable during tough times, because we help restaurants drive operational efficiencies and then we help restaurants drive revenue. So we feel like we're in a pretty good spot note in the dynamic both from consumers and restaurants and both are incredibly resilient. No closing remarks. We thank you all, and have a great day."

Finally, the press release can be found on the Investor Relations website at investors.toasttab.com. After the call, a replay will be available on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Aman.\nAman Narang: Thank you, Michael, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. We delivered another strong quarter. We added approximately 7,000 net locations. Our recurring gross profit streams grew 35% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $113 million and our GAAP operating income was $34 million. I'm really proud of the team and I'm confident we're well-positioned to finish out the year strong and bring this momentum with us into 2025. Our mission at Toast is to help restaurants delight their guests do what they love and pride. We proudly serve nearly 127,000 locations today. And our long-term ambition is to scale this impact across new geographies, new market segments and new verticals. As we think about not just the coming years, but what's possible over the next decade, I firmly believe we can serve many multiples of our current customer count by both increasing market penetration in our current market segments and continuing to expand our addressable markets over time. Over the past year, we've been focused on making disciplined investments that align with our most important priorities and support our long-term vision. And we have so much to be proud of. While the progress over the past 10 years has been tremendous, we're still early in unlocking the full potential of the opportunity that lies ahead. We've increased our outlook for the full year based on our performance in the third quarter and we remain focused on the four strategic priorities we laid out earlier this year. Number one, scaling locations and market share in our core business. Number two, expanding our offering for restaurants with products customers love. Number three, expanding our addressable market into new adjacencies. And finally number four, setting up the company to deliver ongoing operating leverage as we scale. First, scaling restaurant locations and gaining share in our core business. Over the past three years, we've more than doubled our market share in the U.S. Including recently signed mid-market brands, Metro Diner, Giordano's Pizza and Earl Corporation. We're still only at 14% penetration. Our purpose-built restaurant platform and local go-to-market engine creates a flywheel effect as we increase density in local markets driving approximately 7,000 net adds in the quarter. Our customers continue to choose Toast as they expand locations, solidifying our position in the market as the choice for growing successful restaurants. Here's a story that speaks to this momentum. Cultivate Food & Coffee is a full service restaurant and coffee concept in the Atlanta area that recently opened their third location with Toast. Cultivate uses a variety of Toast products to increase speed of service and reduce errors across their locations. For example, servers are able to process orders and half the time with 80% fewer errors using our Tosco handheld. And even though Cultivate's new location has more complex payroll needs than before, managers are able to save time and process payroll in just minutes through Toast. These time savings add up. We heard from Cultivate that the efficiency gains from Toast, free them up to create a positive environment for staff and memorable experiences for guests. It's stories like this that inspire us and our team to keep innovating. Moving on our second priority is expanding our offering for restaurants with products and experiences customers love. To help our customers drive demand, we've recently released two new products to help restaurants reach their guests, branded app and SMS marketing. First, our new branded app allows our customers to build best-in-class native app experiences for iOS and Android including integrated digital ordering, delivery, loyalty and more. This helps our customers level the playing field with much larger brands at a fraction of the cost, and has been particularly successful with our multi-unit SMBs and mid-market customers. This build on our website product released earlier this year, as we round out the guest-facing products included in our essential premium and pro tiers of our digital storefront suite. With multiple offerings at various price points, we now provide options for a variety of different businesses and show our customers how they can expand with us as they grow. And our customers are already seeing increased guest loyalty through our branded app powered experience. For example, guests who order through the app are 4x more likely to be repeat customers than those who order through a restaurant's website. Peetaway, our fast casual Mediterranean restaurant with 37 locations across the Midwest So orders from their newly launched branded app make up almost 15% of the digital sales, since they've launched. Second, we added a highly requested capability in SMS marketing to our marketing suite to help our customers reach their guests directly and generate more revenue. Our customers will be the first tell you, SMS marketing just works. Spaghettini a full service Italian restaurant in California attributed over 11,000 in sales to SMS marketing in its first month alone. It's a critical tool when business is slow. For example, during a quiet period, Spaghettini sold out their surf and turf special after promoting it with the tax campaign. But we're not just expanding our offering by releasing new products. Our vertical SaaS strategy goes deep and focuses on a wide range of unique restaurant-first capabilities. What we refer to as our 1,000 little things. This fall alone, we released over a dozen updates across products like Toast Now, benchmarking, kiosks, Toast Tables and payroll in response to direct customer feedback. Switching gears, our third priority is expanding our addressable market into new adjacencies including food and beverage retail, international and enterprise. These new verticals represent meaningful TAMs, where we see a right to win. And our investments in these areas position us to drive sustained location growth over the long-term. We continue to see great signal across these market segments, which has given us even more conviction to increase our investments in these areas, as we head into 2025. In food and beverage retail, we've expanded product functionality to now accept EBT/SNAP benefits, which opens up more of the grocery and convenience store TAM. We're proud to be able to serve the over 42 million Americans who rely on SNAP, including customers at Gangnam Market, a 28,000 square foot market in Chicago that does over $10 million in sales annually and manages over 15,000 SKUs. Gangnam's markets owners new Toast would be able to meet their needs of this new concept because they've already used Toast in their restaurants in the past. Next in international, we're continuing to see momentum with our month over month gains in attach for our guest products that we rolled out early this year, which is helping us drive our unit economics and sales productivity. Customers in the UK, Ireland and Canada can now also access Toast Now, our mobile operator app, where they can view real time data about the restaurant. As we continue to invest internationally and see the attach rates of our products improve, we have even more conviction in what international markets represent for Toast, as long-term growth drivers. And within enterprise, I'm excited to announce with Potbelly Sandwich Works and we'll be deploying Toast across their 400 plus locations in the U.S., our pipeline entering 2025 is really strong and we continue to make progress across our rollouts with Marriott, NTY Group, NBC and many others. And lastly, our fourth priority is to continue to deliver ongoing operating leverage as we scale. In 2024, we reshaped our cost structure, positioning us to invest behind our priorities we've laid out to drive durable growth over the long-term, while continuing to expand our margins towards the target we presented at our Investor Day. I'm confident in our team's ability to make the right trade-offs and set us up for the future. As I wrap up, I'm so confident in our team, the plan we have in place and the opportunity ahead of us. Thank you to every Toaster for your dedication and passion for our mission. There's no question we wouldn't be here without you. Thank you to our customers. It's an honor to serve you. And to our investors, thank you for continuing to believe in us and our potential. Now I'll turn the call over to Elena to share more about this quarter's results.\nElena Gomez: Thank you, Aman, and thank you to everyone for joining. I also want to thank our employees whose hard work and consistent execution led to another successful quarter with top and bottom-line results exceeding expectations. In the third quarter, ARR increased 28% and total fintech and subscription gross profit our recurring gross profit streams grew 35%. Our strong top-line growth is complemented by our efficient and disciplined approach to scaling the business, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $113 million, a 30% margin on our recurring gross profit streams and GAAP operating income of $34 million. Third quarter results came in above our expectations, driven by strong top-line results, including a higher contribution from Toast Capital and upside to SaaS revenue. We added approximately 7,000 net locations in third quarter, increasing total locations to nearly 127,000, up 28% year-over-year. The combination of our purpose-built platform and localized go-to-market motion continue to drive our momentum. With our strong performance year-to-date, we remain on track to deliver more net location adds in 2024 versus 2023. SaaS ARR grew 33% year-over-year, driven by strong location growth and a 4% increase in SaaS ARPU on an ARR basis. Subscription revenue increased 44% year-over-year, growing faster than SaaS ARR due to ongoing focus across the organization to improve our ARR to revenue conversion. Part of that improvement is sustainable going forward. And part of the increase in subscription revenue was a one-time benefit. Payments ARR grew 23% and Fintech gross profit increased 27% in the third quarter. GPD was $41.7 billion growing 24% year-over-year with GPD per location down approximately 3% versus last year. Net take rate was 56 basis points with a core net take rate of 45 basis points. We made targeted payment pricing changes for a small cohort of customers in September. It had minimal impact in the quarter and we expect a small benefit to net trade grade in Q4. As we've discussed, we are building a motion for ongoing small, targeted price adjustments and view pricing as one lever to complement our primary growth drivers over the long-term. Gross profit from non-payments Fintech Solutions increased to $43 million driven by healthy demand for Toast Capital. Defaults remain in line with our expectations and due to continued optimization and the addition of forward flow, bad debt associated with Toast Capital is down relative to prior year, even as we scale the program. Let me share one story that shows how customers value the fast, low friction access to capital to grow their business. The Baum Group, which owns the popular Speakeasy and Ice Cream Shop, UES in New York City, used Toast Capital help with early operations for a new concept called Champagne Problems, they opened earlier this year. The quick and seamless access to funding allowed the owner to maintain strategic control of her business, while avoiding the time and complexity associated with traditional loans. The Baum Group considers Toast to be an ideal partner for growth, given Toast's unique visibility into their financials and business operations and plans to use Toast Capital to help with future expansions. Shifting back to the P&L, total operating expenses including bad debt and credit related expenses increased 11% year-over-year in the third quarter, accelerating versus the first half of 2024 due to the planned investments in our highest priority areas. Sales and marketing expenses were up 25% year-over-year in Q3, as we made targeted investments across our TAM expansion areas, upsell and U.S. go-to-market channels to increase market share gains. R&D increased 5% year-over-year in the third quarter, reflecting investments aligned with our product strategy. As Aman mentioned, recently we recently announced SMS marketing, branded app and over a dozen new features across our platform, reflecting the continued innovation to further differentiate our offering and provide more value for our customers. We're also investing behind our TAM expansion areas. In retail, we're adding more product integrations like accepting SNAP/EBT payments and our grocery and convenience segments and deepening our retail inventory management offering. Internationally, we're rolling out more products, including Toast Now, gift cards and expanding third-party integrations. Excluding $18 million of bad debt and credit related expenses, G&A declined 8% year-over-year. We expect to continue operating leverage in G&A as we maintain a focus on driving efficiencies, including through automation and global diversification of our workforce. Adjusted EBITDA was $113 million in the quarter and margins expanded 17 percentage points year-over-year to 30%. The strong Q3 results reflect a healthy top line growth and our commitment to prudently scaling the business, while balancing investments in more nascent areas like food and beverage retail, international and enterprise to lay the foundation to deliver durable growth for years to come. Our Q3 margin also benefits from typical payment seasonality. GAAP operating income was $34 million in Q3, reflecting our strong operating performance and disciplined approach to managing stock-based compensation expenses, and free cash flow totaled $97 million in the Q3. Moving to capital allocation. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we repurchased over 2 million shares for $56 million for an average price of $23 per share. Early in the third quarter, we also repurchased a warrant representing 5 million shares, reflecting our focus on reducing dilution. We will continue to be opportunistic based on market conditions and act judiciously in support of building long-term shareholder value. Turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect total subscription and Fintech gross profit to grow in the 32% to 35% range, year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA to be $90 million to $100 million. The sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA and margin compared to the third quarter reflects typical seasonal decline in the fourth quarter of GPV per location, as well as our planned ongoing reinvestments to set ourselves up for sustained healthy growth in both 2025 and over the long-term. For the full year, we now expect 32% to 33% growth in Fintech and subscription gross profit and $352 million to $362 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a 26% adjusted EBITDA margin at the midpoint, marking approximately 20 percentage point improvement in margin versus last year. Thus far, in 2024, we have delivered meaningful adjusted EBITDA outperformance and significant margin expansion after resetting our cost structure at the beginning of the year and aligning our investments with our highest priority areas. As we exit the year, our strong financial profile enables us to invest in the business to position us for both a strong 2025 and long-term durable growth. We will focus on balancing growth with modest margin expansion as we march towards the 30% to 35% medium-term goal we laid out at Investor Day. To wrap up, we are executing across the board and extremely proud of what we have accomplished so far in 2024 and in our position heading into 2025. Now, I will turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Josh Baer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thanks for the question. And congrats on a nice quarter. Question is on location growth ahead. Your TAM is expanding, execution is strong, you benefit from more efficiency in your density markets. And you're talking about bringing the momentum from this year into 2025. Does that mean that you can add more locations in '25 versus '24? Is it a similar number? Just wondering how you're thinking about the trajectory of location additions.\nAman Narang: Hi, Josh. Look, I'll start by saying we've had a great quarter, and we had 7,000 net adds. I think overall for the year, we've got strong net adds in 2024. It's really led by our flywheel markets and our core business. These flywheel markets continue to drive strong productivity and stronger productivity than our other markets, and number of flywheel markets continues to increase. In parallel, we're seeing good early momentum in CBG Retail and our Horizon One international markets. And that does give us more conviction to invest more in those businesses next year. We also had a great win in top billing enterprise, continue to see momentum there as well, steady momentum. If you just zoom out and think about the next decade before next year, like we recognize that it's critical like to both scale and drive market share in our core U.S. business now while expanding our TAM across new verticals and new market segments. Overall, we're confident in our ability to continue to drive location growth in the next year.\nJosh Baer: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nAman Narang: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Samad Samana from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Good evening and thanks for taking my questions. Great to see the strong results. Maybe first I'll start on some of the newer items that you mentioned, so like the branded app and the SMS marketing, other ways for you guys to continue to add value that are not just kind of core instead of the restaurant. Just how are we thinking about the upsell or cross sell motion of those products? Is it a different type of sale? And how should we think about maybe attach rates? And then just Elena, is there a different gross margin profile for those revenue streams?\nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks, Samad. I can start and Elena you can jump in after. The branded app and the SMS marketing tools, they're really nice additions to our guest suite to help our customers drive loyalty and demand. And the early feedback from customers has been great. And we're seeing especially in mid-market and our multi-unit SMB customers really pick it up. I think, as we think about our longer-term growth strategy, it's both driving locations. That's why we're talking about driving locations in our core business as well as expanding the TAM and continuing to invest in our product innovation and continue to make the existing products better. And so, this is just one more step to help us continue to make our guest suite an even stronger product in the market.\nElena Gomez: Yes. Samad, to the point on the gross profit for those products, it's too early. But I can just tell you that, the discipline that we've seen that you've seen us really execute against and the focus on unit economics and payback periods, that doesn't change as we add more products to our platform. So we'll keep an eye on it, but nothing to report is too early.\nSamad Samana: Great. And then just a follow-up on the price increases. You guys let us know very clearly that, it was going to be very targeted. And I think there's some chatter out there on the magnitude that maybe some people have experienced. I'm curious how long we should think about that rolling through the whole base. Is this something that will take several quarters? Is this something that will take several years? And when should we -- any kind of expectation on what the tailwind will be when it's fully baked into the installed base?\nElena Gomez: Thanks, Ahmad for the question. So just to frame how we think about pricing, Aman alluded to it a little bit just a minute ago, but as we think about the growth algorithm of the business, right, we think about locations and ARPU as the two primary growth levers and pricing really complements that alongside. And the way we think about it is, we're going to make targeted pricing adjustments and build this muscle over time. And so, what you saw us do in Q3 was make very targeted price changes for a small cohort of customers, went into effect in September. So that's why, we've comment minimal impact in Q3, some small impact in Q4. But I would think about pricing as something that is going to be with us for a long time. Think about it more of as a long-term strategy and, occasionally we will make targeted pricing adjustments where it makes sense.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thank you again.\nAman Narang: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Stephen Sheldon of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nStephen Sheldon: Hi, thanks. And also a big congrats on the strong quarter. One of the really encouraging win with Potbelly's in enterprise. So just curious how that enterprise pipeline is building. I know it usually takes a lot longer to convert, deals there. And for customers that you've won upmarket, what are some of the bigger factors that have helped you win versus competitive solutions?\nAman Narang: Thanks, Steven. Potbelly is a great win for us. I've actually got one down the street from me in Massachusetts, where I live. I've always loved their food and their bottled peppers. So it's a great brand, excited to partner with them to get them rolled out. As we think about just our enterprise pipeline, I think every year the thing that I see is, we continue to build on the previous year, which is a really good sign, in terms of just the scale we're getting, the types of opportunities we're seeing, the scale of the opportunities. That's really a testament to of course our go-to-market execution, but even more importantly the investments we've been making in our product to continue to support and build out the capabilities, upmarket whether it's enterprise comfit management, some of the capabilities we offer above store for to help restaurants manage at scale. And I think the other piece of it is, just there's some custom capability that each of these has and so building out that capability as well is something we're working on. And the way I think about it, this is enterprise, as we think about the next decade is an important growth vector for us. But it's going to be steady alongside some of the other growth vectors we've talked about in international and enterprise -- international and retail and of course our corporate U.S. SMB business.\nStephen Sheldon: Great. Thank you.\nAman Narang: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Dominic Ball of Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.\nDominic Ball: Hello, Aman and Elena. Great job as usual. I mean, really impressive on software ARPA expansion. Can you speak a little bit more towards, where such sharp acceleration quarter-on-quarter has come from? And then going forward into 2025, how does this also change as you start to win even more retail, international and larger merchants?\nElena Gomez: Yes, sure. So the comment, to answer your question, is, what happened with the step up in SaaS revenue this quarter. So really proud actually of the team's execution here. There was a focus in the organization to improve our ARR to revenue conversion. The team focused on more specifically improving the billing infrastructure and looking at the end-to-end quote to cash process. And so, that resulted in more ARR converting to revenue. As I commented, some of that is a one-time benefit. We'll see some a little bit more in Q4 on a one-time basis. But the way you should think about the future is, in Q3, we saw ARR revenue conversion higher than we've seen historically. So we won't -- we shouldn't expect it to be as high as Q3, but certainly higher than historical levels.\nAman Narang: Yes. Dominic, just a bit on that, you asked about some of the new segments and what they mean? We've seen slightly higher ARPU so far in CBG Retail than our core U.S. SMB business and smaller ARPU in international markets. But across both of these businesses, Elena and team and all of us are really carefully looking at the economics and contribution margins, as we scale them. If you just look at this year, one of the things I'm really proud of is, we've been able to grow these businesses, while driving margin expansion this year. It's just because there's so much overlap across the core platform and what these new market segments need.\nDominic Ball: That's great. Thank you so much. If you don't mind me just asking one more. I mean, can you give us any numbers on terms of location wins for international and retail for this quarter?\nAman Narang: Yes. Just continued momentum really from our Investor Day. We -- I think we had shared some numbers then and the progress we're seeing across both has been really positive. In CPG retail, we're seeing good progress across all of the -- whether it's grocery or convenience or bottle shops. And then international, we're continuing to add more and more of the products, which is improving our unit economics and our productivity. And so, just continue to see really good momentum going to next year. In 2025, we expect to invest more in these businesses, based on what signal we're seeing so far this year.\nDominic Ball: Cool. Thank you.\nAman Narang: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Timothy Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig in on Toast Capital a little bit. So this business is a key advantage of you being the system of record, and it's not just about the SaaS and the payments, but clearly this is another advantage that you have. You're in sort of that pull position. This topic has become more topical with investors, given Clover is somewhat leaning into their Clover Capital Business. Square Capital's been delivering good growth for Square. With all that as a backdrop, when I look at your volumes as a percentage of GPB, it's sort of in the below 1% level. And the program is still relatively nascent compared to Square Capital. Clearly, that's a very different business, right? Different vertical distribution, merchant size, et cetera. But, they're more in sort of the 2.5% range. And I just wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about where you think you might sit longer-term? Is it in that 1% to 2% range? Could it possibly be higher? And there are certainly good arguments on both sides. Thanks.\nElena Gomez: Yeah. Thanks, Tim, for the question. It's a fair question. First of all, let me just start by saying the team's execution here has been excellent. And I think the demand for the product is very clear, right? Customers are valuing the fast, low-friction access to capital and you saw the performance this quarter getting up to $43 million. The best thing is we've continued to optimize the program, default rates are where we expect them to be. All-in-all, it's really healthy program. As we think about the long term, we're going to continue to grow it in a balanced way. Other companies have different profiles of customers, so you got to take that into consideration. But over the long-term, there's no reason why we couldn't grow the program through more attach. I think we just want to make sure we do that in a very balanced risk-adjusted manner. But we feel really confident where the team is executing today.\nTimothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nDan Dolev: Hi, guys. Really amazing results here. I just want to ask like, kind of, bigger long term strategic question, in terms of sort of next year. I know you had the Analyst Day. But, you know, is there, you know, in your discussions, have there been any sort of reprioritizations into the different, initiatives that you're going to take whether international or any other products, given the recent, involvement of the last few months? Thank you.\nAman Narang: Yes. Hi, Dan. I think a lot of its consistency with what we outlined at Investor Day. We've seen a really good year in terms of progress against all of our efforts to drive location growth and ARPU growth and that's continuing to get more markets into flywheel and continuing to expand our product portfolio in ways that has impact for customers. That's really the foundation. As we think about all the future growth opportunities we have, scaling in our core business and driving towards market leadership is foundational. That's the most important thing. As we think about the future, one of the most important things over the next decade is, in addition to scaling our core, investing to open up the TAM in areas where we see really good opportunity, where there's right we think, where there's the right to win and where we think there's great economics and overlap with our platform. And so, I think the team's done a great job of finding some of those areas right like with international with some of the key markets there with CVG retail and we're going to invest some more go-to-market capacity in those areas next year. We're going to keep investing in enterprise business and also keep investing in product expansion to make the products that we have better to drive attach rates. And so, really the strategy is consistent with what we outlined at Analyst Day. There are also a few things that we're doing that are further out. We do take some part of our investment in our R&D product, in our R&D portfolio. We're looking -- we're investing in things that are further out where we're looking to see is there any signal and those are things that, where the team's learning, whether it's other categories, other sub verticals, other international markets, and we'll share more as when it's appropriate.\nDan Dolev: Got it. Great results, Aman. Amazing stuff.\nAman Narang: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Borsch from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nConan Leon: Hi guys. This is Conan on for Andrew. Congrats on the strong quarter. I had a quick question on SAS ARPU. On your own metric, it was up 4% year-over-year and just looking at subscription revenue, it was up 12%. Can you, go a little bit into what the, I guess, differences between the two?\nElena Gomez: Yes. Sure. At the highest level, there are differences at times between ARR and revenue based on timing, based on concessions or credits, things like that. And so, that's the primary driver between the two. When we talk about SaaS, ARRPU, we're talking about, on an ARR basis. So just keep that in mind. In terms of the 4%, the execution of the team has been strong and we view ARPU, as Aman mentioned, as one of the key growth levers alongside locations. So that's how we think about it.\nConan Leon: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nWill Nance: I appreciate you taking the question. A lot of calls going on tonight, so I'll just ask one. But I wanted to ask about the retail push. It's really exciting. We kind of seen it out in the wild. I have heard some great feedback on it. And I'm curious if you have any incremental thoughts on just how you're thinking about structuring go-to-market? How you're kind of weighing the benefits of on the one hand getting scale out of the existing sales force versus having a more verticalized or kind of specialty sales force for that product? Thanks for taking the question tonight guys and nice results.\nAman Narang: Thanks Will. Yes, as you said we continue to see great momentum in retail across all the subcategories we're playing in. If you look at 2025, it's giving us more confidence to invest. I think part of it's, yes, like investing strategically with a team that is very focused on retail. But part of the benefit that we also have is, we've got all the sales reps throughout the country that can help to drive top-of-funnel and lead flows. So we're thinking through what is the best approach to maximize growth and that's something we're tweaking and testing. But at the highest level, thinking of the progress and the signal we've seen so far this gives us conviction to lean in investment more next year to see, if we can build on the momentum from this year. And thank you for the report that you shared. Our team appreciate that.\nWill Nance: Thanks guys. Appreciate taking the questions.\nAman Narang: Thanks, Will.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Nick Setyan from Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nNick Setyan: Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter. The restaurant industry trends seems to have crossed in July and we've seen an uptick month-over-month all the way through October here. And so, the question is what could that potentially be for the GPV per location? Could that have trough, in Q3 and could we see could we expect to see an improvement, going forward?\nElena Gomez: Yes. Thanks for the question. GPV per location was down 3%, consistent actually with Q2. It's been relatively consistent over the last several quarters. As we head into fourth quarter, it'll be in the same range. That's what our guidance reflects. We're monitoring, obviously always monitoring the macro. It's a tight band. We always say it's going to stay within a tight band. We still continue to believe that. As we consider the kind of over the next couple of quarters, we expect it to be in that similar trend.\nNick Setyan: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our last question from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Melissa on for Jason. I wanted to just ask about the net new adds of 7,000 this quarter. Are they fairly balanced between new restaurant openings and competitive takeaways, or what can you tell us about the mix there? And a quick question on churn. Is it still in the slightly above 10% range on an annualized basis, or are there any updates to that metric? Thanks.\nAman Narang: Sure. I think with the 7,000 net adds, it's largely been consistent in terms of the trends we've seen in the past, good mix of new openings, as well as existing restaurants that are switching as they upgrade. The great thing is our marketing team does a great job in either case. We've got some reps hitting photo, with four in a row and new openings and some with existing restaurants and so can compete either way. In terms of churn, it's largely aligned with what we've shared historically. When we do see churn, it's typically smaller restaurants. And so the impact of ARR is smaller and our churn metrics are just in similar range.\nElena Gomez: Similar range. Yes. No real update there.\nElena Gomez: All right. Thank you, everyone.\nAman Narang: Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining.",

            "name": "Aman Narang",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. We delivered another strong quarter. We added approximately 7,000 net locations. Our recurring gross profit streams grew 35% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $113 million and our GAAP operating income was $34 million. I'm really proud of the team and I'm confident we're well-positioned to finish out the year strong and bring this momentum with us into 2025. Our mission at Toast is to help restaurants delight their guests do what they love and pride. We proudly serve nearly 127,000 locations today. And our long-term ambition is to scale this impact across new geographies, new market segments and new verticals. As we think about not just the coming years, but what's possible over the next decade, I firmly believe we can serve many multiples of our current customer count by both increasing market penetration in our current market segments and continuing to expand our addressable markets over time. Over the past year, we've been focused on making disciplined investments that align with our most important priorities and support our long-term vision. And we have so much to be proud of. While the progress over the past 10 years has been tremendous, we're still early in unlocking the full potential of the opportunity that lies ahead. We've increased our outlook for the full year based on our performance in the third quarter and we remain focused on the four strategic priorities we laid out earlier this year. Number one, scaling locations and market share in our core business. Number two, expanding our offering for restaurants with products customers love. Number three, expanding our addressable market into new adjacencies. And finally number four, setting up the company to deliver ongoing operating leverage as we scale. First, scaling restaurant locations and gaining share in our core business. Over the past three years, we've more than doubled our market share in the U.S. Including recently signed mid-market brands, Metro Diner, Giordano's Pizza and Earl Corporation. We're still only at 14% penetration. Our purpose-built restaurant platform and local go-to-market engine creates a flywheel effect as we increase density in local markets driving approximately 7,000 net adds in the quarter. Our customers continue to choose Toast as they expand locations, solidifying our position in the market as the choice for growing successful restaurants. Here's a story that speaks to this momentum. Cultivate Food & Coffee is a full service restaurant and coffee concept in the Atlanta area that recently opened their third location with Toast. Cultivate uses a variety of Toast products to increase speed of service and reduce errors across their locations. For example, servers are able to process orders and half the time with 80% fewer errors using our Tosco handheld. And even though Cultivate's new location has more complex payroll needs than before, managers are able to save time and process payroll in just minutes through Toast. These time savings add up. We heard from Cultivate that the efficiency gains from Toast, free them up to create a positive environment for staff and memorable experiences for guests. It's stories like this that inspire us and our team to keep innovating. Moving on our second priority is expanding our offering for restaurants with products and experiences customers love. To help our customers drive demand, we've recently released two new products to help restaurants reach their guests, branded app and SMS marketing. First, our new branded app allows our customers to build best-in-class native app experiences for iOS and Android including integrated digital ordering, delivery, loyalty and more. This helps our customers level the playing field with much larger brands at a fraction of the cost, and has been particularly successful with our multi-unit SMBs and mid-market customers. This build on our website product released earlier this year, as we round out the guest-facing products included in our essential premium and pro tiers of our digital storefront suite. With multiple offerings at various price points, we now provide options for a variety of different businesses and show our customers how they can expand with us as they grow. And our customers are already seeing increased guest loyalty through our branded app powered experience. For example, guests who order through the app are 4x more likely to be repeat customers than those who order through a restaurant's website. Peetaway, our fast casual Mediterranean restaurant with 37 locations across the Midwest So orders from their newly launched branded app make up almost 15% of the digital sales, since they've launched. Second, we added a highly requested capability in SMS marketing to our marketing suite to help our customers reach their guests directly and generate more revenue. Our customers will be the first tell you, SMS marketing just works. Spaghettini a full service Italian restaurant in California attributed over 11,000 in sales to SMS marketing in its first month alone. It's a critical tool when business is slow. For example, during a quiet period, Spaghettini sold out their surf and turf special after promoting it with the tax campaign. But we're not just expanding our offering by releasing new products. Our vertical SaaS strategy goes deep and focuses on a wide range of unique restaurant-first capabilities. What we refer to as our 1,000 little things. This fall alone, we released over a dozen updates across products like Toast Now, benchmarking, kiosks, Toast Tables and payroll in response to direct customer feedback. Switching gears, our third priority is expanding our addressable market into new adjacencies including food and beverage retail, international and enterprise. These new verticals represent meaningful TAMs, where we see a right to win. And our investments in these areas position us to drive sustained location growth over the long-term. We continue to see great signal across these market segments, which has given us even more conviction to increase our investments in these areas, as we head into 2025. In food and beverage retail, we've expanded product functionality to now accept EBT/SNAP benefits, which opens up more of the grocery and convenience store TAM. We're proud to be able to serve the over 42 million Americans who rely on SNAP, including customers at Gangnam Market, a 28,000 square foot market in Chicago that does over $10 million in sales annually and manages over 15,000 SKUs. Gangnam's markets owners new Toast would be able to meet their needs of this new concept because they've already used Toast in their restaurants in the past. Next in international, we're continuing to see momentum with our month over month gains in attach for our guest products that we rolled out early this year, which is helping us drive our unit economics and sales productivity. Customers in the UK, Ireland and Canada can now also access Toast Now, our mobile operator app, where they can view real time data about the restaurant. As we continue to invest internationally and see the attach rates of our products improve, we have even more conviction in what international markets represent for Toast, as long-term growth drivers. And within enterprise, I'm excited to announce with Potbelly Sandwich Works and we'll be deploying Toast across their 400 plus locations in the U.S., our pipeline entering 2025 is really strong and we continue to make progress across our rollouts with Marriott, NTY Group, NBC and many others. And lastly, our fourth priority is to continue to deliver ongoing operating leverage as we scale. In 2024, we reshaped our cost structure, positioning us to invest behind our priorities we've laid out to drive durable growth over the long-term, while continuing to expand our margins towards the target we presented at our Investor Day. I'm confident in our team's ability to make the right trade-offs and set us up for the future. As I wrap up, I'm so confident in our team, the plan we have in place and the opportunity ahead of us. Thank you to every Toaster for your dedication and passion for our mission. There's no question we wouldn't be here without you. Thank you to our customers. It's an honor to serve you. And to our investors, thank you for continuing to believe in us and our potential. Now I'll turn the call over to Elena to share more about this quarter's results. Hi, Josh. Look, I'll start by saying we've had a great quarter, and we had 7,000 net adds. I think overall for the year, we've got strong net adds in 2024. It's really led by our flywheel markets and our core business. These flywheel markets continue to drive strong productivity and stronger productivity than our other markets, and number of flywheel markets continues to increase. In parallel, we're seeing good early momentum in CBG Retail and our Horizon One international markets. And that does give us more conviction to invest more in those businesses next year. We also had a great win in top billing enterprise, continue to see momentum there as well, steady momentum. If you just zoom out and think about the next decade before next year, like we recognize that it's critical like to both scale and drive market share in our core U.S. business now while expanding our TAM across new verticals and new market segments. Overall, we're confident in our ability to continue to drive location growth in the next year. Thanks, Josh. Yes. Thanks, Samad. I can start and Elena you can jump in after. The branded app and the SMS marketing tools, they're really nice additions to our guest suite to help our customers drive loyalty and demand. And the early feedback from customers has been great. And we're seeing especially in mid-market and our multi-unit SMB customers really pick it up. I think, as we think about our longer-term growth strategy, it's both driving locations. That's why we're talking about driving locations in our core business as well as expanding the TAM and continuing to invest in our product innovation and continue to make the existing products better. And so, this is just one more step to help us continue to make our guest suite an even stronger product in the market. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Steven. Potbelly is a great win for us. I've actually got one down the street from me in Massachusetts, where I live. I've always loved their food and their bottled peppers. So it's a great brand, excited to partner with them to get them rolled out. As we think about just our enterprise pipeline, I think every year the thing that I see is, we continue to build on the previous year, which is a really good sign, in terms of just the scale we're getting, the types of opportunities we're seeing, the scale of the opportunities. That's really a testament to of course our go-to-market execution, but even more importantly the investments we've been making in our product to continue to support and build out the capabilities, upmarket whether it's enterprise comfit management, some of the capabilities we offer above store for to help restaurants manage at scale. And I think the other piece of it is, just there's some custom capability that each of these has and so building out that capability as well is something we're working on. And the way I think about it, this is enterprise, as we think about the next decade is an important growth vector for us. But it's going to be steady alongside some of the other growth vectors we've talked about in international and enterprise -- international and retail and of course our corporate U.S. SMB business. Thanks. Yes. Dominic, just a bit on that, you asked about some of the new segments and what they mean? We've seen slightly higher ARPU so far in CBG Retail than our core U.S. SMB business and smaller ARPU in international markets. But across both of these businesses, Elena and team and all of us are really carefully looking at the economics and contribution margins, as we scale them. If you just look at this year, one of the things I'm really proud of is, we've been able to grow these businesses, while driving margin expansion this year. It's just because there's so much overlap across the core platform and what these new market segments need. Yes. Just continued momentum really from our Investor Day. We -- I think we had shared some numbers then and the progress we're seeing across both has been really positive. In CPG retail, we're seeing good progress across all of the -- whether it's grocery or convenience or bottle shops. And then international, we're continuing to add more and more of the products, which is improving our unit economics and our productivity. And so, just continue to see really good momentum going to next year. In 2025, we expect to invest more in these businesses, based on what signal we're seeing so far this year. Thank you. Yes. Hi, Dan. I think a lot of its consistency with what we outlined at Investor Day. We've seen a really good year in terms of progress against all of our efforts to drive location growth and ARPU growth and that's continuing to get more markets into flywheel and continuing to expand our product portfolio in ways that has impact for customers. That's really the foundation. As we think about all the future growth opportunities we have, scaling in our core business and driving towards market leadership is foundational. That's the most important thing. As we think about the future, one of the most important things over the next decade is, in addition to scaling our core, investing to open up the TAM in areas where we see really good opportunity, where there's right we think, where there's the right to win and where we think there's great economics and overlap with our platform. And so, I think the team's done a great job of finding some of those areas right like with international with some of the key markets there with CVG retail and we're going to invest some more go-to-market capacity in those areas next year. We're going to keep investing in enterprise business and also keep investing in product expansion to make the products that we have better to drive attach rates. And so, really the strategy is consistent with what we outlined at Analyst Day. There are also a few things that we're doing that are further out. We do take some part of our investment in our R&D product, in our R&D portfolio. We're looking -- we're investing in things that are further out where we're looking to see is there any signal and those are things that, where the team's learning, whether it's other categories, other sub verticals, other international markets, and we'll share more as when it's appropriate. Thank you. Thanks Will. Yes, as you said we continue to see great momentum in retail across all the subcategories we're playing in. If you look at 2025, it's giving us more confidence to invest. I think part of it's, yes, like investing strategically with a team that is very focused on retail.

And thank you for the report that you shared. Our team appreciate that. Thanks, Will. Sure. I think with the 7,000 net adds, it's largely been consistent in terms of the trends we've seen in the past, good mix of new openings, as well as existing restaurants that are switching as they upgrade. The great thing is our marketing team does a great job in either case.

And so the impact of ARR is smaller and our churn metrics are just in similar range. Thank you, everybody."

            "content": "Thank you, Aman, and thank you to everyone for joining. I also want to thank our employees whose hard work and consistent execution led to another successful quarter with top and bottom-line results exceeding expectations. In the third quarter, ARR increased 28% and total fintech and subscription gross profit our recurring gross profit streams grew 35%. Our strong top-line growth is complemented by our efficient and disciplined approach to scaling the business, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $113 million, a 30% margin on our recurring gross profit streams and GAAP operating income of $34 million. Third quarter results came in above our expectations, driven by strong top-line results, including a higher contribution from Toast Capital and upside to SaaS revenue. We added approximately 7,000 net locations in third quarter, increasing total locations to nearly 127,000, up 28% year-over-year. The combination of our purpose-built platform and localized go-to-market motion continue to drive our momentum. With our strong performance year-to-date, we remain on track to deliver more net location adds in 2024 versus 2023. SaaS ARR grew 33% year-over-year, driven by strong location growth and a 4% increase in SaaS ARPU on an ARR basis. Subscription revenue increased 44% year-over-year, growing faster than SaaS ARR due to ongoing focus across the organization to improve our ARR to revenue conversion. Part of that improvement is sustainable going forward. And part of the increase in subscription revenue was a one-time benefit. Payments ARR grew 23% and Fintech gross profit increased 27% in the third quarter. GPD was $41.7 billion growing 24% year-over-year with GPD per location down approximately 3% versus last year. Net take rate was 56 basis points with a core net take rate of 45 basis points. We made targeted payment pricing changes for a small cohort of customers in September. It had minimal impact in the quarter and we expect a small benefit to net trade grade in Q4. As we've discussed, we are building a motion for ongoing small, targeted price adjustments and view pricing as one lever to complement our primary growth drivers over the long-term. Gross profit from non-payments Fintech Solutions increased to $43 million driven by healthy demand for Toast Capital. Defaults remain in line with our expectations and due to continued optimization and the addition of forward flow, bad debt associated with Toast Capital is down relative to prior year, even as we scale the program. Let me share one story that shows how customers value the fast, low friction access to capital to grow their business. The Baum Group, which owns the popular Speakeasy and Ice Cream Shop, UES in New York City, used Toast Capital help with early operations for a new concept called Champagne Problems, they opened earlier this year. The quick and seamless access to funding allowed the owner to maintain strategic control of her business, while avoiding the time and complexity associated with traditional loans. The Baum Group considers Toast to be an ideal partner for growth, given Toast's unique visibility into their financials and business operations and plans to use Toast Capital to help with future expansions. Shifting back to the P&L, total operating expenses including bad debt and credit related expenses increased 11% year-over-year in the third quarter, accelerating versus the first half of 2024 due to the planned investments in our highest priority areas. Sales and marketing expenses were up 25% year-over-year in Q3, as we made targeted investments across our TAM expansion areas, upsell and U.S. go-to-market channels to increase market share gains. R&D increased 5% year-over-year in the third quarter, reflecting investments aligned with our product strategy. As Aman mentioned, recently we recently announced SMS marketing, branded app and over a dozen new features across our platform, reflecting the continued innovation to further differentiate our offering and provide more value for our customers. We're also investing behind our TAM expansion areas. In retail, we're adding more product integrations like accepting SNAP/EBT payments and our grocery and convenience segments and deepening our retail inventory management offering. Internationally, we're rolling out more products, including Toast Now, gift cards and expanding third-party integrations. Excluding $18 million of bad debt and credit related expenses, G&A declined 8% year-over-year. We expect to continue operating leverage in G&A as we maintain a focus on driving efficiencies, including through automation and global diversification of our workforce. Adjusted EBITDA was $113 million in the quarter and margins expanded 17 percentage points year-over-year to 30%. The strong Q3 results reflect a healthy top line growth and our commitment to prudently scaling the business, while balancing investments in more nascent areas like food and beverage retail, international and enterprise to lay the foundation to deliver durable growth for years to come. Our Q3 margin also benefits from typical payment seasonality. GAAP operating income was $34 million in Q3, reflecting our strong operating performance and disciplined approach to managing stock-based compensation expenses, and free cash flow totaled $97 million in the Q3. Moving to capital allocation. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we repurchased over 2 million shares for $56 million for an average price of $23 per share. Early in the third quarter, we also repurchased a warrant representing 5 million shares, reflecting our focus on reducing dilution. We will continue to be opportunistic based on market conditions and act judiciously in support of building long-term shareholder value. Turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect total subscription and Fintech gross profit to grow in the 32% to 35% range, year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA to be $90 million to $100 million. The sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA and margin compared to the third quarter reflects typical seasonal decline in the fourth quarter of GPV per location, as well as our planned ongoing reinvestments to set ourselves up for sustained healthy growth in both 2025 and over the long-term. For the full year, we now expect 32% to 33% growth in Fintech and subscription gross profit and $352 million to $362 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a 26% adjusted EBITDA margin at the midpoint, marking approximately 20 percentage point improvement in margin versus last year. Thus far, in 2024, we have delivered meaningful adjusted EBITDA outperformance and significant margin expansion after resetting our cost structure at the beginning of the year and aligning our investments with our highest priority areas. As we exit the year, our strong financial profile enables us to invest in the business to position us for both a strong 2025 and long-term durable growth. We will focus on balancing growth with modest margin expansion as we march towards the 30% to 35% medium-term goal we laid out at Investor Day. To wrap up, we are executing across the board and extremely proud of what we have accomplished so far in 2024 and in our position heading into 2025. Now, I will turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Yes. Samad, to the point on the gross profit for those products, it's too early. But I can just tell you that, the discipline that we've seen that you've seen us really execute against and the focus on unit economics and payback periods, that doesn't change as we add more products to our platform. So we'll keep an eye on it, but nothing to report is too early. Thanks, Ahmad for the question. So just to frame how we think about pricing, Aman alluded to it a little bit just a minute ago, but as we think about the growth algorithm of the business, right, we think about locations and ARPU as the two primary growth levers and pricing really complements that alongside. And the way we think about it is, we're going to make targeted pricing adjustments and build this muscle over time. And so, what you saw us do in Q3 was make very targeted price changes for a small cohort of customers, went into effect in September. So that's why, we've comment minimal impact in Q3, some small impact in Q4. But I would think about pricing as something that is going to be with us for a long time. Think about it more of as a long-term strategy and, occasionally we will make targeted pricing adjustments where it makes sense. Yes, sure. So the comment, to answer your question, is, what happened with the step up in SaaS revenue this quarter. So really proud actually of the team's execution here. There was a focus in the organization to improve our ARR to revenue conversion. The team focused on more specifically improving the billing infrastructure and looking at the end-to-end quote to cash process. And so, that resulted in more ARR converting to revenue. As I commented, some of that is a one-time benefit. We'll see some a little bit more in Q4 on a one-time basis. But the way you should think about the future is, in Q3, we saw ARR revenue conversion higher than we've seen historically. So we won't -- we shouldn't expect it to be as high as Q3, but certainly higher than historical levels. Yeah. Thanks, Tim, for the question. It's a fair question. First of all, let me just start by saying the team's execution here has been excellent. And I think the demand for the product is very clear, right? Customers are valuing the fast, low-friction access to capital and you saw the performance this quarter getting up to $43 million. The best thing is we've continued to optimize the program, default rates are where we expect them to be. All-in-all, it's really healthy program. As we think about the long term, we're going to continue to grow it in a balanced way. Other companies have different profiles of customers, so you got to take that into consideration. But over the long-term, there's no reason why we couldn't grow the program through more attach. I think we just want to make sure we do that in a very balanced risk-adjusted manner. But we feel really confident where the team is executing today. Yes. Sure. At the highest level, there are differences at times between ARR and revenue based on timing, based on concessions or credits, things like that. And so, that's the primary driver between the two. When we talk about SaaS, ARRPU, we're talking about, on an ARR basis. So just keep that in mind. In terms of the 4%, the execution of the team has been strong and we view ARPU, as Aman mentioned, as one of the key growth levers alongside locations. So that's how we think about it. Yes. Thanks for the question. GPV per location was down 3%, consistent actually with Q2. It's been relatively consistent over the last several quarters. As we head into fourth quarter, it'll be in the same range. That's what our guidance reflects. We're monitoring, obviously always monitoring the macro. It's a tight band. We always say it's going to stay within a tight band. We still continue to believe that. As we consider the kind of over the next couple of quarters, we expect it to be in that similar trend. Similar range. Yes. No real update there. All right. Thank you, everyone."

And with that, let me turn the call over to Aman.\nAman Narang: Thank you, Michael, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. We had a strong second quarter. We added a record 8,000 net locations, our recurring gross profit streams increased 29% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA came in at 92 million and we\u2019ve achieved GAAP income profitability ahead of expectations. I\u2019m really proud of how the team performed and we\u2019re well positioned to continue to scale and have a strong second half. Our mission at Toast is to help restaurants delight their guests, do what they love and thrive. At our first Investor Day in May, we shared the opportunity, strategy and drivers behind our momentum. At about 13% share in U.S. restaurants, we have an incredible opportunity out of us, to scale and become the platform of choice serving this amazing industry. Our products and data assets, combined with our local go-to-market engine and customer success teams, uniquely position us to drive both location and ARPU expansion and sustained durable growth over the long term. In addition to scaling across U.S. SMB and mid-market restaurants, we\u2019re thoughtfully laying the foundation to expand our TAM across key international markets, enterprise restaurant chains as well as food and beverage retail. The team has done a great job of identifying segments of the market where we have a right to win without distracting from our ability to scale in our core market segments. And these investments allow us to expand our TAM and support our ability to drive durable growth and shareholder returns. We\u2019ve increased our outlook for the full year based on our performance in the first half and we\u2019re all focused on the four strategic priorities we laid out earlier this year. One, scaling locations and market share in our core business; two, expanding our offering for restaurants with products customers love; three, expanding our addressable market into new adjacencies; and four, setting up the company to deliver ongoing operating leverage as we scale. So first, scaling restaurant locations and gaining share in our core business. Our record 8,000 net adds in the second quarter were driven by our purpose-built restaurant platform and our local go-to-market engine. As we gain momentum in local markets across the country, we continue to see a flywheel effect with higher rep productivity and faster market share gains. In fact, in our top 10 flywheel markets across the country with the highest market share, we saw 50% more wins on average in Q2 versus non-flywheel markets. This gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive strong market share gains over time. And we\u2019re gaining share because restaurants see the impact we can have on their businesses. I\u2019ll spotlight one recent example that speaks to the value we bring. Bizoria, a growing fast casual concept in Great Atlanta switched to Toast from another cloud provider to help fuel their next stage of growth. By complementing our POS terminals with self-ordering kiosks for guests and kitchen display systems across their food and prep lines, they\u2019ve reduced average order times by 5 minutes. And as a result, Bizoria estimates that they have increased revenue by 25% across their locations. Switching gears, our second priority is expanding our offering for restaurants with products and experiences customers love. Our platform and partner ecosystem serves all the restaurant stakeholders, operators, guests, employees and suppliers and creates value across many dimensions, including supporting new revenue streams, driving throughput and simplifying operations. Last quarter, I talked about the launch of product suites across good, better and best tiers to simplify how we sell and how our products adopt -- how our customers adopt our products. We\u2019re starting to see this have an impact. For example, since we launched our digital storefront suite in the spring, approximately 30% of book locations upgraded to our Pro tier, which includes our new website product. And this website products works in concert with the rest of our digital suite, to help restaurants build a great online presence. As we continue to mature our product suites, we\u2019re confident we will see similar trends across our platform, which will, in turn, help us drive product attach in ARR. Internationally, across the U.K., Canada and Ireland, our team has been hard at work building out the platform to drive both differentiation and ARPU. In the first half, we launched several products, including online ordering, Mobile Order & Pay, gift cards and kiosk. Attach rates are surpassing expectations. As an example, nearly half of international June bookings adopted Toast line ordering. Tahini is a Canadian quick-serve restaurant that\u2019s already rolled out Toast across 42 locations. The plan is to double our location count next year. One of the highlights for Tahini has been a 15% increase in check sizes on their kiosk versus ordering at a POS terminal. They credit this increase to our kiosks ability to prompt for data-driven upsells via beautiful custom images of their dishes for items that go better together. And this growth in revenue has helped them invest more back into their business to support their ambitious growth goals. Our team is planned to roll out more products internationally this year, including guest marketing, restaurant retail, Toast tables as well as our hotel PMS integration. And with 2,000 live locations as of Q2, we are excited about our progress and continue to remain bullish on the long-term potential given how early we are in the international opportunity. Next, our third priority is expanding our addressable market into new adjacencies, including enterprise and food and beverage retail. We recently expanded our partnership with mussels pretzels by signing an extension for another 100 stores in addition to the 300 locations already on our platform. We continue to roll our Toast across a number of marquee brands, including wet soils and barbecue holdings, which are part of fast-growing MTY brands. And the improvements we have made to our platform, combined with our strong pipeline gives us confidence in steadily increasing enterprise penetration over time. As I mentioned in our Investor Day in May, the work we\u2019ve put in over the past decade building on our platform has allowed us to enter new verticals, including grocery, convenience stores and bottle shops. There are 220,000 locations and 660 billion in spend in these markets alone in the U.S. And so far, we\u2019ve booked 1,000 new customers. We see a significant growth opportunity here, in part because so much of this market is still using legacy on-prem solutions and see the benefits of an integrated cloud platform. For example, Victory Hospitality Group in Portland, Maine, recently launched three markets on Toast in addition to their portfolio of award-winning restaurants that have been with us since 2016. Since adding Toast, the staff has been able to offer better service to their guests by making back-office tasks, including inventory management, much more streamlined. We see examples like this across many of our early retail customers and have confidence that we can drive significant growth in the segment. And finally, our fourth priority is to deliver operating leverage in our core business as we scale both to drive shareholder returns and have the capital available to invest into our nascent market segments. Our adjusted EBITDA was 92 million in the second quarter, a 77 million improvement from a year ago. I\u2019m very proud of the team\u2019s ability to both drive strong growth and this level of margin expansion in a short period of time. And as we look to the second half of the year, we will invest more back into our business to support our growth plans while working towards our long-term margin goals. To wrap up, I\u2019m confident in how we\u2019re executing. We\u2019re still in the early innings and are prepared to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. I want to thank every Toaster for their continued dedication and passion for our mission. Our customers for entrusting us to support them. Our partners for helping us enable this great ecosystem and of course, our investors for believing in us and the potential in this business. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Elena to share more about this quarter\u2019s results.\nElena Gomez: Thank you, Aman, and to everyone for joining I also want to thank our employees, your continued focus on execution delivered another strong quarter with top and bottom-line results above expectations. In the second quarter, ARR grew 29%, driven by strong location growth and continued ARPU expansion. Total fintech and subscription gross profit are recurring gross profit stream, also increased 29% year-over-year and totaled 344 million. Adjusted EBITDA was 92 million, representing a 27% margin on a recurring on our recurring gross profit streams. We reached GAAP profitability earlier than expected, an important milestone we have been working towards and further evidence of our ability to drive durable, efficient growth. In Q2, we added approximately 8,000 net locations, a new quarterly record, increasing our total locations to about 120,000, up 29% year-over-year. Location growth was primarily driven by continued share gains in our core U.S. SMB and mid-market customer segment, complemented by the contributions across international, enterprise and food and beverage retail. As a reminder, Q2 is our seasonally strongest quarter of the year as restaurants repair for peak season and we typically see lower quarterly net adds in the second half. SaaS ARR grew 35% year-over-year, driven by strong location growth and a mid-single-digit increase in SaaS ARPU on an ARR basis. Payments ARR grew 24% and fintech gross profit increased 23% in Q2. GPV was 40.5 billion, up 26% year-over-year, with GPV per location down about 3% versus prior year, consistent with recent quarterly trends. Net take rate was 54 basis points with core net take rate flat year-over-year at 45 basis points. Our non-payment fintech solutions led by Toast Capital contributed $34 million in gross profit and 8 basis points to the net take rate. The net take rate contribution is slightly lower than prior periods due to the introduction of forward flow, which comes with a lower take rate per dollar of origination, but carries no credit risk. Expanding capacity with diverse funding sources enables us to prudently grow the program and optimize across models to maximize risk-adjusted returns. We are on track for the targeted payments pricing increase we\u2019ve discussed and expected to have a small impact on core net take rate in the second half of the year. Over time, ongoing price adjustments will be one of the several drivers of our long-term growth algorithm. Total operating expenses were up 2% year-over-year in the quarter, reflecting a full quarter of savings from restructuring actions taken earlier in the year. We anticipate operating expense growth will increase in the second half as we reinvest savings into our highest priority areas across go-to-market, product, TAM expansion to drive sustained long-term growth. We\u2019ll maintain the same disciplined investment approach we\u2019ve employed and remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business to fund investments and drive margin expansion. Sales and marketing expenses increased 16% year-over-year in Q2 as we continue to grow our upsell and international sales teams and make targeted investments in our U.S. go-to-market motion to drive deeper penetration. R&D expenses declined 4% year-over-year in Q2. We expect to see the impact of reinvestment starting in Q3. We\u2019re making targeted investments aligned with our product strategy to provide a differentiated platform for our core SMB and mid-market customers, innovate new products that create value for our customers and expand into new TAMs. Excluding $50 million of bad debt and credit-related expenses, G&A was down 12% year-over-year. We will continue to drive efficiency within G&A, including through automation and global diversification of our workforce and expect ongoing operating leverage. Bad debt associated with Toast capital was lower relative to prior periods, benefiting from the addition of forward flow and the continued optimization of the program. Our progress in growing adjusted EBITDA combined with containing stock-based compensation expenses, resulted in our first quarter of GAAP operating income profit reaching 5 million in the quarter. Free cash flow totaled 108 million in the second quarter, driven by strong adjusted EBITDA and a benefit from working capital due to the seasonality of our payments business. Moving to capital allocation. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 49 million in shares. At the start of Q3, we also opportunistically repurchased a warrant for 5.2 million shares expiring in 2027 for 60 million. The warrant repurchase aligns with our broader capital allocation strategy to maximize shareholder value, in part by reducing dilution. We view it as an accelerated, efficient share repurchase and use of cash we would have otherwise allocated for opportunistic stock repurchases. As a result, we anticipate a slower pace of buyback through the balance of the year, although we will remain opportunistic based on market conditions. Now turning to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect total subscription and fintech gross profit to increase in the 23% to 27% range year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA to be 70 million to 80 million. Following our strong first half performance, we are increasing our full year outlook. We now expect 27% to 29% growth in fintech and subscription gross profit and 285 million to 305 million in adjusted EBITDA. At the midpoint, it represents a 22% margin, a 16 percentage point improvement versus 2023. We expect to be around breakeven on a GAAP basis for the remainder of the year. After benefiting from the restructuring savings in the first half of the year, our guidance includes investment in key areas of the business, which are concentrated in the back half of the year. This is also driving the quarterly fluctuations in adjusted EBITDA margins. Our expectations for the full year margins are representative of how we are managing the business and capture our growth investment and efficiency gains. We plan to build off of our full year 2024 margin and steadily progress towards our medium- and long-term targets. To wrap up, we are extremely proud of our execution and momentum through the first half of 2024. We are on track for a strong second half of the year and well positioned to sustain high growth and margin expansion over the long term. Now I will turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi. Good afternoon. Good results here. Just wanted to ask on the second half and if there\u2019s been any change in restaurant health in the last couple of months since we last got together, I understand the location addition seasonality comment, I know that you mentioned, but just any other observations on the macro side?\nElena Gomez: Yes. Thanks, Tien-Tsin, for the question. So in Q2, our GPV per location was down 3%. And as we head into Q3, it\u2019s in that same range. So it\u2019s been relatively consistent. We\u2019re -- and our guidance reflects that as I laid out on the call. That said, the macro is dynamic, and we also know a couple of the data points about our restaurants. We\u2019ve proven to be resilient through various economic cycles. But of course we\u2019re going to continue to monitor it. And just zooming out as we think about GPV growing 26% that\u2019s 40 billion this quarter, we just have a lot of confidence in our ability to manage the business through to various economic cycles.\nTien-Tsin Huang: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho.\nDan Dolev: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about subscription ARR. I think it looks pretty strong and annual number looks actually really good. I wondered what kind of products are resonating with your customers today as the upsell performance, at least from what we\u2019re seeing here looks pretty good in the context of the same-store sales allocation?\nAman Narang: Thanks for the question, Dan. Yes. Look there\u2019s a broad range of capabilities we shared across our platform at Analyst Day. And this is everything from things like data and AI, we shared our benchmarking tool and how the feedback from our customers has been positive. Generative AI and leverage that in our CRM tool. Sous chef another area we\u2019re excited about to help be an umbrella for all of our AI innovations. So that\u2019s one area that the team is excited about. And then across our platform, we\u2019ve talked about how the platform has commerce, guests, employee cloud and SMA and fintech. And across all of those areas there are -- there\u2019s work the team is putting in to help continue to refine and iterate on the products. So on guess, for example, or Toast stables product, catering, online ordering, CRM, our new website product. There\u2019s been good feedback on. On the employee cloud side, there\u2019s a lot of focus on our payroll product, working in conjunction with our scheduling and our Tips [ph] product. We\u2019re continuing to work on the product market fit in our supplier and accounting product. And I\u2019ll just wrap by saying a lot of the focus we have as a team, all what we\u2019re doing in suites is really to make sure that we\u2019re driving strong ARPU growth in the medium and long term. We have recognize this is an important growth driver for the business.\nDan Dolev: Got it. Great quarter and great momentum.\nAman Narang: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from William Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nWilliam Nance: Hi, guys. Appreciate for taking the question. Nice to see another strong quarter. I wanted to ask maybe sticking with the macro from Tien-Tsin\u2019s question a second ago, just on decisions to make some of the incremental investments. I think there\u2019s been a lot of focus on the macro recently. And I guess when you think about adding additional head count to go-to-market functions like how do you think about sort of the mix of net adds and those that are coming from sort of new restaurant openings versus competitive takeaways? And I guess the genesis of the question is -- have you seen any impact on just sort of the opportunity out there as sort of new restaurant location formation sort of slows? Are you actually seeing that in the numbers? And how do you kind of marry that with the decision to accelerate investments in the back half?\nAman Narang: Yes. Great question. Well, thanks for asking. In terms of like the mix of NROs in existing, we\u2019ve continued to see not a fundamentally different pattern. And our team is -- has the ability to sign and convert both existing restaurants and NROs. If it just zoom out, you think about like the progress we\u2019ve made like one thing I just want to start by saying is I\u2019m really proud of the team\u2019s performance. We had a record 8,000 net adds in Q2. And I was reflecting on how 8K is an important milestone for us. If you look at our ARPU at 12K plus and we\u2019re approaching 100 million in ARR that we added in the quarter. And you just think about sustaining this level of growth quarter-after-quarter for the next decade. I think it\u2019s a great outcome. In Q2 specifically a lot of the net adds came from our core U.S. SMB and mid-market business. As you can imagine it\u2019s taken us a decade to build our SMB business. And as I mentioned on the call one of the things I\u2019m really proud of is our top 10 cyber markets continue to be really productive. In fact, it\u2019s at 50% more wins versus non-flywheel markets and flywheel markets have expanded 5x in the last 3 years. So while we\u2019re excited about adding capacity, sales capacity in international retail and we will look to do that in the second half. Really proud of the progress we\u2019ve made in our core SMB business. And to your question about investing I think it\u2019s a fair question like ultimately, we see really healthy period in uneconomic in our core business. And we see nice growth drivers in some of these new segments that we\u2019re getting into. And so as long as we continue to see our unit economics be healthy, we\u2019re going to look to continue to invest.\nWilliam Nance: Makes total sense. Appreciate you taking the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Your line is open.\nStephen Sheldon: Hi. Thanks and nice work in the quarter. As you kind of expanded some of these adjacent markets in grocery, convenience stores, et cetera, I think Aman you talked about the big opportunities to replace legacy on current solutions. So just wanted to broaden that and ask if there -- as you look at the end markets Toast is pursuing, are there specific portions where there\u2019s bigger legacy replacement opportunities than others do you think about SMB restaurants, enterprise restaurants, international and again those adjacent markets which you -- I think you hit on in your prepared comments.\nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks for the question, Stephen. I think we\u2019ve mentioned in the calls in the past that the enterprise segment, the conversion cycles are slower. So there is more legacy upmarket. We also see that within retail, there are some very specific needs and there isn\u2019t a great cloud provider that has taken over the space. In fact, reminds me a little bit of what the restaurant business was like 10 years ago. And so those are the two segments that I see a lot of opportunity in. But even if you look at the international markets for larger restaurants with higher GPV the trend in pattern we see is a lot of legacy still out there. And so one of the big challenges for us is to really think about asset allocation right across all of these growth vectors and the thing that we\u2019re focused on is what is the customer feedback we\u2019re getting, what are our payback periods? What are your economics? What is our -- and those are some of the drivers that help us determine how we allocate capital across these different growth vectors. And where we see ultimately long term, the biggest growth potential across these market segments.\nStephen Sheldon: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Chiodo with UBS. Your line is open.\nTim Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I have an upfront question around the upsell teams in land and expand, but if you don\u2019t mind, I was hoping to also clarify something for the second half guidance. For the upsell teams in the land expand. Those are 2 things that you focused on last year hiring more of the upsell folks in the fourth quarter, I believe. And maybe you could just talk a little bit about the progress that you\u2019re seeing with those teams as those additional heads that might have been brought on later last year, probably becoming more productive. And as we think about them contributing to SaaS ARPU or SaaS AR per location in the back half of the year and beyond. And then actually, I\u2019ll just throw in the guidance clarifier if you don\u2019t mind. If I\u2019m not mistaken the prior guidance would have implied GPV per location being a little bit better in the second half and now it\u2019s slightly maybe a downtick there. So is it fair to say that the guidance is actually absorbing a little bit more macro pressure and you were still able to raise the guide despite that incremental macro pressure?\nElena Gomez: Yes. I mean that\u2019s a fair -- let me think about -- I\u2019m trying to think about Q1. But that\u2019s a fair assessment, Tim, our guidance does reflect our latest thinking. And what we\u2019ve seen is it\u2019s been relatively consistent in terms of same-store sales. It\u2019s been in this narrow band GPV per location. So that\u2019s how we think about it and we anticipate it to be in a narrow band for the back half of the year but that\u2019s factored into our guidance on a year-over-year basis.\nAman Narang: And on upsell, Tim, on your question upsell, 2 years then, we\u2019re -- I\u2019ll start by saying we\u2019re learning a lot. We\u2019ll continue to optimize this in conjunction with our new business team. And this team is a critical component of driving to drive ARPU growth because the new business team first and foremost is focused on growing locations. And as our platform continues to improve, I talked about the question earlier about how do we think about the product portfolio and what customers are looking for as we continue to mature our platform and as we continue to invest in the suites to make our products easier to buy and sell. This upsell team is critical to making sure that we continue to drive ARPU growth to complement the great location growth that we\u2019re seeing. And the last thing is, we\u2019ve talked in the past about Toast shop and product let growth. That\u2019s another thing that R&D team is very focused on, especially for products where the ability to adopt to activate is easier. So I think 2 years in, we\u2019re pleased with the progress. The upsell team has made. There\u2019s still work to do and we\u2019re committed to making sure that we continue to refine our land and expand motion across our new business team and our upsell team.\nTim Chiodo: Great. Thank you on both of those.\nAman Narang: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you, Tim. Your next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line\u2019s open.\nHarshita Rawat: Good afternoon. Very strong location adds. Can you maybe expand upon the contribution also from new areas like food and beverage retail international? And then, Elena, how should we want to think about location at in 3Q? I know you\u2019ve mentioned seasonality kind of driven headwind also in the second half of the year. Thank you.\nAman Narang: Yes. Sure. Thanks, Harshita. International Retail are growing nicely as we said share at Analyst Day, international -- 2,000 locations lives start to see the investments we\u2019re making to expand the platform that\u2019s resonating really well with our customers. And our team has got more to sell in their bag, which has been great. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest to bring more of our platform as we\u2019ve shared in the past internationally before we really put the pedal down in some of these markets on go-to-market capacity. And on retail, we again, really proud of the progress the team\u2019s made. This was a Stockworks project that\u2019s gotten to 1,000 locations booked relatively quickly. But if you remember that if you zoom out and think about this our core business in the U.S., we\u2019ve been at it for 11 years now relative to these new businesses that are still early doesn\u2019t have the same level of sales capacity, the same maturity in the product. And so the bulk of the adds are coming from our core business. And the thing we talked about the 5 wheel effect is still the primary driver of our growth. And as you think about the next few years and you think about especially about the next decade, of course, our aspirations are to continue to expand not just in our core business but also make these new areas more significant contributors and we\u2019re working on that.\nElena Gomez: Yes. And Harshita, on your question on the second half, first of all, Aman -- il just echo Aman\u2019s comments, we had a strong first half of the year on that location as the demand and funnel remains strong, and we\u2019re still on track to add more new locations in \u201824 than we did in \u201823, and that\u2019s off a bigger base. I\u2019ll just reiterate what I said in the script, which is Q2 quarterly net adds tend to be obviously higher than the rest of the year given seasonality. So just think about that as you plan your models for the second half, but confident the team is executing well.\nHarshita Rawat: Thank you.\nOperator: We now have Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJosh Baer: Great, thank you for the question. Was hoping you could unpack GPV per location just a bit more. Any impact from mix -- changing mix on that metric? And then I was hoping you could dig into the trends you\u2019re seeing just across exceeded diner number of ticket items and check sizes.\nElena Gomez: Yes. I\u2019m happy to unpack that. So just to put it in context, Q2 was down 3% August year-to-date in the same zone as I mentioned. And most of that\u2019s the primary driver of that is same-store sales declining year-over-year. So that\u2019s the primary driver. There\u2019s a small portion related to mix but it\u2019s mostly really same-store sales declining. And that China has been relatively consistent. And in terms of the different pockets of our segments, we haven\u2019t seen a notable pattern that\u2019s different across our segments.\nAman Narang: And just to add to that, in terms of check size or in the order side, there hasn\u2019t been any fundamental change. And I think if you look at these changes, these are very gradual and in a narrow band. And I think, as Elena mentioned, have been a pattern that we\u2019ve seen over the past year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Coad with Autonomous.\nMatthew Coad: Thanks for taking the question here. I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the investments needed in food and beverage retail and international. At the Investor Day, you talked about how you\u2019ve already made a lot of investments to kind of get the product parity there and build out the platforms and all the modules that you need, but it sounds like there\u2019s still a good amount of investment that needs to be done. So I was hoping you could touch on that and maybe use like a baseball analogy, right? Like what inning are we in, in terms of building out the platform for those 2 new verticals right now?\nAman Narang: Yes. I think it\u2019s a fair question, Matt. I\u2019m not going to use the baseball analogy, but I\u2019ll say that our core business in the U.S. we\u2019re in your 12 or 11 and we\u2019re in year 2 and year 1 for these other businesses to give you some context. But look, I\u2019ll start by saying like I think the customer reception has been amazing. It\u2019s been really positive. The history hospitality story that I shared in the call, we see a lot of these stories across our customer base. And I think one of the big drivers is that there\u2019s a lot of legacy solutions and the ability to move it to this all in one approach in the cloud, it really resonates with our customers in the space. In terms of the features, I think one of the ones we shared at Analyst Day that continues to resonate a lot is the ability to manage inventory on the floor. We continue to hear feedback, but that\u2019s a feature and a capability and there\u2019s some capabilities around that, adds a lot of efficiency for staff. On e-commerce also because I think the retailers offering e-commerce capability is important. And so having that built into the back end and integrated is really valuable. And then, Matt, your question on road map, there\u2019s work to do. If you think of the 20,000 locations we laid out, there\u2019s work to do on the fuel integrations that\u2019s an area. We\u2019re working on the payment side, supporting SNAP and EBT. There\u2019s some work in grocery around deli scale management. But we also get a lot on the platform. When you think about our platform, we get a lot across things like payroll and payments and scheduling that\u2019s built in that can really be reused. And so we see this as a great opportunity where the return investment our ability to build in the segment is really high. And then in international, I think it\u2019s not the same lift I know I talked about a lot of products, but it\u2019s not nearly the same lift to be able to bring these products to market internationally. But as you can imagine, we\u2019ve taken a decade to build this platform in the U.S. And so to support internationalization, it\u2019s a gradual process that the team is working on.\nElena Gomez: Yes. The only thing I would build upon what you said, Aman, is, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, we take capital allocation, obviously, as a strategy and some guiding principles. And as we think about these emerging businesses. We have a very thoughtful gated way that we approach investing. And so we wait to see signal before we incrementally invest -- so that\u2019s just a discipline we have, and you\u2019ll continue to see that as we grow these businesses.\nMatthew Coad: Really helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nDavid Hynes: Thanks for taking the question, guys. Excellent results. Aman, I\u2019d love to get an update from you on what you\u2019re hearing from customers with respect to interest and your opportunity with AI, whether that\u2019s Sous Chef or some of the other initiatives you have underway? And I guess how you think these could contribute to the financial model over time?\nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks for the question, DJ. Look, I think it\u2019s still early. I think we think of the world of AI, one of the things that the team is really focused on is how do we leverage AI to create value for our customers. That\u2019s a mantra that we\u2019ve been reinforcing over and over with our team and just really make sure that the work we\u2019re doing is landing with customers. And one great example of this is the work we did in our guest marketing tools. So you think of restaurateurs, they\u2019re not marketers. And so the ability to have generative AI create great campaigns for them when they\u2019re on their floor and have that drive demand for them. And this is all the text and the ability to actually send out these campaigns. As a great example of Leveraging AI, Generative AI to actually create value and create demand for restaurants. And we\u2019ve seen examples already it\u2019s early where it\u2019s actually having a big impact on the activation adoption of the product. Another example on the data side is benchmarking. So as you can imagine, we\u2019ve got 120,000 plus restaurants on the platform. And so we\u2019ve got this amazing data set that we can leverage. And the team is thinking through what are all the ways in which we can add value. And one of them is just leveraging the data to help restaurants be smarter. You think of how restaurants think about simple things like what to put on menus or how to price menus, how to think about inflation. There\u2019s not a lot of data that\u2019s been there historically. And so the ability to actually log in a Toast and say, tell me my Zip code what\u2019s going on, has been really, really well received. And with sue chef specifically, the idea is it\u2019s an umbrella, Think of it like ChatGPT, it\u2019s an umbrella where you can get prompts. You can get recommendations. You can also, over time, you can search to get feedback in terms of how to run a better restaurant. And so there are many ideas the team is considering within that umbrella and benchmarking or some of the work we\u2019re doing with CRM are examples of that where this prompt can give you recommendations on how to leverage data to be smarter or to drive demand.\nDavid Hynes: Yes, it makes sense. We did the demo of the benchmarking product down in New York, and it\u2019s pretty slick. So, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So Elena, I know I hear you on the back half guidance around net adds in the commentary. I just wanted to ask -- are you changing any of your assumptions around what you\u2019re expecting for gross retention as you think about the back half on what the net adds ultimately look like? And I guess, any observation on what you saw in the second quarter around churn or retention metrics inside of the installed base?\nElena Gomez: Yes. Broadly speaking now, I think the team has been executing well. No -- no material change in how we\u2019re thinking about the business. And on churn, we\u2019re slightly above the 10% range on an annualized basis, which is up slightly relative to a year ago, but very similar to where it\u2019s been the last few quarters. And it continues to be predominantly out of business churn, so the impact to ARR is low, right, on an ARR basis. So we built that into the net adds that you see, we build in our churn assumptions and no material change there.\nSamad Samana: Got you. And I apologize if I had missed this, but do you guys still have the view that you\u2019ll add more net adds this year than last year. I think you\u2019d previously said that. And I\u2019m not sure if I heard that on this call or not?\nElena Gomez: Yes. I answered that a few minutes ago. So yes, you did hear that.\nSamad Samana: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nElena Gomez: No. Problem,\nAman Narang: Thanks, Samad.\nOperator: We will now take our last question from the line of Andrew Bauch with Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Conan [ph] in on for Andrew. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus a little bit on the macro again. Just in the case that we see slower restaurant spend environment materialize throughout the back half some of the offsets built into the business or levers you can pull from the cost side to manage impacts near term? And what are you embedding into the guide? Thanks.\nElena Gomez: Yes. No, thanks for the question, Andrew or Conan for Andrew. Look, at the highest level, let me start by saying the value of the Toast platform is durable during tough times, and we\u2019ve proven that over cycles. But more importantly, we\u2019ve proven that we\u2019re able to adapt the business quickly. So as we became more a lean company earlier in the year, it just positions us to absorb changes in the macro and enables us to move faster if we need to. So if we needed to take action, we would. That said, right now, what we\u2019re seeing is same-store sales decline is really what\u2019s driving the GPV per location was down 3% in Q2. We\u2019re seeing that same zone as we start the quarter here and our guidance reflects that. We know the macro is dynamic, of course, and -- but we also know restaurants have proven to be resilient. So confident in the guide that we gave, and we\u2019ll just continue to monitor.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: I would like to hand back to your management team for some final remarks.\nElena Gomez: Thanks for the time everyone.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines, and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aman Narang",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. We had a strong second quarter. We added a record 8,000 net locations, our recurring gross profit streams increased 29% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA came in at 92 million and we've achieved GAAP income profitability ahead of expectations. I'm really proud of how the team performed and we're well positioned to continue to scale and have a strong second half. Our mission at Toast is to help restaurants delight their guests, do what they love and thrive. At our first Investor Day in May, we shared the opportunity, strategy and drivers behind our momentum. At about 13% share in U.S. restaurants, we have an incredible opportunity out of us, to scale and become the platform of choice serving this amazing industry. Our products and data assets, combined with our local go-to-market engine and customer success teams, uniquely position us to drive both location and ARPU expansion and sustained durable growth over the long term. In addition to scaling across U.S. SMB and mid-market restaurants, we're thoughtfully laying the foundation to expand our TAM across key international markets, enterprise restaurant chains as well as food and beverage retail. The team has done a great job of identifying segments of the market where we have a right to win without distracting from our ability to scale in our core market segments. And these investments allow us to expand our TAM and support our ability to drive durable growth and shareholder returns. We've increased our outlook for the full year based on our performance in the first half and we're all focused on the four strategic priorities we laid out earlier this year. One, scaling locations and market share in our core business; two, expanding our offering for restaurants with products customers love; three, expanding our addressable market into new adjacencies; and four, setting up the company to deliver ongoing operating leverage as we scale. So first, scaling restaurant locations and gaining share in our core business. Our record 8,000 net adds in the second quarter were driven by our purpose-built restaurant platform and our local go-to-market engine. As we gain momentum in local markets across the country, we continue to see a flywheel effect with higher rep productivity and faster market share gains. In fact, in our top 10 flywheel markets across the country with the highest market share, we saw 50% more wins on average in Q2 versus non-flywheel markets. This gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive strong market share gains over time. And we're gaining share because restaurants see the impact we can have on their businesses. I'll spotlight one recent example that speaks to the value we bring. Bizoria, a growing fast casual concept in Great Atlanta switched to Toast from another cloud provider to help fuel their next stage of growth. By complementing our POS terminals with self-ordering kiosks for guests and kitchen display systems across their food and prep lines, they've reduced average order times by 5 minutes. And as a result, Bizoria estimates that they have increased revenue by 25% across their locations. Switching gears, our second priority is expanding our offering for restaurants with products and experiences customers love. Our platform and partner ecosystem serves all the restaurant stakeholders, operators, guests, employees and suppliers and creates value across many dimensions, including supporting new revenue streams, driving throughput and simplifying operations. Last quarter, I talked about the launch of product suites across good, better and best tiers to simplify how we sell and how our products adopt -- how our customers adopt our products. We're starting to see this have an impact. For example, since we launched our digital storefront suite in the spring, approximately 30% of book locations upgraded to our Pro tier, which includes our new website product. And this website products works in concert with the rest of our digital suite, to help restaurants build a great online presence. As we continue to mature our product suites, we're confident we will see similar trends across our platform, which will, in turn, help us drive product attach in ARR. Internationally, across the U.K., Canada and Ireland, our team has been hard at work building out the platform to drive both differentiation and ARPU. In the first half, we launched several products, including online ordering, Mobile Order & Pay, gift cards and kiosk. Attach rates are surpassing expectations. As an example, nearly half of international June bookings adopted Toast line ordering. Tahini is a Canadian quick-serve restaurant that's already rolled out Toast across 42 locations. The plan is to double our location count next year. One of the highlights for Tahini has been a 15% increase in check sizes on their kiosk versus ordering at a POS terminal. They credit this increase to our kiosks ability to prompt for data-driven upsells via beautiful custom images of their dishes for items that go better together. And this growth in revenue has helped them invest more back into their business to support their ambitious growth goals. Our team is planned to roll out more products internationally this year, including guest marketing, restaurant retail, Toast tables as well as our hotel PMS integration. And with 2,000 live locations as of Q2, we are excited about our progress and continue to remain bullish on the long-term potential given how early we are in the international opportunity. Next, our third priority is expanding our addressable market into new adjacencies, including enterprise and food and beverage retail. We recently expanded our partnership with mussels pretzels by signing an extension for another 100 stores in addition to the 300 locations already on our platform. We continue to roll our Toast across a number of marquee brands, including wet soils and barbecue holdings, which are part of fast-growing MTY brands. And the improvements we have made to our platform, combined with our strong pipeline gives us confidence in steadily increasing enterprise penetration over time. As I mentioned in our Investor Day in May, the work we've put in over the past decade building on our platform has allowed us to enter new verticals, including grocery, convenience stores and bottle shops. There are 220,000 locations and 660 billion in spend in these markets alone in the U.S. And so far, we've booked 1,000 new customers. We see a significant growth opportunity here, in part because so much of this market is still using legacy on-prem solutions and see the benefits of an integrated cloud platform. For example, Victory Hospitality Group in Portland, Maine, recently launched three markets on Toast in addition to their portfolio of award-winning restaurants that have been with us since 2016. Since adding Toast, the staff has been able to offer better service to their guests by making back-office tasks, including inventory management, much more streamlined. We see examples like this across many of our early retail customers and have confidence that we can drive significant growth in the segment. And finally, our fourth priority is to deliver operating leverage in our core business as we scale both to drive shareholder returns and have the capital available to invest into our nascent market segments. Our adjusted EBITDA was 92 million in the second quarter, a 77 million improvement from a year ago. I'm very proud of the team's ability to both drive strong growth and this level of margin expansion in a short period of time. And as we look to the second half of the year, we will invest more back into our business to support our growth plans while working towards our long-term margin goals. To wrap up, I'm confident in how we're executing. We're still in the early innings and are prepared to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. I want to thank every Toaster for their continued dedication and passion for our mission. Our customers for entrusting us to support them. Our partners for helping us enable this great ecosystem and of course, our investors for believing in us and the potential in this business. Now I'll turn the call over to Elena to share more about this quarter's results. Thanks for the question, Dan. Yes. Look there's a broad range of capabilities we shared across our platform at Analyst Day. And this is everything from things like data and AI, we shared our benchmarking tool and how the feedback from our customers has been positive. Generative AI and leverage that in our CRM tool. Sous chef another area we're excited about to help be an umbrella for all of our AI innovations. So that's one area that the team is excited about. And then across our platform, we've talked about how the platform has commerce, guests, employee cloud and SMA and fintech. And across all of those areas there are -- there's work the team is putting in to help continue to refine and iterate on the products. So on guess, for example, or Toast stables product, catering, online ordering, CRM, our new website product. There's been good feedback on. On the employee cloud side, there's a lot of focus on our payroll product, working in conjunction with our scheduling and our Tips [ph] product. We're continuing to work on the product market fit in our supplier and accounting product. And I'll just wrap by saying a lot of the focus we have as a team, all what we're doing in suites is really to make sure that we're driving strong ARPU growth in the medium and long term. We have recognize this is an important growth driver for the business. Thanks, Dan. Yes. Great question. Well, thanks for asking. In terms of like the mix of NROs in existing, we've continued to see not a fundamentally different pattern. And our team is -- has the ability to sign and convert both existing restaurants and NROs. If it just zoom out, you think about like the progress we've made like one thing I just want to start by saying is I'm really proud of the team's performance. We had a record 8,000 net adds in Q2. And I was reflecting on how 8K is an important milestone for us. If you look at our ARPU at 12K plus and we're approaching 100 million in ARR that we added in the quarter. And you just think about sustaining this level of growth quarter-after-quarter for the next decade. I think it's a great outcome. In Q2 specifically a lot of the net adds came from our core U.S. SMB and mid-market business. As you can imagine it's taken us a decade to build our SMB business. And as I mentioned on the call one of the things I'm really proud of is our top 10 cyber markets continue to be really productive. In fact, it's at 50% more wins versus non-flywheel markets and flywheel markets have expanded 5x in the last 3 years. So while we're excited about adding capacity, sales capacity in international retail and we will look to do that in the second half. Really proud of the progress we've made in our core SMB business. And to your question about investing I think it's a fair question like ultimately, we see really healthy period in uneconomic in our core business. And we see nice growth drivers in some of these new segments that we're getting into. And so as long as we continue to see our unit economics be healthy, we're going to look to continue to invest. Yes. Thanks for the question, Stephen. I think we've mentioned in the calls in the past that the enterprise segment, the conversion cycles are slower. So there is more legacy upmarket. We also see that within retail, there are some very specific needs and there isn't a great cloud provider that has taken over the space. In fact, reminds me a little bit of what the restaurant business was like 10 years ago. And so those are the two segments that I see a lot of opportunity in. But even if you look at the international markets for larger restaurants with higher GPV the trend in pattern we see is a lot of legacy still out there. And so one of the big challenges for us is to really think about asset allocation right across all of these growth vectors and the thing that we're focused on is what is the customer feedback we're getting, what are our payback periods? What are your economics? What is our -- and those are some of the drivers that help us determine how we allocate capital across these different growth vectors. And where we see ultimately long term, the biggest growth potential across these market segments. And on upsell, Tim, on your question upsell, 2 years then, we're -- I'll start by saying we're learning a lot. We'll continue to optimize this in conjunction with our new business team. And this team is a critical component of driving to drive ARPU growth because the new business team first and foremost is focused on growing locations. And as our platform continues to improve, I talked about the question earlier about how do we think about the product portfolio and what customers are looking for as we continue to mature our platform and as we continue to invest in the suites to make our products easier to buy and sell. This upsell team is critical to making sure that we continue to drive ARPU growth to complement the great location growth that we're seeing. And the last thing is, we've talked in the past about Toast shop and product let growth. That's another thing that R&D team is very focused on, especially for products where the ability to adopt to activate is easier. So I think 2 years in, we're pleased with the progress. The upsell team has made. There's still work to do and we're committed to making sure that we continue to refine our land and expand motion across our new business team and our upsell team. Thanks, Tim. Yes. Sure. Thanks, Harshita. International Retail are growing nicely as we said share at Analyst Day, international -- 2,000 locations lives start to see the investments we're making to expand the platform that's resonating really well with our customers. And our team has got more to sell in their bag, which has been great. And we're going to continue to invest to bring more of our platform as we've shared in the past internationally before we really put the pedal down in some of these markets on go-to-market capacity. And on retail, we again, really proud of the progress the team's made. This was a Stockworks project that's gotten to 1,000 locations booked relatively quickly. But if you remember that if you zoom out and think about this our core business in the U.S., we've been at it for 11 years now relative to these new businesses that are still early doesn't have the same level of sales capacity, the same maturity in the product. And so the bulk of the adds are coming from our core business. And the thing we talked about the 5 wheel effect is still the primary driver of our growth. And as you think about the next few years and you think about especially about the next decade, of course, our aspirations are to continue to expand not just in our core business but also make these new areas more significant contributors and we're working on that. And just to add to that, in terms of check size or in the order side, there hasn't been any fundamental change. And I think if you look at these changes, these are very gradual and in a narrow band. And I think, as Elena mentioned, have been a pattern that we've seen over the past year. Yes. I think it's a fair question, Matt. I'm not going to use the baseball analogy, but I'll say that our core business in the U.S. we're in your 12 or 11 and we're in year 2 and year 1 for these other businesses to give you some context. But look, I'll start by saying like I think the customer reception has been amazing. It's been really positive. The history hospitality story that I shared in the call, we see a lot of these stories across our customer base. And I think one of the big drivers is that there's a lot of legacy solutions and the ability to move it to this all in one approach in the cloud, it really resonates with our customers in the space. In terms of the features, I think one of the ones we shared at Analyst Day that continues to resonate a lot is the ability to manage inventory on the floor. We continue to hear feedback, but that's a feature and a capability and there's some capabilities around that, adds a lot of efficiency for staff. On e-commerce also because I think the retailers offering e-commerce capability is important. And so having that built into the back end and integrated is really valuable. And then, Matt, your question on road map, there's work to do. If you think of the 20,000 locations we laid out, there's work to do on the fuel integrations that's an area. We're working on the payment side, supporting SNAP and EBT. There's some work in grocery around deli scale management. But we also get a lot on the platform. When you think about our platform, we get a lot across things like payroll and payments and scheduling that's built in that can really be reused. And so we see this as a great opportunity where the return investment our ability to build in the segment is really high. And then in international, I think it's not the same lift I know I talked about a lot of products, but it's not nearly the same lift to be able to bring these products to market internationally. But as you can imagine, we've taken a decade to build this platform in the U.S. And so to support internationalization, it's a gradual process that the team is working on. Yes. Thanks for the question, DJ. Look, I think it's still early. I think we think of the world of AI, one of the things that the team is really focused on is how do we leverage AI to create value for our customers. That's a mantra that we've been reinforcing over and over with our team and just really make sure that the work we're doing is landing with customers. And one great example of this is the work we did in our guest marketing tools. So you think of restaurateurs, they're not marketers. And so the ability to have generative AI create great campaigns for them when they're on their floor and have that drive demand for them. And this is all the text and the ability to actually send out these campaigns. As a great example of Leveraging AI, Generative AI to actually create value and create demand for restaurants. And we've seen examples already it's early where it's actually having a big impact on the activation adoption of the product. Another example on the data side is benchmarking. So as you can imagine, we've got 120,000 plus restaurants on the platform. And so we've got this amazing data set that we can leverage. And the team is thinking through what are all the ways in which we can add value. And one of them is just leveraging the data to help restaurants be smarter. You think of how restaurants think about simple things like what to put on menus or how to price menus, how to think about inflation. There's not a lot of data that's been there historically. And so the ability to actually log in a Toast and say, tell me my Zip code what's going on, has been really, really well received. And with sue chef specifically, the idea is it's an umbrella, Think of it like ChatGPT, it's an umbrella where you can get prompts. You can get recommendations. You can also, over time, you can search to get feedback in terms of how to run a better restaurant. And so there are many ideas the team is considering within that umbrella and benchmarking or some of the work we're doing with CRM are examples of that where this prompt can give you recommendations on how to leverage data to be smarter or to drive demand. Thanks, Samad."

            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "Thank you, Aman, and to everyone for joining I also want to thank our employees, your continued focus on execution delivered another strong quarter with top and bottom-line results above expectations. In the second quarter, ARR grew 29%, driven by strong location growth and continued ARPU expansion. Total fintech and subscription gross profit are recurring gross profit stream, also increased 29% year-over-year and totaled 344 million. Adjusted EBITDA was 92 million, representing a 27% margin on a recurring on our recurring gross profit streams. We reached GAAP profitability earlier than expected, an important milestone we have been working towards and further evidence of our ability to drive durable, efficient growth. In Q2, we added approximately 8,000 net locations, a new quarterly record, increasing our total locations to about 120,000, up 29% year-over-year. Location growth was primarily driven by continued share gains in our core U.S. SMB and mid-market customer segment, complemented by the contributions across international, enterprise and food and beverage retail. As a reminder, Q2 is our seasonally strongest quarter of the year as restaurants repair for peak season and we typically see lower quarterly net adds in the second half. SaaS ARR grew 35% year-over-year, driven by strong location growth and a mid-single-digit increase in SaaS ARPU on an ARR basis. Payments ARR grew 24% and fintech gross profit increased 23% in Q2. GPV was 40.5 billion, up 26% year-over-year, with GPV per location down about 3% versus prior year, consistent with recent quarterly trends. Net take rate was 54 basis points with core net take rate flat year-over-year at 45 basis points. Our non-payment fintech solutions led by Toast Capital contributed $34 million in gross profit and 8 basis points to the net take rate. The net take rate contribution is slightly lower than prior periods due to the introduction of forward flow, which comes with a lower take rate per dollar of origination, but carries no credit risk. Expanding capacity with diverse funding sources enables us to prudently grow the program and optimize across models to maximize risk-adjusted returns. We are on track for the targeted payments pricing increase we've discussed and expected to have a small impact on core net take rate in the second half of the year. Over time, ongoing price adjustments will be one of the several drivers of our long-term growth algorithm. Total operating expenses were up 2% year-over-year in the quarter, reflecting a full quarter of savings from restructuring actions taken earlier in the year. We anticipate operating expense growth will increase in the second half as we reinvest savings into our highest priority areas across go-to-market, product, TAM expansion to drive sustained long-term growth. We'll maintain the same disciplined investment approach we've employed and remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business to fund investments and drive margin expansion. Sales and marketing expenses increased 16% year-over-year in Q2 as we continue to grow our upsell and international sales teams and make targeted investments in our U.S. go-to-market motion to drive deeper penetration. R&D expenses declined 4% year-over-year in Q2. We expect to see the impact of reinvestment starting in Q3. We're making targeted investments aligned with our product strategy to provide a differentiated platform for our core SMB and mid-market customers, innovate new products that create value for our customers and expand into new TAMs. Excluding $50 million of bad debt and credit-related expenses, G&A was down 12% year-over-year. We will continue to drive efficiency within G&A, including through automation and global diversification of our workforce and expect ongoing operating leverage. Bad debt associated with Toast capital was lower relative to prior periods, benefiting from the addition of forward flow and the continued optimization of the program. Our progress in growing adjusted EBITDA combined with containing stock-based compensation expenses, resulted in our first quarter of GAAP operating income profit reaching 5 million in the quarter. Free cash flow totaled 108 million in the second quarter, driven by strong adjusted EBITDA and a benefit from working capital due to the seasonality of our payments business. Moving to capital allocation. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 49 million in shares. At the start of Q3, we also opportunistically repurchased a warrant for 5.2 million shares expiring in 2027 for 60 million. The warrant repurchase aligns with our broader capital allocation strategy to maximize shareholder value, in part by reducing dilution. We view it as an accelerated, efficient share repurchase and use of cash we would have otherwise allocated for opportunistic stock repurchases. As a result, we anticipate a slower pace of buyback through the balance of the year, although we will remain opportunistic based on market conditions. Now turning to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect total subscription and fintech gross profit to increase in the 23% to 27% range year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA to be 70 million to 80 million. Following our strong first half performance, we are increasing our full year outlook. We now expect 27% to 29% growth in fintech and subscription gross profit and 285 million to 305 million in adjusted EBITDA. At the midpoint, it represents a 22% margin, a 16 percentage point improvement versus 2023. We expect to be around breakeven on a GAAP basis for the remainder of the year. After benefiting from the restructuring savings in the first half of the year, our guidance includes investment in key areas of the business, which are concentrated in the back half of the year. This is also driving the quarterly fluctuations in adjusted EBITDA margins. Our expectations for the full year margins are representative of how we are managing the business and capture our growth investment and efficiency gains. We plan to build off of our full year 2024 margin and steadily progress towards our medium- and long-term targets. To wrap up, we are extremely proud of our execution and momentum through the first half of 2024. We are on track for a strong second half of the year and well positioned to sustain high growth and margin expansion over the long term. Now I will turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Tien-Tsin, for the question. So in Q2, our GPV per location was down 3%. And as we head into Q3, it's in that same range. So it's been relatively consistent. We're -- and our guidance reflects that as I laid out on the call. That said, the macro is dynamic, and we also know a couple of the data points about our restaurants. We've proven to be resilient through various economic cycles. But of course we're going to continue to monitor it. And just zooming out as we think about GPV growing 26% that's 40 billion this quarter, we just have a lot of confidence in our ability to manage the business through to various economic cycles. Yes. I mean that's a fair -- let me think about -- I'm trying to think about Q1. But that's a fair assessment, Tim, our guidance does reflect our latest thinking. And what we've seen is it's been relatively consistent in terms of same-store sales. It's been in this narrow band GPV per location. So that's how we think about it and we anticipate it to be in a narrow band for the back half of the year but that's factored into our guidance on a year-over-year basis. Yes. And Harshita, on your question on the second half, first of all, Aman -- il just echo Aman's comments, we had a strong first half of the year on that location as the demand and funnel remains strong, and we're still on track to add more new locations in \u201824 than we did in \u201823, and that's off a bigger base. I'll just reiterate what I said in the script, which is Q2 quarterly net adds tend to be obviously higher than the rest of the year given seasonality. So just think about that as you plan your models for the second half, but confident the team is executing well. Yes. I'm happy to unpack that. So just to put it in context, Q2 was down 3% August year-to-date in the same zone as I mentioned. And most of that's the primary driver of that is same-store sales declining year-over-year. So that's the primary driver. There's a small portion related to mix but it's mostly really same-store sales declining. And that China has been relatively consistent. And in terms of the different pockets of our segments, we haven't seen a notable pattern that's different across our segments. Yes. The only thing I would build upon what you said, Aman, is, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, we take capital allocation, obviously, as a strategy and some guiding principles. And as we think about these emerging businesses. We have a very thoughtful gated way that we approach investing. And so we wait to see signal before we incrementally invest -- so that's just a discipline we have, and you'll continue to see that as we grow these businesses. Yes. Broadly speaking now, I think the team has been executing well. No -- no material change in how we're thinking about the business. And on churn, we're slightly above the 10% range on an annualized basis, which is up slightly relative to a year ago, but very similar to where it's been the last few quarters. And it continues to be predominantly out of business churn, so the impact to ARR is low, right, on an ARR basis. So we built that into the net adds that you see, we build in our churn assumptions and no material change there. Yes. I answered that a few minutes ago. So yes, you did hear that. No. Problem, Yes. No, thanks for the question, Andrew or Conan for Andrew. Look, at the highest level, let me start by saying the value of the Toast platform is durable during tough times, and we've proven that over cycles. But more importantly, we've proven that we're able to adapt the business quickly. So as we became more a lean company earlier in the year, it just positions us to absorb changes in the macro and enables us to move faster if we need to. So if we needed to take action, we would. That said, right now, what we're seeing is same-store sales decline is really what's driving the GPV per location was down 3% in Q2. We're seeing that same zone as we start the quarter here and our guidance reflects that. We know the macro is dynamic, of course, and -- but we also know restaurants have proven to be resilient. So confident in the guide that we gave, and we'll just continue to monitor. Thanks for the time everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Cameron, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Toast First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call will be 45 minutes. I'll now turn the call over to Michael Senno, Senior Vice President of Finance. You may now begin your conference. \nMichael Senno: Thank you, Cameron. Welcome to Toast's earnings conference call for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. On today's call are CEO and Co-Founder, Aman Narang; and CFO, Elena Gomez, who'll open with prepared remarks, which will be followed by our Q&A session. \n Before we start, I'd like to draw your attention to the safe harbor statement included in today's press release.

Finally, the press release can be found on the Investor Relations website at investors.toasttab.com. After the call, a replay will be available on our website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Aman. \nAman Narang: Thank you, Michael, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. 2024 is off to a great start with first quarter results ahead of expectations across the board. We added over 6,000 net locations to our platform, our recurring gross profit streams increased 33% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA came in at $57 million, a $74 million improvement versus Q1 last year. \n I'm really proud of how the whole team performed, and we are well positioned to continue to scale and have a terrific year. Our mission at Toast is to help restaurants delight their guests, do what they love and thrive. We continue to innovate and drive value for our restaurant community, including with the recent launch of our restaurant management suite and upgraded digital storefront suite and a marketing suite, which for the first time, is leveraging AI to help our customers stay one step ahead. \n We're looking forward to sharing more about our longer-term vision and strategy at our Investor Day on May 29. We've increased our outlook for the full year based on our performance in Q1, and we are all focused on the 4 strategic priorities I laid out in our February earnings call: one, scaling locations and market share in our core business; two, driving ARR through platform growth; three, expanding addressable market into new adjacencies; and four, setting up the company to scale and deliver ongoing operating leverage. \n First, scaling restaurant locations and gaining share in our core business. We added over 6,000 net locations in the quarter, driven by the combination of our purpose-built restaurant platform and our local go-to-market engine. As we gain momentum in local markets across the country, we continue to see a pliable effect with higher rep productivity and faster market share gains, which gives us confidence in sustaining healthy location growth. \n Let me share 2 recent customer stories that speak to our momentum and the value we create for customers. Pickles Pub is a busy full-service restaurant and bar in downtown Baltimore near Camden Yards and M&T Bank Stadium. They switched to Toast to partner with a technology partner that could handle their volume, streamline operations and increase speed of service, particularly on those busy game days. On opening day for the Orioles, they blew through their previous sales record and credit the uplift in part to faster speed of service after implementing Toast Go Handhelds, Mobile Order & Pay and Kitchen Display Systems. \n Since switching to Toast, they have reduced order to delivery times for drinks to under a minute. And in addition, the addition of Mobile Order & Pay has opened up a new service model with 20% of food and drink orders coming in directly from guests scanning QR codes at the table and placing the orders themselves. \n I'm also excited to announce our agreement with Snooze Eatery, a breakfast and lunch concept with over 70 locations nationwide. Snooze needed a technology partner that could support their growth plans and provide a better guest experience with faster and more accurate service. They're rolling out Toast across their footprint. And for the locations they've taken live, they're already seeing benefits. Toast handhelds have increased server capacity, leading to higher sales, higher tips and greater earnings. As these 2 stories highlight, our focus on creating products that drive value for our customers continues to drive our growth. \n Our second priority is driving ARR and ARPU by building products and experiences our customers love. Earlier this year, we launched a suite-based approach to packaging that simplifies the sales process for customers and our sales reps alike. Our suites are designed with good, better, and best tiers and creates a path for customers to adopt more of our platform over time as well as provide a framework for us to roll out and monetize new products and features. They cover the breadth and depth of our customers' needs across restaurant operations, guest experience, as well as employee and supplier management. \n Let's walk through how the suites are adding value for our customers. The restaurant management suite helps multi-location operators access the latest version of our above-store management tools, and for the first time, access powerful benchmarking data across all restaurants on our platform. Our digital storefront suite helps restaurants take control of their online business, and our marketing suite helps them bring their guests back more often. These launches are scratching the surface of how Toast can leverage one of the best data sets in the restaurant industry to create value for customers. \n To bring this to life with an example, Whisk is a neighborhood restaurant North of Dallas that recently adopted our AI-powered writing assistant included in our marketing suite. The writing assistant not only does a great job of describing Whisk's food and atmosphere, it has cut the time required to send out a guest engagement campaign by more than half. Our recent AI-enhanced marketing campaign drove over $2,500 in sales for Whisk in April alone. \n Moving to our third priority, expanding our addressable market into new adjacencies. We continue to gain momentum across the first 3 international countries we launched in, the U.K., Canada, and Ireland and remain confident in the potential these markets have to help us drive growth. In Q1, we expanded the platform internationally with the launch of our integrated online ordering capability, which has been received incredibly well by our customers. And as the year progresses, we expect to launch more of our platform across both in-restaurant operations as well as the guest experience. This should help us drive further product differentiation and expand ARPU across these international markets. \n Within enterprise, we continue to gain momentum across a broad range of customers. The launch of the enterprise tier of our management suite allows our customers to manage their operations at scale and reduce the administrative workload on their corporate teams. Our pipeline in the segment remains strong, and we have confidence that we'll continue to increase penetration over time. And beyond international and enterprise, we're also investing to open up new opportunities where our vertical platform and our local go-to-market team can be a competitive advantage. \n Our fourth priority is setting up the company to scale and deliver ongoing operating leverage to complement our growth. As I mentioned, we delivered over $57 million in adjusted EBITDA in the past quarter, a $74 million improvement versus Q1 last year. We have aligned our resources on our most important priorities and are building a culture where everyone across the organization is taking efficiency seriously. This allowed us to increase our full year guidance and puts us on track to expand margins by over 13 percentage points to the midpoint versus last year without sacrificing our most important growth and innovation initiatives. \n To wrap up, I'll leave you with a few thoughts: one, I'm confident in how we're executing and thrilled to be leading this team; and two, we're still in the early innings of what is possible and have the foundation in place to capitalize on this incredible opportunity ahead. I want to thank every Toaster for their continued dedication and passion for our mission. It wouldn't be here without you. Our customers who are entrusting us to support you all, and our investors for believing in us and the potential in this business. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Elena to share more about this quarter's results. \nElena Gomez: Thank you, Aman, and to everyone for joining today. To start, I'll reiterate a thank you to our entire Toast team, whose hard work and continued execution led to another successful quarter. Top and bottom line results exceeded expectations, evidence of our operating momentum and disciplined approach at driving both growth and profitability. In the quarter, ARR grew 32%, and total fintech and subscription gross profit, our recurring gross profit streams increased 33% year-over-year. \n Adjusted EBITDA was $57 million in the first quarter, a 19% margin on our recurring gross profit streams, up 26 percentage points from Q1 last year. In Q1, we executed on reshaping our cost structure, better aligning our investments with our highest priorities and positioning ourselves to go faster on key growth initiatives. We now expect slightly higher annualized run rate savings and to capture more in-year savings in 2024 than initially estimated, including in Q1. \n The first quarter also included onetime cost benefits related to the restructuring. Those factors coupled with stronger-than-expected GPV as the quarter progressed, led to significant adjusted EBITDA outperformance in Q1 and contributed to the increase in our full year outlook. Our conviction in the opportunity ahead is stronger than ever. We will reinvest part of the incremental savings in key growth areas. We added over 6,000 net locations in Q1, increasing total live locations to approximately 112,000, up 32% year-over-year. Our focused vertical strategy and differentiated go-to-market engine, coupled with consistent execution, continue to drive location growth as we deepen penetration across the full breadth of the restaurant TAM. \n And with Toast in only 13% of U.S. restaurants and just scratching the surface internationally, we continue to have an opportunity to significantly increase share as we execute our playbook. SaaS ARR grew 39% year-over-year, driven by strong location growth and a 5% increase in SaaS ARPU on an ARR basis. And we continue to expect SaaS ARPU on an ARR basis to be in the mid-single digits in the near term. \n Payments ARR and fintech gross profit both grew 26% in the first quarter. GPV increased 30% to $34.7 billion with GPV per location down 2% year-over-year. After a softer January related to weather, GPV trends bounced back to similar levels we saw exiting 2023 and consistent with seasonal patterns. \n Net take rate was 55 basis points and other fintech products contributed 10 basis points. Our non-payments fintech solutions led by Toast Capital contributed $34 million in gross profit. Toast Capital continues to perform well. Customers value the fast, low-friction access to capital to grow their business, driving healthy demand for the product. As we scale the program, we will diversify and broaden our funding sources. In addition to our existing model, we recently added a forward flow model where a portion of Toast Capital loans are sold to third parties. \n For loans sold to a third party, we do not take credit risk. As a result, there is a slightly lower revenue take rate and typically no associated bad debt. On the P&L, compared to our current model, that translates to lower recurring gross profit for forward flow originations with nearly 100% flow-through. We plan to balance both models of the scale originations and continue to optimize for maximizing risk-adjusted returns. \n Expense growth moderated in the first quarter as we continue to drive efficiencies and cost discipline, coupled with savings from the restructuring actions. As we drive efficiency and increase profitability, we'll prudently invest in our highest priority growth areas, including product innovation, our go-to-market engine and new growth vectors to expand our TAM. Sales and marketing expenses were up 13% year-over-year. We continue to grow our upsell and international sales teams and make targeted investments in our U.S. new business team to drive deeper penetration. \n The Q1 restructuring actions impacted our R&D and G&A expense lines more than other parts of the business, resetting the expense growth trajectory in these areas. We expect R&D expenses will grow at a more moderate level as we continue to make targeted investments to drive product innovation and add value for our customers. G&A was down 13% year-over-year, excluding $15 million of bad debt and credit-related expenses, primarily related to reserves for Toast Capital. We expect ongoing operating leverage in G&A, reflecting our continued focus on driving efficiency in G&A as we scale, including through automation and global diversification of our workforce. \n Free cash flow was negative $33 million in the quarter due to the timing of cash bonus payments and severance payments in Q1. We expect free cash flow to be positive for the remainder of the year and broadly mirror adjusted EBITDA on a full year basis. \n Turning to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect total subscription and fintech gross profit to increase in the 20% to 24% range year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA to be $55 million to $65 million. Our top line growth rate is negatively impacted by a few points due to adding forward flow and comping a small onetime benefit last year. As a result of our strong start to the year, we raised our full year outlook. At the midpoint, we now expect 26% growth in fintech and subscription gross profit and $260 million in adjusted EBITDA, a margin of 19%, marking a 13 percentage point improvement versus 2023. \n After executing the restructuring, we now have visibility on higher in-year savings than expected and reset the guidance higher to reflect that. This also factors in our plans to reinvest in key areas of the business to drive sustained growth going forward. With our increased profit expectations for the year and progress on containing stock-based compensation, we are now on a path to be close to breakeven on GAAP operating income by the end of the year. \n To wrap up, we are making significant progress executing against our goals and are positioned to deliver strong top and bottom line results in 2024. Our top focus remains delivering value to customers, and we are well positioned to drive durable growth across our core business while building new growth curves. We announced our first Investor Day will be held on May 29, at which time you will hear more from our leadership team on our market opportunity, strategy, and growth plans. We are incredibly excited about what lies ahead for Toast and look forward to sharing with you more then. \n Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. \nJosh Baer: Congrats on a good quarter. Wanted to ask about net take rates from 2 perspectives. I was hoping you could comment on the interchange settlement and how that should impact take rates as well as an update just around taking price as far as the tactical approach of going back to select customers that have off-market contracts. \nElena Gomez: Yes, sure. I can take that. So in terms of the Visa-Mastercard settlement, it's really early and not final. Our early signal is it's most likely going to impact us in the second half of 2025. That's the early read. And also, I would also comment that it won't impact our entire volume of GPV, just at the highest level. So just keep that in mind as you guys update your models.\n But in the context of pricing, I think your question on take rate, as we've said, we're going to take pricing over time, it's going to be an ongoing cadence of small steady changes in price. No step function change in pricing this year. We're going to start with fintech in the second half of the year. And just keep in mind, it won't have a meaningful impact in 2024. But over time, you should see us execute against a steady cadence of price adjustments, in particular, in places where customers are out of market. \nAman Narang: Just to build on that, Josh, as we think about growth, it's really a combination of, if you think about our growth algorithm, it's a combination of product attach rates, product innovation and pricing. And we're thinking about all three of them as we think about where we are with 13% market share in the industry. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Koning with Baird. \nDavid Koning: I guess first of all, it looked to me like Q2 recurring GP growth is actually a little lower than the back half year. It looks to me like you're calling for a re-acceleration in the back half. Is that right? And what would that be attributed to? \nElena Gomez: Yes, so a couple of things. One, recurring -- let me just start giving context for the full year and Q2, there's some dynamics at play. But yes, if you look at the full year, our full year guidance at 26% at the midpoint would imply that, obviously, our GP grows over time. Q2, there's a few dynamics at play. One is the implementation of forward flow, which we talked about, and we're comping this onetime benefit to SaaS revenue in Q2. So those are contributing to a lower recurring gross profit in Q2. Then we talked about targeted fintech pricing towards the back half of the year. And that will be slight and gradual. \nDavid Koning: Got you. And just maybe as a follow-up, you talked about GPV per location being down a bit, just especially because of January. What is kind of April, May, June? Would we expect acceleration just because you don't have January, obviously, in Q2? \nElena Gomez: Yes. So I think -- so you're right, Josh. What happened in Q1, recall, January was a lighter -- we had a weather pattern that impacted January. As the quarter progressed, we saw GPV get back to sort of sustained levels or seasonal levels. So overall GPV was down, on a per location, down 2% in Q1. As we enter into the first part of Q2, down low single digits as we enter into the quarter. So that's what I would say.\n And then back to the question on the guidance on GPV, just keep in mind, GPV towards the back half of the year, that started to decrease in the back half of last year on a per location. So when you look towards the back half of the year, you'll see the GPV compares improve. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. \nDavid Hynes: Aman, I'd love to ask about the new suites that were rolled out, management suite, digital storefront, marketing suite. As you think about kind of sizing the opportunity in the installed base, how do you think about that? And then maybe you could talk about, are there incumbent technologies there? Is it more of a greenfield opportunity? Like what are the competitive dynamics? \nAman Narang: Yes. DJ, thanks for the question. If you look back the past couple of years, we've launched a lot of products. And really, the driver behind these suites was to simplify. And so we've introduced these suites to package our products and really simplify the sales process, both for our go-to-market team and our customers in terms of how easy it is to adopt and leverage the platform.\n The suites are organized into good, better, and best tiers to help both let our customers start off, for example, at one tier and then, over time as they see value, adopt more of it. And also as our team is driving more innovation, having a framework where our team can deliver more capabilities without just continuing to launch more and more products. I think it simplifies it for everyone.\n And in terms of like the types of products and areas we're investing in, of course, we're going to continue to invest in the lines of business and products we offer. This is across commerce, restaurant operations, guest experience, have launched a lot of products there, employee experience, fintech and supplier as well.\n And then I think the other thing that we're tracking very closely is how does AI and data play a role. So one of the things that we think is really powerful is we've got one of the most, if not the most powerful data set in the restaurant industry. And so how do you leverage that to help restaurants be more successful? One example is in our management suite. We've added restaurant management suite, we've added data benchmarking to help restaurants better understand how they benchmark relative to their peers, both on sales data, menu data, even what to put in menus and so just helping them be smarter by leveraging the data.\n And then on things like our guest management suite, we're leveraging AI to drive campaigns, again leveraging all that guest data that's in our platform. So that's another big area of focus for the team. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. \nHarshita Rawat: So Elena, you talked about 30% to 35% margin target long term as you think about percentage of gross profit. As now we think about the operating leverage you're achieving in the business and also kind of driving the gradual adjustment as a component, is there a change in thinking about that long-term profitability target? And also, how should we think about long-term GAAP profitability as well? \nElena Gomez: Sure, great question. So I'll provide context on our long-term financial profile at Analyst Day. But just sort of pivoting back to 2024, our guidance shows significant progress on margin. And you've seen us deliver that efficiency and scale over the course of the last several quarters. So we're going to continue with that discipline. And you heard Aman talk about his strategic priorities as he's laid out. We're positioning the company really to drive ongoing operating leverage while we're balancing that with growth and innovation. So I don't have an update today but we'll update you at Analyst Day.\n And you had a question on GAAP, actually, that's a really good point. You had a question on GAAP. Overall, just keep in mind, we've been very focused on stock-based comp as well as you've heard us talk about that. So that's really what's driving our confidence in the updated guidance on GAAP on this call. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Sorry, can you hear me? \nElena Gomez: Yes. Now we can. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Just on the -- I was following up on Dave's question on GPV per location. Beyond the second quarter, I know some of the compares will help. We do see that on our side as well. But just given some of the mix shifts and different focus upmarket, downmarket, any sort of directional view on GPV per location structurally beyond the macro? \nAman Narang: Yes, Tien-Tsin, thanks for the question. Nothing material to report there. I mean, if you look at the bulk of our growth, that is still being driven by our core SMB business. And the same effect we've talked about is as we gain share, we're seeing the same flywheel effect. It's taken us a decade to get -- build a business we've built in our SMB business. And while we're excited about the potential internationally in enterprise and other segments of the market, that's not what's materially driving any changes in GPV. I mean, I think some of this is just if you think about restaurant sales trends, they're stable, but year-over-year, there was some small decel that we saw. Now it's stabilized in a narrow band. \nElena Gomez: Yes, and I would just add that as we extend the different parts of the TAM, any mix shift will be very gradual over a long period of time. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Makes sense. Yes, you got a big base here. Okay, just my quick follow-up maybe for you, Aman. Just we get a lot of questions on competitive intensity and a lot of your peers are upgrading tech and verticalizing and adding more software content around these verticals. Are you seeing any change there? And does it change your sort of focus around product velocity or going into adjacencies, that kind of thing? \nAman Narang: Yes. I mean, look, we're also investing in a big way to continue to innovate for our customers. I talked about some examples with how we're leveraging data and AI to just really help this customer community with this unique data asset that we have. And we had a good -- maybe I'll start by saying that a great quarter. You saw 6,000 net adds, I think great momentum in the business. Back to our -- this really speaks to the team's execution but also our platform and our go-to-market engine.\n And this is always -- we've said this before in calls but it's always been a competitive market. I think we continue to see great execution, good win rates, productivity from our team is strong. And we continue to believe the biggest thing, the biggest factor that's going to drive our growth long term is our own execution, getting more of these markets into flywheel, getting word-of-mouth, getting customer experience to be the best it can be. So nothing material to report. We track a lot of this very closely across competitors, nothing material to report at the moment. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. \nPeter Heckmann: Some of my questions echo what we've already heard, but when you think about that roughly 850,000 restaurant locations in the U.S., I guess how do you feel about how much of that is addressable by your current solution, either the turnkey option or software, hardware but not with payments? I guess, how difficult is it for -- will it be as you move upmarket to displace more modern software or more modern payment players? \nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks for the question, Pete. Look, I think if you look at the overall TAM, we see there's a lot of room for us to continue to grow in our core TAM. Overall, Toast is about, I think, 13% of U.S. restaurants, as Elena mentioned. Within SMB and mid-market, that penetration is a little bit higher in mid to high teens. And of course, enterprise is still nascent and it's early.\n Even in these markets that are the most penetrated where we've got 25%, 30% share, these are the flywheel markets we talked about, we still see some of the strongest growth in terms of net adds in those markets. And so the #1 focus of the team is to get all of our markets into flywheel state. As we think about in enterprise, you asked about upmarket, I think at least what we see is that the adoption of cloud upmarket is lower. There's more of legacy solutions.\n And I think part of why we have expanded our platform to support a partner like FreedomPay is to make the platform more accessible in ways that customers want to buy, so we're more flexible upmarket based on what our customers need. And of course, we've got hundreds of partners as well that are on top of our platform that can build on our solution as well.\n So I think certainly, like it's -- as we think about going upmarket, it's -- we're happy with the momentum and the progress we're making. But we also want to be balanced about making sure that the customers we take on are in line with where the platform is going. So we don't want any one customer to take over our road map, for example. \nPeter Heckmann: Okay, that's helpful. And then have you talked about what's implied from a net revenue retention basis in your annual guidance that you think we can see that uptick after the downtick in 2023? \nElena Gomez: Yes. We haven't commented on that specifically so nothing new to report on that today. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. \nStephen Sheldon: Maybe I want to start with you, Aman. Want to get some more detail on the benchmarking analytics. How robust could those capabilities become? And how does this support even more differentiation for your platform relative to competing vendors? It seems like you've been a very favorable spot for buying benchmarking, given your size and scale. So how important could these capabilities be to your restaurant owners, operators? And is this a capability that they've been asking for? \nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks for the question, Stephen. They have been asking for it. I think at the scale that we're at, we've got likely one of the best data sets in the restaurant industry. And so our team is thinking about what are ways in which we can apply to really add value for restaurants. And one of the use cases that, frankly, have come up for years at this point is how can you leverage this data to better understand things like, what are you seeing in terms of sales trends? What are you thinking in terms of inflation and price adjustments? What are you seeing in terms of what's on the menu, pricing on the menu?\n And so there's a whole host of use cases where our customers value understanding that data across their geographies, zip codes, nationally. And so that's really what's driving that benchmarking initiative. And the early signs from our customers has been very positive. Again, it's early so we're still iterating on the product based upon customer feedback but it's leveraging the data that we have. \nStephen Sheldon: Very helpful. And then maybe a quick follow-up for Elena on location growth. What's your level of confidence now in being able to surpass 2023 net adds? Are you still on track for that, given the outperformance in the first quarter and what you're seeing in the pipeline? \nElena Gomez: Yes. No, absolutely, Stephen. As Aman said, we had a strong start to Q1, and we're seeing a lot of great momentum from the sales team on the ground. Q2 is typically seasonally stronger and we don't see any reason why that will be different. Seen really good demand and the funnel is strong, so overall, we have no reason -- we still believe that we'll add more locations in 2024 than we did in 2023. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tim Chiodo with UBS. \nTimothy Chiodo: I want to talk a little bit about the sales team. So you mentioned investing behind the upsell team, the international sales teams. I believe the last time that you formally disclosed the size of the overall sales and marketing organization was at the time of the IPO. It was about 730 people and a subset of that would have been the actual quota-carrying salespeople.\n Could you just give some directional color on how large that team may be now? How large the 730 might have grown to? Anything to give us some context on the overall size and breadth of the sales team? \nElena Gomez: Yes. So thanks, Tim, for the question. We've continued to add to the team, of course, since the IPO as you've seen as our locations grown. But keep in mind, this dynamic around flywheels allows us to grow ARR without adding reps. So we're gaining that efficiency and productivity from our sales reps all the while, to the point you made, growing our upsell team, investing behind international and enterprise.\n So while I can't give specificity at the highest level, we feel like we're really balanced across both our new business team, our upsell team, and now these early investments in international. So overall, we're managing the payback periods as we always do, and that's how we're thinking about surgically adding to our sales force over time. \nTimothy Chiodo: Great. And if you don't mind, just a brief numbers follow-up. The forward flow for Toast Capital, you mentioned a little bit of an impact for Q2. But just broadly speaking for the rest of the year, roughly what would that have been in terms of gross profit or recurring gross profit impact, i.e., would the recurring gross profit guide have been a point or two higher absent the forward flow change? \nElena Gomez: Yes, it's early, Tim, so the impact in 2024 won't be as meaningful as I would give you that context for the balance of the year. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. \nJason Kupferberg: Just wanted to follow up on the location adds. Obviously, you beat your first quarter guide there, I think, by about 10%. Was hoping you could talk about which segments of the end market drove the upside. And what is your specific expectation for Q2 net adds? \nAman Narang: Yes. Thanks, Jason. We had, as I mentioned earlier, the bulk of the growth came from our core business. Within our core business, we continue to see, as we get more markets with higher share, it's driving our productivity. And our team's focus is really getting more and more of our markets into this viable state so that we can keep on benefiting from the scale that we're at.\n Seeing early good momentum within international and enterprise as well. And those teams, I'd say, are, compared to our SMB business, just early. So while there's good momentum, you could zoom out and think about our core SMB business, we've been at this for a decade. And so these new businesses, while they're contributing and over time, you should expect them to contribute more as a percentage, the bulk of the growth today is really still coming from our core SMB business. \nElena Gomez: Yes. And in terms of Q2, it's seasonally higher, Jason, but nothing specific. But our momentum is strong. \nJason Kupferberg: Any update on just the percent of locations that are using 6 or more of the elective products? I know you've been giving that each quarter. And I think, if I recall, it kind of stabilized around the second half of last year. So just any updates on how that's trending? \nAman Narang: Yes. Sure, Jason. I think that, that metric overall is just less relevant for us. We've added more and more products that now we've packaged up, as I mentioned, to these suites just because it's simpler for our sales reps to sell, our customers to adopt. We added these good, better, best tiers where they can start with one version, take as an example, digital storefront suite, you can start with the version and then add advanced capabilities like websites and advanced versions of online ordering. And so really, the better metric now is adoption of suites at different levels. And of course, we're tracking that with ARPU. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matt Coad with Autonomous. \nMatthew Coad: I wanted to ask one more on capital. Curious, if we looked at it from a different perspective so not the dollars of gross profit but rather the dollars of contribution margin, so thinking gross profit less your reserve build, do you think this forward flow agreement will help you kind of like expand that contribution margin percentage and grow contribution margin going forward? \nElena Gomez: Yes. At the highest level forward flow, the model is such that we don't take credit risk so the margin profile is healthy. And just kind of zooming out when you think about the capital program, we're really trying to optimize or maximize our risk-adjusted returns. So as we scale, we're going to build more partners, and in this case, workflow offers us a really healthy margin profile and still allows us to scale the business as well. So hopefully, that answers your question. \nMatthew Coad: Yes, that's helpful. And then just for my follow-up. Elena, sorry if this is you repeating yourself, but curious if you could provide an update, of the $100 million of annualized cost savings from the risk, how much of that did we see in 1Q? \nElena Gomez: In 1Q, did I say -- I don't think we've given the quarterly guidance, to be honest. But I will tell you, because of the fact that we had -- I talked about on the script some onetime benefits. We had a little bit higher savings than we anticipated, roughly around $10 million of incremental savings from the $100 million. And just keep in mind, 1/3 of it is related to stock-based comp. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Dominic Ball with Redburn Atlantic. \nDominic Ball: Great job on taking market share as always. So it seems like in the SMB, the breadth and depth of products offered by Toast is clearly market-leading. My question is for larger merchants, be that upper mid-market or enterprise, are there any product gaps that you would like to fill? I asked this because the recent restaurant management suite put release, the benchmarking tool was really interesting. So should we expect more product releases in the future specifically geared to larger merchants? \nAman Narang: Dominic, thanks for the question. That is the plan gradually as we continue to invest across the whole TAM, including enterprise. The goal of the restaurant management suite was to provide a capability where we can start to drop in more and more of the capabilities into the suite. And so whether it's our above-store management tools, whether it's our extensibility and our APIs, food security and compliance, config management, there's a whole host of capabilities that we're investing in to make our product a better fit upmarket, including, by the way, drive-through capabilities as well over time. And so this is the plan in the long term. And the restaurant management suite allows us to package all of it up into a suite that can be used upmarket. \nDominic Ball: That's super interesting. And just one more, if that's okay. For international growth, how should we think about the product pipeline, the product parity with the U.S. and then the subsequent OpEx attached to that? So what I mean is, because in the U.S., you sort of build these products from scratch and now that isn't the case when you go international, is there a lower cost of growth or because there's different markets that are actually a higher initial cost of growth? \nAman Narang: Yes. I think, look, maybe I'll just say that we -- if you looked this quarter, we announced the online ordering, integrated online ordering, which is a big feature request from our customers internationally, it's been really well received. And there's a road map to continue to invest and expand the product both from a guest experience standpoint and in restaurant operations perspective to support our international customers. A lot of that is driven by our customer base.\n I think the incremental investment to go -- to build out the product, certainly not the same as building the product for the U.S. market, given we're building on top of what we've built here over the past decade. And also, I think one more thing I'll call out is we've built a framework here where whether it's language or currency or location-specific requirements, payments, for example, is one, the capabilities reusable across new market. So as we enter the next scale of markets over time, it should actually allow us to go even faster. \nOperator: We will now take our last question from the line of Sheriq Sumar with Evercore ISI. \nSheriq Sumar: I just wanted to ask about the cadence around the SaaS ARPU for this year. Like is there any kind of fluctuation that we could expect? And probably -- I mean, I know it's kind of a bit too early but thinking beyond 2024, I mean, just wanted to get a sense on the upsell strategy that could we expect to see any kind of potential improvement in the SaaS ARPU growth trend from here? \nElena Gomez: Yes, Sheriq, I'll take that. So in the near term, we've said mid-single digits on an ARR basis, and that's still -- we feel confident in delivering on that in the near term. Zooming out, when you think about our opportunity long term, there's really a few things we think about. One is growing our attach, right? And that's through optimizing the breadth of products we have and working on product market fit, our upsell team, pricing and packaging.\n And then there's innovation that's -- we're continuing to invest in our R&D team to drive future innovation. And then, of course, as we've talked about, we will implement an ongoing cadence of small steady pricing changes, over time, both on the SaaS side but also even on the fintech side, even though I know you're asking about SaaS ARPU. So we have an opportunity over time to grow our ARPU. But in the near term, mid-single digits is the right proxy on an ARR basis. \nMichael Senno: Operator, I think that ramps up our call for today. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Aman Narang",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. 2024 is off to a great start with first quarter results ahead of expectations across the board. We added over 6,000 net locations to our platform, our recurring gross profit streams increased 33% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA came in at $57 million, a $74 million improvement versus Q1 last year. \n I'm really proud of how the whole team performed, and we are well positioned to continue to scale and have a terrific year. Our mission at Toast is to help restaurants delight their guests, do what they love and thrive. We continue to innovate and drive value for our restaurant community, including with the recent launch of our restaurant management suite and upgraded digital storefront suite and a marketing suite, which for the first time, is leveraging AI to help our customers stay one step ahead. \n We're looking forward to sharing more about our longer-term vision and strategy at our Investor Day on May 29. We've increased our outlook for the full year based on our performance in Q1, and we are all focused on the 4 strategic priorities I laid out in our February earnings call: one, scaling locations and market share in our core business; two, driving ARR through platform growth; three, expanding addressable market into new adjacencies; and four, setting up the company to scale and deliver ongoing operating leverage. \n First, scaling restaurant locations and gaining share in our core business. We added over 6,000 net locations in the quarter, driven by the combination of our purpose-built restaurant platform and our local go-to-market engine. As we gain momentum in local markets across the country, we continue to see a pliable effect with higher rep productivity and faster market share gains, which gives us confidence in sustaining healthy location growth. \n Let me share 2 recent customer stories that speak to our momentum and the value we create for customers. Pickles Pub is a busy full-service restaurant and bar in downtown Baltimore near Camden Yards and M&T Bank Stadium. They switched to Toast to partner with a technology partner that could handle their volume, streamline operations and increase speed of service, particularly on those busy game days. On opening day for the Orioles, they blew through their previous sales record and credit the uplift in part to faster speed of service after implementing Toast Go Handhelds, Mobile Order & Pay and Kitchen Display Systems. \n Since switching to Toast, they have reduced order to delivery times for drinks to under a minute. And in addition, the addition of Mobile Order & Pay has opened up a new service model with 20% of food and drink orders coming in directly from guests scanning QR codes at the table and placing the orders themselves. \n I'm also excited to announce our agreement with Snooze Eatery, a breakfast and lunch concept with over 70 locations nationwide. Snooze needed a technology partner that could support their growth plans and provide a better guest experience with faster and more accurate service. They're rolling out Toast across their footprint. And for the locations they've taken live, they're already seeing benefits. Toast handhelds have increased server capacity, leading to higher sales, higher tips and greater earnings. As these 2 stories highlight, our focus on creating products that drive value for our customers continues to drive our growth. \n Our second priority is driving ARR and ARPU by building products and experiences our customers love. Earlier this year, we launched a suite-based approach to packaging that simplifies the sales process for customers and our sales reps alike. Our suites are designed with good, better, and best tiers and creates a path for customers to adopt more of our platform over time as well as provide a framework for us to roll out and monetize new products and features. They cover the breadth and depth of our customers' needs across restaurant operations, guest experience, as well as employee and supplier management. \n Let's walk through how the suites are adding value for our customers. The restaurant management suite helps multi-location operators access the latest version of our above-store management tools, and for the first time, access powerful benchmarking data across all restaurants on our platform. Our digital storefront suite helps restaurants take control of their online business, and our marketing suite helps them bring their guests back more often. These launches are scratching the surface of how Toast can leverage one of the best data sets in the restaurant industry to create value for customers. \n To bring this to life with an example, Whisk is a neighborhood restaurant North of Dallas that recently adopted our AI-powered writing assistant included in our marketing suite. The writing assistant not only does a great job of describing Whisk's food and atmosphere, it has cut the time required to send out a guest engagement campaign by more than half. Our recent AI-enhanced marketing campaign drove over $2,500 in sales for Whisk in April alone. \n Moving to our third priority, expanding our addressable market into new adjacencies. We continue to gain momentum across the first 3 international countries we launched in, the U.K., Canada, and Ireland and remain confident in the potential these markets have to help us drive growth. In Q1, we expanded the platform internationally with the launch of our integrated online ordering capability, which has been received incredibly well by our customers. And as the year progresses, we expect to launch more of our platform across both in-restaurant operations as well as the guest experience. This should help us drive further product differentiation and expand ARPU across these international markets. \n Within enterprise, we continue to gain momentum across a broad range of customers. The launch of the enterprise tier of our management suite allows our customers to manage their operations at scale and reduce the administrative workload on their corporate teams. Our pipeline in the segment remains strong, and we have confidence that we'll continue to increase penetration over time. And beyond international and enterprise, we're also investing to open up new opportunities where our vertical platform and our local go-to-market team can be a competitive advantage. \n Our fourth priority is setting up the company to scale and deliver ongoing operating leverage to complement our growth. As I mentioned, we delivered over $57 million in adjusted EBITDA in the past quarter, a $74 million improvement versus Q1 last year. We have aligned our resources on our most important priorities and are building a culture where everyone across the organization is taking efficiency seriously. This allowed us to increase our full year guidance and puts us on track to expand margins by over 13 percentage points to the midpoint versus last year without sacrificing our most important growth and innovation initiatives. \n To wrap up, I'll leave you with a few thoughts: one, I'm confident in how we're executing and thrilled to be leading this team; and two, we're still in the early innings of what is possible and have the foundation in place to capitalize on this incredible opportunity ahead. I want to thank every Toaster for their continued dedication and passion for our mission. It wouldn't be here without you. Our customers who are entrusting us to support you all, and our investors for believing in us and the potential in this business. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Elena to share more about this quarter's results. Just to build on that, Josh, as we think about growth, it's really a combination of, if you think about our growth algorithm, it's a combination of product attach rates, product innovation and pricing. And we're thinking about all three of them as we think about where we are with 13% market share in the industry. Yes. DJ, thanks for the question. If you look back the past couple of years, we've launched a lot of products. And really, the driver behind these suites was to simplify. And so we've introduced these suites to package our products and really simplify the sales process, both for our go-to-market team and our customers in terms of how easy it is to adopt and leverage the platform.\n The suites are organized into good, better, and best tiers to help both let our customers start off, for example, at one tier and then, over time as they see value, adopt more of it. And also as our team is driving more innovation, having a framework where our team can deliver more capabilities without just continuing to launch more and more products. I think it simplifies it for everyone.\n And in terms of like the types of products and areas we're investing in, of course, we're going to continue to invest in the lines of business and products we offer. This is across commerce, restaurant operations, guest experience, have launched a lot of products there, employee experience, fintech and supplier as well.\n And then I think the other thing that we're tracking very closely is how does AI and data play a role. So one of the things that we think is really powerful is we've got one of the most, if not the most powerful data set in the restaurant industry. And so how do you leverage that to help restaurants be more successful? One example is in our management suite. We've added restaurant management suite, we've added data benchmarking to help restaurants better understand how they benchmark relative to their peers, both on sales data, menu data, even what to put in menus and so just helping them be smarter by leveraging the data.\n And then on things like our guest management suite, we're leveraging AI to drive campaigns, again leveraging all that guest data that's in our platform. So that's another big area of focus for the team. Yes, Tien-Tsin, thanks for the question. Nothing material to report there. I mean, if you look at the bulk of our growth, that is still being driven by our core SMB business. And the same effect we've talked about is as we gain share, we're seeing the same flywheel effect. It's taken us a decade to get -- build a business we've built in our SMB business. And while we're excited about the potential internationally in enterprise and other segments of the market, that's not what's materially driving any changes in GPV. I mean, I think some of this is just if you think about restaurant sales trends, they're stable, but year-over-year, there was some small decel that we saw. Now it's stabilized in a narrow band. Yes. I mean, look, we're also investing in a big way to continue to innovate for our customers. I talked about some examples with how we're leveraging data and AI to just really help this customer community with this unique data asset that we have. And we had a good -- maybe I'll start by saying that a great quarter. You saw 6,000 net adds, I think great momentum in the business. Back to our -- this really speaks to the team's execution but also our platform and our go-to-market engine.\n And this is always -- we've said this before in calls but it's always been a competitive market. I think we continue to see great execution, good win rates, productivity from our team is strong. And we continue to believe the biggest thing, the biggest factor that's going to drive our growth long term is our own execution, getting more of these markets into flywheel, getting word-of-mouth, getting customer experience to be the best it can be. So nothing material to report. We track a lot of this very closely across competitors, nothing material to report at the moment. Yes. Thanks for the question, Pete. Look, I think if you look at the overall TAM, we see there's a lot of room for us to continue to grow in our core TAM. Overall, Toast is about, I think, 13% of U.S. restaurants, as Elena mentioned. Within SMB and mid-market, that penetration is a little bit higher in mid to high teens. And of course, enterprise is still nascent and it's early.\n Even in these markets that are the most penetrated where we've got 25%, 30% share, these are the flywheel markets we talked about, we still see some of the strongest growth in terms of net adds in those markets. And so the #1 focus of the team is to get all of our markets into flywheel state. As we think about in enterprise, you asked about upmarket, I think at least what we see is that the adoption of cloud upmarket is lower. There's more of legacy solutions.\n And I think part of why we have expanded our platform to support a partner like FreedomPay is to make the platform more accessible in ways that customers want to buy, so we're more flexible upmarket based on what our customers need. And of course, we've got hundreds of partners as well that are on top of our platform that can build on our solution as well.\n So I think certainly, like it's -- as we think about going upmarket, it's -- we're happy with the momentum and the progress we're making. But we also want to be balanced about making sure that the customers we take on are in line with where the platform is going. So we don't want any one customer to take over our road map, for example. Yes. Thanks for the question, Stephen. They have been asking for it. I think at the scale that we're at, we've got likely one of the best data sets in the restaurant industry. And so our team is thinking about what are ways in which we can apply to really add value for restaurants. And one of the use cases that, frankly, have come up for years at this point is how can you leverage this data to better understand things like, what are you seeing in terms of sales trends? What are you thinking in terms of inflation and price adjustments? What are you seeing in terms of what's on the menu, pricing on the menu?\n And so there's a whole host of use cases where our customers value understanding that data across their geographies, zip codes, nationally. And so that's really what's driving that benchmarking initiative. And the early signs from our customers has been very positive. Again, it's early so we're still iterating on the product based upon customer feedback but it's leveraging the data that we have. Yes. Thanks, Jason. We had, as I mentioned earlier, the bulk of the growth came from our core business. Within our core business, we continue to see, as we get more markets with higher share, it's driving our productivity. And our team's focus is really getting more and more of our markets into this viable state so that we can keep on benefiting from the scale that we're at.\n Seeing early good momentum within international and enterprise as well. And those teams, I'd say, are, compared to our SMB business, just early. So while there's good momentum, you could zoom out and think about our core SMB business, we've been at this for a decade. And so these new businesses, while they're contributing and over time, you should expect them to contribute more as a percentage, the bulk of the growth today is really still coming from our core SMB business. Yes. Sure, Jason. I think that, that metric overall is just less relevant for us. We've added more and more products that now we've packaged up, as I mentioned, to these suites just because it's simpler for our sales reps to sell, our customers to adopt. We added these good, better, best tiers where they can start with one version, take as an example, digital storefront suite, you can start with the version and then add advanced capabilities like websites and advanced versions of online ordering. And so really, the better metric now is adoption of suites at different levels. And of course, we're tracking that with ARPU. Dominic, thanks for the question. That is the plan gradually as we continue to invest across the whole TAM, including enterprise. The goal of the restaurant management suite was to provide a capability where we can start to drop in more and more of the capabilities into the suite. And so whether it's our above-store management tools, whether it's our extensibility and our APIs, food security and compliance, config management, there's a whole host of capabilities that we're investing in to make our product a better fit upmarket, including, by the way, drive-through capabilities as well over time. And so this is the plan in the long term. And the restaurant management suite allows us to package all of it up into a suite that can be used upmarket. Yes. I think, look, maybe I'll just say that we -- if you looked this quarter, we announced the online ordering, integrated online ordering, which is a big feature request from our customers internationally, it's been really well received. And there's a road map to continue to invest and expand the product both from a guest experience standpoint and in restaurant operations perspective to support our international customers. A lot of that is driven by our customer base.\n I think the incremental investment to go -- to build out the product, certainly not the same as building the product for the U.S. market, given we're building on top of what we've built here over the past decade. And also, I think one more thing I'll call out is we've built a framework here where whether it's language or currency or location-specific requirements, payments, for example, is one, the capabilities reusable across new market. So as we enter the next scale of markets over time, it should actually allow us to go even faster."

            "name": "Elena Gomez",
            "content": "Thank you, Aman, and to everyone for joining today. To start, I'll reiterate a thank you to our entire Toast team, whose hard work and continued execution led to another successful quarter. Top and bottom line results exceeded expectations, evidence of our operating momentum and disciplined approach at driving both growth and profitability. In the quarter, ARR grew 32%, and total fintech and subscription gross profit, our recurring gross profit streams increased 33% year-over-year. \n Adjusted EBITDA was $57 million in the first quarter, a 19% margin on our recurring gross profit streams, up 26 percentage points from Q1 last year. In Q1, we executed on reshaping our cost structure, better aligning our investments with our highest priorities and positioning ourselves to go faster on key growth initiatives. We now expect slightly higher annualized run rate savings and to capture more in-year savings in 2024 than initially estimated, including in Q1. \n The first quarter also included onetime cost benefits related to the restructuring. Those factors coupled with stronger-than-expected GPV as the quarter progressed, led to significant adjusted EBITDA outperformance in Q1 and contributed to the increase in our full year outlook. Our conviction in the opportunity ahead is stronger than ever. We will reinvest part of the incremental savings in key growth areas. We added over 6,000 net locations in Q1, increasing total live locations to approximately 112,000, up 32% year-over-year. Our focused vertical strategy and differentiated go-to-market engine, coupled with consistent execution, continue to drive location growth as we deepen penetration across the full breadth of the restaurant TAM. \n And with Toast in only 13% of U.S. restaurants and just scratching the surface internationally, we continue to have an opportunity to significantly increase share as we execute our playbook. SaaS ARR grew 39% year-over-year, driven by strong location growth and a 5% increase in SaaS ARPU on an ARR basis. And we continue to expect SaaS ARPU on an ARR basis to be in the mid-single digits in the near term. \n Payments ARR and fintech gross profit both grew 26% in the first quarter. GPV increased 30% to $34.7 billion with GPV per location down 2% year-over-year. After a softer January related to weather, GPV trends bounced back to similar levels we saw exiting 2023 and consistent with seasonal patterns. \n Net take rate was 55 basis points and other fintech products contributed 10 basis points. Our non-payments fintech solutions led by Toast Capital contributed $34 million in gross profit. Toast Capital continues to perform well. Customers value the fast, low-friction access to capital to grow their business, driving healthy demand for the product. As we scale the program, we will diversify and broaden our funding sources. In addition to our existing model, we recently added a forward flow model where a portion of Toast Capital loans are sold to third parties. \n For loans sold to a third party, we do not take credit risk. As a result, there is a slightly lower revenue take rate and typically no associated bad debt. On the P&L, compared to our current model, that translates to lower recurring gross profit for forward flow originations with nearly 100% flow-through. We plan to balance both models of the scale originations and continue to optimize for maximizing risk-adjusted returns. \n Expense growth moderated in the first quarter as we continue to drive efficiencies and cost discipline, coupled with savings from the restructuring actions. As we drive efficiency and increase profitability, we'll prudently invest in our highest priority growth areas, including product innovation, our go-to-market engine and new growth vectors to expand our TAM. Sales and marketing expenses were up 13% year-over-year. We continue to grow our upsell and international sales teams and make targeted investments in our U.S. new business team to drive deeper penetration. \n The Q1 restructuring actions impacted our R&D and G&A expense lines more than other parts of the business, resetting the expense growth trajectory in these areas. We expect R&D expenses will grow at a more moderate level as we continue to make targeted investments to drive product innovation and add value for our customers. G&A was down 13% year-over-year, excluding $15 million of bad debt and credit-related expenses, primarily related to reserves for Toast Capital. We expect ongoing operating leverage in G&A, reflecting our continued focus on driving efficiency in G&A as we scale, including through automation and global diversification of our workforce. \n Free cash flow was negative $33 million in the quarter due to the timing of cash bonus payments and severance payments in Q1. We expect free cash flow to be positive for the remainder of the year and broadly mirror adjusted EBITDA on a full year basis. \n Turning to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect total subscription and fintech gross profit to increase in the 20% to 24% range year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA to be $55 million to $65 million. Our top line growth rate is negatively impacted by a few points due to adding forward flow and comping a small onetime benefit last year. As a result of our strong start to the year, we raised our full year outlook. At the midpoint, we now expect 26% growth in fintech and subscription gross profit and $260 million in adjusted EBITDA, a margin of 19%, marking a 13 percentage point improvement versus 2023. \n After executing the restructuring, we now have visibility on higher in-year savings than expected and reset the guidance higher to reflect that. This also factors in our plans to reinvest in key areas of the business to drive sustained growth going forward. With our increased profit expectations for the year and progress on containing stock-based compensation, we are now on a path to be close to breakeven on GAAP operating income by the end of the year. \n To wrap up, we are making significant progress executing against our goals and are positioned to deliver strong top and bottom line results in 2024. Our top focus remains delivering value to customers, and we are well positioned to drive durable growth across our core business while building new growth curves. We announced our first Investor Day will be held on May 29, at which time you will hear more from our leadership team on our market opportunity, strategy, and growth plans. We are incredibly excited about what lies ahead for Toast and look forward to sharing with you more then. \n Now I'll turn the call back over to the operator. Thank you. Yes, sure. I can take that. So in terms of the Visa-Mastercard settlement, it's really early and not final. Our early signal is it's most likely going to impact us in the second half of 2025. That's the early read. And also, I would also comment that it won't impact our entire volume of GPV, just at the highest level. So just keep that in mind as you guys update your models.\n But in the context of pricing, I think your question on take rate, as we've said, we're going to take pricing over time, it's going to be an ongoing cadence of small steady changes in price. No step function change in pricing this year. We're going to start with fintech in the second half of the year. And just keep in mind, it won't have a meaningful impact in 2024. But over time, you should see us execute against a steady cadence of price adjustments, in particular, in places where customers are out of market. Yes, so a couple of things. One, recurring -- let me just start giving context for the full year and Q2, there's some dynamics at play. But yes, if you look at the full year, our full year guidance at 26% at the midpoint would imply that, obviously, our GP grows over time. Q2, there's a few dynamics at play. One is the implementation of forward flow, which we talked about, and we're comping this onetime benefit to SaaS revenue in Q2. So those are contributing to a lower recurring gross profit in Q2. Then we talked about targeted fintech pricing towards the back half of the year. And that will be slight and gradual. Yes. So I think -- so you're right, Josh. What happened in Q1, recall, January was a lighter -- we had a weather pattern that impacted January. As the quarter progressed, we saw GPV get back to sort of sustained levels or seasonal levels. So overall GPV was down, on a per location, down 2% in Q1. As we enter into the first part of Q2, down low single digits as we enter into the quarter. So that's what I would say.\n And then back to the question on the guidance on GPV, just keep in mind, GPV towards the back half of the year, that started to decrease in the back half of last year on a per location. So when you look towards the back half of the year, you'll see the GPV compares improve. Sure, great question. So I'll provide context on our long-term financial profile at Analyst Day. But just sort of pivoting back to 2024, our guidance shows significant progress on margin. And you've seen us deliver that efficiency and scale over the course of the last several quarters. So we're going to continue with that discipline. And you heard Aman talk about his strategic priorities as he's laid out. We're positioning the company really to drive ongoing operating leverage while we're balancing that with growth and innovation. So I don't have an update today but we'll update you at Analyst Day.\n And you had a question on GAAP, actually, that's a really good point. You had a question on GAAP. Overall, just keep in mind, we've been very focused on stock-based comp as well as you've heard us talk about that. So that's really what's driving our confidence in the updated guidance on GAAP on this call. Yes. Now we can. Yes, and I would just add that as we extend the different parts of the TAM, any mix shift will be very gradual over a long period of time. Yes. We haven't commented on that specifically so nothing new to report on that today. Yes. No, absolutely, Stephen. As Aman said, we had a strong start to Q1, and we're seeing a lot of great momentum from the sales team on the ground. Q2 is typically seasonally stronger and we don't see any reason why that will be different. Seen really good demand and the funnel is strong, so overall, we have no reason -- we still believe that we'll add more locations in 2024 than we did in 2023. Yes. So thanks, Tim, for the question. We've continued to add to the team, of course, since the IPO as you've seen as our locations grown. But keep in mind, this dynamic around flywheels allows us to grow ARR without adding reps. So we're gaining that efficiency and productivity from our sales reps all the while, to the point you made, growing our upsell team, investing behind international and enterprise.\n So while I can't give specificity at the highest level, we feel like we're really balanced across both our new business team, our upsell team, and now these early investments in international. So overall, we're managing the payback periods as we always do, and that's how we're thinking about surgically adding to our sales force over time. Yes, it's early, Tim, so the impact in 2024 won't be as meaningful as I would give you that context for the balance of the year. Yes. And in terms of Q2, it's seasonally higher, Jason, but nothing specific. But our momentum is strong. Yes. At the highest level forward flow, the model is such that we don't take credit risk so the margin profile is healthy. And just kind of zooming out when you think about the capital program, we're really trying to optimize or maximize our risk-adjusted returns. So as we scale, we're going to build more partners, and in this case, workflow offers us a really healthy margin profile and still allows us to scale the business as well. So hopefully, that answers your question. In 1Q, did I say -- I don't think we've given the quarterly guidance, to be honest. But I will tell you, because of the fact that we had -- I talked about on the script some onetime benefits. We had a little bit higher savings than we anticipated, roughly around $10 million of incremental savings from the $100 million. And just keep in mind, 1/3 of it is related to stock-based comp. Yes, Sheriq, I'll take that. So in the near term, we've said mid-single digits on an ARR basis, and that's still -- we feel confident in delivering on that in the near term. Zooming out, when you think about our opportunity long term, there's really a few things we think about. One is growing our attach, right? And that's through optimizing the breadth of products we have and working on product market fit, our upsell team, pricing and packaging.\n And then there's innovation that's -- we're continuing to invest in our R&D team to drive future innovation. And then, of course, as we've talked about, we will implement an ongoing cadence of small steady pricing changes, over time, both on the SaaS side but also even on the fintech side, even though I know you're asking about SaaS ARPU. So we have an opportunity over time to grow our ARPU. But in the near term, mid-single digits is the right proxy on an ARR basis."
